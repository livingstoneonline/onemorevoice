						<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>William Ivens Craft arrived into a foreign world when he joined his family in the United States. The Crafts aimed to develop a farming school that encouraged cooperation among newly freedpeople and also disrupted the white-controlled labor systems sweeping the former slave states. The Craft’s efforts, however, met with white supremacist violent backlash, as William Ivens navigated the new, complex, and racist American society.</p>

						<h3 id="cooperation">Dreams of Cooperation</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>Amidst the family’s transition from England to homesteading back in the U.S., Ellen gave birth to a son they named Alfred George, who may have been born before the family left or once they returned to the United States–or, there is a small chance Ellen gave birth at sea. After a brief stay with some friends in Boston, the family traveled south in April of 1870 to Savannah (Sterling 1988, 49, 51; Anonymous 1878g). The Civil War had brought the end of slavery, but not the end of the struggle for freedom, life, and rights for Black Americans.</p>

						<p>The confusion and speculation over the birth of Alfred Craft stems from the fact that William and Ellen, uncharacteristically, did not register the birth of their son. As a result, the exact date of Alfred’s birth is another question the descendants still actively research. Martin Copeland, great-grandson of William Ivens, mentions that he has two sources that give 1869 as Alfred’s birth year. Chris Clark, another great-grandson of William Ivens, says, it could have been in England, at sea, or the U.S., but, “[o]ur clique knows it was in the U[S],” they just “don’t yet have the documents” (Copeland 2023b; Clark 2023b). The Historian Dorothy Sterling asserts that Alfred was born in England, before the Crafts’ return to the U.S. (1988, 49). It is the absence of these seemingly mundane records – such as a missing birth registry – that make the Craft history and genealogy a living and changing story. Alfred later attended the oldest HBCU in the Southern US, Atlanta University.</p>

						<p>In Georgia, the Crafts helped fund and manage Hickory Hill, a plantation leased by William Thompson “on the Charleston road” in South Carolina, just across the border from Savannah (Anonymous 1878b). Their dream was a farming school that encouraged cooperation among newly freed people and disrupted the coercive, and white-controlled, contract labor system. During the farm’s first year, “a very good crop was raised,” William later reported, and Ellen “taught five or six children and seven or eight adults. There were three families on the place.”</p>

						<h3 id="burning">The Burning of Hickory Hill</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>After only one year of farming, however, Hickory Hill – a farm co-operated and leased by two Black men in Reconstruction-era Georgia – erupted into flames one flight. William Ivens later reported that “the kuklux [sic] burned the buildings at Hickory Hill.” Ellen remembered the terrifying night. She hurried the children out of the burning building, wearing only their night clothes. She managed to save some of their money from the conflagration (Anonymous 1878b; Anonymous 1878c).</p>

						<p>With hardened resolve, William and Ellen next established Woodville Co-Operative Farm School in their home state of Georgia (Sterling 1988, 52). The Crafts also started a free school on the property, which was at the time the only school in Bryan County – a seaboard county consisting of large rice and cotton plantations, and one that had a majority-Black population (Blackett 1983, 61; Blackett 1986, 125).</p>

						<h3 id="washington">William Ivens Craft Goes to Washington</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>Despite listing their intended destination as Savannah upon their arrival in 1873, William Ivens and Brougham did not make it there that year or even the next. The brothers, who both likely spoke with a British lilt, spent the rest of 1873 and beginning of 1874 in the nation’s capital. Wendell Phillips later remembered that in early 1874 he encountered William Ivens, “who, I had supposed was assisting his father in Georgia.” Phillips claimed that William Ivens “was idling away his time. [...] I was told while in Washington that young Crafts was doing nothing and living on his friends” (Anonymous 1878f).</p>

						<p>In contrast to Phillips’ calumny, however, William Ivens was gainfully employed as a messenger for the US government by the end of March 1874. He lived at 1416 I Street NW with his brother, Brougham, who continued his schooling and attended Howard University during their stay in the city (Anonymous 1878d; Davis 2021). 1416 I Street NW was somewhat of a hub for the burgeoning Black political elite in the early 1870s, and especially during the year that Wiliam Ivens and Brougham spent there. In 1871 the building was listed as a boarding house run by a man named John Browne (“Boyd’s Directory” 1871, 43). It was the place of residence of Josiah T. Walls, the first African American elected to Congress from Florida (and the last, until 1992). Walls served in the House of Representatives from 1871 to 1876.</p>
							
						<p>In 1874, the city directory also listed this address as the abode of <a aria-label="External Link" href="https://coloredconventions.org/black-illinois-organizing/delegates/richard-cain/">Richard H. Cain</a>, African American minister, activist, and US Representative from South Carolina. Mississippi Representative John R. Lynch, Ohio-born William H. J. Malvin, who went on to attend Howard University Dental College, and printer John A Pierre, who later worked for the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing also boarded at 1416 I Street during William Ivens’ stay (“Boyd’s Directory” 1874, 15; “Howard University” 1900, 273; “Boyd’s Directory” 1875, 353, 411; “US Treasury Register” 1879, 15).</p>
						
						<p>Also at 1416 I Street lived another US Representative from South Carolina, <a aria-label="External Link" href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/12753">Robert B. Elliott</a>. Like William Ivens, pieces of Elliott’s biography are shrouded – due to a lack of extant paper documentation. Elliott was likely born in Boston in 1842 to parents who had moved there from the West Indies (although, some sources claim Elliott’s birthplace was England, near Liverpool, which would in fact make his story even more closely resemble that of the Craft children). He received his schooling at High Holborn Academy and went on to study law at Eton College, graduating in 1859 (Lamson 1973, 23).</p>
							
						<p>It is unclear where Elliott was and what he did throughout the turbulent years of the US Civil War, but by 1867 he had traveled to South Carolina, where he was admitted to the bar, published a paper with Richard H. Cain, and was elected to Congress several years later (Lamson 1973, 21,23; Russell 1984, 44). And, in 1874, while living under the same roof as William Ivens and Brougham, Elliott rose to national fame for a speech he gave on the House Floor in support of legislation that would secure federal civil rights for Black Americans – a direct rebuttal to a speech made only a day earlier by former Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens. With a journey that paralleled the Craft childrens’ in many ways, it is unsurprising but nonetheless exciting to see Elliott and William Ivens – ten years apart in age – rooming together in Washington, DC, in 1874.</p>
							
						<p>In Washington, the Craft brothers lived and no doubt socialized with some of the most prominent members of the new elite Black political class, who likely influenced the young men and sharpened their ambition for political and economic success. In his time as a government employee, William Ivens managed to save some money and opened two accounts at the Washington, D.C., branch of the newly established Freedmen’s Savings Bank (“Freedman’s Bank Records” 1874a, 1874b; “Boyd’s Directory” 1874, 148).</p>

						<p>Yet whatever money the brothers might have saved was quickly lost to white greed and recklessness. The Freedmen’s Savings Bank, ostensibly secured by congressional oversight, failed late in 1874 due to unrestrained railroad speculation perpetrated by its white trustees (Baradaran 2017, 25-31). By late 1873 or 1874, Brougham decided to join his family down in Georgia--though he still appeared at 1416 I Street NW in the 1874 Washington, DC, directory (while William Ivens did not) (Blackett 1986, 127; “Boyd’s Directory” 1874, 148). It is here that William Ivens’ path would, possibly for the first time, diverge from that of his younger brother.</p>

						<p><strong>Lead image commentary:</strong> This photograph shows a large group of men and women, presumably students, standing on the lawn in front of Howard University in Washington, D. C. This photo captured the school as it looked in the late nineteenth century, as it might have when Brougham Craft, William Ivens’ brother, attended for a stint in the 1870s while the two lived in Washington, D. C. It is possible, though we have no record of it, that William Ivens also went to school at Howard while in that city, surrounded by the flourishing Black intellectual and political culture.</p><!-- Change -->
