</p>
<p class="p ">Foremost in importance among the events of the past
month, we have to notice the expedition of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">General <span class="word">Cathcart</span></span>
into the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">country of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Basuta</span> chief <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span></span>, and
the sanguinary battle of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Berea</span>; followed by the submission
of that chief and the prompt return of the troops into the
colony.
</p>
<p class="p ">Having issued the proclamation which appeared in our
last summary—declaring that his object was, "not to make
war, but to settle all disputes, and to establish the blessings
of peace," and commanding "all chiefs and men of all
classes and tribes" to remain quiet and abide by his <span class="word">judgment</span>
and decision—<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">General Cathcart</span> proceeded across the
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Orange River</span> into the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Sovereignty</span>, and on the
<time>1st of <span class="word">December</span></time>
encamped at <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Commissie Drift</span>, on the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Caledon River</span>,
where he was joined by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Colonel Eyre</span>, <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">73d Regiment</span>, and
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Colonel Duff</span>, <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">74th</span>, with their respective columns; the
whole force, including the column under his Excellenecy's
immediate command, amounting to about 2,500 men of all
arms. Here, in reply to an address presented to him by the
inhabitants of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Caledon</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">General Cathcart</span> announced that
he had summoned the chiefs <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Molitsani</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sikonyella</span>,
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moroko</span>, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Gert Taaybosch</span> to meet him at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span> on
the
<time>13th</time>, and that each of those chiefs would be compelled
to pay the amount of cattle which the Commissioners, after
due investigation, should think fit to award. On the
<time>8th</time>
the camp moved forward towards <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span>, and was joined
by a <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: detachment">dctachment</u> of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">45th Regiment</span>, under <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lieutenant
Howard</span>, with some fieldpieces; while 40 burghers, of a
neighbouring field-cornetcy, turned out to protect the
border, in the rear of the Governor's operations. <span class="word">Unfortunately</span>,
during the first day's march, his Excellency
lost the valuable aid of his military secretary, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Colonel <span class="word">Seymour</span></span>,
who was thrown violently from his horse, by which
his left shoulder was fractured, and he had consequently to
be conveyed in a cart to the neighbouring village of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="word">Smithfield</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">On the morning of the
<time>13th</time> his Excellency arrived at
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span>, which he found deserted by the natives. In the
evening two young chiefs, sons of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>, came to the
camp, but <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">General Cathcart</span> refused to see them, and next
morning they returned to their father's "great place,"
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thaba Bossigo</span>, accompanied by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Commissioner Owen</span>
who was the bearer of the following message:—
</p>
<p class="p right ">"<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span>,
<time>Dec. 13, 1852</time>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief Moshesh</span>,—When I was sent by the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span> to be
Governor, and to command her army in this part of the
world, six months past, I wrote to acquaint you and the
other chiefs, and I told you that I would visit you as soon
as the rebellion of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Gaikas</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Tambookies</span> and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="word">Hottentots</span></span>
was ended. This has been done, as you have no
doubt learnt, and I now visit this country as I promised,
and desire to see you and the other chiefs, as my friends, at
my camp at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span>, without delay.
</p>
<p class="p noindent ">"My proclamation will have told you the righteous cause
in which I am come and what it is my duty to do.
</p>
<p class="p ">"As I told you in my letter, I now hope my visit to you
may be in peace; but I must do justice, whether it be by
war or in peace. I had been told that you are a great chief
and a good man, but I find that though you were a man of
good words you have not done what you promised.
</p>
<p class="p ">"I find, not only that you have not paid the fine of cattle
imposed on you by the Assistant Commissioners, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Major
Hogge</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Owen</span>, and which you promised to pay for
the robberies of cattle and horses committed by your people
and with your knowledge, up to the time of your agreement
with them; but since then you and the people over whom
you rule, including <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Molitsani</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Morosi</span> and your own son
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Letsea</span>, with their people, and certain robbers called <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jan</span>
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Letell</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Bashuli</span>, have been stealing cattle from your
neighbours, and otherwise doing them harm. Even <span class="word">murders</span>
have been committed by them, and this village has been
plundered and destroyed. In short, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Basuta</span> people <span class="word">under</span>
your rule have become a nation of thieves.
</p>
<p class="p ">"This state of things must not be, and I have come to
put an end to it, and to restore peace between you and your
neighbours if I can, and if not, to put you and your people
out of the way of doing them wrong, and this I must do
promptly.
</p>
<p class="p ">"I will not therefore stop to talk, but tell you now once
for all, that having carefully inquired into the business, and
judging as justly and as mercifully as I can what is the
amount of cattle and damage you should be required to <span class="word">restore</span>,
I demand of you 10,000 head of cattle and 1,000 horses
to be delivered over to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">British</span> resident at this place,
within three days' time, in order to be restored to those from
whom they have been stolen.
</p>
<p class="p ">"If this be not done, I must go and take either cattle or
other things from you and your people, and from <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Molitsani</span>
and his people, and if resistance be made it will then be
war between us, and I must then take three times the
amount of cattle, as well as kill many of your people and
destroy their dwellings and kraals, which I should be very
sorry to be obliged to do. But if this cattle be paid within
three days, and that I am assured peace is restored, I will
take the army back again in peace.
</p>
<p class="p ">"Now, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief</span>, if you are an honest man, it is for you to
pay the just fine, which is not more than the cattle stolen,
and save yourself and your people from ruin, or else <span class="word">prepare</span>
for war, for on the fourth day I must bring you to <span class="word">account</span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">"You must also pay back to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sikonyella</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moroka</span> what
you have stolen from them, and be at peace with them.
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Carolus Batjee</span> and his people must return to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span>, and
the boundaries fixed by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor Sir Harry Smith</span> must be
respected.
</p>
<p class="p ">"When all this is done, you must remain at peace with
all your neighbours, and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Basutas</span> must cease to be a
nation of thieves, for if I come again it will not be to talk,
but to make an end of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Basuta</span> nation, as has been done
of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Gaikas</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Tambookie</span> tribe of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Mapassa</span>.
</p>
<p class="p right ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person."><span class="seg caps ">G. Cathcart</span></span>."<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p ">Next day <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> himself made his appearance, and an
interview took place between him and the General, highly
characteristic on both sides. The "talk" is thus reported in
an official notice afterwards published:—
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—I am glad to see you and to make your <span class="word">acquaintance</span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I am glad to see the governor, as since his
arrival in the country I have been expecting a visit from
him, which his letter in October last led me to expect.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—I told you in that letter that I hoped to
meet you in peace, and I still hope so, as I look to you as
the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Great Chief</span> in this part.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I hope so, too; for peace is like the rain that
makes the grass grow, while war is like the wind which
dries it up. You are right in looking to me; that is in <span class="word">accordance</span>
with the treaties.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—I will not now talk much, but wish to know
whether you received my message yesterday, in which I
made the demand of cattle and horses? I have nothing to
alter in that letter.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Do you mean the letter I received from <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
Owen</span>?
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—Yes.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I received the letter, but do not know where
I shall get the cattle from. Am I to understand that the
10,000 head demanded are a fine imposed for the thefts <span class="word">committed</span>
by my people, in addition to the cattle stolen?
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—I demand but 10,000 head, though your
people have stolen many more, and I consider this a just
award. It must be paid in three days.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Do the three days count from yesterday, or
to-day?
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—To-day is the first of the three.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—The time is short, and the cattle many, will
you not allow me six days to collect them?
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—You had time given you when <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Major Hogge</span>
and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Owen</span> made the first demand, and then promised
to comply with it, but did not.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—But I was not quite idle. Do not the papers
in the commissioner's hands show that I collected cattle?
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—They do, but not half of the number <span class="word">demanded</span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—That is true, but I have not now control
enough over my people to induce them to comply with the
demand, however anxious I may be to do so.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—If you are not able to collect them, I must
go and do it, and if any resistance be made it will then be
war, and I shall not be satisfied with 10,000 head, but shall
take all I can.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Do not talk of war, for however anxious I
may be to avoid it, you know that a dog when beaten will
show his teeth.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—It will, therefore, be better that you should
give up the cattle than that I should go for them.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I wish for peace; but have the same
difficulty with my people that you have in the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">colony</span>—your
prisons are never empty, and I have thieves among
my people.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—I would, then, recommend you to catch the
thieves and bring them to me, and I will hang them.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I do not wish you to hang them, but to talk
to them, and give them advice. If you hang them they
cannot talk.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—If I hang them they cannot steal, and I
am not going to talk any more. I have said that if you
do not give up the cattle in three days, I must come and
take them.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>—I beg of you not to talk of war.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>.—I have no more to say; I must either leave
this in peace in three days, or go to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thaba Bossigo</span>. I
therefore advise you to go and collect the cattle as quickly
as possible.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Do not talk of coming to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thaba Bossigo</span>; if
you do I shall lay the blame on the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</u></span> from whom the
cattle were stolen, and whom I requested to come and
point out to me their cattle that I might restore them.
I will go at once and do my best, and, perhaps, God will
help me.
</p>
<p class="p ">"After leaving his Excellency's tent, but before <span class="word">returning</span>
home, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> sent to request that the day on which
the interview took place might not count in the three.
This request his Excellency acceded to."
</p>
<p class="p ">After the action in which <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> was defeated, as <span class="word">described</span>
in our yesterday's impression, a messenger arrived
in camp, bearing a flag of truce, and the following letter to
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">General Cathcart</span>:—
</p>
<p class="p right ">"<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thaba Bossigo</span>, Midnight,

<p class="p ">"Your Excellency,—This day you have fought against
my people and taken much cattle. As the object for which
you have come is to have a compensation for <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</u></span>, I beg
you will be satisfied with what you have taken. I entreat
peace from you—you have shown your power—you have
chastised—let it be enough, I pray you; and let me be no
<br><span class="seg right ">[longer</span>
<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
longer considered an enemy of the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span>. I will try all I
can to keep my people in order in the future.
</p>
<p class="p right ">"Your humble servant,<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p right ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person."><span class="seg caps ">Moshesh</span></span>."<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p ">To which his Excellency returned the following reply:—</p>
<p class="p right ">"<span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Camp</span>, <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Caledon River</span>,
<time>Dec. 21, 1852</time>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief Moshesh</span>,—I have received your letter. The
words are those of a great chief, and of one who has the
interests of his people at heart. But I care little for words.
I judge of men by their actions. I told you that if you did
not pay the fine I must go and take it. I am a man who
never breaks his word, otherwise the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span> would not have
sent me here. I have taken the fine by force, and I am
satisfied.
</p>
<p class="p ">"I am not angry with your people for fighting in defence
of their property; for those who fought—and fought well—were
not all of them thieves, and I am sorry that many were
killed. This is your fault; for if you had paid the fine it
would not have happened. I now desire not to consider
you, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief</span>, as an enemy <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: to">ot</u> the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span>, but I must proclaim
martial law in the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Sovereignty</span>, to give to Commandants
and Field-Cornets power to make commandos in a regular
manner, and, with the consent of the Resident, enter your
country in search of plundered horses and cattle that may
be stolen after this time. And I expect you to assist them;
for though you are a great chief, it seems that you either do
not, or cannot, keep your own people from stealing; and
among the cattle you sent as part of your fine there were
three oxen, the property of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Hain</span>, of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bloemfontein</span>,
stolen since I crossed the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Caledon river</span>. Now, therefore,
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief Moshesh</span>, I consider your past obligations fulfilled, and
hope that you will take measures for preventing such abuses
in future.
</p>
<p class="p ">"In the meantime, as the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span>'s representative, I <span class="word">subscribe</span>
myself, your friend,
</p>
<p class="p right ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person."><span class="seg caps ">George Cathcart</span></span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p ">"P.S.—<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief</span>, I shall be glad to see either yourself or
your sons, in the same friendly manner and in the same
good faith as before the fight, at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span>, to-morrow or
next day; but I shall now send away the army, and go back
to the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">colony</span> in a few days' time."
