The First Native Clergyman in India.
[...]
[...] He joined in singing a hymn
which he himself had composed, and soon afterwards gently
breathed his last. We give a literal translation of this hymn:— 
"Beloved Saviour! let not me
In Thy kind heart forgotten be!
Of all that deck the field or bower,
Thou are the sweetest, fairest flower.
"Youth's morn has fled, old age come on;
But sin distracts my soul alone;
Beloved Saviour! let not me
In Thy kind heart forgotten be."
