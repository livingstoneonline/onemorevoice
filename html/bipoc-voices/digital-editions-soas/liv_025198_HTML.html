  <h5 style="text-align:center"><em>Letter from Rev. Boyce Mama, Etamara, to Rev. W. Impey, Heald
      Town, June</em> 21<em>st</em>, 1872. </h5>
  <p> I WANT to let you know about the work of God here at Tamara. Since you sent me here I have
    never wrote to you about the work.</p>
  <p>The word you sent through the Superintendent of the Annshaw Circuit to my Superintendent at
    Mount Coke about W. Shaw Kama to take Tamara, and for me to take Pewuleni, has reached me. I am
    sorry, because I have not been here long enough. I should like to have stayed here a little
    longer. I have been sowing the seed, waiting to see the fruits. I have great hope that the seed
    which has been sown here shall grow. But still I don't refuse to leave this place, although I
    should like to stay longer. I am quite willing to go to Peuleni, as I believe that it is the
    will ofGod. I have promised God that I shall go any where He sends me. I am no more to do what
    pleases me, but to do God's will.</p>
  <p> When I first came here the number of members was less than it is now. There were sixteen
    members at Tamara, and forty-seven on trial: now there are forty-eight members and forty-seven
    on trial. At Equgqwala there were ten members, and now there are thirty-six. There were five
    classes, and now there are thirteen classes. Total, eighty-four members, and good many on trial.
    There was no school at Tamara, now there is one. There was no school at Equgqwala, and now there
    is a school. There were no chapels; and even now there are none, only that I am busy preparing
    to have a nice chapel here at Etamara; poles, wattles, &amp;c., are ready. My intention was,
    that as soon as I have Tamara chapel, one must be erected at Equgqwala.</p>
