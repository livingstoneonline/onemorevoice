Gleanings from Recent Letters.
[...]
A Hindu Clergyman and his Heathen Father.
We find the following brief but touching entry in a recent journal of the Rev. G. Krishnayya,
the able and earnest Native minister at Ellore, in Telugu country. It is a call for special
prayer in behalf of one of those whose conversion must lie very near to his heart:&#8212;
Friday, 25th Sept., 1874.&#8212;Visited my parents
to-day at their house,
and spent this evening in trying to persuade my old father to accept
salvation through Jesus Christ.
