  <h5 style="text-align: center;">CONFESSIONS OF AN IDOLATER.</h5>
  <p><em>June 21, 1853</em>&#8212;An idolater called this morning at my house at Igbein
    before 8 <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>., and inquired after me. After he had found me, he
    told me
    that he came for peace, and not for war, and that he was sent to me by his
    Obatala (a god composed of white beads, cowries, &amp;c.). As I perceived
    that he wanted medicine, I sent him up to Ake to wait for me. After
    my arrival at Ake I inquired into the reason that his Obatala had sent
    him to me; "for it is a marvellous thing," said I, "to hear that Obatala
    sends his worshipper to one connected with the true God." He replied,
    "I do not know how or why it is thus, but so it is; and let this not prevent
    you from hearing me, for I had long thought of Obatala's conduct
    towards me, which has been altogether strange, and before he had consented
    to send me to you I had almost given him up." He proceeded:
    "I am an Obatala worshipper, as you see by my white dress. I have
    been his servant from childhood, and he promised me health, wealth,
    and a good number of wives and children. I do not believe any one
    has been so faithful to him as I have been: I have sacrificed goats,
    sheep, and pigeons without number to Obatala, and I was glad when
    every thing was going on well with me. I was and am still a farmer: I
    got a good deal from my farm, and afterwards I was able to support a
    wife and a child. I then increased my sacrifices: I had an Ifa priest
    to divine for me; but after some time my wife died. I inquired at the
    hands of Obatala the reason, and he attributed it to the insufficiency of
    sacrifices. I redoubled my sacrifices. After a year or less my child also
    died, my only daughter"&#8212;here he spoke with much feeling. "I again
    inquired, and Obatala's answer was as formerly. I again redoubled my
    sacrifices. Not long after I fell sick of rheumatism. I would not ask
    any more of Obatala, as I could not spare money then to make sacrifices,
    but intended to keep the little I had in hand for the doctors who would
    cure me. I called in an Ifa priest to divine, and he told me that he
    would undertake my cure&#8212;with a good remuneration, of course: but this
    I cared not for; I wanted to get well again. However, after one year's trial
    without any good effect, for I became worse instead of better, I called
    the priest, and asked him the reason why I did not get better. He told me
    that Obatala wanted sacrifices, but did not wish me to use any medicine
    for my cure. It was then that I thought of the unreasonableness of
    Obatala's answer; for how could I have expected to get well without
    means? I then told Obatala that I wanted to make a trial of another
    doctor, for I had already been told of you. Obatala at first would not
    consent to my going to the Oibos [Wite Men], lest I would believe theirs"&#8212;that is,
    embrace their religion. "However, I did not give Obatala rest, for I
    inquired over and over for a recommendation, until I got him to agree
    to my coming to you; and here I am now without any more property
    than what you see on my body. Tell me all about your religion, and
    what I should do; and upon my own words I am bound to believe and
    do it: but I also want your assistance with respect to my complaint."</p>
  <p>I explained to him accordingly the principles of the Christian religion,
    and pointed him to Jesus Christ, who, I told him, was evidently drawing
    him, by the lovely cords of His Holy Spirit, to Himself. I called a
    communicant of the Ake church, who entered the room at the end of
    our conversation, to explain the love of Jesus to him, and the folly of
    idolatry, and thereby to confirm all that I had told him. The woman
    spoke, from the true feeling of her heart, the truths of the Christian
    religion, and the folly, as well as the destroying tendency, of the Obatala
    worship, as also the cruelty and deceitfulness of the babbalawos; for she
    herself, she added, had been an Obatala worshiper, but now she was
    thankful that she was a member of Christ's church. After our long conversation
    I administered medicine to this sick man, and he went away full
    of gratitude and joy. Before he left, he desired me to tell him whether it
    would be lawful for him to attend the church under the state of sickness
    in which he was, and whether he should at once throw away his Obatala.
    I told him that the church is a place where all the sick, both of body and
    soul, are to lay their complaints before Jesus, the true and good physician;
    and that he would find many like himself there. I also advised
    him not to act immediately from the impulse of the moment, by throwing
    away his Obatala, but to attend always God's house of prayer and hear
    His word, and compare His worship with that of Obatala, and then
    make his choice.</p>
  <p>Since then, this individual has been regularly attending our church.</p>
