THE FALSE AND THE TRUE VASANTA RAYAR.
A Narrative of Religious Excitement in Southern India
Ten Years Ago.
BY THE REV. DR.
SARGENT.
[...]
(Proclamation of Vasanta Rayar.)
Then follows the narrative, describing the address of Devenderan,
with Vishnu's reply, in which he promises to appear on
earth as "Vasanta Rayar." He is accordingly born on the tenth
day of the tenth month in the year 1850, in Gowdama, on the
Godaveri, north-east of Cashmere. In due course he is instructed
by the holy sages of Mount Meru, and their utterances
regarding him are recorded as oracles. Various kinds of deaths
and ailments befalling the opponents are mentioned as precursors
of the great event of Vasanta Rayar's reign. Thus:—
"By the treachery of friends and assaults of open
foes some will fall.
By atrocities of various kinds will the goddess Kali destroy some. By the
volcanic action of Mount Keilasam some will die. The idols in the Siva
and Vishnu temples will rise up and dance, and this sight will kill some.
Infants and old men will fall from mountain tops and die. Foxes,
kites, and owls will howl and screech day and night unceasingly.
Four stars will appear in the sky in open day, and a fearful sound be
heard in the heavens. Creatures that live in water will cry out, 'We have
got on land, we have got on land,' and making straight for Mount Keilasam,
and entering Veera Malaram Temple, will stay there eight days, and
then vanish. In the Temple of Kumara Sami, the door will be shut seven
days, and in consequence a furious wind will blow, and destroy many
people. Demons, tigers, and wild beasts will injure multitudes, and blood
suffuse all eyes. At time of new moon, full moon will rise. At dead of
night the sun will rise. Blood will fall as rain. The goddess of fortune
will weep. The ocean and rivers will rage. The goddess Terra will salute
and acknowledge Vasanta Rayar as supreme lord. Then charities and
virtues will flourish as of old. People of every caste will rejoice. Rain
will pour three times every month. Crops of grain will grow profusely.
Gifts and charities be everywhere abundant. Brahmins, Chattriyas, Visyas,
and Sudras will be prosperous, performing their respective duties."
Then follow promises to those who promote the matter:—
"Whoever believes what is herein mentioned, whoever
performs poojah
to this book, will have health, with long life, riches, possessions, and conveyances.
Whoever will not write, nor read, nor hear this book, but
ridicule and revile it, will be annihilated, worms will breed in their
mouth, and the furies will torment them."
"We, the emissaries in this matter, were seized and
brought before the
vile fellows who hold the present reins of government. They put powder
and shot in their guns and fired at us, when the two balls came and fell
into our hands."
"Therefore in the year Perabava (1867)* Vasanta Rayar
will come to
reign, and that you who are virtuous may know this matter, we have
written and sent this revelation to the several provinces. The virtuous
and those who meditate on Siva, even if weak in the eyes, if they copy
this book, and make poojah to it, will receive all that they wish for in
their prayers. All who write, or read, or hear and worship this book,
whatever be their present age, will be prosperous till he, Vasanta Rayar,
come. Pluto cannot approach nor afflict with his pangs any who laud this
book. The gods prosper you."
Observing the excitement created on all sides by these proclamations,
I determined to meet it, and take advantage of it, by
publishing a tract reviewing the documents, and setting forth
Jesus Christ as the true Vasanta Rayar. This tract of forty
pages became for the time exceedingly popular, not only in Tinnevelly,
but also in Travancore and Malabar, where a Malayalim
translation of it was read with great avidity. It served not only
to explode the current notions regarding the Hindu Messiah, but
it was made useful under God's blessing to the conversion of
several parties. One of the Basle missionaries wrote to me to
say that he knew four persons who had been converted to
Christianity by the perusal of this tract. It was styled:—
[...]
(Truth Victorious.)
"GLORIOUS NEWS OF THE TRUE VASANTA RAYAR."
Within three months after the publication of the tract, the
excitement regarding Vasanta Rayar ceased, and not long after
the matter was completely ignored.
(In our next we shall give some extracts from this interesting tract.)
* The Hindus reckon by cycles of sixty years, of which twenty are considered
fortunate, twenty indifferent, and twenty unfortunate. Perabava is the first of
the fortunate.
