  <h5 style="text-align:center;">DAY-SPRING IN THE FAR WEST.</h5>
  <h6 style="text-align:center;"> Sketches of Mission Work in British North America.</h6>
  <h6 style="text-align:center;">III.&#8212;E<small>XTENSION OF THE</small> M<small>ISSION</small>
    W<small>ESTWARD</small>.</h6>
  <p>In a letter dated August 19, 1871, Mr. Budd writes thus:&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">The growing population of Devon, and the endeavours
    of the people
    towards improvement in temporal as well as spiritual matters, give me
    full employment on the spot,
    and leave little room for
    visiting and seeing the Indians
    at other places. We
    see here new houses putting
    up every year, the soil
    ploughed up, the seed put
    in, parks and fences rising
    up here and there, until
    very little land is left for
    the cattle to graze upon.
    All this spring I was delighted
    to see them, each
    one trying to break up his
    own piece of land, and
    planting his potatoes in it,
    and now they have potatoes
    growing up nicely, and there
    is promise of a good harvest.
    The people have effectually
    put down the sale of any
    spirituous liquors among
    themselves, and now that
    the law has passed forbidding
    it, we trust we shall never
    see any more of that soul-destroying
    article of trade
    among our people.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">The Sunday services have
    been regularly attended by
    all the people when they are
    at home. It is seldom that
    all our people are at home
    together. Most of the strong
    and able go about hunting
    during winter, leaving their
    families sometimes, and at
    other times taking them
    with them. During the
    summer months the strong
    men are away tripping in
    the boats; but as the population
    is yearling increasing,
    we still have plenty at home
    who fill the church Sabbath
    by Sabbath. I am always
    particularly encouraged at
    the Sunday duties; for I feel
    that I am preaching to a
    people that understand me.
    The Sunday-school is not
    less encouraging. Here we
    have children and young
    people attending, many of
    them reading with fluency
    the Word of God in their
    own language. They manage
    to read it in their own language
    so much quicker than
    in English, and of course at
    once understand what they
    are reading about. This and
    the day-school I have to
    conduct myself, with the
    help of a young man whom
    I am training for a teacher.</p>
