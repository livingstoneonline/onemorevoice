<p class="p ">In February, 1872 I was at <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Sharaupur</span> School</span>
<br>near <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nasick</span>. I heard <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Price</span> talk of an expedition going
<br>to <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> to find out <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>. Livingstone</span>. I and many others were
<br>willing to go and join the expedition. Some time after the
<br><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Rev. W.S. Price</span> received a telegram. Whether it was from
<br><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">London</span> or <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bombay</span> I cannot tell; but this I know, that I,
<br><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jacob Wainwright</span>, and four others were chosen for the <span class="word">ex<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>pedition</span>. We were ordered immediately to leave <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nasick</span>
<br>for <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bombay</span>. At <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bombay</span> the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Rev. J.S.S. Robertson</span>, the <span class="word">Secre<span class="supplied" title="Text supplied because the original text is illegible, not visible, or missing.">[<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>]</span>
<br>tary</span>, got us all the necessary things for our journey from
<br><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bombay</span> to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. Having got ready, I and my fellow
<br>companions left <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bombay</span> per ship "Livinia," bound for
<br><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. The captain of the ship was very kind to us through
<br>out the voyage. We had pleasant wind which made our
<br>ship to glide rapidly over the mighty foaming ocean. But
<br>it did not continue so for many days. One day a heavy
<br>storm made our little ship to reel fearfully, so much
<br>so that we and other passengers on board had entirely
<br>despaired of our lives. But God in whose hands the powers
<br>of the sea are, was with us. The raging of the water soon
<br>ceased and our hearts began again to look on the blue
<br>sea with less fear. After sailing twenty-one days we
<br>landed at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. We anchored about half past 6 p.m.
<br>Next day very early in the morning the captain of our ship
<br>took me and my companions to the English Consul, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>. Kirk</span>.
<br>He was very kind to us and he got us a room where we
<br>lived in waiting for the remainder <ins class="add above ">of the expedition</ins>.
<br>We were only four days in the island when the remainder of the expedition
<br>consisting of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">young Livingstone</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Dawson</span> and others arrived
<br>from <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>. After their arrival everything was got ready.
<br><span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br>The <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Livingstone Search Expedition</span> then left the <span class="word">is<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>land</span> of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> for <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Buàgamoyo</span>. At <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Buàgamoyo</span> while
<br>we were ready for leaving the country for the interior, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
<br>H.M. Stanley</span> at once made his appearance at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="word">Buaga<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>moyo</span></span> from the interior, bringing the news of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>. L.</span> being
<br>found. We were all glad to hear that the good <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> was
<br>alive. We all then returned to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> again with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
<br>Stanley</span> leaving some of us behind to take care of some
<br>of the baggages that were left behind. At <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> the
<br><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Europeans</span> were all very glad to see <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr Stanley</span>, specially the
<br><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">young Livingstone</span>. About ten days were given to the men
<br>who came from the interior with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span> for <span class="word">refresh<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>ment</span>, after which time they were again asked to go and
<br>carry some stores for the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>. L.</span> sent by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span>. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Young
<br>Mr Livingstone</span> was willing to join this caravan in order
<br>to go and see his beloved father. But the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European friends</span>
<br>at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> would not permit him to go. He asked me
<br>and my companions whether we would prefer going to <span class="country" title="A country.">India</span>
<br>back or joining the party that was ready for going to carry
<br>some stores for his father. We all preferred going to see the
<br><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> in the heart of <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> which was one object in leaving
<br><span class="country" title="A country.">India</span>. The whole party consisted of 70 persons in all. We
<br>then left <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> for <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Buagamoyo</span> again. At <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Buàgamoyo</span>
<br>we did not stay long for we remained there only two days
<br>and then commenced our long journey to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Unyembe</span> in the interior.
<br>In about 2 months and a half we reached <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Uniembe</span>. Here we
<br>found the great missionary and enterprising traveller, living
<br>with savage <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Africans</span> and half barbarous <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arabs</span>. The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> was
<br>very pleased to see us a little band of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Christians</span>. Many and if
<br>not all of the nine boys who joined him at first in his long
<br>and adventurous travels had entirely deserted him. It was
<br>therefore natural for him to ask us whether we preferred
<br>going back to the coast or following him in his adventurous
<br><span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br>work. He was afraid we would prove ourselves the same
<br>as our brothers. He therefore gave us a day for consideration as
<br>to whether we would go and be faithful to him in all the trials
<br>and enormous difficulties and countless privations while journey
<br>ing about through countries unknown to finish his work assigned
<br>to him or make our way to the coast again. Some of us were willing
<br>to return to the coast a thing which would go very much against us
<br>had we left him. After a little consultation we all made up our
<br>minds to follow him. Ten days were then given us here at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="word">Uniem<span class="seg hyphen ">-
<br>be</span></span></span> for taking rest. When the ten days were expired we left the
<br><span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Uniembe</span> country</span> for <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Cawende</span>. In this country there is the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">lake
<br>Tanganyika</span>. We then commenced our journey by coasting the lake
<br>towards the north east till we reached the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">country of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="word">Nama<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>roongoo</span></span></span>. Leaving the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">country of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Namaroongoo</span></span> we entered
<br>the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">country of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Wapipa</span></span>. But before leaving the frontiers
<br>of the fierce race of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Namaroongoo</span> for <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Pipa</span></span>, the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> was
<br>asked to give something to the chiefs of the country as he was quitting
<br>their land. The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> instead of heeding to their everlasting demands
<br>ordered the men to take up their loads and move onwards
<br>without giving them anything: After marches and countermarches
<br>of many a long day we entered the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Wemba</span> country</span>. Here we
<br>with great difficulties arising from want of food. The natives
<br>had deserted their country owing to some petty wars and our
<br>whole expedition was thrown to the severest test as we lay for
<br>days without any means of sustenance. We fed upon wild fruit
<br>of the jungle. The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> then despatched ten men full armed to go
<br>finding if any trace of a road leading into countries or
<br>villages could be found while the whole of the expedition
<br>and the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> remained behind. The ten men travelled 3 days
<br>after which they found villages. The news of our arrival soon
<br>reached <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Kumbakumba</span> an enterprising <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> chief and one
<br>of the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span>'s friend, who hearing of his coming sent him some
<br><span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br>rice, goats, etc. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Kumbakumba</span> is an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab chief</span> and is a terror
<br>of that part of the country. After remaining a few days at <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Wemba</span>
<br>we left it for the island where the king <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Matipa</span> lives in the midst
<br>of the large sheet of water called <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Bemba</span>. We found the king
<br>in the middle of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Bemba Lake</span>. We reached him by going in
<br>small native canoes. The Lake has many islands in it and it
<br>took us two <ins class="add above ">days</ins> to row to go to the island where the king resides. We
<br>were detained for a long time by the king in this island as he was
<br>not willing to give us canoes. At last the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> ordered all his
<br>men to arm themselves and to follow him to the king's hut to
<br>demand boats. After telling the king the folly of his keeping us
<br>longer against our will we demanded to leave the place soon <span class="word">any<span class="supplied" title="Text supplied because the original text is illegible, not visible, or missing.">[<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>]</span>
<br>how</span> contrary to his will. The king seeing that the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> was determined
<br>to leave he immediately procured him many boats which soon
<br>transported the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span>, his men, and their baggages on the other side
<br>of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bisa</span> country</span>. It took us 3 days to cross the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Bemba
<br>lake</span> to get to other side of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bisa</span> country</span>. When we got to the other
<br>side of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bisa</span></span>, the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> divided his men into two divisions.
<br>One division went with the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> coasting one of the rivers called
<br><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Chambesi</span> which falls into the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Bemba Lake</span>. But he had
<br>soon to leave following <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Chambesi</span> and went coasting
<br>another river the name of which I do not now remember.
<br>The second division went on by land following the same
<br>direction from where the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Chambesi</span> flowed. We travelled
<br>three days without meeting the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span>'s party. We then halted
<br>three days near a river which the natives of the country would
<br>not allow us to cross it owing to the war that was going on
<br>in that part of the country. The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> while coasting the river
<br>in canoes took sickness. He then sent some of his men
<br>to find out where the second division was, in order to get
<br>the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span>'s donkey from them for him to ride as he was ill
<br>with dysentery which sickness added to the inclement clime
<br>and the need of medical man did greatly weaken his <span class="word">con<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>stitution</span>. He then soon came and joined with the second
<br>division. The next day we all along with the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> crossed
<br><span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br>river where the natives detained the first division.
<br>The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> then began to grow worse and worse every day. He was
<br>no longer able to ride on his donkey, and yet, strange to say,
<br>he urged us all forward though we did not know where we
<br>were hastening to. But each and all of us plaining saw
<br>that our master was declining every day by the fatigue of the
<br>journey and by the sickness. When he could no longer ride or
<br>be able to sit on his donkey we then carried him on a cot.
<br>But time soon came when we could no longer also carry him
<br>about in the open heat of the sun of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span>. We <span class="word">there<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>fore</span> halted at a place called <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Kalonga Njofu</span> on the frontiers
<br>of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bisa</span> country</span> where we remained five days. Leaving
<br>this place we crossed a river which divides the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bisa</span> country</span>
<br>and <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Illala</span>. In <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Illala</span> we raised a booth for the sick
<br><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> His sickness increased every day which thing greatly alarmed
<br>us. We six <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nassick</span> felt more fear as we were the only xtians
<br>while the majority were <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Mohammedans</span>. We thought if our
<br>master die in this part of the world surely none of us
<br>that are <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Christians</span> would survive to go and tell the story
<br>of our master's death. But our God overruled the whole
<br>affair as it pleased him. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majuàra</span> was his waiting
<br>boy in the booth. On the morning of the second day of our
<br>arrival at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Illala</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majuàra</span> who always slept near our
<br>sick master, was compelled by necessity to leave the booth
<br>for some minutes leaving the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> on the cot in side the
<br>booth. But on his return again he found the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> fallen
<br>on the ground already expired. This took place on the 4<span class="sup ">th</span> May
<br>1873. We were all as it may easily be seen then described
<br>very sorry for our master. The whole camp wept for him.
<br>We decided that our master's death should be kept a secret
<br>from the natives. But the king of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Illala</span> soon heard
<br>the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span>'s death on the second day. He was grieved for not
<br>having been informed by us at once of the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span>'s death.
<br>To show how much loved the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> was he summoned all
<br>the chiefs, men, and women of his country to come out
<br><span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br>with their drums and other materials of war to morn for
<br>the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span> after their custom. Accordingly his orders were obeyed.
<br>There was then the most devilish and fanatical morning
<br>dance in which men, women and children promiscuously
<br>mingled. The whole caravan knowing the great loss they
<br>had sustained fired incessantly their guns in honour of
<br>their master. The morning was kept up for two days. Three
<br>days after, the bereaved faithfuls of the great traveller
<br>held a council as to what should be done to the body of
<br>their deceased commander. After each giving his own
<br>private opinion it was unanimously carried out that
<br>the body of our master should not be left in the <span class="word">in<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>terior</span> of <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> but embalm it and carry it to the
<br>coast. Accordingly, I and another <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Swahili man</span> dissected
<br>the body and after removing all the abdominal parts
<br>filled it with salt and brandy and then exposed it to
<br>the sun fifteen days. We then began to think of return
<br>ing to the coast with our master's remains. There is a large
<br>tree at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Illala</span> and if travellers are ever to reach that
<br>part of <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> they will not fail to see the <span class="word">inscrip<span class="seg hyphen ">-</span>
<br>tions</span> made on it. The name of the famous traveller
<br>is there nicely cut on the tree and the date of his
<br>death. Thus far did I and my companions go with
<br><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>. L.</span> whom death refused us to bring him alive again.
<br>We then soon left <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Illala</span> and travelling westward
<br>after three days we came to the river <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Luapulla</span>
<br>which we crossed.</p>
<br><p class="p ">After crossing the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Luàpulla</span> we entered the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">country

<br>of the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D<span class="sup ">r</span>.</span>'s death, he sighed heavily for him and also
<br>appeared to be very sorry for him. We then left the

<br>with us to the coast. We were one month at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Uniembe</span>
<br>with the three gentlemen. On the day of our leaving
