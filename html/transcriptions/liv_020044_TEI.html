<p class="p ">Our tribute to the memory of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Cameron</span> would not be complete
if we failed to record the universal sympathy and sorrow called
forth by the tidings of his death.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On that Sabbath morning the sad
news reached the different congregations in the capital just as they
were assembling for worship, and preparing to partake of the
memorials of the Lord's death. How different was <span class="italic ">our</span> commemoration,
from <span class="italic ">his</span>, who was then "absent from the body," but "present
with the Lord !"<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With us, a deep gloom and sadness overspread all
ranks and classes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Everyone">Every one</u> seemed to be mourning the loss of a
father or of a dear and venerated friend.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Prime
Minister</span> attired themselves in mourning, and their grief was deep and
sincere.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A kind letter of sympathy was at once dispatched by them
to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Miss Cameron</span>, with the request that the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span> might be allowed to
show her regard for her departed friend by bearing all the expenses
of the funeral, and signifying her wish also to erect a suitable and
lasting monument over his grave.
</p>
<p class="p ">At the funeral, an immense concourse of people gathered together.
<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Protestant</span> missions in the capital were strongly represented,
and the aged <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M. Laborde</span>, the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">French</span> Consul</span>, also joined, by his presence
on the occasion, in paying the last tribute of respect to his friend.
</p>
<p class="p ">At the grave, one of the highest officers of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Court</span>, as representative
of the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span>, read in her name a proclamation, of which
the following is, as nearly as possible, a literal translation :—
</p>
<p class="p ">" Thus saith <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Ranavalonamanjaka</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen of <span class="country" title="A country.">Madagascar</span></span>, &amp;c.
<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Carry this my word to my subjects, and to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mary Cameron</span>, and to
the missionaries of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">London</span> Missionary Society</span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">" For, inasmuch as the decease of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Cameron</span> has befallen my
country and people, thus declares <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Ranavalonamanjaka</span>, <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen of
<span class="country" title="A country.">Madagascar</span></span></span>, that great indeed has been the good done by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="pb-title">0011</span>
<span class="fw " title=""><span class="seg center italic ">The Late <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. James Cameron</span> of <span class="country" title="A country.">Madagascar</span>.</span> <span class="seg right ">179</span></span>
Cameron</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He sought, and desired, and accomplished such things as
benefit my kingdom and people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And he sought whatever would
promote the Gospel of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jesus Christ</span> here in my kingdom and among
my people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And not only so, but from the very beginning, until now,
he has endeavoured to prosper this kingdom, for he was not a fickle
man, nor a man who ever opposed the interests of my kingdom, but
he did what was becoming and right.
</p>
<p class="p ">" Further, on account of the benefits conferred by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Cameron</span>,
says <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Ranavalonamanjaka</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen of <span class="country" title="A country.">Madagascar</span></span>, and inasmuch as a
subject of my friend <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen Victoria</span> has done good here among my
people, and has died here in my kingdom, we therefore send our
representative to show our respect at his funeral.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And although, in
the present state of things, no cattle are slaughtered and no cannon
are fired (to show him honour), nevertheless I account him as among
the benefactors of my kingdom.
</p>
<p class="p ">" And further, I proclaim to my subjects, and to his daughter, and
to his friends, that whatsoever amount may be expended at the
funeral of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Cameron</span>, be it done according as you desire ;<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for I
will defray all the expenses, for he has done good to my people and
my kingdom, and I do not forget :
</p>
<p class="p right ">" Saith<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p right ">" <span class="seg smallcaps "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Ranavalonamanjka</span></span>,<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p right ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen of <span class="country" title="A country.">Madagascar</span></span>."
</p>
<p class="p ">And so, at the conclusion of the service in English and in
Malagasy, we committed him to the tomb, where he sleeps by the
side of his fellow labourers in the vineyard who entered into rest
before him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The beautiful monument to their memory had been
but lately completed by him, and its shadow falls upon his grave.
<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His remains rest in the spot sacred to the memory of the labours
begun by him for the welfare of Madagascar nearly fifty years ago.
<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There he taught the 600 young men those useful arts and sciences
which have changed the social life of the people and increased their
comforts a hundredfold.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There he set up the first printing-press and
helped to strike off the first twenty-three verses of the First Malagasy
Bible.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There he joined in forming the first <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Christian</span> church and
helped to cheer and strengthen the early converts amid the dark
forebodings of the storm of persecution that was soon to burst in fatal
fury upon them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There on his return to <span class="country" title="A country.">Madagascar</span>, he was
welcomed by the acclaiming "voice of a great multitude" assembled
for prayer and praise to God.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There he aided in the erection of the
first memorial church, built to commemorate the faith and patience of
many who had been brought to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Christ</span> by his own instrumentality.
<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And as long as that building stands, or the faith of which it is a
visible symbol survives in the hearts of the people, the name of <span class="seg smallcaps ">James
Cameron</span> will be treasured unforgotten, as one of <span class="country" title="A country.">Madagascar</span>'s
earliest and greatest benefactors.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"The righteous shall be in
ever-lasting remembrance."<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Psalm cxii, 6.
