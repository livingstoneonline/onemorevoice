 F late years a great deal of interest has 
 ^5 been taken in the folklore of uncivilized 
 tribes by those who have made it their 
 business to study mankind. It has been 
 found that a knowledge of the tradition- 
 ary tales of a people is a key to their ideas 
 and a standard of their powers of thought. 
 These stories display their imaginative facul- 
 ties ; the)' are guides to the nature of the 
 rehVious belief, of the form of government, of 
 the marriage customs, in snort, of much that 
 relates to bc^h the inner and the outer life of 
 those by whom they are told. 
 
 These tales also show the relationship be 
 tween tribes and people of different countries

 and even of different languages. They are 
 evidences that the same ideas are common to 
 every branch of the human family at the same 
 stage of progress. On this account, it is now 
 generally recognised that in order to obtain 
 correct information concerning an uncivilized 
 race, a knowledge of their folklore is necessary. 
 Without this a survey is no more complete than, 
 for instance, a description of the English people 
 would be if no notice of English literature 
 were taken. 
 
 It is with a view of letting the people we 
 have chosen to call Kaffirs describe themselves 
 in their own words, that these stories have 
 been collected and printed. They form only 
 a small portion of the folklore that is extant 
 among them, but it is believed that they have 
 been so selected as to leave no distinguishing 
 feature unrepresented. 
 
 Though these traditionary tales are very 
 generally known, there are of course some per- 
 sons who can relate them much better than 
 others. The best narrators are almost in- 
 variably ancient dames, and the time chosen for 
 story telling is always the evening. This is

 perhaps not so much on account of the evening 
 being the most convenient time, as because such 
 tales as these have most effect when told to an 
 assemblage gathered round a fire circle, when 
 night has spread her mantle over the earth, 
 and when the belief in the supernatural is 
 stronger than it is by day. Hence it may 
 easily happen that persons may mix much with 
 Kaffirs without even suspecting that they have 
 in their possession a rich fund of legendary lore. 
 
 There is a peculiarity in many of these 
 stories which makes them capable of almost 
 indefinite expansion. They are so constructed 
 that parts of one can be made to fit into parts 
 of another, so as to form a new tal< .n this 
 respect they are like the blocks of woe in the 
 form of cubes with which European children 
 amuse themselves. Combined in one way they 
 present the picture of a lion, another combina- 
 tion shows a map of Europe, another still, a 
 view of St. Paul's, and so on. So with many 
 of these tales. They are made up of fragments 
 which are capable of a variety of combinations. 
 
 It will surprise no one to learn that these 
 tales are already undergoing great changes

 among a very large section of the natives on 
 the border. Tens of thousands of Kaffirs have 
 adopted the reHgion of the Europeans, and the 
 facility with which such changes can be made 
 as were alluded to in the last paragraph has 
 encouraged them to introduce ideas borrowed 
 from their teachers. Thus with them Satan — 
 of whom they had no conception before the 
 advent of Europeans — is now the prompter to 
 evil, and morals are drawn that never could 
 have entered their heads in days of old. Their 
 tales are thus a counterpart of the narrators, in 
 possessing an adaptability to growth and a 
 power of conformation to altered circumstances. 
 It is necessary to say a few words concerning 
 the care that has been taken to give absolutely 
 not a smgle sentence in any of these tales that 
 has not come from native sources. Most of 
 them have been obtained from at least ten 
 or twelve individuals residing in different parts 
 of the country, and they have all undergone 
 a thorough revision by a circle of natives. 
 They were not only told by natives, but were 
 copied down by natives. The notes only are 
 my own. I have directed the work of others,

 Most of the tales collected in this book have 
 already appeared in various South African 
 papers and magazines, some as far back as 
 1874. They were arranged for publication in 
 a volume which was to have been issued from 
 the press of the Lovedale Missionary Institu- 
 tion, and the first sheet was already printed, 
 when the disturbances of 1877 took place. I 
 was then called away to perform work of a 
 very different kind, and the publication was ne- 
 cessarily suspended. The book is now issued, 
 in the hope that it may be found useful, as 
 throwing light upon the mode of life of a 
 people who differ from ourselves in many 
 respects besides degree of civilization.

 KAFFIR FOLK. 
 
 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER REGARDING THE KAFFIRS. 
 
 N South Africa the word Kaffir is often 
 used in a general way to signify any 
 black native who is not the descendant 
 of an imported slave, but on the eastern 
 frontier of the Cape Colony the term is 
 usually restricted to a member of the Amaxosa 
 tribe. It is from individuals of this tribe that 
 the following stories have been collected. 
 
 Europeans have designated these people 
 Kaffirs ever since the discovery of the country, 
 though they themselves cannot even pronounce 
 che word, as the English sound of the letter r 
 is wanting in their language. R In Kaffir 
 words, as now written, represents the same 
 guttural sound as g- does in Dutch, or the 
 Scotch sound of c/i In loch ; thus Rarabe is

 pronounced Khah-khah-bay. They have no 
 word by which to signify the whole race, but 
 each tribe has its own title, which is usually the 
 name of its first great chief, with the plural 
 prefix Ama or Aba. 
 
 A very large portion of South Africa is 
 occupied by people of this race. All along the 
 eastern coast, as far south as the Great Fish 
 River, the country is thickly populated with 
 Kaffir tribes. On the other side of the moun- 
 tains, the Bechuanas, their near kindred, are 
 found stretching almost across to the Atlantic 
 shore, from the heart of the continent south- 
 ward to the Orange River. 
 
 The country lying between the present 
 colonies of the Cape and Natal was first 
 explored by Europeans in the year 1688, and 
 was then found to be occupied by four great 
 tribes, — the Amampondomsi, the Amampondo, 
 the Abatembu, and the Amaxosa, — who formed 
 nations as distinct from each other as are the 
 French and the Italians. Their language was 
 the same, and their laws and customs varied 
 very slightly ; but in all that respected govern- 
 ment they were absolutely independent of one 
 another. It has since been ascertained that the 
 tribes further northward do not differ materially 
 from these.

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 
 
 The Amaxosa were the farthest to the south- 
 ward in 1688, as they have been ever since. 
 On the coast they had then reached the Keis- 
 kama River, and there is good reason to believe 
 that inland their outposts extended westward 
 as far as the site of the present village of 
 Somerset East. They were thus in contact 
 with Hottentot tribes along an extended line, 
 and an amalgamation of the two races had 
 probably already commenced. It is certain 
 that during the latter half of the last century 
 a great many Hotteniots were incorporated 
 with the Amaxosa. 
 
 The mode of incorporation was in most 
 instances a selection of Hottentot females after 
 the destruction of their clan in war ; but in at 
 least one case a Hottentot tribe became gradu- 
 ally a Kaffir clan by mixture of blood through 
 adoption of Kaffir refugees. The people of 
 this tribe, a pure Hottentot one in 1689 and 
 then called the Gqunaqua, were found by a 
 traveller a century later to resemble Kaffirs 
 more than Hottentots in appearance, and, 
 except a few families, they are now undistin- 
 guishable from other members of the Amaxosa. 
 Their original language has been lost, but their 
 old tribal tide is yet retained in the Kaffir form 
 Amagqunukwebe.

 This large admixture of Hottentot blood has 
 not affected the mode of government or the 
 general customs of the Amaxosa, as is seen on 
 comparing them with other tribes to the north ; 
 but it has affected their personal appearance 
 and their language. Many words in use by the 
 women, though appearing in a Kaffir form, can 
 be traced to Hottentot roots. Owing to this, 
 their traditional stories may have been modified 
 to some, though not to any great, extent. 
 
 In a condition independent of European 
 control, each Kaffir tribe is presided over by a 
 great chief, whose government is, however, but 
 little felt beyond his own immediate cl^n, each 
 petty division being under a ruler who is in 
 reality nearly independent. The person of a 
 chief is inviolable, and an indignity offered to 
 one of them is considered a crime of the 
 gravest nature. Such offshoots of the ruling 
 house as are not of themselves chiefs are of 
 aristocratic rank, and are exempt from obe- 
 dience to the laws which govern the com- 
 monalty. With regard to the common people, 
 the principle of the law is that they are the 
 property of the rulers, and consequently an 
 offence against any of their persons is atoned 
 for by a fine to the chief. Murder and assaults 
 are punished in this manner. Thus in theory

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 
 
 the government is despotic, but in practice it 
 has many checks. The first is the existence of 
 a body of councillors about the person of each 
 chief, whose advice he is compelled to listen to. 
 A second is the custom that a man who can 
 escape from a chief whose enmity he has in- 
 curred will be protected by any other with 
 whom he takes refuge, so that an arbitrary or 
 unpopular ruler is in constant danger of losing 
 his followers. 
 
 The chief in council makes the law and 
 administers it, but from the courts of the petty 
 chiefs there is an appeal to the head of the 
 tribe. Only two kinds of punishment are 
 known : fines and death. Lawsuits are of 
 frequent occurrence, and many Kaffirs display 
 great ability and remarkable powers of oratory 
 in conducting them. The judges are guided in 
 their proceedings by a recognised common law 
 and by precedents, though some of them are 
 exceedingly venal. They will sit, however, 
 with exemplary patience, for days together, to 
 hear all the details of a case, and, where bribery 
 is impossible, their sentences are usually in 
 accordance with strict justice. 
 
 The manner in which the Kaffirs became 
 divided into independent tribes in ancient times 
 is clearly shown by the law of succession to the

 chieftainship which is in force to the present 
 day. The first wives of a chief are usually 
 the daughters of some of his father's principal 
 retainers ; but as he increases in power his 
 alliance is courted by great families, and thus 
 it generally happens that the last of his wives 
 is the highest in rank. Probably she is the 
 daughter of a neighbouring chief, for it is indis- 
 pensable in her case that the blood of the ruling 
 line should flow in her veins. She is termed 
 the great wife, and her eldest son is the prin- 
 cipal heir. 
 
 Another of his wives is invested at some 
 period of his life, with the consent of his coun- 
 cillors and friends, with the title of wife of the 
 right hand, and to her eldest son is allotted 
 a portion of the tribe, with which he forms a 
 new clan. The government of this is entrusted 
 to him as soon as he is full grown, so that while 
 his brother is still a child he has opportunities 
 of increasing his power. If he is the abler 
 ruler of the two, war between them follows 
 almost to a certainty as soon as the great heir 
 reaches manhood, and is invested with a sepa- 
 rate command. Should peace be maintained, 
 upon the death of his father the son of the 
 right hand acknowledges his brother as superior 
 in rank, but pays him no tribute, nor admits of

 his right to interfere in any manner with the 
 internal government of the new clan. 
 
 Thus there was always a tendency to division 
 and subdivision of the tribes, which was the 
 great fault of the system. But while it operated 
 against unity, it tended towards a rapid expan- 
 sion of the people in a country where only a 
 slight opposition could be made by the earlier 
 inhabitants. The lesj powerful chief of the two 
 would naturally desire to reside at a consider- 
 able distance from his competitor, and thus a 
 new tract of country would be taken possession 
 of. About six generations ago a practice was 
 introduced of dividing each tribe into three 
 sections, by the elevation of a third son to 
 power, with the title of representative of the 
 ancients. But it was not generally adopted 
 until Gaika, about the beginning of the present 
 century, gave it his countenance, since which 
 time this custom has been almost universally 
 followed by the Amaxosa, so that the number 
 of petty chiefs and little clans is now very 
 great. 
 
 The Kaffir of the coast region is a model of 
 a well-formed man. In general he is large, 
 without being corpulent, strong, muscular, erect 
 in bearing, and with all his limbs in perfect 
 symmetry. His skull is shaped like that of a

 European ; but here the resemblance ends, for 
 his colour is a deep brown, and his hair is short 
 and woolly. His intellectual abilities are of no 
 mean order, and his reasoning p'"' ' *" are quite 
 equal to those of a white man. iivj is haughty 
 in demeanour, and possesses a large amount of 
 vanity. For anything approaching frivolity he 
 has a supreme contempt. The men are hand- 
 somer than the women, which is owing to the 
 difference in their mode of living. 
 
 Their language is rich in words, and Is 
 musical in expression, owing to the great 
 number of vowels used. With very few excep- 
 tions the syllables end in vowels. In structure 
 it differs greatly from the languages of Euro- 
 peans. The inflections take place at the be- 
 ginning, not at the end of words. Thus the 
 plural of indoday a man, is amadoda, men ; of 
 umfazi, a woman, is abafazi^ women ; of isikaiiy 
 a weapon, is izikali, weapons. And so with 
 every part of speech which is capable of being 
 inflected. This difference is, however, a slight 
 one, when compared with the changes which 
 the other parts of speech undergo to make them 
 harmonize in sound with the principal noun in 
 the sentence. According as the noun com- 
 mences with a particular syllable, so the first 
 syllable of the adjective, the verb, the adverb, 
 
 liMi': 
 


## p. (#26) #################################################

INTRODUCTORY CHATTER. 
 
 and evcMi the preposition, must be altered to 
 agree with it in sound. Only the root syllables 
 of these parts of speech remain the same in all 
 combinations. 
 
 Kaffir words are in most instances combined 
 together to form sentences in such a way 
 that they cannot be separated from each other 
 as English words are. What appears in 
 writing to be only one word, is often really 
 three or four, but as in another combination 
 these would change their positions, and as 
 very frequently a single letter represents a 
 word, it would create much greater confusion 
 to separate them than to write them as one. 
 
 There is no difficulty whatever in expressing 
 any ideas in the Kaffir language. The present 
 infinitive of any verb can be transformed 
 into an abstract noun. The numerals are as 
 complete as is necessary for any calculation. 
 Adjectives proper are not numerous, but their 
 place is supplied by abstract nouns ; as if we 
 should say, a thing with goodness, instead of, 
 a good thing. The adjective follows the 
 noun, as abantwana bane, children four, izinto 
 zine, things four. 
 
 The language of the Amaxosa contains three 
 clicks, which are now represented in writino- 
 by the superfluous letters c, q, and x. These

 clicks are easily sounded separately by Euro- 
 peans, the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply 
 from the front teeth, the q by doing the same 
 from the roof of the mouth, and the x by 
 drawing the breath in a peculiar way between 
 the tongue and the side teeth ; but they 
 generally prove an insurmountable difficulty 
 to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the 
 language. By such a person a syllable com- 
 mencing with a click can only be sounded 
 as a distinct word with a considerable in- 
 terval of time between it and the one before 
 it. European children, however, readily learn 
 to speak it fluently. 
 
 The women do not always use the same 
 words as the me*^, owing to the custom called 
 tcktihlonipa, which prohibits females from pro- 
 nouncing the names of any of their husband's 
 male relatives in the ascending line, or any 
 words whatever in which the principal syllables 
 of such names occur. Owing to this custom, 
 in many instances almost a distinct dialect 
 has come into use. (This custom is referred 
 to in a note to follow the Story of Tangalim- 
 libo.) 
 
 Before the advent of the white man, the 
 Kaffirs knew nothing of letters or of any signs 
 by which ideas could be expressed. Their

 history is thus traditional, and cannot be con- 
 sidered authentic beyond four or five genera- 
 tions back. There are numerous old men in 
 every clan who profess to be acquainted with 
 the deeds of the past, but their accounts of 
 these seldom correspond in details beyond a 
 period of about a century and a half. The 
 genealogy of the great chiefs even, as given 
 by them, is not the same beyond the time of 
 Sikomo, the eighth in order from the present 
 one, while with regard to minor chiefs con- 
 siderable confusion exists two or three genera- 
 tions later. 
 
 They know of no other periods in reckoning 
 time than the day and the lunar month, and 
 can describe events only as happening before 
 or after some remarkable occurrence, such as 
 the death of a chief. The different seasons 
 of the year are indicated by the rise in the 
 evening of particular constellations, to which, 
 as well as to several of the prominent stars 
 and planets, they have given expressive names. 
 
 Until European clothing was introduced, the 
 dress of the Kaffirs was composed of skins 
 of animals formed into a square mantle the 
 size of a large blanket, which they wrapped 
 about their persons. The skin of the leopard 
 was reserved for chiefs and their principal

 councillors alone, but any other could be used 
 by common people. Married women wore a 
 short leather petticoat at all times ; in warm 
 weather men and children went quite naked. 
 No covering was ordinarily worn on the head, 
 though a fillet, intended for show, was com- 
 monly bound round it, and a fantastic head- 
 dress was used by the women on certain festive 
 occasions. 
 
 They are fond of decorating their persons 
 with ornaments, such as shells, teeth of animals, 
 and beads, used as necklaces, copper and ivory 
 rings on their arms, etc. They protect their 
 bodies from the effects of the sun by rubbing 
 themselves all over with fat and red clay, 
 which makes them look like polished bronze. 
 Their clothing is greased and coloured in the 
 same manner. 
 
 They live in villages, large or small accord- 
 ing to circumstances. Their habitations con- 
 sist of hemispherical huts formed of strong 
 wickerwork frames thatched with reeds or 
 grass ; they are proof against rain or wind. 
 The largest are about twenty-five feet in 
 diameter, and seven or eight feet in height 
 in the centre. They are entered by a low, 
 narrow aperture, which is the only opening in 
 the structure ; their interior is smoky and dirty,

 and not seldom swarms with vermin. The 
 villages are usually in situations which com- 
 mand a good view of the surrounding country. 
 
 The Kaf¥irs are warlike in disposition and 
 brave in the field, though when fighting with 
 Europeans they seldom venture upon a pitched 
 battle, owing to their dread of firearms. Their 
 weapons of offence are wooden clubs with 
 heavy heads, and assagais or javelins. The 
 assagai (a corruption of a Portuguese word de- 
 rived from the Latin hastci) consists of a long, 
 thin iron head, with both edges sharp, and 
 terminating in a point, and is attached by 
 thongs to a slender shaft or rod. Poising this 
 first in his uplifted hand and imparting to it a 
 quivering motion, the Kaffir hurls it forth with 
 great force and accuracy of aim. The club is 
 used at close quarters, and can also be thrown 
 to a considerable distance. Boys are trained 
 to the use of both these weapons from an 
 early age. Before the introduction of firearms 
 the Kaffir used a shield to defend his person. 
 It was made of ox-hide stretched over a wooden 
 frame, and varied in size and pattern among 
 the clans. 
 
 The warriors are formed into companies 
 under their respective chiefs, and are not 
 divided into regiments of about the same

 number. A battle between Kaf¥irs consists of 
 a series of individual encounters, in which the 
 bravest combatants on each side challenge each 
 other by name, and when one falls, another is 
 called upon by the victor to take his place. 
 The heiofht of ambition is to be mentioned in 
 one of the rude chants which the bards, whose 
 principal employment is to sing the praises of

 and to hear one's name received with applause. 
 The brave wear on their heads the feathers 
 of the blue crane, which are given to them by 
 the chief as tokens of distinction, and which 
 no one else is permitted to wear (except a 
 single individual at a peculiar ceremony which 
 will be referred to in a note upon the custom 
 of ntonjane). 
 
 Horned cattle constitute their principal 
 wealth, and form a medium of exchange 
 throughout the country. Great care is taken 
 of them, and particular skill is exhibited in 
 their training. They are taught to obey 
 signals, as, for instance, to run home upon a 
 certain call or whistle being given. In former 
 days every man of note had his racing oxen, 
 and prided himself upon their good qualities 
 as much as an English squire does upon his 
 blood horses. Ox racing was then one of the

 institutions of Kaffirland, and was connected 
 with all kinds of festivities. 
 
 The care of cattle is considered the most 
 honourable employment, and falls entirely to 
 the men. They milk the cows, take charge of 
 the dairy, and will not permit a woman even 
 to touch a milksack. When Europeans first 
 visited them they had, in addition to the ox, 
 domestic dogs and an inferior breed of goats, 
 the last not considered of much value. Barn- 
 yard fowls were also found in their possession, 
 but adults made no use of either their flesh or 
 their eggs. 
 
 The Kaffirs are an agricultural as well as 
 a pastoral people. They cultivate the ground 
 to a large extent, and draw the greater portion 
 of their food from it. A species of millet, 
 called by the colonists Kaffir corn, was the 
 grain exclusively cultivated by them prior to 
 the advent of Europeans. Of this they raise 
 large quantities, which they use either boiled, 
 or bruised into a paste from which bread is 
 made. They were acquainted ¦ with the art 
 of fermenting it and making a kind of beer, 
 which they were fond of drinking, and which 
 soon caused intoxication. Of this grain they 
 were careful always to keep a good stock on 
 hand. They preserved it from the attacks of

 the weevil by storing it in air-tight holes ex- 
 cavated beneath the cattle kraals. They had 
 also pumpkins, a species of gourd, a cane 
 containing saccharine matter in large quantities, 
 and a sort of ground nut. The other produc- 
 tions of their gardens, as we see them at 
 present, have been introduced since they be- 
 came acquainted with the white man. Of 
 those mentioned their food consisted, with the 
 addition of curdled milk and occasionally flesh. 
 
 They have two meals a day, a slight break- 
 fast in the morning, and a substantial repast 
 at sunset. Boys before being circumcised are 
 permitted to eat any kind of meat, even that 
 of wild cats and other carnivora, but after that 
 ceremony has been performed the flesh of all 
 unclean animals is rejected by them. They 
 use no kinds of fish as an article of diet, and 
 call them all snakes, without distinction. 
 
 They have a system of religion which they 
 carefully observe. It is based upon the sup- 
 position of the existence of spirits who can 
 interfere with the affairs of this world, and who 
 must therefore be propitiated with sacrifices. 
 These spirits are those of their deceased chiefs, 
 the greatest of whom has power over lightning. 
 When the spirits become hungry, they send 
 a plague or disaster, until sacrifices are offered

 and their hunger is appeased. When a person 
 is killed by lightning no lamentation is made, 
 as it would be considered rebellion to mourn 
 for one whom the great chief has sent for. 
 They have no idea of reward or punishment 
 in a world to' come for acts committed in this 
 life, and each of the commonalty denies the 
 immortality of his own soul. 
 
 In olden times, when common people died, 
 their corpses were dragged away to a short 
 distance from the kraal, and there left to be 
 devoured by beasts of prey; but chiefs and 
 great men were interred with much ceremony. 
 A grave was dug, in which the body was 
 placed in a sitting posture, and by it were 
 deposited his weapons of war and ornaments. 
 When it was closed, such expressions as these 
 were used : " Remember us from where you 
 are. You have gone to high places. Cause 
 us to prosper ! " 
 
 They believe in the existence of a Supreme 
 Being, whom they term Qamata, and to whom 
 they sometimes pray, though they never offer 
 sacrifices to him. In a time of great danger a 
 Kaffir will exclaim, " O Qamata, help me ! " 
 and when the danger is over he will attribute 
 his deliverance to the same Supreme Being. 
 The Kaffirs cannot define their belief concern-

 ing Qamata very minutely, and they do not 
 trouble themselves with thinking much about 
 the matter. 
 
 The largest amount of information on this 
 subject which I ever obtained was from a group 
 of aged Gaikas, among whom was a celebrated 
 native antiquary. Negatively they replied to 
 my inquiries much better than positively. 
 
 " Had he been once a chief, such as Xosa 
 or Tshawe ? " 
 
 " No." 
 
 " Was he the first man, the father of the 
 nations, the one whom some of the old Fingoes 
 call Nkulunkulu ? " 
 
 ••No, not at all ; Qamata was never a man." 
 
 " Was he the creator of all that we see, the 
 mountains, and the sun, and the stars ? " 
 
 " Perhaps he was, we don't know ; he is 
 greater than all these." 
 - -Where is he ?" 
 
 " Everywhere." 
 
 " Does he see all things ?" 
 
 " We think he does." 
 
 " Does he help people ? " 
 
 '• We ask him to sometimes, and we believe 
 he does." 
 
 " Is he altogether good, or altogether bad, or 
 pardy good and partly bad ? "

 " We dou't know about that ; but we think he 
 is altogether good." 
 
 "Are there any others like him ? " 
 
 " No ; he is all alone." 
 
 " Is there any other name for him ? " 
 
 "In the olden times that was the only 
 name, but now he is called by some u-Tixo," 
 (a name for God, introduced by mission- 
 aries). 
 
 A superstitious act of a ver)^ peculiar kind 
 is somehow or other connected in their minds 
 with prayer to, or worship of, Qamata. In 
 various parts of the Kaffir country there 
 are artificial heaps of stones, and a Kaffir, 
 when travelling, may often be seen adding one 
 to the number. He repeats no words, but 
 merely picks up a stone and throws it on the 
 heap. Why does he do it ? That good 
 fortune may attend him, — that he may not be 
 carried away by the river spirit when crossing 
 a stream, — that he may find food prepared 
 for him where he is to rest, — that he may be 
 successful in the business he is engaged in, — 
 or something of the kind that he is thinking of 
 at the time. It is an act of superstition. But 
 old men have told me, when I inquired the 
 object of this act, that " it was for Qamata." 
 How ? They did not know ; but their ances-

 tors had done the same thing, and said it was 
 for Qamata ; and so they did it too. 
 
 The influence of the unseen world is ever 
 acting upon the Kaffir. Far nearer to him 
 than Qamata or the spirits of his ancestors is 
 a whole host of water sprites and hobgoblins, 
 who meet him turn which way he will. There 
 is no beautiful fairyland for him, for all these 
 fanciful beings who haunt the mountains, the 
 plains, and the rivers, are either actively 
 malevolent, or mischievous and addicted to 
 playing pranks. To protect himself from them 
 he carries on his person charms in numbers, 
 only to find himself still exposed to their 
 attacks. This superstition influences all his 
 acts and gives a tone of seriousness to his 
 character. 
 
 The rites of religion consist merely in 
 sacrifices to appease the spirits. These are 
 numerous. On great occasions they are per- 
 formed by individuals who act the part of 
 priests, on ordinary occasions by heads of 
 families. The meat of the animal sacrificed is 
 eaten, for the hunger of the spirit is allayed 
 with the smoke. No sacred days or seasons 
 are observed. 
 
 A corollary to the belief in malevolent spirits 
 is the belief in witchcraft. Certain persons

 obtain from the demons power to bewitch 
 others, and thus sickness and death are caused. 
 The same individual who acts as a priest acts 
 also as a witch-finder. In olden times the 
 person whom the witch-finder pronounced guilty 
 was liable to confiscation of property, torture, 
 and even death. The priest and witch-finder 
 professes also to have the power of making 
 rain, and of causing the warriors of his clan to 
 be invulnerable in battle. When following any 
 of these occupations, he attires himself most 
 fantastically, being painted with various colours, 
 and having the tails of wild animals suspended 
 around him. 
 
 Before the supremacy of the Europeans it 
 was seldom that the individual who filled this 
 office died a natural death. Sooner or later he 
 would fail to cause rain to fall when it was 
 needed, or warriors whom he had made in- 
 vulnerable would be struck down, or something 
 else would happen which would cause him to 
 be regarded as an impostor. He was then 
 generally tied hand and foot and cast into the 
 first stream at hand. Nevertheless, implicit 
 confidence was placed in his successor, until 
 he, too, met the same fate. 
 
 Sometimes a person intimates that he has 
 received revelations from the spirit world.

 He is really a monomaniac, but if his state- 
 ments are believed his power at once becomes 
 greater than that of the highest chief, and his 
 commands are implicitly obeyed. 
 
 The snake is treated with great respect by 
 the Kaffirs. If one is found in a hut, the 
 people will move out and wait patiently until 
 it leaves. The owner will say that it is per- 
 haps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has 
 come to visit him in this form. It may be only 
 an ordinary snake, he will add, but it is not 
 advisable to run any risk, lest harm should 
 befal his house. 
 
 When about fifteen or sixteen years of age, 
 Kaffir youths are circumcised. This is entirely 
 a civil rite. By it a youth is enabled to 
 emerge from the society of women and boyp, 
 and is admitted to the privileges of manhood. 
 Its performance is attended with much cere- 
 mony. The time for circumcision is just after 
 the millet crop is gathered in, when the rite is 
 performed upon all the youths of the clan at 
 the same time. Thereafter, for a couple of 
 months or longer, they live by themselves, and 
 are distinguished by wearing a whimsical head- 
 dress and a girdle of long grass about the loins' 
 besides having their bodies covered with white 
 clay. During this period they have licence to

 Steal pretty freely from their relatives, pro- 
 vided they can do so without being caught in 
 the act. Towards the close they go about in 
 bands to the different villages, dancing and 
 feasting at each. After returning to their 
 homes, they are brought before the old men, 
 who lecture them upon the duties and re- 
 sponsibilities which they have taken upon 
 themselves, and afterwards presents of cattle 
 and weapons are made to them by their 
 friends to give them a start in life. 
 
 If a young chief happens to be growing 
 up, the circumcision of the boys of his clan 
 is delayed until he is fifteen or sixteen years 
 old. All who are circumcised with him are 
 supposed to be bound to him by the strongest 
 ties ; they would be disgraced for ever if they 
 were to desert him in any extremity, and in 
 practice they are usually found ready even to 
 die for him if necessary. 
 
 The ntojijane Is a ceremony having refer- 
 ence to females entering womanhood. It is 
 described In a note to one of the following 
 stories. 
 
 The Kaffirs are polygamlsts, but their wives 
 are not of equal rank. (The marriage 
 ceremony is fully described in a note.) The 
 females ought to be dissatisfied, according to

 our ideas, but in point of fact they are fully as 
 happy and contented as European women are. 
 The husband is head of the establishment. 
 Each of his wives has a hut of her own, which 
 she and her children occupy, and the husband 
 uses his caprice as to which of them he shall 
 honour with his society at any time. Wealth 
 is estimated by the number of wives and cattle 
 a man possesses, and the former is commonly 
 made use of to increase the other. 
 
 In ^he division of labour the cultivation of 
 the ground falls to the woman's share, as does 
 also the collection of firewood, and the thatch- 
 ing of the huts. A man who meddles with 
 work of this kind is regarded as an intruder 
 into a domain not his own. The females look 
 upon it as pertaining to them, just as in 
 England they look upon housework. 
 
 The descent of property is regulated In the 
 same manner as the succession to the chieftain- 
 ship. 
 
 Many of their manufactures display con- 
 siderable skill and ingenuity. Foremost 
 among these must be reckoned metallic wares, 
 which include implements of war and husban- 
 dry, and ornaments for the person. Iron and 
 copper are now obtained in trade from Euro- 
 peans, but when the country was first visited,

 the Kaffirs were found in possession of these 
 metals, and to the present day a few stubborn 
 conservatives prefer to smelt ore for themselves, 
 as their ancestors did before them. There 
 are certain families to whom the workinjr in 
 metals is confined, the son following the father 
 in his occupation. This is the case with every 
 kind of manufacture, and no one pretends to 
 know anything about a trade which does not 
 belong to his own family. 
 
 In many parts of the country iron ore of 
 excellent quality is abundant, and this they 
 smelt (or rather did so until recently) in a 
 simple manner. Forming a furnace of a boul- 
 der with a hollow surface, out of which a groove 
 was made to allow the liquid metal to escape, 
 and into which a hole was pierced for the pur- 
 pose of introducing a current of air, they piled 
 up a heap of charcoal and virgin ore, which 
 they afterwards covered in such a way as to 
 prevent the escape of heat. The bellows by 
 which air was introduced were made of skins, 
 the mouthpiece being the horn of a large ante- 
 lope. The molten iron, escaping from the 
 crude yet effective furnace, ran into clay moulds 
 prepared to receive it, which were as nearly 
 as possible of the same magnitude as the im- 
 plements they wished to make. These were

 never of great size, the largest being the picks 
 or heavy hoes used in gardening. 
 
 The Kaffir smith, using a boulder for an 
 anvil and a hammer of iron or stone, next 
 proceeded to shape the lump of metal into an 
 assagai head, an axe, a pick, or whatever was 
 required. The iron was worked cold. In this 
 laborious operation a vast amount of patience 
 and perseverance was exercised, and the article 
 when completed was very creditable indeed. 
 
 Copper is worked into a great variety of 
 ornaments for their persons. This metal is 
 found in certain parts of the country, but it is 
 now generally obtained in trade from Euro- 
 peans. 
 
 Hardly less remarkable was their skill in 
 pottery, an art rapidly becoming lost since the 
 introduction of European wares. Vessels con- 
 taining from half a pint to fifty gallons were 
 constructed by them of earthenware, some of 
 which were highly ornamented, and were almost 
 as perfect in form as if they had been turned 
 on a wheel. Though they were frequently not 
 more than an eighth of an inch in thickness, so 
 finely tempered were they that the most intense 
 heat did not damage them. These vessels 
 were used as beer pots, grain jars, and cooking 
 utensils.

 In the manufacture of wooden articles, such 
 as spoons, bowls, fighting sticks, pipes (since 
 the introduction of tobacco), rests for the head 
 when sleeping, etc., they display great skill and 
 no little taste. Each article is made of a single 
 block of wood, requiring much time and pa- 
 tience to complete it, and upon it is frequently 
 carved some neat but sitnple pattern. 
 
 Baskets for holding grain, rush mats, bags, 
 and drinking vessels made of grass are among 
 the products of their labour. Rush bags are 
 made so carefully and strongly that they are 
 used to hold water or any other liquid. 
 
 Skins for clothing are prepared by rubbing 
 them for a length of time with grease, by which 
 means they are made nearly as soft and pliable 
 as cloth. 
 
 Ingenious as they are, the men are far from 
 being industrious. A great portion of their 
 time is spent in visiting and gossip, of which 
 they are exceedingly fond. They are perfect 
 masters of that kind of argument which consists 
 in parrying a question by means of putting 
 another. They are not strict observers of 
 truth, and, though not pilferers, they are 
 addicted to cattle lifting. According to their 
 ideas, stealing cattle is not a crime ; it is a civil 
 offence, and a thief when detected is compelled

 to make ample restitution ; but no disgrace 
 attaches to it, and they have no religious 
 scruples concerning it. 
 
 Such, in brief, are the Kaffirs, the people 
 among whom the following stories are current.

 STORY OF THE BIRD THAT MADE MILK. I. 
 
 HERE was once upon a time a poor 
 man living with his wife in a certain 
 village. They had three children, two 
 boys and a girl. They used to get milk 
 from a tree. That milk of the tree was 
 got by squeezing. It was not nice as that of 
 a cow, and the people that drank it were always 
 thin. For this reason, those people were never 
 glossy like those who are fat. 
 
 One day the woman went to cultivate a 
 garden. She began by cutting the grass with 
 a pick, and then putting it in a big heap. That 
 was the work of the first day, and when the 
 sun was just about to set she went home. 
 When she left, there came a bird to that place, 
 and sang this song :

 Spring up, spring up ; 
 Work of this garden, 
 Work of this garden, 
 Disappear, disappear." 
 
 It was so. 
 
 The next morning, when she returned and 
 saw that, she wondered greatly. She again 
 put it in order on that day, and put some sticks 
 in the ground to mark the place. 
 
 In the evening she went home and told that 
 she had found the grass which she had cut 
 growing just as it was before. 
 
 Her husband said : " How can such a thing 
 be ? You were lazy and didn't work, and now 
 tell me this falsehood. Just get out of my 
 sight, or I'll beat you." 
 
 On the third day she went to her work with 
 a sorrowful heart, remembering the words 
 spoken by her husband. She reached the place 
 and found the grass growing as before. The 
 sticks that she stuck in the ground tvere there 
 still, but she saw nothing else of her labour. 
 She wonderd greatly. 
 
 She said in her heart, " I will not cut the 
 grass off again, I will just hoe the ground as it 
 
 IS. 
 
 She commenced. Then the bird came and 
 perched on one of the sticks.

 It sang : 
 
 " Cili, citi, who is this cultivating the ground of my father ? 
 Pick, come off; 
 Pick handle, break ; 
 Sods, go back to your places ! " 
 
 All these things happened. 
 
 The woman went home and told her husband 
 what the bird had done. Then they made 
 a plan. They dug a deep hole in the ground, 
 and covered it with sticks and grass. The man 
 hid himself in the hole, and put up one of his 
 hands. The woman commenced to hoe the 
 ground again. Then the bird came and perched 
 on the hand of the man, and sang : 
 
 ** This is the ground of my father. 
 Who are you, digging my father's ground ? 
 Pick, break into small pieces ; 
 Sods, return to your places." 
 
 It was so. 
 
 Then the man tightened his fingers and 
 caught the bird. He came up out of the place 
 of concealment. 
 
 He said to the bird : " As for you who spoil 
 the work of this garden, you will not see the 
 sun any more. With this sharp stone I will 
 cut off your head ! " 
 
 Then the bird said to him : " I am not a bird

 that should be killed. I am a bird that can 
 make milk." 
 
 The man said : "Make some, then." 
 
 The bird made some milk in his hand. The 
 man tasted it. It was very nice milk. 
 
 The man said : " Make some more milk, my 
 bird." 
 
 The bird did so. The man sent his wife for 
 a milk basket. When she brought it, the bird 
 filled it with milk. 
 
 The man was very much pleased. He 
 said : " This pretty bird of mine is better than 
 a cow." 
 
 He took it home and put it m a jar. After 
 that he used to rise even in the night and tell 
 the bird to make milk for him. Only he and 
 his wife drank of it. The children continued 
 to drink of the milk of the tree. The names 
 of the children were Gingci, the first-born son ; 
 Lonci, his brother ; and Dumangashe, Ms 
 sister. That man then got very fat indeed, so 
 that his skin became shining. 
 
 The girl said to her brother Gingci : " Why 
 does father get fat and we remain so thin ? " 
 
 He replied : " I do not know. Perhaps he 
 eats in the night" 
 
 They made a plan to watch. They saw him 
 rise in the middle of the night. He went to

 the big jar and took an eating mat off it. He 
 said : " Make milk, my bird." He drank much. 
 Again he said : " Make milk, my bird," and 
 again he drank till he was very full. Then he 
 lay down and went * ^ sleep. 
 
 The next day the woman went to work m 
 her garden, and the man went to visit his 
 friend. The children remained at home, but 
 not in the house. Their father fastened the 
 door of the house, and told them not to enter 
 it on any account till his return. 
 
 Gingci said : " To-day we will drink of the 
 milk that makes father fat and shining; we 
 will not drink of the milk of the euphorbia 
 to-day." 
 
 The girl said : "As for me, I also say let us- 
 drink of father's milk to-day." 
 
 They entered the house. Gingci removed 
 the eating mat from the jar, and said to the 
 bird : "My father's bird, make milk for 
 
 me. 
 
 »> 
 
 The bird said : " If I am your father's bird, 
 put me by the fireplace, and I will make 
 milk." 
 
 The boy did so. The bird made just a little 
 milk. 
 
 The boy drank, and said : " My father's 
 bird, make more milk."

 fear. 
 
 They said to themselves: "If our father finds

 replied. He asked for the others. 
 
 Lonci said : "I went to the river to drink ; 
 when I returned they were gone/' 
 
 He searched for them, and found the girl 
 under the ashes and the boy behind a stone. 
 He inquired at once about his bird. They 
 were compelled to tell the truth concerning 
 it. 
 
 Then the man took a riem and hung those 
 two children on a tree that projected over the 
 river. He went away, leaving them there. 
 Their mother besought their father, saying that 
 they should be released ; but the man refused.

 After he was gone, the boy tried to escape. 
 He dimbed up the riem and held on to the 
 tree ; then he went up and loosened the riem 
 that was tied to his .ister. After that they 
 climbed up the tree, and then went away from 
 their home. They slept three times on the 
 road. 
 
 They came to a big rock. The boy said : 
 " We have no father and no mother ; rock, be 
 our house." 
 
 The rock opened, and they went inside. 
 After that they lived there in that place. 
 They obtained food by hunting animals, — they 
 were hunted by the boy. 
 
 When they were already in that place a long 
 time, the girl grew to be big. There were no 
 people in that place. A bird came one day 
 with a child, and left it there by their house. 
 
 Thie bird said : " So have I done to all the 
 people." 
 
 After that a crocodile came to that place. 
 The boy was just going to kill it, but it said : 
 " I am a crocodile; I am not to be killed; I am 
 your friend." 
 
 Then the boy went with the crocodile to the 
 house of the crocodile, in a deep hole under the 
 water. 
 
 The crocodile had many cattle and (much)

 millet. He gave the boy ten cows and ten 
 baskets of millet. 
 
 The crocodile said to the boy : " You must 
 send your sister for the purpose of being 
 married to me." 
 
 The boy made a fold to keep his cattle in ; 
 his sister made a garden and planted millet. 
 The crocodile sent more cattle. The boy 
 made a very big fold, and it was full of cattle. 
 
 At this time there came a bird and circum- 
 cised the boy. The bird said: "Your sister has 
 performed the custom, and as for you, you 
 should enter manhood." 
 
 The crocodile gave one of his daughters to 
 be the w'fe of the young man. The young 
 woman went to the village of the crocodile, 
 she went to be a bride. 
 
 They said to her : " Whom do you choose to 
 be your husband?" 
 
 The girl replied : " I choose Crocodile." 
 
 Her husband said to her : " Lick my face." 
 
 She did so. The crocodile cast off its skin, 
 and arose a man of great strength and fine 
 appearance. 
 
 He said : " The enemies of my father's 
 house did that; you, my wife, are stronger than 
 they." 
 
 After this there was a great famine, and the

 mother of those people came to their village. 
 She did not recognise her children, but they 
 knew her and gave her food. She went away, 
 and then their father came. He did not 
 recognise them either, but they knew him. 
 They asked him what he wanted. He told 
 them that his village was devoured by famine. 
 They gave him food, and he went away. 
 
 He returned again. 
 
 The young man said : " You thought we 
 would die when you hung us in the tree." 
 
 He was astonished, and said : " Are you in- 
 deed my child ? " 
 
 Crocodile then gave them (the parents) three 
 baskets of corn, and told them to go and build 
 on the mountains. He (the man) did so, and 
 died there on the mountains.

THE STORY OF THE BIRD THAT MADE MILK. II. 
 
 The following is another version of this story of the Bird 
 that made Milk, as current among the Barolongs, a tribe 
 speaking the Sechuana language, and residing beyond the 
 Orange River. It was written down for me by an educated 
 granc'snn of the late chief Moroko. 
 
 T is said that there was once a great 
 town in a certain place, which had 
 many people living in it. They lived 
 5? upon grain only. One year there was a 
 great famine. There was in that town a 
 poor man, by name Masilo, and his wife. One 
 day they went to dig in their garden, and they 
 continued digging the whole day long. In the 
 evening, when the digging companies returned 
 home, they returned also. Then there came a 
 bird and stood upon the house which was be- 
 side the garden, and began to whistle, and said : 
 " Masilo's cultivated ground, mix together." 
 The ground did as the bird said. After that 
 was done the bird went away. 
 
 In the morning, when Masilo and his wife

 went to the garden, they were in doubt, and 
 said : 
 
 " Is it really the place we were digging 
 yesterday ? " 
 
 They saw that it was the place by the people 
 working on each Side. The people began to 
 laugh at them, and mocked them, and said : " It 
 is because you are very lazy." 
 
 They continued to dig again that day, and 
 in the evening they went home with the others. 
 
 Then the bird c.:ine and did the same thing. 
 
 When they went back next morning, they 
 found their ground altogether undug. Then 
 they believed that they were bewitched by 
 some others. 
 
 They continued digging that day again. 
 But in the evening', when the companies re- 
 turned, Masilo said to hir wife : 
 
 " Go home ; I will stay behind to watch and 
 find the thing which eats our work." 
 
 Then he went and laid himself down by the 
 head of the garden, under the same house 
 which the bird used always to stand upon. 
 While he was thinking, the bird came. It was 
 a very beautiful bird. He was looking at it 
 and admiring it, when it began to speak. 
 
 It said : " Masilo's cultivated ground, mix 
 together."

 Then he caught it, and said : " Ah ! is it you 
 who eat the work of our hands ? " 
 
 He took out his knife from the sheath, and 
 was going to cut the head of the bird off. 
 
 Then the bird said : " Please don't kill me, 
 and I will make some milk for you to eat." 
 
 Masilo answered : " You must bring back 
 the work of my hands first." 
 
 The bird said : " Masilo's cultivated ground, 
 appear," and it appeared. 
 
 Then Masilo said : " Make the milk now/* 
 and, behold, it immediately made thick milk, 
 which Masilo began to eat. When he was 
 satisfied, he took the bird home. As he ap- 
 proached his house, he put the bird in his 
 bag. 
 
 When he entered his house, he said to his 
 wife, "Wash all the largest beer pots which 
 are in the house," but his wife was angry on 
 account of her hunger, and she answered : 
 "What have you to put in such large pots V* 
 
 Masilo said to her : "Just hear me, and do 
 as I command you, then you will see." 
 
 When she was ready with the pots, Masilo 
 took his bird out of his bag, and said : " Make 
 milk for my children to eat." 
 
 Then the bird filled all the beer pots with 
 milk.

 They commenced to eat, and when they 
 were finished, Masilo charged his children, 
 saying, 
 
 " Beware that you do not tell anybody of 
 this, not one of your companions." 
 
 They swore by him that they would not tell 
 anybody. 
 
 Masilo and his family then lived upon this 
 bird. The people were surprised when they 
 saw him and his family. They said : 
 
 " Why are the people at Masilo's house so 
 fat ? He is so poor, but now since his garden 
 has appeared he and his children are so fat !" 
 
 They tried to watch and to see what he was 
 eating, but they never could find out at all. 
 
 One morning Masilo and his wife went to 
 work in their garden, and about the middle of 
 the same day the children of that town met to- 
 gether to play. They met just before Masilo's 
 house. While they were playing the others 
 said to Masilo's children : 
 
 "Why are you so fat while we remain so 
 thin } " 
 
 They answered : " Are we then fat ? We 
 thought we were thin just as you are." 
 
 They would not tell them the cause. The 
 others continued to press them, and said : " We 
 won't tell anybody."

 • Then the children of Masilo said :" There 
 is a bird in our father's house which makes 
 milk." 
 
 The others said : " Please show us the bird." 
 
 They went into the house and took it out of 
 the secret place where their father had placed 
 it. They ordered it as their father used to 
 order it, and it made milk, which their com- 
 panions drank, for they were very hungry. 
 
 After drinking they said : " Let it dance for 
 us," and they loosened it from the place where 
 it was tied. 
 
 The bird began to dance in the house, but 
 one said : " This place is too confined," so they 
 took it outside of the house. While thej' were 
 enjoying themselves and laughing, the bird 
 flew away, leaving them in great dismay. 
 
 Masilo's children said : " Our father will this 
 day kill us, therefore we must go after the 
 bird." 
 
 So they followed it, and continued going 
 after it the whole day long, for when they were 
 at a distance it would sit still for a little while, 
 and when they approached it would fly away. 
 
 When the digging companies returned from 
 digging, the people of that town cried for their 
 children, for they did not know what had 
 become of them. But when Masilo went into

 the house and could not find his bird, he knew 
 where the children were, but he did not tell any 
 of their parents. He was very sorry for his 
 bird, for he knew that he had lost his food. 
 
 When evening set in, the children deter- 
 mined to return to their home, but there came 
 a storm of rain with hea^y thunder, and they 
 were very much afraid. Among them wa^ a 
 brave boy, named Mosemanyanamatong, who 
 encouraged them, and said : 
 
 " Do not be afraid ; I can command a house 
 to build itself." 
 
 They said : " Please command it." 
 
 He said : " House appear," and it appeared, 
 and also wood for fire. Then the children 
 entered the house and made a large fire, and 
 began to roast some wild roots wh* :h they dug 
 out of the ground. 
 
 While they were roasting the roots and were 
 merry, there came a big cannibal, and they 
 heard his voice saying : " Mosemanyanamatong, 
 give me some of the wild roots you have." 
 
 They were afraid, and the brave boy said to 
 the girts and to the other boys, " Give me some 
 of yours." 
 
 They gave to him, and he threw the roots 
 outside. While the cannibal was still eating, 
 they went out and fled. He finished eating

 the roots, and then pursued them. When he 
 approached they scattered somo more roots 
 upon the ground, and while he was picking 
 them up and eating, they fled. 
 
 At length they came among mountains, 
 where trees were growing. The girls were 
 already very tired, so they all climbed up a tall 
 tree. The cannibal came ^here, and tried to 
 cut the tree down with his sharp and long nail. 
 
 Then the brave boy said to the girls : "While 
 I am singing you must continue saying, * Tree 
 be strong, Tree be strong ! ' " 
 
 He sang this song : 
 
 
 " It is foolish, 
 It is foolish to be a traveller. 
 And to go on a journey 
 With the blood of girls upon one ! 
 While we were roasting wild roots 
 A great darkness fell upon us. 
 It was not darkness, 
 It was awful gloom ! " 
 
 While he was singing, the 'e came a great 
 bird and hovered over them, and said : " Hold 
 fast to me." 
 
 The children held fast to the bird, and it 
 flew away with them, and took them to their 
 own town. 
 
 It was midnight when it arrived there, and it

 sat down at the gate of Mosemanyanamatong's 
 mother's house. 
 
 In the morning, when that woman came out 
 of her house, she took ashes and cast upon the 
 bird, for she said : " This bird knows where our 
 children are." 
 
 At midday the bird sent word to the chief, 
 saying, "Command all your people to spread 
 mats in all the paths." 
 
 The chief commanded them to do so. Then 
 the bird brought all the children out, and the 
 people were greatly delighted.

 THE STORY OF FIVE HEADS. 
 
 HERE was once a man living In a 
 certain place, who had two daughters 
 big enough to be married. 
 One day the man went over the river 
 to another village, which was the residence 
 of a great chief. The people asked him to tell 
 them the news. He replied, that there was 
 no news in the place that he came from. Then 
 the man inquired about the news of their place. 
 They said the news of their place was that 
 the chief wanted a wife. 
 
 The man went home and said to his two 
 dau'jhters : " Which of you wishes to be the 
 wife of a chief ? " 
 
 The eldest replied : " I wish to be the wife 
 of a chief, my father." The name of that girl 
 was Mpunzikazi.

 visited, the chief wishes for a wife ; you, my 
 daughter, shall go." 
 
 The man called all his friends, and assembled 
 a large company to go with his daughter to 
 the village of the chief. But the girl would not 
 consent that those people should go with her. 
 
 She said : " I will go alone to be the wife of 
 the chief" 
 
 Her father replied : " How can you, my 
 daughter, say such a thing ? Is it not so that 
 when a girl goes to present herself to her 
 husband she should be accompanied by others ? 
 Be not foolish, my daughter." 
 
 The girl still said : " I will go alone to be 
 the wife of the chief" 
 
 Then the man allowed his daughter to do 
 as she chose. She went alone, no bridal party 
 accompanying her, to present herself at the 
 village of the chief who wanted a wife. 
 
 As Mpunzikazi was in the path, she met a 
 mouse. 
 
 The mouse said : " Shall I show you the 
 
 way 
 
 ?" 
 
 The girl replied : " Just get away from before 
 my eyes." 
 
 The mouse answered : '' If you do like this, 
 you will not succeed." 
 
 Then she met a frog.

 The frog said : " Shall I show you the way ? " 
 
 Mpunzikazi replied : " You are not worthy 
 to speak to me, as I am to be the wife of a chief" 
 
 The frog said : " Go on then ; you will see 
 afterwards what will happen." 
 
 When the girl got tired, she sat down under 
 a tree to rest. A boy who was herding goats 
 i.i that place came to her, he being very hungry. 
 
 The boy said : " Where are you going to, my 
 eldest sister ? " 
 
 Mpunzikazi replied in an angry voice : " Who 
 are you that you should speak to me ? Just 
 get away from before me." 
 
 The boy said : " I am very hungry ; will you 
 not give me of your food ? " 
 
 She answered : " Get away quickly." 
 
 The boy said : " You will not return if you 
 do this." 
 
 She went on her way again, and met with 
 an old woman sitting by a big stone. 
 
 The old woman said : " I will give you advice. 
 You will meet with trees that will laugh at 
 you : you must not laugh in return. You will 
 see a bag of thick milk : you must not eat of 
 it. You will meet a man whose head is under 
 his arm : you must not take water from him." 
 
 Mpunzikazi answered: " You ugly thing! who 
 are you that you should advise me .-* "

 The old woman continued in saying those 
 words. 
 
 The girl went on. She came to a place 
 where were many trees. The trees laughed at 
 her, and she laughed at them in return. She 
 saw a bag of thick milk, and she ate of it. 
 She met a man carrying his head under his 
 arm, and she took water to drink from him. 
 
 She came to the river of the village of the 
 chief. She saw a girl there dipping water from 
 the river. The girl said : " Where are you 
 going to, my sister ? " 
 
 Mpunzikazi replied : " Who are you l ^t 
 you should call me sister ? I am going to be 
 the wife of a chief" 
 
 The girl drawing water was the sister of the 
 chief She said : ** Wait, I will give you advice. 
 Do not enter the village by this side." 
 
 Mpunzikazi did not stand to listen, but just 
 went on. 
 
 She reached the village of the chief. The 
 people asked her where she came from and 
 what she \vanted. 
 
 She answered : " I have come to be the wife 
 of the chief." 
 
 They said : " Who ever saw a girl go without 
 a retinue to be a bride ? " 
 
 They said also: ** The chief is not at home;

 you must prepare food for him, that when he 
 comes in the evenings he may eat." 
 
 They gave her millet to grind. She ground 
 it very coarse, and made bread that was not 
 nice to eat. 
 
 In the evening she heard the sound of a 
 irreat wind. That wind was the comingf of the 
 chief. He was a big snake with five heads 
 and large eyes. Mpunzikazi was very much 
 frightened when she saw him. He sat down 
 before the door and told her to bring his food. 
 She brought the bread which she had made. 
 Makanda Mahlanu (Five Heads) was not satis- 
 fied with that bread. He said: " You shall not 
 be my wife," and he struck her with his tail 
 and killed her. 
 
 Afterwards the sister of Mpunzikazi said to 
 her father : " I also wish to be the wife of a chief." 
 
 Her father replied: " It is well, my daughter; 
 it is right that you should wish to be a bride." 
 
 The man called all his friends, and a great 
 retinue prepared to accompany the bride. The 
 name of the girl was Mpunzanyana. 
 
 In the way they met a mouse. 
 
 The mouse said : *' Shall I show you the 
 road?" 
 
 Mpunzanyana replied: " If you will show me 
 the way I shall be glad."

 Then the mouse pointed out the way. 
 
 She came into a valley, where she saw an 
 old woman standing by a tree. 
 
 The old woman said to her : " You will 
 come to a place where two paths branch off. 
 You must take the little one, because if you 
 take the big one you will not be fortunate." 
 
 Mpunzanyana replied: " I will take the little 
 path, my mother." She went on. 
 
 Afterwards she met a cony. 
 
 The cony said: " The village of the chief is 
 close by. You will meet a girl by the river : 
 you must speak nicely to her. They will give 
 you millet to grind : you must grind it well. 
 When you see your husband, you must not be 
 afraid." 
 
 She said : " I will do as you say, cony." 
 
 *n the river she met the chiefs sister carry- 
 ing water. 
 
 The chiefs sister said : '* Where are you 
 going to ? " 
 
 Mpunzanyana replied: "This is the end of 
 my journey." 
 
 The chiefs sister said : " What is the object 
 of your coming to this place ? " 
 
 Mpunzanyana replied : " I am with a bridal 
 party." 
 
 The chiefs sister said : " That is right, but

 will you not be afraid when you see your 
 husband ? " 
 
 Mpunzanyana answered : " I will not be 
 afraid." 
 
 The chief's sister pointed out the hut in 
 which she should stay. Food was given to the 
 bridal party. The mother of the chief took 
 millet and gave to the bride, saying : " You 
 must prepare food for your husband. He is 
 not here now, but he will come in the evening." 
 
 In the evening she heard a very strong wind, 
 which made the hut shake. The poles fell, but 
 she did not run out. Then she saw the chief 
 Makanda Mahlanu coming. He asked for 
 food. Mpunzanyana took the bread which she 
 had made, and gave it to him. He was very 
 much pleased with that food, and said : 
 
 " You shall be my wife." He gave her very 
 many ornaments. 
 
 Afterwards Makanda Mahlanu became a 
 man, and Mpunzanyana continued to be the 
 wife he loved best.

 THE STORY OF TANGALIMLIBO. 
 
 HERF was once a man who had two 
 wives, one of whom had no children. 
 She grieved much about that, till one 
 day a bird came to her and gave her 
 ' some little pellets. The bird said she 
 must eat of these always before she partook of 
 food, and then she would bear a child. She 
 was very glad, and offered the bird some 
 millet. 
 
 But the bird said : " No, I do not want 
 millet." 
 
 The woman then offered an isidanga (an 
 ornamental breast-band which women wear), 
 but the bird said it had no use for that. Then 
 she got some very fine gravel and placed be- 
 fore the bird, which it received at her hands. 
 
 After this the woman had a daughter. Her 
 husband knew nothing of what had happened, 
 because he never went to her house. He did

 not love her at all, for the reason that she bore 
 no children. So she said : 
 
 " I will keep my daughter in the house till 
 my husband comes ; he will surely love me 
 when he sees I have such a beautiful child." 
 
 The name given to the girl was Tangalim- 
 libo. 
 
 The man went always to the house of the 
 other wife, and so it happened that Tangalim- 
 libo was grown to be a young woman when 
 her father first saw her. He was very much 
 pleased, and said : 
 
 " My dear wife, you should have told me of 
 this before." 
 
 The girl had never been out of the house in 
 the daytime. Only in the night-time she had 
 gone out, when people could not see her. 
 
 The man said to his wife : 
 
 " You must make much beer, and invite 
 many people to come and rejoice with me over 
 this that has happened." 
 
 The woman did so. There was a big tree in 
 front of the kraal, and the mats were spread 
 under it. It was a fine sunny day, and very 
 many men came. Among them was the son of 
 a certain chief, who fell in love with Tangalim- 
 libo as soon as he saw her. 
 
 When the young chief went home he sent a

 message to the father of the girl that he must 
 send her to him to be married. The man told 
 all his friends about that. He told them also 
 to be ready at a certain time to conduct his 
 daughter to the chief So they came and took 
 her, and the marriage feast was very great. 
 The oxen were many which were killed that 
 day. Tangalimlibo had a large and beautiful 
 ox given to her by her father. That ox was 
 called by her own name. She took off a piece 
 of her clothing and gave it to the ox, which ate 
 it. 
 
 After she had been married some time, this 
 woman had a son. She was loved very much 
 by her husband, because she was pretty and 
 industrious ; only this thing was observed of 
 her, that she never went out in the daytime. 
 Therefore she received the name of Sihamba 
 Ngenyanga (the walker by moonlight). 
 
 One day her husband went to a distant place 
 to hunt with other men. There were left at 
 his home with this woman only her father-in- 
 law, her mother-in-law, and a girl who nursed 
 the little child. 
 
 The father-in-law said : 
 
 " Why does she not work during the day ? " 
 
 He pretended to become thirsty, and sent the 
 girl to Tangalimlibo to ask for water, saying :

 The woman sent water to her father-in-law, 
 but he threw it on the ground, saying : 
 
 '* It is water from the river I desire." 
 
 She said : 
 
 " I never go to the river in the daytime." 
 
 He continued to ask, saying again : 
 
 •' I die with thirst." 
 
 Then she took a milk- basket and a calabash 
 ladle, and went weeping to the river. She 
 dipped the ladle in the water, and it was 
 drawn out of her hand. She dipped the 
 milk-basket in the water, and it was drawn 
 away from her. Then she tried to take some 
 water in her mantle, and she was drawn under 
 the surface. After a little time the girl was 
 sent to look for her, but she came back, saying : 
 
 " I found her not who is accustomed to draw 
 water only in the night." 
 
 Her father-in-law drove oxen quickly to the 
 river. He took the big ox that was called by 
 her name and killed it. He put all the flesh 
 and everything else that was of that ox into the 
 river, saying : 
 
 " Let this be instead of my child." 
 
 A voice was heard saying : 
 
 " Go to my father and my mother and say to 
 them that I am taken by the river."

 That evening the Httle child of TangaHmlibo 
 was crying very bitterly. Its father was not 
 yet home. Its grandmother tried by every 
 means to keep it from crying, but in vain. 
 Then she gave it to the nurse, who fastened it 
 on her back. Still the child continued to cry. 
 In the middle of the night the nurse went down 
 to the river with the child, singing this song : 
 
 " It is crying, it is crying, 
 The child of Sihamba Ngenyanga ; 
 It is crying, it will not be pacified." 
 
 Then the mother of the child came out of 
 the river, and wailed this song : 
 
 " It is crying, it is crying, 
 The child of the walker by moonlight. 
 It was done intentionally by people whose names are un- 
 mentionable. 
 They sent her for v/ater during the day. 
 She tried to dip with the milk-basket, and then it sank. 
 Tried to dip with the ladle, and then it sank. 
 Tried to dip with the mantle, and then it sank." 
 
 With the name as a chorus at the end of each 
 line. 
 
 Then she took her child and put it to her 
 breast to suck. 
 
 When the child had finished sucking, she 
 gave it back to the nurse, telling her to take it 
 home. She commanded the nurse never to say

 to any one that she came out of the water, and 
 told her that when people asked where the 
 child got food she must say she gave it berries 
 to eat. 
 
 This continued for some days. Every night 
 the nurse took the child to the river, when its 
 mother came out and suckled it. She always 
 looked round to see that no one was present, 
 and always put the same command on the girl. 
 
 After a time the father of the child returned 
 from hunting. They told nim of Tangalim- 
 libo's going to the river and not returning. 
 Then the nurse brought the child to him. He 
 inquired what it ate, and was told that berries 
 were given to it. 
 
 Me said : *' That cannot be so ; go anc. get 
 some berries, and let me see my child eat 
 them." 
 
 The girl went and brought some berries, but 
 they were not eaten by the child. Then the 
 father of the child beat the girl until she told 
 the truth. She said she went at night to 
 the river, when the mother came out and 
 caressed her child and gave it of her milk. 
 
 Then they made a plan that the liasband of 
 Tangalimlibo should hide himself in the reeds 
 and try and catch his wife when she came out 
 of the water. He took the skin of an ox and

 cut it into a long riem, one end of which he 
 fastened round his waist. The other end he 
 gave to the men of that village, telling them to 
 hold it fast and to pull hard when they felt it 
 being drawn from them. 
 
 At night the man hid himself in the reeds. 
 Tangalimlibo came out of the water and looked 
 all round while she was singing her song. 
 She asked the girl if any one was there, and 
 when the girl replied that there was no one 
 she took her child. Then her husband sprang 
 upon her, clasping her very tight. She tried 
 to pull back, but the men at the village drew 
 upon the riem. She was drawn away, but the 
 river followed her, and its water turned into 
 blood. When it came close to the village, the 
 men who were pulling at the riem saw it, and 
 became frightened. They let the riem go, 
 when the river at once went back, taking 
 Tangalimlibo with it. 
 
 After that her husband was told of the voice 
 which came from the water, saying : 
 
 " Go to my father and my mother and tell 
 them I am taken by the river." 
 
 He calle 1 his racing ox, and said : 
 
 " Will you, my ox, take this message to the 
 father and mother of Tangalimlibo ? " 
 
 The ox only bellowed.

 The cock answered : "I will do so, my

 He said : " Let me hear what you will

 Then the cock stood up, and sang his song.

 They said : ** Where does this cock come

 The cock said : *' Give me some food, for I

 Then he came to the village of the father of

 woman skilful in the use of medicines. 
 
 She said to her husband : " Get a fi ox to 
 go with us." 
 
 They arrived at the river, and killed the ox. 
 
 Then that woman worked with her medicines 
 while they put the meat in the water. There 
 was a great shaking and a rising up of the 
 river, and Tangalimlibo came out. There was 
 great joy among those people when they took 
 her home to her husband.

 STORY OF THE GIRL WHO DISREGARDED THE CUSTOM 
 
 OF NTONJANE. 
 
 HERE was once a chiefs daughter who 
 had reached the age when it was 
 necessary for her to observe the ntonjane. 
 She was therefore placed in a hut, in 
 which she was to remain during the period 
 of the ceremony. One day her companions 
 persuaded her to go and bathe in a stream 
 near at hand, though this was against the 
 custom of the ntonjane. When they came out 
 of the water, they saw a snake with black 
 blotches, called the Isinyobolokondwana, near 
 their clothes. They were very much afraid, 
 and did not know what to do at first. But by- 
 and-by one of them commenced to sing these 
 words : 
 
 *• Sinyobolokondwana, 
 Sinyobolokondwana, 
 Bring my mantle ! "

STORV OF A CHIEFS DAUGHTER. 
 
 (¦>'¦> 
 
 The snake replied : 
 
 " Take it, 
 And pass on." 
 
 The companions of the chief's daughter, one 
 after the other, asked the snake for their 
 mantles in this manner, and obtained per- 
 mission to take them. Last of all was the 
 chiefs daughter. But instead of speaking to 
 the snake respectfully as the others had done, 
 she said mockingly, ** Ngcingcingci, ngcingci- 
 ngci." * So the snake became very angry, and 
 bit her, when she immediately became of the 
 same hideous colour as it was. Her com- 
 panions were so frightened that they left her 
 and ran away home. They put another girl 
 in the hut, and pretended that she was the 
 chief's daughter. The girl, thus left alone, 
 went to a forest close by, and climbed up a tree 
 to hide herself. 
 
 About this time the chief was killinqr an ox 
 on account of his daughter, and so he sent a 
 young man to the forest to get pieces of wood 
 with which to peg out the skin. The young 
 man was cutting sticks, when he heard some 
 one crying : " Man cutting sticks, tell my 
 father and mother that the sinyobolokondwana 
 
 * Words without meaning, but used to express contempt, 
 being merely a repetition of the sound ngci.

 bit me." He heard this repeated twice, and, 
 without lookinj^ to see what was crying, he ran 
 home and told the chief. Two young men 
 were then sent back with him to see what it 
 was, one of these happening to be the girl's 
 brother. These two were told to hide them- 
 selves and listen while the other cut the sticks. 
 They did so, and heard the voice crying as 
 Ipefore. Then the brother of the girl knew 
 the voice of his sister, and they all went to the 
 tree where she was, and took her home with 
 them. 
 
 The chief was very much surprised to see 
 his daughter in that state, and was so angry 
 with her companions for taking her to the river, 
 and then for substituting another girl so as to 
 deceive him, that he caused them all to be 
 killed. 
 
 Then he sent some of his men with forty 
 cattle to take his daughter to a distant country, 
 where she was to remain far away from him. 
 They did as they were told, and built huts in 
 that place lo live in. After they had been 
 there a long time, they found that the cows 
 which the chief sent with them were giving 
 more milk than they could consume, so they 
 poured what was left in a hole in the ground. 
 To their amazement, the milk rose, and rose.

 and rose, higher and still higher, till at last it 
 stood up out of the ground like a great over- 
 hanging rock. They called the girl to see this 
 wonderful thing that was happening. In her 
 curiosity she went close to the precipice, when 
 it fell down on her, and, as the milk ran over 
 her, all her ugly blotched skin disappeared, and 
 she was again beautiful as at first. 
 
 Soon afterwards a young chief who was pass- 
 ing by saw the girl, and fell in love with her. 
 He thought she was the daughter of one of 
 the men who were there to protect her, but 
 when he made inquiries they told him she was 
 the daughter of their chief. Then he went to 
 her father, and some of the men went also to 
 tell how the milk had cured the girl. The 
 young chief had very many cattle, which he 
 offered to her father. So the old chief agreed 
 to let him marry the girl, and she became his 
 great wife, and was loved by him very dearly.

 THE STORY OF SIMBUKUMBUKWANA. 
 
 'IlI'2Rr'' was a man whose wife hud no 
 children, so that he was much dissatis- 
 fied. At last he went to a wise woman 
 (lg(/irakazi) and asked her to help him 
 in this matter. She said : " You must 
 brmir me a fat calf that I may ^et its tallow 
 to use with my medicine " (or charms — the 
 Kaffir word is I))iijizi\ The man went home 
 and selected a calf without horns or tail, which 
 he took to the wise woman. She said : '* Your 
 wife will have a son who will have no arms 
 and no le^s, as this calf has no horns and no 
 tail." She told him, further, that he was not 
 to inform any one of this. 
 
 The man returned to his home and told his 
 friends what was to happen. Not long after 
 this his wife bore a child, but it was a daughter 
 and had arms and legs. The man would not

 own that child, he said it was not his. He 
 beat his wife, and commanded her to take the 
 child away and leave it to perish. Then he 
 went to the wise woman, and told her what had 
 taken place. The wise woman said : " It was 
 because you did not obey my command about 
 keepinir this matter to yourself, but your wife 
 will yet have a son without arms and without 
 legs." 
 
 It was so. His wife bore another child, 
 which was a boy without arms and without 
 legs, therefore he was called Simbukumbu- 
 kwana. He began to speak on the day of his 
 birth. During this time the girl that was first 
 born was growing up in the valley where her 
 mother left her; she lived in a hole in an 
 ant-heap, and ate honey, and " nongwes," and 
 gum. 
 
 One day the mother of Simbukuml)ukwana 
 went to work in her garden, and left the boy 
 at home with the door fastened. While she 
 was away the girl came ; she stood at a dis- 
 tance and said : " Where arc the people ? " 
 
 There came a voice from inside which said : 
 " Here am I." 
 
 She said : " Who are you ? " 
 
 The voice replied: "I am Simbukumbu-

 She said : " Open for me." 
 
 He answered : " How can I open ? I have

 She said : "My mother's Simbukumbukwana, 
 have legs and arms " (Shnbtikumbukwana sika- 
 ina, yiba nemilenze nemikono). 
 
 Then legs and arms came on the boy, and 
 he arose and opened for his sister. She went 
 in and swept the floor ; then she took millet 
 and ground it and made bread. She told her 
 brother when his parents asked him who did 
 these things to say that he did them himself, 
 and if they should ask him to do them again 
 to reply, " I have done it already." Then she 
 said : " My mother's Simbukumbukwana, sink 
 legs and sink arms" (Simbuhimbukwana 
 sikatfia, tsliona v'ilenze tshona mikono). Then 
 his legs and arms shrunk up, and his sister 
 went away. 
 
 After a time his father and his mother came 
 home ; they went in and saw the clean floor 
 and bread ready for eating. They were sur- 
 prised, and said to Simbukumbukwana, " Who 
 did this } " 
 
 He replied : " I did." 
 
 They said : '* Do so again that we may see 
 you." 
 
 He answered : " I have done it already."

 The next day the woman went again to 
 work in her garden, but the man hid himself to 
 watch what would happen. After a time came 
 the sister of Simbukumbukwana and said : 
 " Where are the people ? " (Exactly the same 
 conversation as before.) She went in and 
 began to smear the floor ; water was wanting, 
 so she sent Simbukumbukwana to the river 
 for some. His joy in walking was great, so 
 that he did not stop at the river, but put the 
 pot down there and continued to go forward. 
 The girl thought he ought not to be so long 
 absent, for the river was close by, so she went 
 to look for him. She saw him walking up a 
 hill far away, and she called to him to return. 
 He would not. Then she sang, Si})ibukumbu- 
 kwana sikama, tshona milcnze, tshona mikono, 
 and immediately his legs shrank up. Then 
 she was going away, but her father came out 
 and caught her ; he kissed her, and said she 
 must remain with him. 
 
 Her mother was coming home, when she saw 
 something moving on the hillside. She went 
 to see what it was, and found her son. She 
 said : " How did you come horc ? " 
 He replied : " I came by myself." 
 She said : " Let me see you go further. '

 His sister compelled him to sit down ; but as 
 soon as they went on, he followed ; then his 
 sister beat him, and left him in the path. 
 After that there was a heavy storm of rain, 
 but none fell where the little boy was. When

 THE STORY OF SIKULUME. 
 
 HERE was once in a certain village an 
 old man who was very poor. He had 
 no children, and only a few cattle. One 
 day, when the sky was clear and the sun 
 wr*^ bright, he sat down by the cattle-fold. 
 While he was sitting there, he noticed some 
 birds close by which were si .ging very joy- 
 fully. He listened for a while, and then he 
 stood up to observe them better. They were 
 very beautiful to look upon, and they sang 
 differently from other birds. They had all 
 long tails and topknots on their heads. Then 
 the old man went to the chief and told him 
 what he had seen. 
 
 The < hief -viid : "How many were they ? " 
 The old rian replied : " There were seven." 
 The chief oaiJ : ** You have acted wisely in 
 coming to tell me ; you shall have seven of the

 fattest of my cows. I have lost seven sons in 
 battle, and these beautiful birds shall be in the 
 place of my seven sons. You must not sleep 
 to-night, you must watch them, and to-morrow 
 I will choose seven boys to catch them. Do 
 not let them out of your sight by any means." 
 
 In the morning the chief ordered all the 
 boys of the village to be assembled at the 
 cattle-fold, when he spoke to them of the birds. 
 He said : ** I will choose six of you, and set my 
 son who is dumb over you, that will make 
 seven in all. You must catch those birds. 
 Wherever they go, you must follow, and you 
 must not see my face again without them." 
 He gave them weapons, and instructed them 
 that if any one opposed them they were to 
 fight till the last of them died. 
 
 The boys set off to follow those beautiful 
 birds. They ch; 3ed them for several days, till 
 at last the birds were exhausted, when each 
 of the boys caught one. At the place where 
 they caught the birds they remained that 
 night. 
 
 On the morning of the next day they set out 
 on their return home. That evening they 
 came to a hut in which they saw a fire burning, 
 but no one was there. They went in, and lay 
 down to sleep. In the middle of the night one

 of those boys was awake. He heard some one 
 saying : " There is nice meat here. I will 
 begin with this one, and take this one next, 
 and that one after, and the one with small feet 
 the last." The one with the small feet was 
 the son of the chief. His name was Sikulume, 
 for he had never been able to speak till he 
 caught the bird. Then he began to talk at 
 once. 
 
 After Faying those words the voice was still. 
 Then the boy awakened his companions, and 
 told them what he had heard. 
 
 They said : " You have been dreaming ; there 
 is no one here ; how can such a thing be ? " 
 
 He replied : " I did not dream ; I spoke the 
 truth." 
 
 Then they made a plan that one should 
 remain awake, and if anything happened, he 
 should pinch the one next him, and that one 
 should pinch the next, till all were awake. 
 
 After a while the boy who was listening 
 heard some one come in quietly. That was a 
 cannibal. He said the same words again, and 
 then went out for the purpose of calling his 
 friends to come to the feast. The boy 
 awakened his companions according to the 
 plan agreed upon, so that they all heard what 
 was said. Therefore, as soon as the cannibal

 went out, they arose and fled from that place. 
 The cannibal came back with his friends, and 
 when the others saw there was no one in the 
 hut, they killed and ate him. 
 
 As they were going on, Sikulume saw that 
 he had left his bird behind. He stood, and 
 said : " I must return for my bird, my beautiful 
 bird with the long tail and topknot on its head. 
 My father commanded that I must not see his 
 face aofain unless I brinor the bird." 
 
 The boys said: " Take one of ours. Why 
 should )'ou go where cannibals are ? " 
 
 He replied : " I must have the one that is

 He stuck his assagai in the ground, and told 
 them to look at it. He said : " If it stands still, 
 you will know I am safe ; if it shakes, you will 
 know I am running ; if it falls down, you will 
 know I am dead." Then he left them to return 
 to the hut of the cannibals. 
 
 On the way he saw an old woman sitting by 
 a big stone. She said : " Where are you going 
 to .'*" He told her he was going for his bird. 
 The old woman gave him some fat, and said : 
 "If the cannibals pursue you, put some of this 
 on a stone." 
 
 He came to the hut and got his bird. The 
 cannibals were sitting outside, a little way back.

 They had just finished eating the owner of the 
 hut. When SikuUime came out with his bird 
 they saw him and ran after him. They were 
 close to him, when he took some of the fat and 
 threw it on a stone. The cannibals came to 
 the stone, and began to fight with each other. 
 
 One said : " The stone is mine." 
 
 Another said : " It is mine." 
 
 One of them swallowed the stone. When 
 the others saw that, they killed him and ate 
 him. Then they pursued again after Sikulume. 
 They came close to him again, when he threw 
 the remainder of the fat on another stone. The 
 cannibals fought for this also. One swallowed 
 it, and was killed by the others. 
 
 They followed still, and Sikulume was almost 
 in their hands, when he thre»v off his mantle. 
 The mantle commenced to run another way, 
 and the cannibals ran after it. It was so long 
 before they caught it that the young chief had 
 time to reach his companions. 
 
 They all went on their way, but very soon 
 they saw the cannibals coming after them. 
 Then they observed a little man sitting by a 
 big stone. 
 
 He said to them : " I can turn this stone into 
 a hut." 
 
 They replied : " Do so."

 He turned the stone into a hut, and they all 
 went inside, the little man with them. They 
 played the " iceya " there. The cannibals came 
 to the place and smelt. They thought the hut 
 was still a stone, for it looked like a stone to 
 them. They began to bite it, and bit till all 
 their teeth were broken, when they returned to 
 their own village. 
 
 After this, the boys and the little man came 
 out. 
 
 The boys went on. When they reached 
 their own home they saw no people, till at 
 length an old woman crept out of a heap of 
 ashes. She was very much frightened, and 
 said to them : "I thought there were no people 
 left." 
 
 Sikulume said : " Where is my father } " 
 
 She replied : " All the people have been 
 swallowed by the inabulele " (a fabulous mon- 
 ster). 
 
 He said : " Where did it go to ? " 
 
 The old woman replied : " It went to the 
 river. 
 
 So those boys went to the river, and Siku- 
 lume said to them : " I will go into the water, 
 and take an assagai with me. If the water 
 moves much, you will know I am in the 
 stomach of the inabulele ; if the water is red.

 you will know I have killed it." Then he 
 threw himself into the water and went down. 
 
 The inabulele swallowed him without tearing 
 him or hurting him. He saw his father and 
 his mother and many people and cattle. Then 
 he took his assagai and pierced the inabulele 
 from inside. The water moved till the inabu- 
 lele was dead, then it became red. When the 
 young men saw that, they cut a big hole in the 
 side of the inabulele, and all the people and the 
 cattle were delivered. 
 
 One day Sikulume said to another boy : " I 
 am going to be circumcised ; tell my sister to 
 cook food for me, nice food that I may eat." 
 This was done. 
 
 He said to his sister : " Bring me of the 
 
 skin of the inabulele which I killed, to make 
 
 a mantle." She called her companions, and 
 
 they went to the side of the river. She sang 
 
 this song : — 
 
 " Inabulele, 
 Inabulele, 
 I am sent for you 
 By Sikulume, 
 Inabulele." 
 
 The body of the inabulele then came out. 
 She cut two little pieces of the skin for sandals, 
 and a large piece to make a mantle for her 
 brother.

 When he was a young man, Sikulume said 
 to his friends : "I am going to marry the 
 daughter of Mangangezulu." 
 
 They replied : " You must not go there, for 
 at Mangangezulu's you will be killed." 
 
 He said : " I will go." 
 
 Then he called those young men who were 
 circumcised with him to accompany him. On 
 the way they came to a place where the grass 
 was long. A mouse came out of the grass, and 
 asked Sikulume where he was going to. 
 
 He replied : " I am going to the place of 
 Mangangezulu." 
 
 The mouse sang this song : — 
 
 " Turn back, turn back, Sikulume. 
 No one ever leaves the place of Mangangezulu. 
 Turn back, turn back, O chief." 
 
 Sikulume replied : " I shall not turn back." 
 
 The mouse then said : " As it is so, you must 
 kill me and throw my skin up in the air." 
 
 He did so. 
 
 The skin said : ** You must not enter by the 
 front of the village ; you must not eat off a new 
 mat ; you must not sleep in a hut which has 
 nothing in it." 
 
 They arrived at the village of Mangangezulu. 
 They entered it from the wrong side, so that 
 all the people said : " Why is this ? "

 They replied : " It is our custom." 
 
 Food was brought to them on a new mat, 
 but they said : " It is our custom to eat off old 
 mats only." 
 
 An empty hut was given to them to sleep 
 in, but they said : *' It is our custom only to 
 sleep in a hut that has things in it." 
 
 The next day the chief said to Sikulume and 
 his companions : " You must go and tend the 
 cattle." 
 
 They went. A storm of rain fell, when 
 Sikulume spread out his mantle and it became 
 a hut as hard as stone, into which they all went. 
 In the evening they returned with the cattle. 
 The daughter of Mangangezulu came to them. 
 Her mother pressed her foot in the footprint 
 of Sikulume, and he became an eland. 
 
 The girl loved the young chief very much. 
 When she saw he was turned into an eland, she 
 made a great fire and drove him into it. Then 
 he was burned, and became a little coal. She 
 took the coal out and put it in a pot of water, 
 when it became a young man again. 
 
 Afterwards they left that place. The girl 
 took with her an ^gg, a milksack, a pot, and 
 a smooth stone. The father of the girl pursued 
 thepi. 
 
 The girl threw down the ^gg, and it became

 a mist. Her father wandered about in the mist 
 a long time, till at length it cleared away. 
 Then he pursued again. 
 
 She threw down the milksack, and it became 
 a sheet of water. Her father tried to get rid 
 of the water by dipping it up with a calabash, 
 but he could not succeed, so he was compelled 
 to wait till it dried up. He followed still. 
 
 The girl threw down the pot, and it became 
 thick darkness. He waited a long time till 
 light came again, when he followed them. He 
 could travel very quickly. 
 
 He came close to them, and then the girl 
 threw down the smooth stone. It became a 
 rock, a big rock with one side steep like a wall. 
 He could not climb up that rock, and so he 
 returned to his own village. 
 
 Then Sikulume went home with his wife. 
 He said to the people : " This is the daughter 
 of Mangangezulu. You advised me not to 
 go there, lest I should be killed. Here is 
 my wife." 
 
 After that he became a great chief. All the 
 people said : " There is no chief that can do 
 such things as Sikulume."

 I Wmh with many women in it. All the wo- 
 
 ^ ^ men had children at the same time 
 except the wife of the chief. The children 
 grew, and again all the women gave birth 
 to others. Only the wife of the chief had no 
 child. Then the people said : " Let us kill an 
 ox, perhaps the wife of the chief will then bear 
 a child." 
 
 While they were killing the ox, the woman 
 heard a voice saying : " Bear me, mother, before 
 the meat of my father is all finished." 
 
 The woman did not pay any attention to 
 that, thinking it was a ringing m her ears. 
 The voice said again : " Bear me, mother, 
 before the meat of my father is all finished." 
 
 The woman took a small piece of wood and 
 cleaned her ears. She heard that voice again.

 Then she became excited. She said : " There 
 is something in my ears ; I would like to know 
 what it is. I have just now cleaned my ears." 
 
 The voice said again : *' Make haste and 
 bear me, mother, before the meat of my father 
 is all finished." 
 
 The woman said : " What is this ? there was 
 never a child that could speak before it was 
 born." 
 
 The voice said again : " Bear me, mother, as 
 all my father's cattle are being finished, and I 
 have not yet eaten anything of them." Then 
 the woman gave birth to that child. 
 
 When she saw that to which she had given 
 birth, she was very much astonished. It was a 
 boy, but in size very little, and with a face that 
 looked like that of an old person. 
 
 He said to his mother : " Mother, give me 
 a skin robe." His mother gave him a robe. 
 Then he went at once to the kraal where the 
 ox was being killed. 
 
 He asked for some meat, saying : " Father, 
 father, give me a piece of meat." 
 
 The chief was astonished to hear this child 
 calling him father. He said : " Oh, men, what 
 thinof is this that calls me father } " So he 
 continued with the skinning of the ox. But

 from him. The chief became very angry, and 
 pushed him, and said : " Get away from this 
 place." 
 
 Hlakanyana answered : " I am your child, 
 give me meat.' 
 
 The chief took a little stick, and said : " If 
 you trouble me again, I will strike you with 
 this." 
 
 Hlakanyana replied : " Give me meat first, 
 and I will go away;" but the chief would not 
 answer, because he was very angry. 
 
 Hlakanyana continued asking. Then the 
 chief threw him outside the kraal, and went on 
 with his work. After a litt;e time, the child 
 returned, still asking. 
 
 So the chief said to the men that were with 
 him : " What strange thing is this ? " 
 
 The men replied : "We don't knov/ hi.i at 
 all." 
 
 The chief asked of them also advice, saying : 
 " What shall I do ? " 
 
 The men replied : " Give him a piece of 
 meat." 
 
 So the chief cut off a piece of meat and gave 
 it to him. Hlakanyana ran to his mother and 
 gave the meat to her to be cooked. 
 
 Then he returned to his father, and said 
 again : " Father, give me some meat."

 The chief just took him and trampled upon 
 him, and threw him outside of the kraal, think- 
 ing that he was dead. 
 
 But he rose again and returned to his father^ 
 still saying : '* Father, give me some meat." 
 
 Then the chief thought to get rid of him by 
 giving him meat again. The chief gave him a 
 piece of liver. Hlakanyana threw it away. 
 Fat was then given to him. He put it down 
 on one side. Flesh was then given to him, and 
 a bone with much marrow in it. 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " I am a man to-day." 
 He said : " This is the beginning of my father's 
 catde." 
 
 At this time the men were saying to each 
 other : " Who will carry the meat to our 
 huts ? " 
 
 Hlakanyana answered : " I will do it." 
 
 They said : " How can such a thing as you 
 are carry meat .-^ " 
 
 Hlakanyana replied : " I am stronger than 
 you ; just see if you can lift this piece of meat." 
 
 The men tried, but could not lift it. Then 
 Hlakanyana took the piece of meat and carried 
 it out of the kraal. The men said : *' That 
 will do now, carry our meat for us." 
 
 Hlakanyana took the meat and carried it to

 put it on the eating mats at the houses of the 
 men. The men went to their houses, and said : 
 " Where is our meat ? " They called Hlakan- 
 yana, and asked him what he had done with 
 the meat. 
 
 He replied : " Surely I put it here where the 
 blood is. It must have been taken by the 
 dogs. Surely the dogs have eaten it." 
 
 Then those men beat the women and chil- 
 dren because they did not watch that the dogs 
 did not take the meat. As for Hlakanyana, he 
 only delighted in this trick of his. He was 
 more cunning than any of the old men. 
 
 Hlakanyana said to his mother, that she 
 must put the meat in the pot to cook, but that 
 it must not be eaten before the next morning. 
 It was done. In the night this cunning little 
 fellow rose and went to the pot. His mother 
 heard something at the pot, and struck with 
 a stick. Hlakanyana cried like a dog. His 
 mother said : "Surely a dog is eating the meat." 
 Hlakanyana returned afterwards, and left 
 nothing but bones in the pot. In the morning 
 he asked his mother for meat. His mother 
 went to the pot, and found nothing but bones. 
 The cunning little fellow pretended to be as- 
 tonished. 
 
 He said : " Where is the meat, mother ? "

 His mother replied : " It has been eaten by 
 a dog." 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " As that is so, give me 
 the bones, for you who are the wife of the chief 
 will not eat from the same pot with a dog." 
 
 His mother gave him the bones. 
 
 Hlakanyana went to sleep in the same house 
 with the boys. The boys were unwilling to 
 let him sleep with them. They laughed at 
 him. 
 
 They said : " Who are you ? You are just 
 a child of a few days." 
 
 Hlakanyana answered : " I am older than 
 you." 
 
 He slept there that night. When the boys 
 were asleep, he got up and went to the catde 
 kraal. He killed two C( \vs and ate all their 
 insides. He took blood a >meared it on one 
 of the boys who was sleepin^^ In the morning 
 the men found those two dead cows. 
 
 They said : " Who has done this thing ? " 
 
 They found the boy with blood upon him, 
 and killed him, because they thought he was 
 the robber. 
 
 Hlakanyana said within himself : ** I told 
 them that I was older than they are ; to-day it 
 is seen who is a child and who is a man."

 an ox. The head was put in a pot to be 
 cooked. Then Hlakanyana considered in his 
 mind how he could get that meat. So he 
 drove all the cattle of the village into a forest, 
 a very thick forest, and tied them by their tails 
 to the trees. After that he cut his arms, and 
 legs, and breast, with a sharp stone, and stood 
 on a hill, and cried out with a loud voice : 
 " The enemy has taken our cattle ; the cattle 
 are being driven away. Come up, come up ; 
 there is an army going away with the cattle." 
 
 The men ran quickly to him. 
 
 He said to them : "Why are you eating meat 
 while the enemy is going away with the cattle ? 
 I was fighting with them ; just look at my 
 body." 
 
 They saw he was covered with blood, and 
 they believed it was as he said. So the men 
 took their assagais and ran after the cattle, but 
 they took the wrong way. 
 
 Only one old man and Hlakanyana were left 
 behind. 
 
 Then Hlakanyana said to the old man : " I 
 am very tired with fighting ; just go to the 
 river, grandfather, and get some water." 
 
 The old man went ; and as soon as he was 
 alone, Hlakanyana ate the meat which was in 
 the pot. When the old man returned with the

 water he was very tired, for the river was far 
 for an old man to go to, therefore he fell asleep. 
 When he was sleeping, Hlakanyana took a bone 
 and put it beside the old man. He also took 
 some fat and put it on the mouth of the old 
 man. Then he ran to the forest and loosened 
 the cattle that were tied by the tails. 
 
 At this time the men were returning from 
 seeking the enemy. Hlakanyana was coming 
 also from the other side with the cattle. 
 
 He shouted : " I have conquered the enemy." 
 He also said : " The meat must be eaten now." 
 
 When they opened the pot they found no 
 meat. They found only dung, for Hlakanyana 
 had filled the pot with dung. 
 
 Then the men said : " Who has done this ? " 
 
 Hlakanyana answered : " It must be the old 
 man who is sleeping there." 
 
 They looked, and saw the bone by the side 
 of the old man, and the fat on his mouth. 
 Then they said : *' This is the thief." They 
 were intending to kill the old man because he 
 had stolen the meat of the chief. 
 
 When the children saw that the old man was 
 to be killed, they said that he did not eat the 
 meat of the chief. 
 
 The men said : " We saw fat on his mouth 
 and a bone beside him."

 The children replied : " He did not do it." 
 
 The men said : " Tell us who did it." 
 
 The children answered : " Hlakanyana ate 
 the meat and put dung in the pot. We were 
 concealed, and we saw him do it." 
 
 Hlakanyana denied. He said : " Let me go 
 and ask the women ; perhaps they saw who ate 
 the meat of the chief." 
 
 The men sent a young man with him to the 
 women ; but when thr^y were a short distance 
 away, Hlakanyana escaped. 
 
 The chief sent an army after him. The 
 army pursued, and saw Hlakanyana sitting by 
 a bush. They ran to catch him. When they 
 came to the bush, only an old woman was 
 sitting there. 
 
 They said to her: " Where is Hlakanyana ? " 
 
 The old woman replied : *' He just went 
 across that river. See, you must make haste 
 to follow him, for the river is rising." 
 
 The army passed over the river quickly. 
 Then that old woman turned into Hlakanyana 
 again. He said in himself : " I will now go 
 on a journey, for I am wiser than the coun- 
 cillors of my father, I being older than they." 
 
 The little cunning fellow went to a village, 
 where he saw an old woman sitting beside her 
 
 house.

 He said to her : " Would you like to be made 
 young, grandmother ? " 
 
 The old woman replied : *' Yes, my grand- 
 child ; if you could make me young, I would 
 be very glad." 
 
 Hlakanyana said : ** Take that pot, grand- 
 mother, and go for some water." 
 
 The old woman replied : " I cannot walk." 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " Just try, grandmother ; 
 the river is close by, and perhaps you will be 
 able to reach it." 
 
 The old woman limped along and got the 
 water. 
 
 Then Hlakanyana took a large pot and set 
 it on the fire, and poured the water into it. 
 
 He said to the old woman : " You must cook 
 me a little first, and then I will cook you a 
 little." 
 
 The old woman agreed to that. Hlakan- 
 yana was the first to be put in the pot. When 
 the water began to get hot, he said : ** Take 
 me out, grandmother ; I am in long enough." 
 
 The old woman took him out, and went in 
 the pot for her turn. Soon she said : " Take 
 me out now, my grandchild ; I am in long 
 enough."

 So the old woman died in the pot. 
 
 Hlakanyana took all the bones of the old 
 woman and threw them away. He left only 
 the toes and the fingers. Then he took the 
 clothing of the old woman and pu; it on. The 
 two sons of this old woman came from hunting. 
 
 They went into the hut, and said : " Whose 
 meat is this in the pot ? " 
 
 Hlakanyana was lying down. He said in 
 a voice like that of their mother : " It is yours, 
 my sons." 
 
 While they were eating, the younger one 
 said : '* Look at this, it is like the toe of 
 mother." 
 
 The elder one said : " How can you say such 
 a thing ? Did not mother give us this meat to 
 eat ? " 
 
 Again the younger one said : " Look at this, 
 it is like the finger of mother." 
 
 Hlakanyana said: "You are speaking evil 
 of me, my son." 
 
 Hlakanyana said in himself: " I shall.be dis- 
 covered ; it is time for me to flee." So he 
 slipped quietly out of the house and went on his 
 way. When he got a little way off, he called 
 out : " You are eating your mother. Did any 
 one ever see people eating their mother be- 
 fore ? "

THE STORY OF HLAKANYANA.

 The two young men took their assagais and 
 ran after him with their dogs. They came to 
 the river ; it was full. 
 
 The cunning fellow changed himself into 
 a little round stone. One of the young men 
 picked up this stone, saying : " If I could see 
 him, I would just throw this stone at him." 
 The young man threw t.he stone over the river, 
 and it turned into Hlakanyana again. He just 
 laughed at those young men. 
 
 Hlakanyana went on his way. He was sing- 
 ing this song : — 
 
 Ndahlangana Nonothloya. 
 
 Sapekapekana, 
 
 Ndagwanya, 
 
 Wapekwa wada wavutwa. 
 
 I met with Nonothloya. 
 We cooked each other, 
 I was half cooked, 
 She was well cooked. 
 
 Hlakanyana met a boy tending some goats. 
 The boy had a digging- stick with him. 
 Hlakanyana proposed that they should pursue 
 after birds, and the boy agreed. They pursued 
 birds the whole day. 
 
 In the evening, when the sun set, Hlakanyana 
 said : " It is time now to roast our birds," 
 
 The place was on the bank of a river. 
 
 Hlakanyana said : "We must go under the 
 water and see who will come out last." 
 
 They went under the water, and Hlakanyana 
 came out last.

 The cunning fellow said : " Let us try again." 
 
 The boy agreed to that. They went under 
 the water. Hlakanyana came out quickly and 
 ate all the birds. He left the heads only. 
 Then he went under the water again. The 
 boy came out while he was still under the 
 water. 
 
 When Hlakanyana came out he said : " Let 
 us go now and eat our birds." 
 
 They found all the birds eaten. 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " You have eaten them, 
 because you came out of the water first, and 
 you have left me the heads only." 
 
 The boy denied having done so, but Hla- 
 kanyana said : '* You must pay for my birds 
 with that digging-stick." 
 
 The boy gave the digging-stick, and Hla- 
 kanyana went on his way. 
 
 He saw some people making pots of clay. 
 He said to them : " Why do you not ask me to 
 lend you this digging-stick, instead of digging 
 with your hands ?" 
 
 They said : ** Lend it to us." 
 
 Hlakanyana lent them the digging-stick. 
 Just the first time they stuck it in the clay it 
 broke. 
 
 He said: "You have broken my digging-

 They gave him a pot. 
 
 Hlakanyana carried the pot till he came to 
 some boys who were herding goats. He said 
 to them : " You foolish boys, you only suck the 
 goats, you don't milk them in any vessel ; why 
 don't you ask me to lend you this pot 1 " 
 
 The boys said : '* Lend it to us." 
 
 Hlakanyana lent them the pot. While the 
 boys were milking, the pot broke. Hlakanyana 
 said : " You have broken my pot, the pot that 
 I received from the people who make pots, the 
 people who broke my digging-stick, the dig- 
 ging-stick that I received from my companion,

 The boys gave him a goat. 
 
 Hlakanyana came to the keepers of calves. 
 
 He said to them : " You foolish fellows, you 
 only sit here and eat nothing. Why don't you 
 ask me to let you suck this goat ?" 
 
 The keepers of calves said : " Allow us to 
 suck this goat." 
 
 Hlakanyana gave the goat into their hands. 
 While they were sucking, the goat died.

 Hlakanyana came to the keepers of cows. 
 
 He said to them : " You only suck the cows 
 without letting the calf suck first. Why don't 
 you ask me to lend you this calf, that the cows 
 may be induced to give their milk freely ?" 
 
 They said : " Lend us the calf." 
 
 Hlakanyana permitted them to take the calf. 
 While the calf was in their hands it died. 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " \ ou have killed my

 They picked up kernes there. 
 
 Then they reached another place, and Hla-

 They threw the kerries away. 
 
 Again they came to another place, and 
 Hlakanyana said : " This is the place for

 The companion of Hlakanyana threw his 
 spoon away, but the cunning little fellow only 
 pretended to throw his away. In fact, he con- 
 cealed his spoon. They went on. 
 
 They came to another place, and Hla- 
 kanyana said : ** This is the place for throwing

 It happened again as with the spoons. 
 Hlakanyana concealed his knife, when his com-

 of pedestrians). 
 
 His companion threw his isilanda away, but 
 Hlakanyana kept his. They went on and 
 reached a place where they had to walk on 
 thorns. Afterwards they looked at their feet, 
 and saw many thorns in them. 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " Let us sit down and 
 take out the thorns." 
 
 His companion replied : " I cannot do so, 
 because I have no isilanda." 
 
 Then Hlakanyana took the thorns out of 
 his feet, and the other was obliged to walk 
 lame. They came to a village. 
 
 The people said to them : " Tell us the

 Hlakanyana replied : "Just give us some- 
 thing to eat first; look at our stomachs and 
 behold the pinchings of hunger." 
 
 The people of that village brought meat. 
 
 Hlakanyana said to his companion : " Now 
 let us eat." 
 
 The companion of Hlakanyana answered : 
 " I have no knife." 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " You are just a child ; I 
 shall not lend you my knife." 
 
 The people of that village brought millet and 
 put before them.

 So Hlakanyana had all the meat and the 
 millet to himself. 
 
 Hlakanyana met a girl herding some goats. 
 
 He sr'd: "Where are the boys of your 
 village, that the goats are herded by a girl ? " 
 
 The girl answered : " There are no boys in 
 the villaofe." 
 
 He went to the father of the girl and said : 
 " You nmst give me your daughter to be my 
 concubine, and I will herd th'^ goats." 
 
 The father of the girl agreed to that. Then 
 Hlakanyana went with the goats, and every 
 day he killed one and ate it till all were done. 
 He scratched his body with thorns. 
 
 The father of the girl said : " Where are all 
 the goats ? " 
 
 Hlakanyana replied : " Can you not see how 
 I have been fighting with the wild dogs ? The 
 wild dogs have eaten the goats. As for me, I 
 will stay here no longer." 
 
 So he went on his way. ' • 
 
 As he was going on, he saw a trap for

 HIakanyana took the birds out and ate them. 
 The owners of the trap were cannibals. They 
 saw the footprints of HIakanyana, and said : 
 " This is a little bo^' '^— *¦ is stealing our birds." 
 They watched for liim. HIakanyana came 
 again to the trap and saw a bird caught in it. 
 He was just going to take the bird out when 
 the cannibals caught him. They made a big 
 fire and put a pot on for the purpose of cooking 
 him. HIakanyana saw two oxen. One was 
 white, the other was red. 
 
 He said to the cannibals : " You can take 
 which one of these oxen you like instead of 
 
 me. 
 
 >> 
 
 The cannibals said : " We will take the white 
 one, because it is white inside also." 
 
 Then HIakanyana went away with the red 
 ox. The cannibals ate the white ox, and then 
 pursued after HIakanyana. They came up to 
 him by a big stone. He jumped on the stone, 
 and sang this song : — 
 
 Ndahamba ndayakuva indaba I went to hear the news, 
 Zeinvula ku mankazana. About rain from the girls. 
 
 The cannibals began to dance when they 
 heard him sing. Then he ran away, and the 
 stone continued to sing that song.

 a place where some baboons were feasting. 
 He asked them for some food. 
 
 The baboons replied : '* If you will go for 
 some water for us, we will give you food." 
 
 He agreed to that. When he returned with 
 the water, the baboons refused to give him 
 food. Then Hlakanyana shouted loudly and 
 said : ** At my village there is a marriage of 
 baboons to-day." 
 
 When the baboons heard that they fled, old 
 and young. So Hlakanyana remained there, 
 and ate all the food. 
 
 As he was going along, he saw a hyena 
 building a house, having cooked some meat. 
 Hlakanyana asked the hyena to give him 
 some. 
 
 The hyena said : " No, I will not give you 
 any; it is too little even for me." 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " Will you not have me 
 to assist in building ? " 
 
 The hyena replied : " I would have you 
 without delay if you are intending to help me." 
 
 While they were fastening the thatch, Hla- 
 kanyana sewed the hair of the tail of the hyena 
 fast. Then he took the pot and sat down. 
 
 The hyena said : " Let that pot alone, Hla- 
 kanyana." 
 
 He replied : " I am going to eat. now."

 The hyena wanted to come down, but he 
 found his tail was fast. Hlakanyana ate all the 
 meat, and threw the bones at the hyena. The 
 hyena tried to frighten him by saying there 
 were many hyenas coming quickly to devour 
 him. He just answered : " That is false ; " and 
 continued eating till the meat was finished. 
 Then he went on his way. 
 
 Hlakanyana came to a river. He saw an 
 iguana that was playing on an ugwali (a simple 
 musical instrument). 
 
 Hlakanyana said to the iguana : '' Lend me 
 your ugwali for a little, please." 
 
 The iguana said : "No, you will run away 
 with my ugwali." 
 
 Hlakanyana replied : "How can I run away 
 with : thing that is not mine ? " 
 
 So the iguana lent him the ugwali. When 
 Hlakanyana saw that he could play upon the 
 instrument nicely, he ran away with it. The 
 iguana pursued him. Then Hlakanyana 
 changed himself into a rush. The iguana took 
 that rush and threw it across the river, saying : 
 " If I could only see him, I would throw him 
 like this." Then the rush turned to be Hla- 
 kanyana again, and he went on his way playing 
 on the ugwali of the iguana. 
 
 Hlakanyana came to the house of a leopar-

 dcss. He proposed to take care of her 
 children while the leopardess went to hunt 
 animals. The leopardess agreed to that. 
 There were four cubs. After the leopardess 
 had gone to hunt, Hlakanyana took one of the 
 cubs and ate it. 
 
 At the time for giving food, the leopardess 
 came back and said : " Give me my children 
 that I may suckle them." 
 
 Hlakanyana gave one. 
 
 The mother said : ** Give all at once." 
 
 Hlakanyana replied : *• It is better that one 
 should drink and then another." 
 
 The leopardess agreed to that. After three 
 had drunk he gave the first one back the 
 second time. Then the leopardess went to hunt 
 again. 
 
 Hlakanyana took another of the cubs and 
 ate it. He also made the door of the house 
 very small so that the mother of the cubs could 
 not come in, and then he made a little hole in 
 the ground at the back so that he could go 
 out. The next day the leopardess came to give 
 her children suck. There were only two left 
 now. Hlakanyana gave them both back the 
 second time. After that the leopardess went 
 away as before.

 only one was left. When the mother came, he 
 gave this one four times. When he gave it the 
 last time the leopardess said : " Why does my 
 child not drink to-day ? " It was already full, 
 and did not want to drink more. 
 
 Hlakanyana replied : " I think this one is 
 sick." 
 
 The mother said : " You must take good care 
 of it." 
 
 Hlakanyana promised to do so, but when the 
 leopardess was gone he ate that one also. 
 
 The next day when the leopardess came 
 there was no cub left to give her. She tried 
 to get in the house, but the door was too small. 
 She sat down in front to watch. Then Hlakan- 
 yana went out through the hole he had made 
 in the ground behind. The leopardess saw 
 him and ran after him. He went under a big 
 rock, and cried out loudly for help, saying the 
 rock was falling. 
 
 The leopardess said : " What is that you are 
 saying ? " 
 
 Hlakanyana replied : " Do you not see that 
 this rock is falling ? Just hold it up while I 
 get a prop and put under it." 
 
 The leopardess went to hold the rock up, and 
 Hlakanyana did not return. He just ran away 
 from that place.

 Hlakanyana came to the village of the ani- 
 mals. The animals had trees that bore fruit. 
 There was one tree that belonged to the chief 
 of the animals only. This tree was a very good 
 one, bearing much fruit on it. One day when 
 all the animals were assembled, Hlakanyana 
 asked them the name of the tree of the chief. 
 They did not know the name of that tree. 
 Then Hlakanyana sent a monkey to the chief 
 to ask the name of the tree. The chief told 
 the monkey. As the monkey was returning, 
 he struck his foot against a stone and fell down, 
 which caused him to forget the name of the 
 tree. 
 
 In the night when all were sleeping, Hlakan- 
 yana went up the tree of the chief and ate all 
 the fruit of it. He took a branch of the tree 
 and fastened it to one of the monkeys. In the 
 morning when the animals awoke and found 
 that the tree of the chief was finished in the 
 night, they asked each other : ''What became of 
 the fruit of the chiefs tree ? What became of 
 the fruit of the tree of the chief ? " 
 
 Hlakanyana looked at the monkey with the 
 branch on him, and said : " It is eaten by the 
 monkey, it is eaten by the monkey ; look at the 
 branch on him." 
 
 The monkey denied, and said : " I don't know

 anything about it. I never ate the fruit of the 
 tree of the chief." 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " Let us make a plan to 
 find out who ate the fruit of the tree of the 
 chief" 
 
 All the animals agreed to this. 
 
 Hlakanyana said : " Let us put a rope from 
 one rock to another, and let all go over it. He 
 that has eaten the fruit of the tree will fall down 
 from that rope." 
 
 One of the monkeys went over first. The 
 next was Hlakanyana himself. He went over 
 carefully and avoided falling. It came to the 
 turn of that monkey with the branch on. He 
 tried to go, but when he was in the middle he 
 fell down. 
 
 Hlakanyana said therefore : " I have told you 
 that it is this monkey." 
 
 After that he went on his way. 
 
 Hlakanyana came to the house of a jackal. 
 He asked for food, but the jackal said there 
 was none. Then he made a plan. 
 
 He said to the jackal : " You must climb up 
 on the house and cry out with a loud voice, 
 ' We are going to be fat to-day because Hla- 
 kanyana is dead.' " 
 
 The jackal did so. All the animals came 
 running to hear that news. They went inside

 Hlakanyana shut the door, and the animals were 
 caught. After that Hlakanyana killed the 
 animals and ate. 
 
 Hlakanyana returned to the home of his 
 father again. He was told that his sister was 
 gone away for some red clay. When she was 
 returning he shouted : " Let all the black cattle 
 which have white teeth be killed. The daugh- 
 ter of my father is coming who has white 
 teeth." 
 
 The chief said: "What is the matter with 
 you, Hlakanyana ? " 
 
 He just repeated the same thing. 
 The chief said : " Let a black ox be killed, 
 but you must not break any of its bones, be- 
 cause it belongs to the daughter of a chief." 
 So Hlakanyana got fat meat to eat that day. 
 Hlakanyana went one day to tend the calves 
 of his father. He met a tortoise. 
 
 He said : ' Where are you going to, tortoise ? " 
 The tortoise answered : " To that big stone." 
 Hlakanyana said : "Are you not tired } " 
 The tortoise replied : " No, I am not tired." 
 Hlakanyana took it and put it on his back. 
 Then he went to the house of his mother.

 Hlakanyana answered : "Just take it off my

 The tortoise held fast to Hlakanyana, and 
 would not be pulled off. His mother then 
 heated some fat and poured on the tortoise. 
 The tortoise let go quickly, and the fat fell on 
 Hlakanyana and burnt him, so that he died. 
 That is the end of this cunning little fellow.

 which was protected by a very strong door, 
 with a fastening inside. Demane went out 
 hunting by day, and told his sister that she 
 was not to roast any meat while he was absent, 
 lest the cannibals should discover their retreat 
 by the smell. The girl would have been quite 
 safe if she had done as her brother commanded. 
 But she was wayward, and one day she took 
 some buffalo meat and put it on a fire to roast. 
 A cannibal smelt the flesh cooking, and went 
 to the cave, but found the door fastened. So

 he tried to imitate Demane's voice, and asked 
 to be admitted, singing this song : — 
 
 " Demazana, Demazana, 
 Child of my mother, 
 Open this cave to me. 
 The swallows can enter it. 
 It has two apertures." 
 
 Demazana said : " No. You are not my 
 brother ; your voice is not like his." 
 
 The cannibal went away, but after a little 
 time came back again, and spoke in another 
 tone of voice : " Do let me in, my sister." 
 
 The girl answered : " Go away, you cannibal ; 
 your voice is hoarse, you are not my brother." 
 
 So he went away and consulted with another 
 cannibal. He said : " What must I do to obtain 
 what I desire ? " 
 
 He was afraid to tell what his desire was, 
 lest the other cannibal should want a share of 
 the girl. 
 
 His friend said : " You must burn your throat 
 with a hot iron." 
 
 He did so, and then no longer spoke hoarse. 
 Again he presented himself before the door of 
 the cave, and sang, — 
 
 " Demazana, Demazana, 
 Child of ray mother. 
 Open this cave to me.

 The swallows can enter it. 
 It has two apertures." 
 
 The girl was deceived. She believed him 
 to be her brother come back from hunting, so 
 she opened the door. The cannibal went in 
 and seized her. 
 
 As she was being carried away, she dropped 
 some ashes here and there along the path. 
 Soon after this, Demane, who had taken nothing 
 that day but a swarm of bees, returned and 
 found his sister gone. He guessed what had 
 happened, and followed the path by means 
 of the ashes until he came to Zim's dwelling. 
 The cannibal's family were out gathering fire- 
 wood, but he was at home, and had just put 
 Demazana in a big bag, where he intended to 
 keep her till the fire was made. 
 
 Demane said : " Give me water to drink, 
 father." 
 
 Zim replied : " I will, if you will promise not 
 to touch my bag." 
 
 Demane promised. Then Zim went to get 
 some Avater ; and while he was away, Demane 
 took his sister out of the bag, and put the bees 
 in it, after which they both concealed them- 
 selves. 
 
 When Zim came with the water, his wife and 
 son and daughter came also with firewood.

 He said to his daughter : " There is some- 
 thing nice in the bag ; go bring it." 
 
 She went, but the bees stung her hand, and 
 she called out : ** It is biting." 
 
 He sent his son, and afterwards his wife, but 
 the result was the same. Then he became 
 angry, and drove them outside, and having put 
 a block of wood in the doorway, he opened the 
 bag himself. The bees swarmed out and stung 
 his head, particularly his eyes, so that he could 
 not see. 
 
 There was a little hole in the thatch, and 
 through this he forced his way. He jumped 
 about, howling with pain. Then he ran and 
 fell headlong into a pond, where his head stuck 
 fast in the mud, and he became a block of wood 
 like the stump of a tree. The bees made their 
 home in the stump, but no one could get their 
 honey, because, when any one tried, his hand 
 stuck fast. 
 
 Demane and Demazana then took all Zim's 
 possessions, which were very great, and they 
 became wealthy people.

 THE RUNAWAY CHILDREN; OR, THE WONDERFUL 
 
 FEATHER. 
 
 /NCE in a time of famine a woman left 
 
 1^ her home and went to Hve in a distant 
 
 villacre, where she became a cannibal. 
 
 She had one son, whose name was Ma- 
 goda. She ate all the people in that vil- 
 lage, until only herself and Magoda remai*^.ed. 
 Then she was compelled to hunt animals, but 
 she caught people still when she could. In 
 hunting she learned to be very swift of foot, 
 and could run so fast that nothing she pursued 
 could escape from her. 
 
 Her brother, who remained at home when 
 she left, had two daughters, whom he did not 
 treat very kindly. One day he sent them to 
 the river for water, w^hich they were to carry in 
 two pots. These pots were made of clay, and 
 were the nicest and most valuable in the vil-

 lage. One of the girls fell down on a rock and 
 broke the pot she was carrying. Then she did 
 not know what to do, because she was afraid to 
 go back to her father. She sat down and cried, 
 but that did not help, the pot would not be 
 whole again. 
 
 Then she said to her sister : " Let us go away 
 to another place, where our father will not be 
 able to find us." 
 
 She was the younger and the cleverer of the 
 two, and so she persuaded her sister. They 
 walked away in the opposite direction from 
 their home, and for two days had nothing but 
 gum to eat. Then they saw a fire at a distance, 
 and went to it, where they saw a house. It 
 was the house of their aunt, but they did not 
 know it. They were afraid to go in, but Ma- 
 goda came out and talked to them. When he 
 heard who they were, he was sorry for them, 
 and told them their aunt was a cannibal, giving 
 them advice not to stay there. But just then 
 they heard her coming, so they went into Ma- 
 goda's house and hid themselves, for he lived 
 in one house and his mother in another. 
 
 The woman came and said : " I smell some- 
 thing nice ; what is it, my son ? " 
 
 Magoda said there was nothing. 
 
 She replied : " Surely I smell fat children."

 But as she did not go in, they remained 
 concealed that night. 
 
 The next morning Nomagoda (so called 
 because she was the mother of Magoda) went 
 out to hunt, but she did not go far, so the 
 children could not get away. They went into 
 her house, where they saw a person with only 
 one arm, one side, and one leg. 
 
 The person said to them : " See, the cannibal 
 has eaten the rest of me ; take care of your- 
 selves." 
 
 When it was nearly dark, Nomagoda came 
 home again, bringing some animals which she 
 had killed. She smelt that children had been 
 in the house, so she went to her son's house 
 and looked in. 
 
 She said to Magoda: " Why do you not give 
 me some ? Do I not catch animals for you ? " 
 
 Then she saw the children, and was very 
 glad. She took them to her house, and told 
 them to sleep. They lay down, but were too 
 frightened to close their eyes. They heard 
 their aunt say, " Axe, be sharp ; axe, be sharp;" 
 and to let hi^r know that they were awake, they 
 spoke of vermin biting them. 
 
 After a while the cannibal went to sleep, 
 when they crept out, first putting two blocks of 
 wood in their places, and ran away as fast as

 they could. When Nomagoda awoke, she took 
 the axe and went to kill them, but the axe fell 
 on the blocks of wood. 
 
 As soon as it was day, the cannibal pursued 
 the children. They looked behind, and saw 
 clouds of dust which she made as she ran. 
 There was a tall tree just in front of them, so 
 they hastened to climb up it, and sat down 
 among the branches. Nomagoda came to the 
 tree and commenced to cut it down ; but when 
 a chip fell out, a bird (Ntengu) sang — 
 
 *' Ntengu, ntengu, 
 Chips, return to your places, 
 Chips, return to your places. 
 Chips, be fast." 
 
 The chip then went back to its place and was 
 fast again. This happened three times ; but 
 Nomagoda, who was very angry, caught the 
 bird and swallowed it. \Vhen she put it in her 
 mouth, one of the feathers dropped to the 
 ground. Then she bt^^c^n to chop at the tree 
 again ; but as soon as a chip was loose the 
 feather sang — 
 
 " Ntengu, ntengu,

 Chips, return to your places.

 The chip then stuck fast again. The cannibal

 chopped till she was tired, but the feather 
 continued to keep the tree from receiving harm. 
 Then she tried to catch the feather, but it flew 
 about too quickly for her, until she sank down 
 exhausted on the ground at the foot of the tree. 
 
 The children, up in the branches, could sec a 
 long way off ; and as they strained their eyes, 
 they observed three dogs as big as calves, and 
 they knew these dogs belonged to their father, 
 who was seeking for them. So they called 
 them by name, and the dogs came running to 
 the tree and ate up the cannibal, who was too 
 tired to make her escape. 
 
 Thus the children were delivered, and their 
 father was so glad to get them back again that 
 he forgave them for breaking the pot and run- 
 ning away.

 { LONG time ago a woman who went 
 1^ to cultivate her garden took her Httle 
 daughter with her, and before she began 
 to hoe the ground she laid the child down 
 in the shade of a tree. About midday 
 there came two birds and flew away with the 
 girl. They carried her across a great river, 
 and laid her gently down in a pumpkin field on 
 a plain. 
 
 As the birds were carrying her away, she 
 called to her mother, who took no notice of her 
 cries, because she could not imagine her child 
 was being carried away. In the afternoon the 
 girl was missing, and her mother searched for 
 her without success. She made inquiries of 
 the neighbours, and some of them told her they 
 had heard the child crying, " I am going away 
 with the birds."

 down was near a town in which lived a nation 
 of cannibals who had one leg much longer than 
 the other. There she remained alone till the 
 next day. 
 
 That nicjht the chief of the cannibals 
 dreamed that he saw a very pretty girl in that 
 place ; so in the morning he sent a party of 
 men to look for her. When the girl saw them 
 coming she was afraid, and hid herself among 
 the pumpkins. But the men had already 
 noticed where she was, so they easily found 
 her, and took her home with them. 
 
 The chief was very much pleased \\\i\\ her 
 appearance. He gave her to his mother to 
 take care of, and when she grew up he took 
 her to be his wife. 
 
 Afterwards she had two children, one very 
 pretty, and with two legs like herself ; the 
 other ugly, and like its father, with one leg 
 longer than the other. The cannibals saw the 
 advantage of having two legs of equal length, 
 and they became jealous of the woman and her 
 child. They told the chief it would be danger- 
 ous to allow the child to grow up, because then 
 a nation stronwr than themselves miixht arise. 
 They persuaded him to consent to her being 
 put to death, and then they rejoiced greatly, 
 because she was very fat, and they intended to

 passion than the others, told the woman what 
 they were about to do. 
 
 After the httle girl had been taken away by 
 the birds, her mother had a son, one of whose 
 sides was flesh like other people's, and the 
 other side was iron. His mother told him of 
 his sister who was lost, and when he became a 
 man he determined to go in search of her. 
 
 In his journey he came to a great river full 
 of water. He had an iron rod in his hand, 
 with which he struck the water, and at the same 
 time he called out with a loud voice : " River, 
 I have no sister. Be empty." 
 
 Then the river dried up, and he went safely 
 across. 
 
 After this he came to the stream where the 
 cannibals drew their water, and concealed him- 
 self among the reeds which grew on its banks. 
 While there his sister came to get water, and 
 he at once knew who she wa?. She, of course, 
 did not know him, but he told her he was her 
 brother. Then she said the cannibals would 
 eat him if he went to their town without an 
 introduction. So they arranged that he should 
 smear himself with mud and go to the top of a 
 high hill, and when he was coming down she 
 would tell the cannibals who he was.

STORY OF IROXSWE AND fllS SISTER. 123 
 
 Ironside went on the hill, and as soon as 
 he came in sight of the town, his sister said: 
 '* There is the servant of the wife of the chief 
 of the cannibals." These words she repeated 
 twice. 
 
 When Ironside reached the town, a mat was 
 brought to him and spread in front of his 
 sister's house ; but after a time he was allowed 
 to go inside, still covered with mud. 
 
 The next day they all went to hunt, and 
 Ironside killed more game than the others, 
 upon which they became envious of him. This 
 was shortly before the cannibals agreed to kill 
 and eat the daughter of their chief. W!^en the 
 one who had compassion made known wh?.t 
 was about to be done, Ironside was present and 
 heard what was told. He said to his sister 
 that she must pluck the hair from her head and 
 scatter it about in different directions. This 
 she did, after which Ironside and his sister and 
 her child left the town in haste. 
 
 The cannibals came, and when they could 
 not find the child they called her loudly by 
 name. Then the tufts of hair all answered in 
 her voice, and the seekers became confused. 
 
 Ironside and his companions, having two 
 legs, could walk much quicker than the can- 
 nibals, and soon they were on the other side of

 the large river. The child trembled, and was 
 very much frightened ; but Ironside told her 
 not to fear at all. After they had crossed, 
 Ironside struck the river with his iron rod, and 
 said : " River, I have found my sister. Be full." 
 Then the water rose very high, quite to the 
 top of the banks. 
 
 A party of cannibals who were in pursuit 
 came to the river after it was full, and Ironside 
 made a long rope, and threw the end over to 
 them. They caught hold of it, thinking that 
 he would pull them across ; but when they 
 were in the middle of the river he let go the 
 rope, and they were all drowned. Another 
 party then came and asked where their com- 
 panions were. Ironside said they had gone to 
 a ford further down ; but they knew that was 
 not true, so they returned home. Afterwards 
 they discovered who it was that gave warning 
 of their intentions, and they killed and ate that 
 one. 
 
 Ironside took his sister home to her mother, 
 who received her with the greatest joy, never 
 having forgotten her during that long time.

 NUMBER of girls once went away 
 from their homes early in the morning 
 for the purpose of getting imbola (the red 
 li';^ clay with which they colour their bodies 
 1 and clothes). Among them was the 
 daughter of a chief, a very pretty girl. After 
 they had collected the imbola, they were about 
 to return home, when one of them proposed 
 that they should bathe in a large pool of water 
 that was there To this they all agreed, and 
 so they went into the water and played about 
 in it for a long time. At last they dressed 
 themselves again, and set out for home ; but 
 when they had gone some distance, the chiefs 
 daughter noticed that she had forgotten one of 
 her ornaments, which she had taken off when 
 they went to bathe. So she asked her cousin 
 to return with her to get it. The cousin

 refused. Then she asked another girl, and 
 another, but one and all refused to go back. 
 She was thus obliged to return to the water 
 alone, while the other girls went home. 
 
 On arriving at the pool, a big ugly cannibal 
 with only one leg came up to her, caught her, 
 and put her in his bag. She was so frightened 
 that she lay quite still. The cannibal then 
 took her round to the different villages and 
 made her sing for him. He called her his bird. 
 When he came to a village he asked for meat, 
 and when it was given to him he said : " Sing, 
 my bird." B''*; he would never open the bag 
 that any one could see what sort of a bird he 
 had. 
 
 When the girls reached home, they told the 
 chief that his dauo^hter had reached the age 
 of puberty, and then they selected one of 
 themselves and put her in a hut. The chief 
 believed that story, and so le killed a large ox 
 and said the people must eat. That day they 
 ate fat beef, and were very merry. The boys 
 took meat, and went away from the village to 
 eat it. 
 
 The cannibal, who did not know that the 
 girl's father was chief at this place, came there 
 just at this time. He said to the boys if they 
 would give him meat he would make his bird

 said: "Sing, my bird." The girl's brother was 
 among those boys, and he thought the bird 
 sang hke his sister^ but he was afraid to ask 
 the cannibal to let him see. He advised the 
 cannibal to eo to the villaofe where the men 
 were, and told him there was plenty of meat 
 that day. 
 
 The cannibal then went to the village and 
 made his bird sing. The chief wanted very 
 much to see the bird, but the cannibal would 
 not open the bag. The chief offered him an 
 ox for the bird, but the cannibal declined the 
 offer. Then the chief made a plan. He 
 asked the cannibal to c^o for some water, and 
 said he would give him plenty of beef when 
 he returned. The cannibal said he would go 
 if they would promise not to open his bag 
 while he was away. They all promised not 
 to touch the bag. They gave the cannibal 
 a leaky pot to carry the water in, so that he 
 was gone a long time. As soon as he was 
 out of sight the chief opered the bag and 
 took his daughter out. At first he could not 
 be'ieve it was his daughter, for he thought she 
 was observing intonjane. But when he knew 
 how those other gi'/ls had deceived him he said 
 they must all die, and so they were killed.

 Then he put snakes and toads in the bag, and 
 tied it up again. 
 
 When the cannibal came back he complained 
 of the leaky pot, but they gave him plenty of 
 meat to satisfy him, so he picked up his bag 
 and went away. He did not know what had 
 happened while he was absent. When he 
 came near his own house he called to his 
 wife: " Make ready to cook." He sent and 
 called all the other cannibals to come to a feast, 
 and they came expecting to get something nice. 
 He let them wait a little to get very hungry. 
 Then he opened his bag and thought to take 
 the girl out, but found only snakes and toads 
 in it. The other cannibals were so angry when 
 they saw this, that they killed him and made 
 their feast of him.

 HERE was once a man and a woman

 very much to go and see our parents." 
 
 Their grandfather said ; " Ho ! will y^u be

 After a time he consented. He said : " You 
 must leave at such a time that you may arrive

 may not see you, only your father."

 They started when the sun was set. When 
 they arrived at their father's house, they 
 listened outside to find out If their mother was 
 there. They heard the voice of their father 
 only, so they caiied to him. He came out, 
 and when he saw them he was sorry, and said : 
 " Why did you come here, my dear children ? 
 Don't you know your mother is a cannibal ? " 
 
 Just then they heard a noise like thunder. 
 It was the coming of their mother. Their 
 father took them inside and put them in a dark 
 corner, where he covered them with skins. 
 Their mother came in with an animal and the 
 body of a man. She stood and said : "There's 
 something here. What a nice smell it has ! " 
 
 She said to her husband : " Sohinazinci, 
 what have you to tell me about this nice smell 
 that is in my house ? You must tell me 
 whether my children are here." 
 
 Her husband answered : " What are you 
 dreaming about ? They are not here." 
 
 She went to the corner where they were, 
 and took the skins away. When she saw 
 them, she said : " My children, I am very 
 sorry that you are here, because I must eat 
 people." 
 
 She cooked for them and their father the 
 animal she had brought home, and the dead

 man for herself. After they had eaten, she 
 went out. 
 
 Then their father said to them : " When we 
 lie down to sleep, you must be watchful. You 
 will hear a dancing of people, a roaring of wild 
 beasts, and a barking of dogs in your mother's 
 stomach. You will know by that she is sleep- 
 ing, and you must then rise at once and get 
 away." 
 
 They lay down, but the man and the 
 children only pretended to go to sletp. They 
 were listening for those sounds. After a while 
 they heard a dancing of people, a roaring of 
 wild beasts, and a barking of dogs. Then 
 their father shook them, and said they must go 
 while th'^ir mother was sleeping. They bade 
 their father farewell, and crept out quietly, that 
 their mother might not hear them. 
 
 At midnight the woman woke up, and when 
 she found the children were gone, she took 
 her axe and went after them. They were 
 already a long way on their journey, when they 
 saw her following them. They were so tired 
 that they could not run. 
 
 When she was near them, the boy said to 
 the girl : "My sister, sing your melodious song; 
 perhaps when she hears it she will be sorry, 
 and go home without hurting us."

 The girl replied : " She will not listen to 
 anything now, because she is in want of meat." 
 
 Hinazinci said : " Try, my sister; it may not 
 be in vain." 
 
 So she sang her song, and when the cannibal 
 heard it, she ran backwards to her own house. 
 There she fell upon her husband, and wanted 
 to cut him with the axe. Her husband caught 
 hold of her arm, and said : ** Ho ! if you put 
 me to death who will be your husband ? " 
 
 Then she left him, and ran after the children 
 again. 
 
 They were near their grandfather's village, 
 and were very weak when their mother over- 
 took them. The girl fell down, and the 
 cannibal caught her and swallowed her. She 
 then ran after the boy. He fell just at the 
 entrance of his grandfathers house, and she 
 picked him up and swallowed him also. She 
 found only the old people and the children of 
 the village at home, all the others being at 
 work in the gardens. She ate all the people 
 that were at home and also all the cattle that 
 were there. 
 
 Towards evening she left to go to her own 
 home. There was a deep valley in the way, 
 and when she came to it she saw a very 
 beautiful bird. As she approached it, the bird

 got bigger and bigger, until at last when she 
 was very near it, it was as big as a house {i.e., 
 a native hut). 
 
 Then the bird began to sing its song. The 
 woman looked at it, and said to herself : " I 
 shall take this bird home to my husband." 
 
 The bird continued its song, and sang : 
 
 " I am a pretty bird of the valley. 
 You come to make a disturbance at my place." 
 
 The bird went slowly towards her, still sing- 
 ing its song. When they met, the bird took 
 the axe from the woman, and still sang the 
 same song. 
 
 The cannibal began to be afraid. 
 
 She said to the bird : " Give me my axe ; I 
 do not wish for your flesh now." 
 
 The bird tore one of her arms. 
 
 She said : " I am going away now ; give me 
 what is mine." 
 
 The bird would not listen to her, but con- 
 tinued its song. 
 
 She said again : " Give me my axe and let 
 me go. My husband at home is very hungry ; 
 I want to go and cook food for him." 
 
 The bird sang more loudly than before, and 
 tore one of her legs. 
 
 She fell down and cried out : "My master, I

 am In a hurry to go home. I do not want 
 anything that is yours." 
 
 She saw that she was in danger. She said 
 to the bird again : " You don't know how to 
 sing your song nicely ; let me go, and I will 
 sin^ it for you." 
 
 The bird opened its wings wide, and tore 
 open her stomach. Many people came forth, 
 most of them alive, but some were dead. As 
 they came forth she caught them and swallowed 
 th m again. The two children were alive, and 
 thi:y ran away. At last the woman died. 
 
 There was great rejoicing in that country. 
 The children returned to their grandfather, and 
 the people came there and made them rulers of 
 the country, because it was through them the 
 cannibal was brought to death.

 STORY OF THE GIRL AND THE MBULU. 
 
 HERE was once a widow woman who 
 
 had one son and two daughters. On 
 
 a certain day she went to her garden, 
 
 taking with her one of the girls. While 
 
 she was away the boy quarrelled with his 
 
 sister and killed her. 
 
 In the course of the day the woman sent the 
 
 girl that was with her to the hut, and when she 
 
 came there a fly told her what had happened. 
 
 She did not believe it. 
 
 Then a mouse told her the same thing, but 
 
 still she did not believe it was true. 
 
 Afterwards the fly told her to look in a 
 
 certain place, and there she saw the head and 
 
 the bones of her sister. 
 
 When the woman came home and found out 
 
 what had happened, she killed her son. Then 
 
 she gave the girl a stick, and told her to go 
 
 to her uncle's house, saying that when she got

 there she must strike the ground with the stick, 
 and all the clothes and other things that be- 
 longed to her would then rise up out of the 
 earth. The woman said she was now all alone, 
 and therefore intended to kill herself. 
 
 The girl was very sorry, but she did as her 
 mother told her. When she was a little way 
 off she looked back and saw smoke coming 
 out of the hut, from which she knew that her 
 mother had burned herself and was no longer 
 a person under the sun. 
 
 After this she met an old woman, who called 
 to her, but she took no heed and walked on. 
 Next she met a mbulu at a place close by a 
 river. The mbulu said that whoever wet any 
 part of the body in crossing the river must go 
 in and bathe. The girl was standing on the 
 bank, and the mbulu struck the water with its 
 tail and splashed it into her face, so that she 
 had to go in and bathe. Then the mbulu took 
 her clothes and put them on. 
 
 When the girl came out of the water she 
 asked for her clothes, but the mbulu said : 
 " I will give them when you are dry." 
 
 So they went on together. After a while the 
 girl asked again, and the mbulu said : ** I will 
 give them when we get to the village." 
 
 But when they arrived there the mbulu said :

STORY OF THE GIRL AND THE MBULU. 137 
 
 " You must tell the people here that you are 
 my servant, and that I am the daughter of 
 a chief." 
 
 The poor girl was so afraid that she pro- 
 mised to do so. They were well received at 
 the village, because the people believed that 
 the mbulu was a great person. They won- 
 dered at her voice, but she told them she had 
 been sick and her throat was not yet well. 
 
 After a time one of the men of that kraal 
 married the mbulu, and the real girl was sent 
 to the gardens to drive the birds away from 
 the corn. While engaged in this occupation 
 she used to sing about the mbulu taking her 
 clothes and passing itself off for a person, until 
 the women who worked in the gardens took 
 notice of this song of hers. 
 
 Then they made a plan to find out if what 
 the girl was singing was the truth. They said : 
 " The tail of a mbulu will want mice and fat," 
 so they set snares to catch the mice. In the 
 night the tail was pursuing mice, and itself got 
 fast in a snare. The mbulu then asked the 
 man who was married to her to go and get 
 some medicine, as she was sick, and when the 
 man went she took off the snare. 
 
 After this they made another plan. They 
 said : " The tail of a mbulu will seek milk,"

 SO they dug a hole in the ground, put milk 
 in it, and required every one in the village 
 to jump over the hole. The mbulu was un- 
 willing at first, but they urged her. She tried 
 to jump quickly, but the tail could not pass 
 the milk. When it went down the people saw 
 that this was a mbulu, so they killed it and 
 buried it in that hole. 
 
 After this the same man who had married 
 the mbulu took the girl to be his wife. She 
 had a child, and one day, when it was playing, 
 a square pumpkin came out of the ground 
 where the inbulu was buried, and tried to kill 
 the infant. But the people chopped the 
 pumpkin into pieces, and burned it. They 
 afterwards threw the ashes into a river, so 
 that nothing more could come of that mbulu.

 TP^ STORY OF MBULUKAZI. 
 
 HERE was once a man why had two 
 wives, one of whom had no children, 
 in consequence of which she was not 
 loved by her husband. Her name was 
 Numbakatali. The other wife had one 
 daughter who was /ery black, and several chil- 
 dren besides, but they were all crows. The 
 one who had no offspring was very downcast 
 on that account, and used to go about weeping 
 all day. 
 
 Once when she was working in her garden, 
 and crying as usual, two doves came and 
 perched near her. One of them said to the 
 other : " Dove, ask the woman why she is 
 crying." So the dove questioned ^"or. 
 
 She replied : " It is because I have no chil- 
 dren, and my husband does not love me. His 
 other wife's children are crows, which cone 
 and eat my corn, and she laughs at me."

 The dove said : ** Go home and get two 
 earthen jars, and bring them here." 
 
 Numbakatali went and got them. Then 
 the doves scratched her knees till the blood 
 flowed, and put the blood in the jars. The 
 woman gave the doves some corn to eat, after 
 which she took the jars home to her hut, and 
 set them carefully down in a corner. Every- 
 day the two doves came to be fed, and always 
 told the woman to look at what was in the jars. 
 
 At last, when she looked one day, she saw 
 two children, one a boy, the other a girl, and 
 both very handsome. She was very much 
 delighted at the sight, but she did not tell 
 any one. 
 
 When the children grew a little she made 
 a snug place for them in the hut, where they 
 were to sit all day, because she did not wish 
 them to be seen. Always before she went 
 to her work she charged them not to go out, 
 and as her husband never came to see her, 
 no one knew of the existence of these children 
 except herself and a servant girl. 
 
 But one day, when they were big, she went 
 out, and after she was away some time, the 
 boy said to his sister : " Come, let us help our 
 mother by bringing water from the river." 
 
 So they went for water; but they had not

 reached the river when they met a company 
 of young men with a chief's son, who was 
 looking for a pretty girl to be his wife. The 
 young chief was called Broad Breast, because 
 his chest was very wide, and it was also made 
 of a glittering metal that shone in the sun. 
 These men asked for water to drink. The 
 boy gave them all some water, but the young 
 chief would receive it only from the girl. He 
 was very much smitten with her beauty, and 
 watched her when she left, so as to ascertain 
 where she lived. 
 
 As soon as the young chief saw the hut that 
 the girl went to, he returned home with his 
 party and asked his father for cattle with 
 which to marry her. The chief, who was very 
 rich, gave his son many fine cattle, with which 
 the young man went to the girl's mother's 
 husband, and said : " I want to marry your 
 daughter." 
 
 So the girl who was very black was told to 
 come, but the young chief said : ** That is not 
 the one I want ; the one I saw was lighter in 
 colour and much prettier." 
 
 The father replied : " I have no other chil- 
 dren but crows." 
 
 But Broad Breast persisted, so the man 
 called his wives, both of whom denied that

 there was such a girl. However, the servant 
 girl went to the man and privately told him 
 the truth. In the evening he went to his 
 wife's hut, and to his great joy saw the boy 
 and his sister. He was so delighted that he 
 remained there that night, and after talking 
 about it with his wife, he concluded to let 
 Broad Breast marry the girl. 
 
 In the morning a mat was spread in the 
 yard, and the young chief was conducted there. 
 The two children and the servant girl who 
 told their father about them were also called, 
 and they all sat down on the mat. 
 
 The young chief, as soon as he saw her, 
 said : " This is the girl I meant." 
 
 He stayed part of the day, and then with his 
 attendants went to his father for more cattle, 
 which, when he obtained, he brought back to 
 the father of the girl. 
 
 The mother of the very black girl and the 
 crows was very jealous when she saw such a 
 fine young chief coming with so many cattle. 
 She wanted her daughter to be the one who 
 was to be married ; so she dressed her as fine 
 as she could, but she had no such pretty 
 clothes as the other girl had. Her name was 
 Mahlunguluza, for she was called after the 
 crows, who were the other children of her

 mother. The pretty girl's name was Mbulu- 
 kazi, which name v/as given to her because 
 her handsome dress was made of the skin of 
 a mbulu. 
 
 The mother of Mahlunguluza spoke to the 
 young chief about her daughter, and so he 
 married both the girls. Their father gave to 
 each an ox, with which they went to their new 
 home. Mbulukazi's ox was a pretty young 
 one, and Mahlunguluza's ox was an old and 
 poor one. When they arrived, Broad Breast 
 gave to Mbulukazi a very nice new house to 
 live in, but to Mahlunguluza was given an old 
 one quite in ruins. 
 
 Then the very black one saw she was not 
 loved, and she became jealous, so she made 
 a plan to kill her sister. One day she told 
 her she heard their father was sick, and pro- 
 posed that they should go to see him. Mbulu- 
 kazi consented, and as soon as they obtained 
 leave from their husband they left Their 
 road led them past a high precipice, below 
 which was a deep pool of water. 
 
 Mahlunguluza lay down on the rock, and 
 said ; *' Come, see what is here in the water." 
 
 Her sister lay down with her head over the 
 edge of the rock, when Mahlunguluza jumped 
 up quickly and pushed her over. Mbulukazi

 sank in the water and was drowned. Then 
 the very black one returned home, and when 
 her husband asked where Mbulukazi was, she 
 said that she was still with their father. 
 
 The next day the ox of the drowned one 
 came running to the village and walked about 
 lowing for a while, after which it tore down 
 the old ruined house of Mahlunguluza with its 
 horns. Its actions attracted the notice of the 
 men, and they said : " Surely this ox means 
 something, why is it doing this ? " 
 
 Then it went to the deep pool of water, the 
 men following it ; it smelt a/ over the rock, 
 and then jumped into the water and brought 
 out the corpse of Mbulukazi. The ox licked 
 her till her life came back, and as soon as 
 she was strong once more, she told what had 
 happened. 
 
 They all went home rejoicing greatly, and 
 informed Broad Breast. When the young 
 chief heard the story he was angry with 
 Mahlunguluza, and said to her : " Go home to 
 your father;, I did not even want you; it was 
 your mother who brought you to me." 
 
 So she had to go away in sorrow, and

 THE STORY OF LONG SNAKE. 
 
 fNCE upon a time a certain girl left her 
 father's place, and went to the village of 
 Long Snake. Having arrived at the 
 village of Long Snake she remained there, 
 but the owner of the place was absent. 
 The only person present was the mother of the 
 owner of the place. 
 
 Then in the evening the mother of Long 
 Snake gave that girl some millet, that she 
 might grind it. After it was ground she made 
 bread. When it was ready the mother of 
 Long Snake said : " Bring this bread into the 
 house of Long Snake." 
 
 A short time after that girl went into the 
 house the owner of the place arrived. Then 
 she gave him bread aqd fermented milk, and 
 he ate. When they had finished the food they 
 went to sleep. Then early in the morning 
 Long Snake went away, because in the day- 
 time he lived in the open country.

 The girl went to the house of the parents 
 of Long Snake. The mother of Long Snake 
 clothed her with a very beautiful robe. After 
 she was dressed she called for an axe, and 
 went to cut firewood. Having arrived in the 
 open fields she did not cut the firewood, but 
 she threw away the axe and ran to her father's 
 place. 
 
 After she arrived at her father's place her 
 sister inquired where she had got that beautiful 
 robe. Her sister told her, and she said : " I 
 am also going to that village." 
 
 Her sister said : " Just listen to what I tell 
 you of the custom of that village." 
 
 But her sister said in reply : " I do not want 
 you to tell me anything, because you yourself 
 were not warned before you went." 
 
 Then at once she journeyed and went, until 
 she arrived in the evening at the village of 
 Long Snake. When she sat down the mother 
 of Long Snake gave her millet that she might 
 grind it and make bread. When it was ready 
 she took it into the house of Long Snake. 
 Then in the evening the owner of the place 
 arrived, and the girl gave him bread and fer- 
 mented milk. When they had finished eating 
 they went to sleep, and early in the morning 
 Long Snake went away.

 Then the girl went to the house of Long 
 Snake's parents. His mother also clothed that 
 girl in the same manner as she had dressed 
 the elder one. Then she borrowed an axe and 
 went to cut fuel. In doing so she made an 
 excuse to run away. 
 
 On this day, however, the man went after his 
 wives, and arrived at his father-in-law's place 
 as the sun was setting. 
 
 They went out of the house that the bride- 
 groom might sleep in it. While he was eating, 
 the people of the village piled up bundles of 
 grass, and the bridegroom was burned in the 
 house. In this manner he died.

 during this time was nongwes {Hypoxis,

 p. 385, " Harvey's Gen. S. A. Plants "), which 
 they dug out ^f the ground. 
 
 There was living at that place a man called 
 Kenkebe, and one day his wife said to him : 
 *• My husband, go to my fathe:* and ask him 
 to give us some corn." 
 
 The man said : " Yes, I will go." 
 
 So he rose up early in the morning, and went 
 on till he arrived at his father-in-law's village, 
 where he was received with every mark of 
 kindness. A very large ox was killed for his 
 entertainment. It was so large that it was 
 six days before it was all eaten. His father- 
 in-law asked of him the news.

 He said : *' There is no news to tell to 
 friends. All the news is this, that at my home 
 there is not a grain to be eaten. Famine is 
 over our heads. Will you give us some corn, 
 for we are dying ? " 
 
 His father-in-law gave him seven bags {i.e. 
 skins of animals dressed entire) full of millet, 
 and his wife's sisters went with him to carry 
 them. When they came to a valley close by 
 his home, he told his sisters-in-law that they 
 could now go back to their father. 
 
 They said : " How will you be able to carry 
 all those bags alone ? " 
 
 He replied : " I will be able to carry them 
 all now, because we are not far from my home." 
 
 So those girls went back to their father. 
 
 Then he carried the bags one by one, and 
 hid them in a cave under a great rock that was 
 there. Afterwards he took some of the millet 
 and ground it. When it was ground very fine 
 he made it into cakes just like nongwes. Then 
 he dug some nongwes out of the ground, and 
 went home to his wife. 
 
 He said to her : " There is a great famine at 
 your fathers also. I found the people there 
 eating themselves." 
 
 He told his wife to make a fire. Then he 
 pretended to cut a piece of meat from his thigh,

 and said : " So are they doing at your father's 
 village. Now, my wife, let us do the same." 
 
 His wife cut a piece from her leg and roasted 
 it. The piece that Kenkebe put on the fire 
 was some that he had brought home with him. 
 
 The little boy of Kenkebe said : " Why 
 does my father's meat smell nice in roac:ting, 
 and my mother's meat does not smell nice ? " 
 
 Kenkebe answered : " It is because it is 
 taken from the leg of a man." 
 
 After this he gave to his wife some nongwes 
 to roast. He took for himself some of those 
 he had made of corn. 
 
 The little boy said : " Why do my father's 
 nongwes smell nice in roasting, and my 
 mother's do not smell nice ? " 
 
 Kenkebe said : " It is because they were dug 
 by a man." 
 
 After eating, he went outside, but he had 
 dropped one of his nongwes by the fire. When 
 he went out the boy found the nongwe. He 
 broke it in two and gave half to his mother. 
 
 He said : " There is a difference between 
 our nongwes and those of father's."

 a pot in his hand. The boy was awake, and 
 saw his father go out So he called to his 
 mother, and said : " Mother, mother, wake, my 
 father is going away with the pot in his hand." 
 
 So she got up, and they followed after 
 Kenkebe. They saw him go to the cave, 
 where he took some corn out of one of the bags 
 and began to grind it. Then they went on top 
 of the rock, and rolled a big stone over. 
 
 When Kenkebe saw the stone coming he 
 ran away, but it followed close behind him. 
 He ran down the valley, the stone kept running 
 too. He jumped into a deep hole in the river, 
 down went the stone too. He ran up the hill, 
 up went the stone also. He ran over the 
 plain, but whenever he turned to look, the stone 
 was there just behind him. So it continued all 
 that day. At night he reached his own house, 
 and then the stone stopped. His wife had 
 already gone home, and had taken with her one 
 of the bags of corn. 
 
 Kenkebe came in crying. 
 
 His wife said to him : " Why do you cry as 
 if you were a child } " 
 
 He said : *' Because I am very tired and 
 very hungry." 
 
 She said : ** Where are your clothes and 
 your bag ? "

 He replied : " I was crossing a river, and I 
 fell down. The stream took my mantle, and 
 my bag, and my kerries, and everything that 
 was mine, away with it." 
 
 Then his wife gave him his mantle, which 
 she had picked up when he was running away, 
 and she said to him : " You are foolish to do 
 such things. There is no food for you to- 
 night." 
 
 The next morning Kenkebe rose early and 
 went out to hunt with his two dogs. Ine 
 name of the one was Tumtumse, and the name 
 of the other was Mbambozozele. He found 
 an eland with a young calf, which he drove 
 to his place. He cut an ear off the calf and 
 roasted it in the fire. It was fat, and he liked 
 it so much that he cut the other ear off and 
 cooked it also. Then he wished to kill the 
 calf, but he said to himself : " If I kill this calf 
 I shall not be able to get milk from the eland." 
 
 So he called his two dogs, and said to the 
 one : " Tumtumse, my dog, if I kill this calf, 
 will you imitate it and suck the eland for me ? " 
 
 The dog said : " No, I will bark like a dog." 
 
 Kenkebe said : " Get out of my sight and 
 never come near me again, you ugly, useless 
 animal." 
 
 He said to the other : •' Mbambozozele, my

 dog, if I kill this calf, will you imitate it and 
 suck the eland for me ? " 
 
 The dog said : " I will do so." 
 
 Then he killed the calf and ate it. He took 
 the skin and put it upon Mbambozozele, so 
 that the eland thought it was her calf that 
 sucked before Kenkebe milked her. But one 
 day the dog was sucking too long, and Ken- 
 kebe wanted him. to leave off. He tried to 
 drink just a f^w drops more, when his master 
 got angry and struck him with a stick. There- 
 upon the dog began to howl, and the eland 
 saw how she had been deceived. At once she 
 ran after Kenkebe and tried to stick him with 
 her horns. He ran one way and the eland ran 
 after him, then he ran another way, and still 
 the eland chased him. 
 
 His wife came out and saw him running. 
 She cried out to him : "Jump up quickly on 
 the big stone." He did so, and the eland ran 
 with such fury against that stone that it broke 
 its head and fell down dead. 
 
 They then cut the eland up and wanted to 
 cook it, but there was no fire. Kenkebe said 
 to his son : *' Go to the village of the cannibals 
 that is on that hill over the valley, and ask for 
 some fire ; but do not take any meat with you, 
 that they may not smell it."

 The boy went, but he hid a piece of meat 
 and took it with him. When he got to the 
 first house he asked for fire, but they sent him 
 to the next. At the next they sent him 
 farther, and so he had to go to the house that 
 was farthest away. An old woman lived 
 there. The boy gave her a little piece of meat, 
 and said : " Do not cook it till I am far away 
 with the fire." 
 
 But as soon as the boy was gone, she put 
 it on the coals. The smell came to the noses 
 of the cannibals, and they ran to the place and 
 swallowed the old woman, and the meat, and 
 the fire, and even the ashes. 
 
 Then they ran after the boy. When he 
 approached his own house, he cried out : 
 "Hide yourselves, you that are at home." 
 
 His father said : " My son is saying we must 
 gather wood that will make coals." 
 
 His mother said: " No, he is saying we must 
 hide ourselves." 
 
 The boy cried again : " Hide yourselves." 
 
 Then his mother hid herself in a bush ; an 
 old woman that was there covered herself with 
 ashes, and Kenkebe climbed up into a tree, 
 with the breast of the eland in his hand. The 
 boy slipped into a hole that was by the side of 
 the path.

 The cannibals came to the place. First 
 they ate the eland. Then one of them said : 
 " Search under the ashes." 
 
 There they found the old woman, and they 
 ate her. Then they said : "Search in the tree." 
 
 There they found Kenkebe. He cried very 
 much, but they would not spare him. They 
 ate him and the breast of the eland. Then 
 the wise one said : " Look in the bush." 
 
 They looked there and found the wife of 
 Kenkebe. They said : " We will eat her 
 another time," and so they took her home with 
 them. They did not look for the boy. 
 
 The woman made a plan to escape. She 
 made beer for the cannibals, and they all came 
 to drink. They sat together in a big house, 
 and drank very much beer. Then she said : 
 " Can I go out ? " 
 
 They said : " You can go, but come back 
 quickly." 
 
 She said : ** Shall I close the entrance ? " 
 
 They said : " Close it." 
 
 Then she took fire and put on the house, 
 and all those cannibals were burnt to death. 
 So the woman escaped, and afterwards lived 
 happily with her son.

 ANOTHER STORY OF KENKEBE. 
 
 At a certain time, Kenkebe went to get his 
 wife at the place of her parents. When he 
 was on the way, he met a crow. He borrowed 
 its eyes. Then he arrived at his wife's parents' 
 place with the eyes of the crow. 
 
 When Le arrived, his wife said : " Where are 
 VO '.'eves ? " 
 
 'e r :plied : " My eyes have been taken 
 away by tiio crows." 
 
 Then his wife said : " Let us go home." 
 
 When they reached home, his wife said : 
 '* Take those eyes, you silly one, to their owner, 
 and bring back your own." 
 
 Accordingly Kenkebe went for his eyes and 
 obtained them. 
 
 Then, when he was returning, he met an 
 ant, and exchanged stomachs with it. When 
 he arrived at his house, his wife gave him food. 
 After he had finished eating, he went to milk 
 a cow. 
 
 After he went out, his little boy went to the 
 place where he had been sitting. He said : 
 •' Mother, this food that is spilt here, whose is 
 it ? " 
 
 His mother replied : " Perhaps it has been 
 spilt by your father. You must not eat it until 
 your father comes."

 STORY OF THE WONDERFUL HORNS. 
 
 HERE was once a boy whose mother 
 
 that bore him was dead, and who was 
 
 ill-treated by his other mothers. On 
 
 y this account he determined to go away 
 
 from his father's place. One morning 
 
 he went, riding on an ox which was given to 
 
 him by his father. As he was travelling, he 
 
 came to a herd of cattle with a bull. 
 
 His ox said: " I will fight and overcome that 
 bull." 
 
 The boy then dismounted. The fight took 
 place, and the bull was defeated. The boy 
 mounted again. 
 
 About midday, feeling hungry, he struck the 
 right horn of his ox, and food came out. After 
 satisfying his hunger, he struck the left horn, 
 and the rest of the food went in again. 
 
 The boy saw another herd of dun-coloured

 cattle. His ox said : " I will fight and die 
 there. You must break off my horns and take 
 them with you. When you are hungry, speak 
 to them, and they will supply you with food." 
 
 In the fight the ox was killed, as was said. 
 The boy took his horns, and went on walking 
 till he came to a village where he found the 
 people cooking a weed (called tyutu), having 
 no other food to eat. 
 
 He entered one of the houses. He spoke 
 to his horn, and food came out, sufficient to 
 supply the owner of the house and himself 
 After they had eaten, they both fell asleep. 
 The owner of the house got up and took away 
 the horns. He concealed them, and put two 
 others in their place. 
 
 The boy started next morning with the 
 horns, taking them to be the right ones. 
 When he felt hungry, he spoke to the horns, 
 but nothing came out. He therefore went 
 back to the same place where he <^lept the 
 previous night. As he drew near, he heard 
 the owner of the place speaking to the horns, 
 but without any avail. 
 
 The boy took his horns from the thief, and 
 went on his way. He came to a house, and 
 asked to be entertained. The owner refused, 
 and sent him away, on account of his gar-

 After that he came to a river and sat down 
 on the bank. He spoke to his horns, and a 
 new mantle and handsome ornaments came 
 out. He dressed himself, and went on. He 
 came to a house where there was a very 
 beautiful girl. He was received by the girl's 
 father, and stayed there. His horns provided 
 food and clothing for all. 
 
 After a time he married the girl. He then 
 returned home with his wife, and was wel- 
 comed by his father. He spoke to his horns, 
 and a fine house came out, in which he lived

 the absence of the animals. She came down 
 from her hiding-place, and took up a stone 
 used for raising pots above the fire (called 
 isoko), and went again into her hiding-place. 
 
 The animals returned in the evening; and 
 while their pots were on the fire, she threw 
 down the stone into one of them. The animals 
 all rushed out of the house. Outside a consul- 
 tation took place, and their chief decided that 
 those living in holes should go to the holes, 
 that those living in forests should go to the 
 forests, and that those living in rivers should 
 go to the rivers. 
 
 Aftei this, the woman set a trap, and suc- 
 ceeded in catching a buffalo, but she could not 
 skill it. She saw a glutton (called an igo- 
 ngqongqo, a fabulous monster, like a man, but 
 capable of devouring enormous quantities of 
 food) coming, and asked him to help her. He 
 consented. 
 
 He pulled out his knife and skinned the 
 buffalo. She gathered some wood, and kindled 
 a fire for the purpose of roasting the liver. 
 The glutton roasted it. She went away and 
 l)icked up an empty calabash, and when she 
 returned she found the glutton roasting the 
 legs, having already eaten the liver. She then

 STORY OF THE GREAT CHIEF OF THE ANIMALS. 
 
 HERE was once a woman who had 
 
 occasion to leave her home for a short 
 
 time, and who left her children in charge 
 
 S of a hare. The place where they lived 
 
 I was close to a path, along which droves 
 
 of wild animals were accustomed to pass. 
 
 Soon after the woman left, the animals 
 
 appeared, and the hare at sight of them became 
 
 frightened. So she ran away to a distance, and 
 
 stood to watch. Among the animals was one 
 
 terrible monster, which called to the hare, and 
 
 demanded to know what children those were. 
 
 The hare told their names, upon which the 
 
 animal swallowed them entire. 
 
 When the woman returned, the hare told 
 
 her what had happened. Then the woman 
 
 gathered some dry wood, and shari)ened two 
 
 pieces of iron, which she took with her and 
 
 went along the path.

 Now this was the chief of the aniiiials : tl;::rc- 
 fore, when she came on a hill over against him, 
 the woman began to call out that she was look- 
 ing for her children. The animal replied : 
 ** Come nearer, I cannot hear you." 
 
 When she went, he swallowed her also. The 
 woman found her children alive, and also many 
 other people, and oxen, and dogs. The chil- 
 dren were hungry, so the woman with her 
 pieces of iron cut some pieces of flesh from the 
 animal's ribs. She then made a fire and cooked 
 the meat, and the children ate. 
 
 The other people said : ''We also are huogiy, 
 give us to eat." 
 
 Then she cut and cooked for them also. 
 
 The animal felt uncomfortable under this 
 treatment, and called his councillors together 
 for advice, but they could suggest no remedy. 
 He lay down and rollH in the mud, but that 
 did not help liim, and at ^ast he went and put 
 his head in the kraal fence, and died. 
 
 His councillors were standing at a distance, 
 afraid to approach him, so they sent a monkey 
 to see how he was. The monkey returned and 
 said : " Those whose home is on the mountains 
 must hasten to the mountains; those whose 
 home is on the plains must hasten to the plains; 
 as for me, I go to the rocks,"

 STORY OF THE HARE. 
 
 *j™U7NCE upon a time the animals made a

 a<^reed that one of their number should 
 remain to be the keeper of the gate. 
 j The first one that was appointed was the 
 coney {itiibila). He agreed to take charge, 
 and all the others went away. In a short time 
 the coney fell asleep, when the inkalimeva (a 
 fabulous an I ma)) went in and ate all the fat. 
 After doing this, he threw a little stone at the 
 cone^'.

 They put the fat in the kraal a second time, 
 and appointed the muishond {igaga) to keep 
 the gate. The muishond consented, and the 
 animals went away as before. After a little 
 time the inkalimeva came to the kraal, bringing 
 some honey with it. It invited the keeper of 
 the gate to eat honey, and while the muishond 
 was enjoying himself the inkalimeva went in 
 and stole all the fat. It threw a stone at the 
 muishond, which caused him to look up. 
 
 The muishond cried out : ** The fat belonging 
 to all the animals has been eaten by the 
 inkalimeva." 
 
 As soon as the animals heard the cry, they 
 ran to the kraal and killed the muishond. 
 
 They put fat in the kraal a third time, and 
 appointed the duiker {ivipunzi) to be the 
 keeper of the gate. The duiker agreed, and 
 the others went away. In a short time the 
 inkalimeva made its appearance. It proposed 
 to the duiker that they should play hide and 
 look for. The duiker agreed to this. Then 
 the inkalimeva hid itself, and the duiker looked 
 for it till he was so tired that he lay down and 
 went to sleep. When the duiker was asleep, 
 the inkalimeva ate up all the fat. 
 
 Then it threw a stone at the duiker, which 
 caused him to jump up and cry out : '* The fat

 the inkalimeva.' 
 
 The animals, when they heard the cry, ran 
 to the kraal and killed the duiker. 
 
 They put fat in the kraal the fourth time, 
 and appointed the bluebuck {JLputi) to be the 
 keeper of the gate. When the animals went 
 away, the inkalimeva came as before. 
 
 It said : ** What are you doing by yourself.'*" 
 
 The bluebuck answered : " I am watching 
 the fat belonging to all the animals." 
 
 The inkalimeva said : *' I will be your com- 
 panion. Come, let us seek for vermin in each 
 other's heads." 
 
 The bluebuck agreed to this. The inkali- 
 meva sat down ; it scratched the hearl of the 
 other till he went to sleep. Then it arose and 
 ate all the fat. When it had finished, it threw 
 A Stone at the bluebuck and awakened him. 
 
 The bluebuck saw what had happened and 
 cried out : " The fat belonging to all the 
 animals has been eaten by the inkalimeva." 
 
 Then the animals ran up and killed the blue- 
 buck also. 
 
 They put fat in the kraal the fifth time, and 
 appointed the porcupine {incanda) to be the 
 keeper of the gate. The animals went away,

 It let the porcupine beat in this race. 
 
 Then it said : " I did not think you could

 animals were gone he laid himself down, but 
 he only pretended to be asleep. 
 
 In a short time the inkalimeva went in, and 
 was just going to take the fat when the hare 
 cried out : ** Let the fat alone." 
 
 The inkalimeva said : " Please let me have 
 this little bit only." 
 
 The hare answered, mocking : " Please let 
 me have this little bit only." 
 
 After that they became companions. The 
 hare proposed that they should fasten each 
 other's tail, and the inkalimeva agreed. The 
 inkalimeva fastened the tail of vhe hare first. 
 
 The hare said : " Don't tie my tail so tight." 
 
 Then the hare fastenM the tail of the in- 
 kalimeva. 
 
 The inkalimeva said : " Don't tie my tail 
 so tight;" but the hare made no answer. After 
 tying the tail of the inkalimeva very fast, the 
 hare took his club and killed it. The hare 
 took the tail of the inkalimeva and ate it, all 
 except a little piece which he hid in the fence. 
 
 Then he called out : " The fat belonging to 
 all the animals has been eaten by the inkali- 
 meva." 
 
 The animals came running back, and when 
 they saw that the inkalimeva was dead they

 rejoiced greatly. They asked the hare for the 
 tail, which should be kept for the chief 
 
 The hare replied : •* The one I killed had no 
 tail." 
 
 They said : "How can an inkalimeva be 
 without a tail ? " 
 
 They began to search, and at length they 
 found a piece of the tail in the fence. They 
 told the chief that the hare had eaten the 
 tail. 
 
 He said : '• Bring him to me." 
 
 All the animals ran after the hare, but he 
 fled, and they could not catch him. The hare 
 ran into a hole, at the mouth of which the 
 animals set a snare, and then went away. The 
 hare remained in the hole for many days, but 
 at length he managed to get out without being 
 caught. 
 
 He went to a place where he found a bush- 
 buck (imbabala) building a hut. There was 
 a pot with meat in it on the fire. 
 
 He said to the bushbuck : ** Can I take this 
 little piece of meat ? " 
 
 The bushbuck answered : " You must not 
 do it." 
 
 But he took the meat and ate it all. After- 
 wards he whistled in a particular manner, and 
 there fell a storm of hail which killed the bush-

 and made for himself a mantle. 
 
 After this the hare went into the forest to 
 procure some weapons to fight with. While 
 he was cutting a stick the monkeys threw leav^es 
 upon him. He called to them to come down 
 and beat him. They came down, but he killed 
 them all with his weapons. 
 
 This story terminates so abruptly that I have little doubt 
 about its being merely a fragment. There is a story very 
 similar to it, in which a pool of water is guarded by different 
 animals in turn, all of which are deceived by the jackal.

 STORY OF LION AND LITTLE JACKAL.

 ITTLE Jackal one day went out hunt- 
 ing, when he met Lion. Lion proposed 
 that they should hunt together, on con- 
 dition that if a small antelope was killed 
 it was to be Little Jackal's, and if a large 
 one was killed it was to be Lion's. Little 
 Jackal agreed to this. 
 
 The first animal killed was a large eland. 
 Lion was very glad, and said to Little Jackal : 
 " I will continue hunting while you go to my 
 house and call my children to carry the meat 
 home." 
 
 Little Jackal replied : " Yes, I agree to that." 
 Lion went away to hunt. When he had 
 gone, Little Jackal went to his own house and 
 called his own children to carry away the meat. 
 He said : " Lion takes me for a fool if he thinks 
 I will call his children while my own are dying 
 
 with hunger."

 So Little Jackal's children carried the meat 
 to their home on the top of a high rock. The 
 only way to get to their house was by means 
 of a rope. 
 
 Lion caught nothing more, and after a time 
 he went home and asked his wife where the 
 meat was. She told him there was no meat. 
 He said : " Did not Little Jackal bring a 
 message to my children to carry meat ? " 
 
 His wife replied : " No ; he was not here. 
 We are still dying with hunger." 
 
 Lion then went to Little Jackal's house, but 
 he could not get up the rock to it. So he 
 sat down by the water, waiting. After a time 
 Little Jackal went to get some water. He was 
 close to the water when he saw Lion. He at 
 once ran away, and Lion ran after him. He ran 
 into a hole under a tree, but Lion caught his 
 tail before he got far in. He said to him : 
 " That is not my tail you have hold of ; it is a 
 root of the tree. If you do not believe me, 
 take a stone and strike it, and see if any blood 
 comes." 
 
 Lion let go the tail, and went for a stone to 
 prove what it was. While he was gone for the 
 stone. Little Jackal went far into the hole. 
 When Lion returned, he could not be found. 
 Lion lay down by the hole end waited. After

 a long time Little Jackal wanted to come out. 
 He went to the entrance and looked round, but 
 he could not see Lion. To make sure, he said : 
 ** Ho, I see you, my master, although you are 
 in hiding." 
 
 Lion did not move from the place where he 
 lay concealed. Then Little Jackal went out, 
 and Lion pursued him, but he got away. 
 
 Lion watched for him, and one day, when 
 Little Jackal was out hunting, he came upon 
 him in a place where he could not escape. 
 Lion was just about to spring upon him, when 
 Little Jackal said softly : " Be still, do you not 
 see that bushbuck on the other side of the rock ? 
 I am glad you have come to help me. Just 
 remain here while I run round and drive him 
 towards you." 
 
 Lion did so, and Little Jackal made his 
 escape. 
 
 At another time there was a meeting of the 
 animals, and Lion was the. chief at the meeting. 
 Little Jackal wanted to attend, but there was a 
 law made that no one should be present unless 
 he had horns. So Little Jackal took wax out 
 of a nest of bees, and made horns for himself 
 with it. He fastened the horns on his head, 
 and went to the meetinii. Lion did not know 
 him on account of the horns. But he sat

 near the fire and went to sleep, when the 
 horns melted. 
 
 Lion looked at him and saw who it was. 
 He immediately tried to catch him, but Little 
 Jackal was quick in springing away. He ran 
 under an overhanging rock and sang out : 
 " Help ! help ! this rock is falling upon me !" 
 
 Lion went for a pole to prop up the rock 
 that ^ might get at Little Jackal. While he 
 was away. Little Jackal escaped. 
 
 After that they became companions again, 
 and went hunting another time. They killed 
 an ox. Lion said : " I will watch it while you 
 carry the pieces away." 
 
 Lion gave him the breast, and said : " Take 
 this to my wife." 
 
 Little Jackal took it to his own wife. When 
 he returned. Lion gave a shin, and said : 
 *' Take this to your wife." 
 
 ' Little Jackal took the shin to Lion's house. 
 Lion's wife said : " I cannot take this, because 
 it should not come here." 
 
 Little Jackal thereupon struck Lion's wife in 
 the face, and went back to the place where the 
 ox was killed. Lion gave him a large piece of 
 meat, and said : " Take this to my wife." 
 
 Little Jackal took it to his own wife. This 
 continued till the ox was finished. Then th^,y

 both went home. When Lion arrived at his 
 house he found there was weeping in his family. 
 His wife said: "Is it you who sent Little Jackal 
 to beat me and my children, and is it you who 
 sent this shin ? Did I ever eat a shin ? " 
 
 When Lion heard this he was very angry 
 and at once went to Little Jackal's house. 
 When he reached the rock^ Little Jackal looked 
 down and said : " Who are you, and what is 
 your name, and whose son are you, and where 
 are you from, and where are you going to, and 
 whom do you want, and what do you want him 
 for ? " 
 
 Lion replied : " I have merely come to see 
 you. I wish you to let down the rope." 
 
 Little Jackal let down a rope made of mouse 
 skins, and when Lion climbed a little way up, 
 the rope broke, and he fell and was hurt. He 
 then went home.

 HE language of a Kaffir is adorned with 
 figurative expressions, some of which 
 are readily understood by an English- 
 man, but others, when literally interpreted, 
 are to us meaningless. Such expressions, 
 however, are found upon inquiry to refer to 
 some circumstance in their mode of living, or 
 some event in their traditional history, which 
 makes their meaning very clear. A few of 
 their commonest proverbs and figurative expres- 
 sions are here given : — 
 
 Isikuni sinyuka nomkwezeli. 
 A brand burns him who stirs it up. 
 This proverb is an exact equivalent to our 
 English one, Let sleeping dogs lie. 
 Njengo mdudo ka Mapassa. 
 Like the marriage festivities of Mapassa. 
 This saying is used to denote anything un- 
 usually grand. The marriage festivities of one

 of the-ancients, Mapassa by name, are said to 
 have been carried on for a whole year. 
 
 Ishwa lomhluzi wamanqina. 
 
 Misfortune of soup made of shanks and feet. 
 
 AppHed to any person who never does well, 
 but is always getting into scrapes. The kind of 
 soup spoken of is very lightly esteemed by the 
 Kaffirs. 
 
 Akuko mpukane inqakulela enye. 
 
 One fly does not provide for another. 
 
 A saying of the industrious to the idle, mean- 
 ing that each should work for himself as the 
 flies do. 
 
 Kude e-Bakuba, akuyiwanga mntu. 
 
 Bakuba is far away, no person ever reached 
 it. 
 
 Bakuba is an ideal country. This proverb is 
 used as a warning against undue ambition, or 
 as advice to be content with that which is 
 within reach. It is equivalent to our English 
 saying. It is no use building castles in the air. 
 
 Kuxeliwe e-Xukwane apo kumaqasho ma- 
 kulu. 
 
 They have slaughtered at Kukwane where 
 muc\ meat is obtainable. 
 
 According to tradition, there was once a very

 entertaining strangers in a more liberal manner

 him.. This proverb is used to such as ask too 
 much from others, as if to say, It was only at 
 Kukwane where such expectations were realized. 
 
 Oabu Unoqolomba efile. 
 
 I rejoice that Kolomba's mother is dead.

 saying is used when anything that one has 
 dreaded or disliked has passed away. 
 
 Izinto azimntaka Ngqika zonke.

 fortunate.

 for a time.

 lives in the water, but who goes about as a 
 human dwarf playing tricks upon people. He 
 milks the cows when no one is watching them. 
 He causes women to fall in love with him, for 
 he is of a very amorous disposition towards the 
 fem.ale sex. The uncivilized Kaffirs, even at 
 the present day, do not doubt of the existence 
 of such a being. It is said that a long time ago 
 there was a man of the Amambalu who had 
 good reason to suspect that his wife had fallen 
 in love with Hill. He accordingly pretended 
 to go upon a journey, but returned in the 
 middle of the night and fastened his dogs at 
 the door of his hut. He then went inside and 
 kindled a fire, when, as he anticipated, he found 
 Hili there. The man called his neighbours, 
 who came with sticks, and they beat Hili until 
 he was unable to move. They then tied him 
 up in a bundle, fastened him to the back of the 
 woman, and sent her away to wander wherever 
 she liked. 
 
 This saying is applied as a warning to people 
 to avoid doing wrong, lest the punishment of 
 Hili overtake them. 
 
 Ulahla imbo yako ngopoyiyana. 
 
 You have cast away your own for that which 
 you are not sure of.

 is used as a warning to any one to avoid a bad 
 habit or an unworthy companion that cannot

 Omasiza mbulala. 
 
 The people who rescue and kill. 
 
 This saying is applied to Europeans. It first 
 arose from the heavy demands made by Lord 
 Charles Somerset upon the Gaikas in return for 
 English protection, but the Kaffirs maintain 
 that we have acted up to the description ever 
 since. It is sometimes put in this form, The 
 people who protect with one hand and kill with 
 the other.

 was he who united them against the English 
 after Lord Charles Somerset invaded their 
 country with a view of compelling them to 
 recognise a chief whom they detested. He 
 led in person the attack upon Grahamstown, 
 and only retreated after the flower of his forces 
 was swept away. To obtain peace for his 
 people, he voluntarily surrendered to the 
 English troops, and was sent as a prisoner 
 of state to Robben Island. In attempting to 
 make his escape from the island in a boat, he 
 was drowned. But the Kaffirs would not 
 believe that Makana was dead, for they 
 deemed him immortal. All through the wars 
 of 1835, 1846-7, and 185 1-2, they looked for 
 his reappearance to lead them to victory. 
 Ten years ago his personal ornaments were 
 still in preservation at a village near King 
 William's Town, but about that date the hope 
 of his return was generally abandoned. In- 
 junctions which Makana laid upon his country- 
 men are still implicitly obeyed. Before his 
 time the corpses of common people were not 
 usually interred, but by his orders this has 
 ever since been done. 
 
 The saying implies anything long expected, 
 but which never occurs. It is now in general 
 use, though it is only of a few years' standing.

 This proverb is an exhortation to be hospi- 
 table. It is as if one said, Give food to the 
 traveller, because when you are on a journey 
 your foot will not be able to smell out a man 
 whom you have turned from your door, but to 
 your shame may carry you to his. 
 
 Uzicandele umgalagala. 
 
 You have exposed yourself. 
 
 This saying is applied as a warning not to 
 give anything to an importunate person, as he 
 would very likely be encouraged thereby to 
 continue asking for more.

 He has fastened a dog to a shrub. 
 
 This saying is used to denote a very greedy 
 person, one who is so greedy as to fasten his 
 dog to a shrub that the animal may not beg 
 for food while he is eating. The shrub de-

 beg 
 
 This is a saying of any one who goes away 
 promising to return, and does not do so. It 
 had its origin in an event which happened 
 five generations back. Guluwe was a hunter 
 of great renown, who crossed the Kei with 
 Khakhabay, the great-grandfather of the late 
 Sandile. No man was ever so skilful and 
 successful in the pursuit of game as he. But 
 when Khp.khabay took possession of the A ma- 
 tolas, which he purchased from the Hottentot 
 chieftainess Hoho, he found them infested by 
 great numbers of bushmen. One day Guluwe, 
 who had two young men with him, killed an 
 eland, but while he was still shouting his cry 
 of triumph : " Tsi ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! the 
 weapons of Khakhabay!" he was surprised 
 by a number of these inhuman abatwa. They 
 said : " Look at the sun for the last time, you 
 shall kill no more of our game." Guluwe 
 offered them a large quantity of dacha (a 
 species of wild hemp, used for smoking) for 
 his ransom. One of the abatwa was unwilling 
 to spare him, but all the rest agreed. They 
 kept him w'th them while he pretended to 
 send the two young men for the dacha, but 
 privately he told them not to return. The 
 bushmen then commenced to eat the eland. 
 They ate that day, and all that night,

 never ceasing to watch Guluwe. The next 
 morning they asked him when the young men 
 would be back with the dacha, and he repHed 
 that he did not expect them before sunset. 
 The abatwa, gorged with meat, then lay down 
 to sleep, all except the one who advised that 
 Guluwe should not be spared. That one 
 watched a while longer, but at length he too 
 was overcome by drowsiness. Guluwe then 
 with his assaga' put one after another to death, 
 until, forgetting himself, he shouted his cry : 
 "Tsi! ha! ha! ha! ha! Izikali zika Rarabe !" 
 This awakened the bushman who advised that 
 he should be killed, and who now sprang to 
 his feet and escaped, calling out as he ran with 
 the speed of the wind : " I said this Guluwe of 
 the Khakhabays should be destroyed ; you who 
 are dead have perished through not following 
 my advice."

 SrORY OF THE BiRD THAT MADE MiLK. 
 
 (a) The word amast, translated milk, means that kind of fer- 
 VTiented milk which is used by the Kaffirs. When taken from 
 the covv, the milk is put into a skin bag, where it ferments and 
 acquires a sharp acid taste. When poured out for use by the 
 master of the household, who is the only one permitted to touch 
 the milk-sack, a portion is always left behind to act as leaven. 
 Amasi is very nutritious ; it forms one of the principal articles 
 of food of the Kaffirs, and is relished by most Europeans in 
 Kaffirland. In warm weather, especially, it is a pleasant and 
 wholesome beverage. 
 
 (d) Among the Kaffirs the work of cultivating the ground fell 
 entirely upon the women in olden times. The introduction of 
 the plough has caused a change in this respect, but to the 
 present day the planting and weeding is performed by females. 
 
 (c) Ikuba, a pick or hoe. Before the advent of Europeans, 
 the largest implement that was made was this instrument for 
 breaking up the ground. It was of nearly the same shape as 
 a European hoe ; but in place of having an eye, into which a 
 handle could be fastened, it was made with a top like a spike, 
 which was driven into the large knob of a long and heavy club. 
 It was at best a clumsy tool. 
 
 {d) Kaffir law recognises the right of individuals to possess 
 landed property. The chief allots a piece of ground to a family, 
 by whom it is retained and held in possession as long as it is 
 cultivated. It is forfeited by abandonment for a long time

 without assigning sufficient cause. It cannot be sold. Pasture 
 land is held in common. 
 
 {e) Itunga, a basket used to milk the cows in. It is woven 
 so nicely as to be watertight. The Kaffirs are 'v. making 
 
 baskets and mats, but never attempt to dye an^ . e materials 
 of which they are composed, or otherwise to ornanient them. 
 They use mats as we use dishes, to eat from. 
 
 (/) The potter's art is now being lost by the Kaffirs. The 
 large jars are being replaced by wooden casks purchased from 
 Europeans, and iron pots have already come into general use. 
 
 ig) The Kaffir house has only one opening, which is low and 
 narrow, but which serves for door, window, and chimney. 
 
 {/i) The fireplace is a circle in the centre of the hut. It is 
 made by raising a ring on the hard and smooth antheap floor. 
 Round it the inmates sleep, while the back of the hut, or the 
 side opposite the entrance, is used as p. store room. There the 
 jars and other household utensils would usually be placed. 
 
 (z) Intambo, a riem, or thong of untanned oxhide. 
 
 {j) Equivalent to saying that they journeyed for three days. 
 
 {k) There are no crocodiles in the rivers of the present 
 Amaxosa country, but the reptile and its habits are well known 
 to the people by hearsay. According to their traditions, the 
 tribe migrated from the north-east It is not unlikely that the 
 Xosa belief in a water-spirit which has power to charm people 
 and entice them into rivers to their destruction, may have ori- 
 ginated in the fact of their having come from a country where 
 these destructive animals were common, as the spirit and the 
 reptile have the same name. In this story it is seemingly a 
 crocodile that appears, but very shortly we learn that it is really 
 a man who has been bewitched and forced to assume that 
 appearance. 
 
 (/) Boys " enter manhood," or acquire the privileges of men, 
 by means of the rite of circumcision. 
 
 (w) Up to this point there is nothing to indicate that the 
 girl knew he was not in reality a crocodile, but here it is evident 
 that she was aware he Was a man under the power of a charm, 
 for she uses a proper nme when speaking of him, as is indi- 
 cated by the prefix U. 
 
 (n) The inference from this is that his enemies had bewitched 
 him and made him assume the appearance of a crocodile, but

 ile, but 
 
 The Story of Five Heads. 
 
 In this story some liberty is taken with the Kaffir marriage 
 ceremonies, a description of which will serve as a key to much 
 that is contained in several of these tales. The whole of the 
 ceremonies are included in the term umdudo, a word derived 
 from the verb ukududa, which means to dance by springing up 
 and down, as ukuxentsa means to dance by moving the upper 
 part of the body. The dance at a marriage is considered of 
 more importance than any of the others, and is consequently 
 frequently practised until skill in its performance is attained. 
 
 The marriage of a young Kaffir woman is arranged by her 
 father or guardian, and she is not legally supposed to be con- 
 sulted in the choice of a husband. In point of fact, however, 
 matches arising from mutual love are not uncommon. In such 
 cases, if any difficulties are raised by the guardians on either 
 side, the young people do not scruple to run away together, 
 after which their relatives usually come to an arrangement. 
 Yet instances are not wanting of girls being compelled against 
 their wishes to marry old men, who have already perhaps five 
 or six wives. Kaffir ideas of some kinds of morality are very 
 low. The custom is general for a married woman to have a 
 lover who is not her husband, and little or no disgrace attaches 
 to her on this account. The lover is legally subject to a fine of 
 no great amount, and the husband may give the woman a 
 beating, but that finishes the penalty. 
 
 That which makes a Kaffir marriage binding in their estima- 
 tion, is not the performance of a ceremony, but the transfer of 
 a certain number of cattle, as agreed upon, from the husband or 
 his friends to the father or guardian of the woman. In practice 
 the umdudo is often deferred to a convenient season, yet the 
 woman is considered not less a wife, and her children not less 
 legal, provided always that the transfer of cattle has taken place 
 according to agreement. This system of transfer of cattle is of 
 great advantage to a Kaffir female. It protects her from gross 
 ill-treatment by her husband, as violence gives a woman's rela- 
 tives a right to claim her divorce without restoring the cattle.

 It creates protectors for herself and her children in the persons 
 of all the individuals among whom the cattle arc shared. And 
 lastly, it gives her the status of a married woman in the estima- 
 tion of her people, whereas, if no cattle are transferred, she is 
 not regarded by them as having the rank of a wife. 
 
 Marriages are absolutely prohibited between people of the 
 same family title. This peculiarity seems to indicate that the 
 tribes and clans of the present day are combinations of others 
 that were dispersed before their traditional history commenced. 
 A man may marry a woman of the same clan that he belongs 
 to, provided she is not a blood relative ; but he may not marry 
 a woman whose father's family title is the same as his own, 
 even though no relationship can be traced between them, and 
 the one may belong to the Xosa and the other to the Pondo 
 tribe. As an instance, we will take a man who belongs to, say, 
 the Dushane clan of the Xosa tribe, and whose family title is 
 the Amanywabe. Among the Tembus, the Pondos, the Zulus, 
 and many other tribes, are people with this same family title. 
 They cannot trace any relationship with each other, but wher- 
 ever they are found they have ceremonies peculiar to them- 
 selves. Thus the customs observed at the birth of a child are 
 exactly the same in every part of the country among people 
 of the same family title, though they may never have heard of 
 each other, while neighbours of the same clan, but of different 
 family titles, have these customs altogether dissimilar. All the 
 children take the family title of the father, and can thus marry 
 people of the same family title as the mother, provided they are 
 not closely related in blood. 
 
 Marriage proposals may come from the father or guardian 
 of the young woman, or they may first be made by the man 
 himself or the relatives of the man who wishes to take a wife. 
 The father of a young man frequently selects a bride for him, 
 and intimates his wish by sending a messenger to make pro- 
 posals to the girl's father or guardian. In this ease the mes- 
 senger takes some cattle with him, when, if the advances are 
 favourably received, an assagai is sent back, after which the 
 relatives of the young people discuss and finally arrange the 
 terms of the marriage. If the proposal comes from the girl's 
 father, he sends an assagai, which is accepted if the suit is 
 agreeable, or returned if it is not.

 When the preliminary arrangements are concluded, a bridal 
 procession is formed at the young woman's kraal, to escort her 
 to her future home. It consists of her relatives and all the 
 young people of both sexes who can get away. It leaves at 
 such a time as to arrive at its destination after dark, and en- 
 deavours to reach the place without attracting notice. The 
 bridal party takes with it a cow, given by the bride's father or 
 guardian to confer fortune upon her, and hence called the 
 Inqakwe. This cow is afterwards well taken care of by the 
 husband. The party has also an ox provided by the same 
 person, as his contribution towards the marriage feast. On the 
 'following morning at daylight the ox is killed, when a portion 
 of the meat is taken by the bride's party, and the remainder is 
 left for the people of the kraal. The bridegroom's friends then 
 send messengers to invite the people of the neighbourhood to 
 the feast, and as soon as these arrive the dancing commences. 
 
 In the dance the men stand in lines three, four, or more rows 
 in depth, according to their number, and at a little distance 
 behind the women stand in the same order, that is, they aie 
 ranged as under : —

 The men stand with their heads erect and their arms locked

 sing, the others immediately join in, and at a certain note the 
 whole of the men rise together from the ground. The dance 
 consists merely in springing straight up and coming down with 
 a quivering of the body ; but when the men warm to it, it gives 
 them great satisfaction. The song is very monotonous, the 
 same note occurring at every rise from the ground. This 
 dancing, with intervals of resi. and feasting, continues as long 
 as the bridegroom's relatives supply oxen for slaughter. A day 
 suffices for a poor man, but a rich man's marriage festivities 
 may last a week or upwards. 
 
 On the closing day the bridegroom and his friends march 
 from one hut, while the bride and her party march from another, 
 so as to meet in front of the entrance to the cattle kraal. The 
 bride carries an assagai in her hand, which she throws so as to 
 stick in the ground inside the kraal in an upright position. This 
 is the last of the ceremonies, and the guests immediately begin 
 to disperse, each man taking home the milk-sack which he had 
 brought with him. In olden times ox-races usually took place 
 on the closing day ; but this custom is now falling into neglect. 
 
 The Story of Tangalimliho. 
 
 This is a favourite story, and is therefore very widely known. 
 Sometimes it happens that native girls are employed as nurses 
 by Europeans, and that little children are taught by them to 
 sing, or rather chant the song of the cock, so that this story 
 may even be like " an old acquaintance with a cheerful face " 
 to many a one of our own race who has grown up on the 
 frontier. 
 
 The original of the first song is : — 
 
 Uyalila, uyalila, umta ka Sihamba Ngenyanga. 
 
 Wenziwe ngabomu Sihamba Ngenyanga, 
 
 Ngabantu abantloni. Sihamba Ngenyanga.

 Walia kuka ngomcepe, wajua watshona. Sihamba Ngenyanga. 
 
 Waba kuka nge.xakato, lazix latshona. Sihamba Ngenyanga. 
 
 That of the second is : — 
 
 Ndiyi nkuku njo ndingcbulawc. Kukulu ku-u-u. 
 Ndize kul)ika u-Tangaiimlibo. Kukulu ku-u-u.

 Among the Kaffirs a childless woman finds little or no favour. 
 In many cases she would be treated by her husband in exactly 
 the manner described in this tale, so that by becoming a mother 
 she might say from the bottom of her heart with Elizabeth of 
 old that " her reproach was taken away from among men." 
 Sometimes she is returned by her husband to her parents, a 
 proceeding commonly adopted when she has a marriageable 
 sister who can be given to him in exchange. The husband is 
 required, however, before repudiating his wife, to go through the 
 customary ceremonies, which are as described in the following 
 case tried before me when acting as a border magistrate in 
 1 88 1 : — A, a Kaffir, sued B, another Kaffir, to recover the value 
 of a heifer lent to him two years before under these circum- 
 stances. B's wife, who was distantly related to A, had been 
 married more than a year without bearing a child. B there- 
 upon applied to him for a heifer, the hair of the tail of which 
 was needed by the doctor of the clan to make a charm to put 
 round the woman's neck. He had lent him one for the purpose, 
 and now wanted payment for it. The defence was that A, 
 being the woman's nearest relative who had cattle, was bound 
 to furnish a heifer for the purpose. The hair of the tail was 
 needed, the doctor had made a charm of it and hung it round 
 the woman's neck, and she had thereafter given birth to a son. 
 The heifer could not be returned after being so used. In this 
 case, if the plaintiff had been so nearly related to defendant's 
 wife as to have participated in the benefit of the cattle given by 
 her husband for her, he could not have justified his claim under 
 Kaffir law ; but as he was very distantly connected, he got 
 judgment. The feeling entertained by the Kaffirs about the 
 court in this instance was that IJ had acted very ungratefully 
 towards A, who had not even been present at the woman's 
 marriage feast, but who had cheerfully acted in conformity with 
 the custom which requires that a charm must be made out of 
 the hair of the tail of a heifer belonging to a relative of a child- 
 less wife, in order to cause her to bear children. 
 
 It will be observed that the woman speaks of those whose 
 names arc unmentionable. According to Kaffir custom no

 woman may pronounce the names of any of her husband's 
 male relatives in the ascending line. She is bound to show 
 them the greatest respect, and implicitly to obey their com- 
 mands. She may not sit in the house where her father-in-law 
 is seated, she may not even pronounce any word in which the 
 principal syllable of his name occurs. Thus, a woman who 
 sang the song of Tangalimlibo for me used the word angoca in- 
 stead of amanzi for water, because this last contained the 
 syllable nzi, which she would not on any account pronounce. 
 She had therefore manufactured another word, the meaning of 
 which had to be judged of by the context, as standing alone it 
 is meaningless. 
 
 The beer-drinking company on the mats under a tree, the 
 escort of the bride to her husband, and the wedding feast are 
 true to the life. 
 
 The idea of the Kaffir with regard to drowning is also shown 
 very distinctly in this tale. He believes that a spirit pulls the 
 person under water, and that this spirit is willing sometimes to 
 accept an ox as a ransom for the human victim. How this 
 belief works practically may be illustrated by facts which have 
 come under my own cognizance. 
 
 Some time in 1875, a party of Kaffir girls went to bathe in a 
 httle stream not far from the place where I was then living. 
 There was a deep hole in the stream, into which one of them 
 got, and she was drowned. The others ran away home as 
 fast as they could, and there told a story how their companion 
 had been lured away from their side by the spirit calling her. 
 She was with them, they said, in a shallow part, when sud- 
 d>' nly she stood upright and said, " It is calling." She then 
 walked straight into the deep place, and would not allow any 
 of them to touch her. One of them heard her saying, " Go 
 and tell my father and my mother that it took me." Upon 
 this, the father collected his cattle as quickly as possible, and 
 set off for the stream. The animals were driven into the water 
 while the man stood on the bank imploring the spirit to take 
 the choicest of them and restore his daughter. The failure to 
 get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of 
 the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with 
 medicines. 
 
 On another occasion, a Kaffir was trying to cross one of the

 fords of a river when it was in flood. He was carried away by 
 the current, but succeeded in getting safely to land some 
 quarter of a mile or so further down. Eight or ten lusty 
 fellows saw him carried off his feet, but not one made the 
 slightest effort to help him. On the contrary, they all rushed 
 away frantically, shouting out to the herd boys on the hill sides 
 to drive down the cattle. As might be supposed, the escape of 
 the man from being drowned was then attributed to his being 
 in possession of a powerful charm. 
 
 Besides these spirits, according to the belief of the Kaffirs, 
 there are people living under the water, pretty much as those do 
 who are in the upper air. They have houses auJ furniture, and 
 even cattle, all of their domestic animals being, hc.vever, of a 
 dark colour. They are wiser than other people, and from them 
 the most skilful witchfinders are supposed to obtain a portion 
 of the knowledge of their art. This is not a fancy of children, 
 but the implicit belief of grown-up men and women at the 
 present day. A knowledge of this is of great service to those 
 who have to do with Kaffirs. As an instance, a woman came 
 to me in July, i88r, to beg assistance. A child had died in her 
 village, and the witchfinder had pointed her out as the person 
 who had caused its death. Her husband was absent, and the 
 result of her being " smelt out " was that no one would enter 
 her hut, share food with her, or so much as speak to her. If 
 she was in a path every one fled out of her way, and even her 
 own children avoided her. Being in the colony she could not 
 be otherwise punished, but such treatmv^nt as this would of 
 itself, in course of time, have made her insane. She denied 
 most emphatically having been concerned in the death of the 
 child, though she did not doubt that some one had caused it by 
 means of witchcraft. The witchfinder was sent for, and, as the 
 matter was considered an important one, a larger number of 
 Kaffirs than usual appeared at the investigation. On putting 
 the ordinary tests to the witchfinder he failed to meet them, and 
 when he was compelled, reluctantly, to admit that he had never 
 held converse with the people under the water, it was easy to 
 convince the bystanders that he was only an impostor.

 Story of the Girl who Disregarded the Custom of 
 
 Ntonjane. ' 
 
 A large proportion of Kaffir tales have a similar termination 
 with many English ones ; the heroine gets married to a prince. 
 These show that a desire for worldly rank is as great in the one 
 people as in the other. Most Kaffir tales are destitute of moral 
 teaching from our point of view. What recommendation, for 
 instance, has the girl in this story to the favour of the young 
 chief.'' 
 
 The custom which the chief's daughter disregarded is the 
 following : — 
 
 When a Kaffir girl arrives at the age of puberty, messengers 
 are sent by her father to all the neighbouring villages to invite 
 the young women to attend the " Ntonjane." The girl in the 
 meantime is kept secluded in the house of an aunt, or other 
 female relative, and her father does noc see her. Soon parties 
 are seen coming from all sides, singing as they march. The 
 first party that arrives halts in front of the cattle kraal, where it 
 is joined by those that come after. When the girls are all 
 assembled, the father chooses an ox to be slaughtered. The 
 meat is cooked, and men and women come from all directions 
 to the feast. The men then instruct the women to dress the 
 girls for the dance, and when this is done they are ranged in 
 rows in front of the cattle kraal. They are almost naked, 
 having on only a girdle round the waist, and an apron, called 
 cacawe, made for the occasion out of the leaves of a certain 
 plant. In their hands they hold assagais, using them as walk- 
 ing sticks. 
 
 When all is ready, four of the girls step out of the front row 
 and dance, the rest singing ; and when these are tired four 
 others step out, and so on, until all the girls present have 
 danced. The spectators then applaud the best dancer, or if 
 they do not at once unanimously fix upon the same person, the 
 girls dance until all present agree. 
 
 The girls then give room to the men and women, who form 
 themselves in lines in the same manner, and dance until it is 
 decided which of them surpass the others. The dancing is 
 continued until sunset, when the men and women return home,

 leaving the party of girls (called the "jaka") who remain over- 
 night. 
 
 Next day dancing is resumed in the same order, the guests 
 usually arriving very early in the morning. 
 
 If the girl's father is a rich man three oxen are slaughtered, 
 and the ntonjane is kept up for twelve days. On the thirteenth 
 day the young woman comes out of the house where she has 
 all the time been living apart from her family. If the girl is 
 a chiefs daughter the ntonjane is kept up for twenty- four days. 
 All the councillors send oxen to be slaughtered, that there may 
 be plenty for the guests to eat. 
 
 The following ceremony takes place on the occasion of a 
 chiefs daughter coming out of the house in which she was con- 
 cealed during the twenty-four days : — 
 
 A son of her father's chief councillor puts on his head the 
 two wings of a blue crane (the indwe), regarded by the Kaffirs 
 as an emblem of bravery only to be worn by veterans in time of 
 war. He goes into the house where she is, and when he comes 
 out she follows him. They march towards the kraal where the 
 dancing took place, the girl's mother, the jaka, or party of 
 young women, the girl's father, and his councillors, forming a 
 procession. More cattle are slaughtered for the *' indwe," and 
 then dancing is renewed, after which the girl drinks milk for 
 the first time since the day when she was concealed in the 
 house. Large skins containing milk are sent from different 
 kraals to the place where the ntonjane is held. Some milk is 
 put into a small vessel made of rushes, a little of it is poured 
 on the fireplace, the aunt, or other female relative, in whose 
 charge the girl was, takes the first mouthful, then she gives the 
 milk to the girl, who, after having drunk, is taken to her 
 mother's house. The people then disperse, and the ntonjane 
 is over. 
 
 This ceremony is frequently attended with gross licentious- 
 ness. The girls of the jaka are allowed by immemorial custom 
 to select sweethearts, and this liberty often leads to depravity. 
 
 The Story of Simbukumbukwana. 
 
 Charms and medicines for the cure of diseases are classed 
 together by the Kaffirs. Some of the women as well as of the 
 men have really a wonderful knowledge of the properties of

 herbs and roots. They are acquainted with various vegetable 
 poisons and with their antidotes, and not unfrequently make use 
 of them. 
 
 A case recently came before me for investigation, in which 
 a Kaffir woman was suspected of having administered poison to 
 another person. In her hut a great variety of roots and dried 
 herbs was found. These were carefully separated, and then 
 persons skilled in such matters were brought to give evidence as 
 to their properties. Anything like collusion was impossible, yet 
 each one without hesitation stated what each medicine was to 
 be used for, and all agreed. 
 
 One plant was for curing stomach-ache, another acted as an 
 emetic, a third cured the sting of a venomous insect, and so on. 
 But among them was a plant to be chewed when crossing a 
 strea»Ti, to prevent the river spirit from biting a person. Another 
 was a root to be used to gain the favour of a judge during a trial. 
 The method of using this last was as follows : — 
 
 A portion of it was to be placed upon some coals, over which 
 the man was to sit, covering himself and the fire with his mantle 
 so as to be thoroughly smoked. During the trial another por- 
 tion was to be kept in the mouth. 
 
 Not the slightest distinction was made by the witnesses be- 
 tween these different kinds of " medicines." 
 
 The Kaffir is a perfect slave to charms, and hardly ever under- 
 takes any matter of importance without using them. 
 
 The Story of Sikulume. 
 
 The game called Iceya is mentioned in this story as being 
 played in the rock that became a hut. The games with which 
 Kaffir boys are accustomed to amuse themselves are, as a rule 
 such as require a large amount of exertion of legs, arms and 
 lungs. In the European towns, and at Mission stations, they 
 have generally adopted the English game of cricket, but at 
 their own kraals they still practise the sports of their ancestors. 
 
 At a very early age they commence trials of skill against each 
 other in throwing knobbed sticks and imitation assagais. They 
 may often be seen enjoying this exercise in little groups, those 
 of the same age keeping together, for there is no greater tyrant 
 in the world than the big Kaffir boy over his younger fellows. 
 Commencing with an ant-heap at a distance of ten or fifteen

 yards, for a target, they gr- dually become so perfect that tliey 
 can hit an object a foot square at double and even treble that 
 distance. The knobbed stick and the imitation assagai are 
 thrown in different ways, the object of the first being to inflict 
 a heavy blow upon the mark aimed at, while that of the last is 
 to pierce it. This exercise strengthens the muscles of the arms, 
 and gives expansion to the chest. The result is that when the 
 boys are circumcised and become men, they are able to use 
 their weapons without any further training. When practising, 
 they keep up a contmual noise, and if an unusually successful 
 hit is made the thrower shouts the common Kaffir cry of exulta- 
 tion, Tsi ! ha ! ha ! ha 1 ha ! Izikali zika Rarabe ! (The wea- 
 pons of Khkkhabay). 
 
 Kaffir boys above the age of nine or ten years are fond of 
 shamfighting with sticks. They stand in couples, each with a 
 foot advanced to meet that of his antagonist, and with a cudgel 
 elevated in the right hand. Each fixes his eye upon the eye of 
 his opponent, and seeks to ward off blows as well as to inflict 
 them. In these contests pretty hard strokes are sometimes 
 given and received with the utmost good humour. 
 
 A game of which they are very fond is an imitation hunt. In 
 this, one of them represents a wild animal of some kind, a 
 second acts as a hunter, and the others take the part of dogs 
 in pursuit. A space is marked off, within which the one chased 
 is allowed to take breath, when he is said to be in the bush. 
 He tries to imitate as closely as possible the animal he is 
 representing. Thus if he is an antelope he simply runs, but if 
 he is a lion he stands and fights. 
 
 The calves of the kraal are under the care of the boys, and a 
 good deal of time is passed in training them to run and to obey 
 signals made by whistling. The boys mount them when they 
 are eighteen months or two years old, and race about upon their 
 backs. When the boys 'i.re engaged in any sport, one of the 
 number is selected by lot to tend the calves. As many blades of 
 grass as there are boys are take.^, and a knot is made on the 
 end of one of them. The biggest boy holds the blades between 
 the fingers and thumb of his closed hand, and whoever draws 
 the blade with the knot has to act as herdsman. 
 
 They have also a simple game called hide and look for. 
 
 If they chance to be disinclined for active exercise, they amuse

 themselves by moulding clay into little images of cattle, or by 
 making puzzles with strings. Some of them are skilful in form- 
 ing kno^s with thongs and pieces of wood, which it taxes the 
 ingenuity of the others to undo. The cleverest of them some- 
 times practise tricks of deception with grains of maize. They 
 are so sharp that although one is sure that he actually sees the 
 grain taken into the right hand, that hand when opened will be 
 found empty and the maize will be contained in the left, or per- 
 haps it will be exhibited somewhere else. 
 
 The above comprise the common out-door sports of boys up 
 to the age of fourteen or fifteen years. At that time of life they 
 usually begin to practise the different dances which they will 
 be required to take part in when they become men. These 
 dances differ one from another almost as much as those prac- 
 tised by Europeans. 
 
 The commonest indoor game of the Kaffirs is the one called 
 Iceya. This can be played by two persons or any number 
 exceeding two. The players sit in a circle, and each has a little 
 piece of wood, a grain of corn, or something of the kind. It 
 must be so small that it can easily be concealed in a folded 
 hand, and no player must have more than one. If there are 
 many players they form themselves into sides or parties, but 
 when they are few in number one plays against the rest. This 
 one conceals the toy in either of his hands, and throwing both 
 arms out against an opponent he announces himself either as 
 an Inhlangano (one who meets), or an Ipambo (one who evades). 
 His opponent throws his arms out in the same manner, so that 
 his right hand shall be opposite the first player's left, and his 
 leftoppor'e the first player's right. The clenched hands are 
 then ope-wU, and if the toys are found to meet, the first player 
 wins if he has called himself an inhlangano, or loses if an 
 ipambo. If the toys do not meet, the case is reversed. When 
 there are many players, one after another is beaten until two 
 only are left. This part of the game is called the Umnyadala 
 (the winding up). Those two then play against each other, and 
 the one who is beaten is said to be left with the umnyadala, and 
 is laughed at. The winner is greeted as the wearer of the tiger 
 skin mantle. In playing, the arms are thrown out very quickly, 
 and the words are rapidly uttered, so that a stranger might 
 fancy there was neither order nor rule observed. Young men

 and boys often spend whole nights playing the Iceya, which has 
 the same hold upon them as dice upon some Europeans. 
 
 Next to the Iceya, the most popular indoor game with Kaffir 
 children is the Imfumba. One of the players takes a grain of 
 maize, or any other small substance, in his hands, and pretends 
 to place it in the hands of the others, who are seated in a circle 
 around him. He may really give it to one of them, or he may 
 keep it himself. One is then selected to guess in whose posses- 
 sion it is.* 
 
 The last of the Kaffir indoor games is called Cumbelele. 
 Three or four children stand with their closed hands on top of 
 each other, so as to form a column. They sing *' Cumbelele, 
 cumbelele, pangalala," and at the last la they draw their hands 
 back sharply, each one pinching with his thumb nail the hand 
 above. 
 
 Toys, as playthings, are few in number. Bows and arrows 
 are sometimes seen, but generally boys prefer an imitation 
 assagai. 
 
 The nodiwu is a piece of wood about six or eight inches long, 
 an inch and a half or two inches wide, and an eighth or a quarter 
 of an inch thick in the middle. Towards the edges it is bevelled 
 ofif, so that the surface is convex, or consists of two inclined 
 planes. At one end it has a thong attached to it by which it is 
 whirled rapidly round. The other end of the thong is usually 
 fastened to a small round piece of wood used as a handle. The 
 nodiwu, when whirled round gives forth a noise that can be heard 
 at a considerable distance. Besides the use which it is put to 
 by the lads, when a little child is crying inside a hut its mother 
 or nurse will sometimes get a boy to make a noise with a nodiwu 
 outside, and then induce the child to be still by pretending that 
 a monster is coming to devour it. There is a kind of super- 
 stition connected with the nodiwu, that playing with it invites a 
 gale of wind. Men will, on this account, often prevent boys 
 from using it when they desire calm weather for any purpose

 * A Kaffir who went with the mission party from Lovedale to Lake 
 Nyassa, and remained there several years, informs me that he found the 
 Imfumba the commonest game of the children in that part of Africa. When 
 he had learned the language of the people there, he was surprised to hear 
 many of the common Kaffir folklore stories told nearly as he had heard 
 them related by Gaika women when he was a boy.

 This superstition is identical with that which prevents many 
 sailors from whistling at sea. 
 
 The Story of Hlakanyana. 
 
 I have greatly reduced this story in bulk by leaving out end- 
 less repetitions of exactly the same trick, but performed upon 
 different individuals or animals. In all other respects it is com^ 
 plete. The word Hlakanyana means the little deceiver. 
 
 The Story of Demane and Demazana. 
 Among the natives of South Africa relationship is viewed 
 differently from what it is by Europeans. I have heard more 
 than once Kaffirs accused of falsehood because they asserted 
 one person to be their father or mother at one time and a dif- 
 ferent person at another time. Yet they were telling the truth 
 according to their ideas. A common complaint concerning native 
 servant girls is that they claim every other person they meet as 
 a brother or a sister. Now, from their point of view, what we 
 would term cousins are really brothers and sisters. It is not 
 poverty of language, for they have words to express shades of 
 relationship where we have none, but a difference of ideas, that 
 causes them to use the same word for father and paternal uncle, 
 for brother and cousin, etc. Bawo is the word used in address- 
 ing father, father's brother, or father's half-brother. Little chil- 
 dren say Tata. But there are three different words for father, 
 according as a person is speaking of his own father or uncle, of 
 the father or uncle of the person he is speaking to, or of the 
 father or uncle of the person he is speaking of. Speaking of 
 tny father, bawo is the word used : of your father, ttyihloj of 
 his father, uyise. Malume is the brother of any one called 
 mother. Ma is the word used in addressing mother, any wife 
 of father, or the sister of any of these. The one we would term 
 mother can only be distinguished from the others, when speak- 
 ing of her, by describing her as uma warn kanye — i.e.^ my real 
 mother; or uma ondtzalayo—i.e., the mother who bore me. 
 Speaking of my mother, tna is the word used : of your mother, 
 unyokoj of his or her mother, unina. A paternal aunt is 
 ad iressed as dadebobawo — i.e., sister of my father. Mnakwetu 
 is the word used by females in addressing a brother, half-brother, 
 or male cousin. Males, when addressing any of these relations 
 
 i ,1

 older than themselves, use the word nikuluwa; and when 
 addressing one younger than themselves say mninawe. Dade 
 is used in addressing a sister, a half-sister, or a female cousin. 
 Females, when speaking to any of these relations younger than 
 themselves, usually say msakwetu. Mtakama is an endearing 
 form of expression, meaning child of my mother. Bawomkulu 
 is the address of a grandfather. Makulu is grandmother. 
 Mtshana is the son of a sister. 
 
 The Runaway Children. 
 
 There are three or four versions of this story, but all agree 
 in the main points. In one, it is the grandmother of the chil- 
 dren who is the cannibal, in another, it is their mother, and in 
 a third it is the husband of their aunt. One version makes 
 Magoda escape with the children, and introduces a great deal 
 of obscenity. The parts referring to the bird and the manner 
 of the children's delivery are the same in all. So also is the 
 episode of the broken pot, but the conversation between the two 
 girls differs in some respects. 
 
 When a Kaffir woman is married, her husband's parents give 
 her a new name, by which she is known to his family ever after. 
 Upon the birth of her first child, whether son or daughter, she 
 is frequently called by every one else after the name given to the 
 child, •' the mother of so-and-so." 
 
 The ntengu is rather larger than a swallow, and is of a bright 
 bluish-black colour. It may often be seen on the backs of 
 cattle, seeking for insects on which it feeds. 
 
 The Girl and the Mbulu. 
 
 The mbulu is a fabulous creature, firmly believed in by little 
 folks. It can assume the human form, but cannot part with its 
 tail. One of its peculiarities is that it nsver speaks the truth 
 when it is possible to tell a falsehood. 
 
 The Story of Long Snake. 
 
 In this story the girls are represented as taking fermented 
 milk to the man. This is not in accordance with ordinary 
 Kaffir usage, which prohibits females from serving out milk. 
 But Long Snake, though a man, has been bewitched and

 obliged to assume the appearance of a serpent, retaining how- 
 ever the faculties of a human being. 
 
 Kaffir women grind, or rather bruise, millet by putting it on 
 a flat stone, before which the worker kneels, and crushing it 
 with a small round stone held in the hands. When several are 
 working near each other of an evening, they usually lighten 
 their labours by a rude chant. The bruised substance is mixed 
 with water, and formed into small loaves of very insipid bread. 
 
 The Story of Kenkebe. 
 
 In the above story Kenkebe is represented as the personifi- 
 cation of selfish greed. In this character his name has passed 
 into a common proverb — 
 
 Sibayeni sonke, Kenkebe. 
 
 We are all bridegrooms, Kenkebe. 
 
 This saying is used to any one who does not readily share 
 food with others. It means, we are all entitled to a portion, 
 you greedy one. A Kaffir, when eating, commonly shares his 
 food with any others who may be present at the time. 
 
 Story of Lion and Little Jackal. 
 
 This story is very likely of Hottentot origin. It is generally 
 told by the Kaffirs, but I have observed that it is a special 
 favourite in places only where there is a very strong- tinge of 
 Hottentot blood. 
 
 It is capable of indefinite extension by the narrator, but the 
 tricks of Little Jackal are always very silly ones, ""he above 
 are among the best of them.
