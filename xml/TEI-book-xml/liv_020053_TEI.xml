Livingstone</persName>; but, as I do not feel sure that any one has thoroughly
examined the men who came down with his remains, I briefly
summarize what I have been able to glean from a careful <w>cross-examination</w>
of <persName>Majwara</persName>, who was always at his side during his
last days, and <persName>Susi</persName>, as well as the <term type="collective"><settlement>Nassik</settlement> boys</term>, have, generally,
confirmed what he says. I enclose a small sketch map, merely
giving my idea of the locality, and have added a dotted line to
show his route during this last journey of his life.</p>
<p>"The party sent by <persName>Stanley</persName> left <settlement>Unyanyembe</settlement> with the Doctor
about the end of <date when="1872-08">August, 1872</date>, and marched straight to the south
of <geogName>Lake Tanganyika</geogName>, through <region>Ufipa</region>, crossing the <geogName>Rungwa River</geogName>,
where they met with natural springs of boiling water, bubbling up
high above the ground. On reaching the <geogName>Chambezi</geogName>, or <geogName>Kambezi
River</geogName>, they crossed it about a week's journey from <geogName>Lake Bemba</geogName>,
also crossing a large feeder; but, by <persName>Susi</persName>'s advice, <persName>Livingstone</persName>
again turned northward, and recrossed the <geogName>Kambezi</geogName>, or <geogName>Luapula</geogName>, as
he then called it, just before it entered the lake.</p>
<p>"He could not, however, keep close to the <region>north shore of <geogName>Lake
Bemba</geogName></region>, owing to the numerous creeks and streams, which were
hidden in forests of high <term type="plant">grass</term> and <term type="plant">rushes</term>. After making a détour,
he again struck the lake at a village, where he got canoes across to
an island in the centre, called <geogName>Matipa</geogName>. Here the shores on either
hand were not visible, and the Doctor was put to great straits by
the natives declining to let him use their canoes to cross to the
opposite shore. He therefore seized seven canoes by force, and
when the natives made a show of resistance, he fired his pistol
over their heads, after which they ceased to obstruct him. Crossing
the lake diagonally, he arrived in a long valley, and the rains
having now set in fully, the caravan had to wade, rather than <lb/>

walk, constantly crossing blind streams, and, in fact, owing to the
high <term type="plant">rushes</term> and <term type="plant">grass</term>, hardly being able to distinguish at times the
land, or rather what was generally dry land, from the lake.</p>
<p>"<persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName> had been weak and ailing since leaving <settlement>Unyanyembe</settlement>,
and when passing through the country of <region>Ukabende</region>, at
the south-west of the lake, he told <persName>Majwara</persName> (the boy given him by
<persName>Stanley</persName>, who is now in my service) that he felt unable to go on
with his work, but should try and cross the hills to <region>Katanga</region>
[<region>Katanda</region>?], and there rest, endeavouring to buy ivory, which in all
this country is very cheap (three yards of merikani buying a slave or
a tusk), and returning to <settlement>Ujiji</settlement> through <region>Manyuema</region> to recruit and
reorganise.</p>
<p>"But as he approached the <region>northern part of <region>Bisa</region></region> (a very large
country), arriving in the <region>Province of Ulala</region>, he first had to take to
riding a <term type="animal">donkey</term>, and then suffer himself to be carried on a <foreign>kitanda</foreign>
(native bedstead), which at first went much against the grain.</p>
<p>"During this time he never allowed the boy <persName>Majwara</persName> to leave
him, and he then told that faithful and honest fellow that he should
never cross the high hills to <region>Katanda</region>.</p>
<p>"He called for <persName>Susi</persName>, and asked how far it was to the <geogName>Luapula</geogName>,
and, on his answering 'three days,' remarked, 'he should never see
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> river again.'</p>
<p>"On arriving at <settlement>Ilala</settlement>, the capital of the district, where <persName>Kitambo</persName>
the sultan lived, the party were refused permission to stay, and
they carried <persName>Livingstone</persName> three hours' march back towards <region>Kabende</region>.
Here they erected for him a rude hut and fence, and he would not
allow any to approach him for the remaining days of his life except
<persName>Majwara</persName> and <persName>Susi</persName>, except that every morning they were all desired
to come to the door and say 'good morning.'</p>
<p>"During these few days he was in great pain, and could keep
nothing, even for a moment, on his stomach. He lost his sight so
far as hardly to be able to distinguish when a light was kindled,
and gradually sank during the night of the <date when="1873-05-04">4th May, 1873</date>.</p>
<p>"Only <persName>Majwara</persName> was present when he died, and he is unable to
say when he ceased to breathe.</p>
<p>"<persName>Susi</persName>, hearing that he was dead, told <persName>Jacob Wainwright</persName> to make
a note in the Doctor's diary of the things found by him. <persName>Wainwright</persName>
was not quite certain as to the day of the month, and as
<persName>Susi</persName> told him the Doctor had last written the day before, and he
found this entry to be dated <date when="1873-04-27">27th April</date>, he wrote <date when="1873-04-28">28th April</date>, but
on comparing his own diary on arrival at <settlement>Unyanyembe</settlement> he found it
to be the <date when="1873-05-04">4th of May</date>; and this is confirmed by <persName>Majwara</persName>, who says
<persName>Livingstone</persName> was unable to write for the last four or five days of his <lb/>
