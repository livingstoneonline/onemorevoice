<p rend="center caps">To the Editor of the Times.</p> 

<p>Sir,&#8212;You did me the favour recently to insert a few lines respecting <persName>Chumah</persName> and <persName>Susi</persName>, who, after serving <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName> since <date when="1864">1864</date>, headed the <hi rend="italic">cortége</hi> which brought their master's body some 1,500 miles to the coast and saved all his priceless journals, papers, and notes.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy and kindness of <persName>Captain L. Brine</persName>, of Her Majesty's ship <persName>Briton</persName>, the senior officer on the <placeName><region>East Coast</region> Station</placeName><!-- Not sure if this is persName or should be org as she's a figurehead of the govt? HB --><!-- No, see new coding rules. AW -->, I have received tho following communications. <persName>Captain Brine</persName> says:-</p>

<p>"<persName>Chumah</persName> and <persName>Susi</persName> have been on board to see me this morning, and <persName>Chumah</persName> asked me to write a letter to you for him, and I send you what he dictated. '<persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName> died at <settlement>Ulala</settlement>, near the <region>S.W. bend of <geogName>Lake Bangweolo</geogName></region> on the <date when="1873-04-30">30th of April</date>. He was at the time on his way to discover the existence or non-existence of tho <geogName>four fountains of <persName>Herodotus</persName></geogName>.' Their existence is affirmed, <persName>Chumah</persName> tells me, by all the people they met around <geogName>Lake Bangweolo</geogName>."</p> 

<p>Here is <persName>Chumah</persName>'s letter:&#8212;</p> 

<p>"<persName>Chumah</persName> gives compliments to <persName>Mr. Waller</persName>. I have been all over with <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName> in <bloc>Africa</bloc>, and am now in <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> with my wife. I am now by myself. I do not know what work to do. Give compliments to my sister, who is at the <region>Cape</region>. <choice><sic>His</sic><corr>Her</corr></choice> name <persName>Chaika</persName>. I hear it with <persName>Dr. <!-- Is His supposed to be Her here if he's talking about his sister? HB --><!-- Yes, corrected. AW --> Livingstone</persName> that letters came to him that <persName>Kinsolo</persName>, my brother, been shot with a gun. I don't know who shoot him. If please you get answer, send to me at <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName>. <persName>Susi</persName>, <term type="collective">Kibanga man</term>, give <choice><sic>him</sic><corr>his</corr></choice> compliments to <persName>Mr. Waller</persName> and to <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName>'s son, and now he is in <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> and will wait for a letter. If you have got any business in <bloc>Africa</bloc>, let us know. We want to go in <bloc>Africa</bloc> again where <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName> died. <seg rend="right caps">"<persName>Chumah</persName>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></seg></p><!-- Definitely compromise coding in the way Chumah's name is done for now. AW -->

<p>"<persName>Susi</persName> don't know write."</p>

<p>I will merely add that on starting upon this last fatal journey in <date when="1866">1866</date>, <persName>Chumah</persName>, then a lad of about 14 years, promised me in a similar epistle that he would stick to the <persName>Doctor</persName>, come what might. He has kept his word. In speaking of <persName>Chinsoro</persName> and <persName>Chasika</persName>, he uses the native idiom ; they were not blood relatives. <persName>Chinsoro</persName> was murdered some years since under circumstances so brutal that I can understand <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName> in suppressing the details in mentioning the fact to him. <persName>Chasika</persName>, <persName>Chinsoro</persName>'s widow, is very poorly off at <region>the Cape</region>. Both, in company with <persName>Chumah</persName>, were originally liberated by us from the slavers. <!-- Are we coding slavers somehow? HB --><!-- No. --> <persName>Chumah</persName>'s wife seems a new acquisition.</p>

<p>Thanks to the heroic conduct of these men an enormous mass of geographlcal information is now in the possession of <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName>'s family. In common with others I have received very long communications from him which I will not touch on now beyond stating that there is continual evidence in them that at <settlement>Ujiji</settlement>, at <settlement>Unyanyembe</settlement>&#8212;in short, at every point between the coast and <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName>'s <!-- Not sure if the whole area of exploring grounds gets a tag too? HB --><!-- OK as is. I'm not even sure we should code generic regions like this. AW --> exploring ground, the <term type="collective">Arabs</term> were fully aware how suicidal it was to allow him to correspond with the outer world. It was, in fact, death to be caught taking letters on his behalf. Wise in their generation, they knew the slave trade was crumbling to pieces under the fierce glance of his observations.</p>

<p>Would that the tried spirit could have known what we knew before it passed away to its rest ! Instead of the annual 20,000 slaves being imported into <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> in <date when="1873">1873</date>, thence to be dispersed on the four winds of bondage, we reduced the number by recent active exertions to a total export of 1,400 only, thus mightily had he dealt his blows, not in the dark, but in total ignorance of all the interest excited by his revelations and the measures taken in consequence of his former letters. Alas, that we must thus speak in the past tense !</p>

<p>Already in <date when="1874">1874</date> the tide is turned. Law officers stand in the stead of him who is no more. The slave trade is reviving hand over hand, and, with shame and indignation, we are forced to admit that such men as <persName>Livingstone</persName> may come and go, but red tape flows on for ever.</p>
