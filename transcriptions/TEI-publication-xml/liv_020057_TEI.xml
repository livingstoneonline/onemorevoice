<lb/><p rend="center"><seg rend="italic">Notes on Refugee Tribes encountered in July</seg> 1903.</p>

<lb/><p><seg rend="caps">Hearing</seg> of the <term type="collective">L* refugees</term> from <settlement>I*</settlement>, I decided to visit the nearest Settlement of these 
fugitives, some 20 miles away, to see them for myself.</p>

<p>At <settlement>N*</settlement> found large town of <term type="collective">K*</term>, and scattered through it many small settlements of <term type="collective">L* 
refugees</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The town of <settlement>N*</settlement> consists approximately of seventy-one <term type="collective">K*</term> houses, and seventy-three 
occupied by <term type="collective">L*</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These latter seemed industrious, simple folk, many weaving <term type="plant">palm</term> fibre into 
mats or <term type="collective">native</term> cloth; others had smithies, working brass wire into bracelets, chains, and anklets; 
some iron-workers making knives.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sitting down in one of these blacksmith’s sheds, the five men 
at work ceased and came over to talk to us.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I counted ten women, six grown-up men, and eight 
lads and women in this one shed of <term type="collective">L*</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I then asked them to tell me why they had left their 
homes.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Three of the men sat down in front of me, and told a tale which I cannot think can be true, 
but it seemed to come straight from their hearts.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I repeatedly asked certain parts to be 
gone over again while I wrote in my note-book.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The fact of my writing down and asking for 
names, &amp;c., seemed to impress them, and they spoke with what certainly impressed me as being 
great sincerity.</p>

<p>I asked, first, why they had left their homes, and had come to live in a strange far-off country 
among the <term type="collective">K*</term>, where they owned nothing, and were little better than servitors.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>All, when this 
question was put, women as well, shouted out, “On account of the rubber tax levied by the 
<orgName>Government</orgName> posts.”</p>

<p>I asked particularly the names of the places whence they had come.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They answered they 
were from <settlement>V**</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Other <term type="collective">L* refugees</term> here at <settlement>N*</settlement> were <term type="collective">W**</term>, others again were <term type="collective">X**</term>, but all 
had fled from their homes for the same reason&#8212;it was the “rubber tax.”</p>

<p>I asked then how this tax was imposed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>One of them, who had been hammering out an iron 
neck collar on my arrival, spoke first.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He said :&#8212;</p>

<p>“I am <persName>N N</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These other two beside me are <persName>O O</persName> and <persName>P P</persName>, all of us <term type="collective">Y**</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>From 
our country each village had to take twenty loads of rubber.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These loads were big : they 
were as big as this<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(Producing an empty basket which came nearly up to the handle of my 
walking-stick.)<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“That was the first size.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We had to fill that up, but as rubber got scarcer the 
<term type="collective">white man</term> reduced the amount.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We had to take these loads in four times a-month.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“How much pay did you get for this?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(Entire audience.)<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“We got no pay!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We got nothing!”</p>

<p>And then N N, whom I asked, again said :&#8212;</p>

<p>“Our village got cloth and a little <term type="foodstuff">salt</term>, but not the people who did the work.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Our Chiefs 
eat up the cloth; the workers got nothing.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The pay was a fathom of cloth and a little <term type="foodstuff">salt</term> 
for every big basket full, but it was given to the Chief, never to the men.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It used to take ten 
days to get the twenty baskets of rubber&#8212;we were always in the forest and then when we were 
late we were killed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We had to go further and further into the forest to find the <term type="plant">rubber 
vines</term>, to go without food, and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Then we starved.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Wild beasts&#8212;the <term type="animal">leopards</term>&#8212;killed some of us when we were working away in 
the forest, and others got lost or died from exposure and starvation, and we begged the <term type="collective">white 
man</term> to leave us alone, saying we could get no more rubber, but the <term type="collective">white men and their soldiers</term> 
said : ‘Go!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You are only beasts yourselves, you are <term type="foodstuff"><foreign>nyama</foreign> (meat)</term>.’<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We tried, always going 
further into the forest, and when we failed and our rubber was short, the soldiers came to our 
towns and killed us.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Many were shot, some had their ears cut off; others were tied up with 
ropes around their necks and bodies and taken away.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white men</term> sometimes at the posts <lb/>


    <pb facs="liv_020058_0061" n="0061"/>
<fw><seg rend="center">61</seg></fw>
did not know of the bad things the soldiers did to us, but it was the <term type="collective">white men</term> who sent the 
soldiers to punish us for not bringing in enough rubber.”</p>

<p>Here <persName>P P</persName> took up the tale from <persName>N N</persName> :&#8212;</p>

<p>“We said to the <term type="collective">white men</term>, ‘We are not enough people now to do what you want us.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Our 
country has not many people in it and we are dying fast.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We are killed by the work you make 
us do, by the stoppage of our plantations, and the breaking up of our homes.’<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term> 
looked at us and said : ‘There are lots of people in <bloc>Mputu</bloc>’”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(<bloc>Europe</bloc>, the <term type="collective">white man</term>’s country).<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
“‘If there are lots of people in the <term type="collective">white man</term>’s country there must be many people in the <term type="collective">black 
man</term>’s country.’<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term> who said this was the chief <term type="collective">white man</term> at <settlement>F F*</settlement>, his name was 
<persName>A B</persName>, he was a very bad man.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Other <orgName><term type="collective">white men</term> of <foreign>Bula Matadi</foreign></orgName> who had been bad and wicked 
were <persName>B C</persName>, <persName>C D</persName>, and <persName>D E</persName>.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“These had killed us often, and killed us by their own hands as well 
as by their soldiers.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Some <term type="collective">white men</term> were good.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These were <persName>E F</persName>, <persName>F G</persName>, <persName>G H</persName>, <persName>H I</persName>, <persName>I K</persName>, <persName>K L</persName>.”</p>

<p>These ones told them to stay in their homes and did not hunt and chase them as the others 
had done, but after what they had suffered they did not trust more any one’s word, and they had 
fled from their country and were now going to stay here, far from their homes, in this country 
where there was no rubber.</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“How long is it since you left your homes, since the big trouble you speak of?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“It lasted for three full seasons, and it is now four seasons since we fled and came into 
the <region><term type="collective">K*</term> country</region>.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“How many days is it from <settlement>N*</settlement> to your own country?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Six days of quick marching.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We fled because we could not endure the things done to 
us.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Our Chiefs were hanged, and we were killed and starved and worked beyond endurance to 
get rubber.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“How do you know it was the <term type="collective">white men</term> themselves who ordered these cruel things to 
be done to you?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These things must have been done without the <term type="collective">white man</term>’s knowledge by 
the <term type="collective">black soldiers</term>.”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(<persName>P P</persName>) : “The <term type="collective">white men</term> told their soldiers : ‘You kill only women; you cannot kill 
men.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You must prove that you kill men.’ So then the soldiers when they killed us” (here he 
stopped and hesitated, and then pointing to the private parts of my bulldog&#8212;it was lying asleep 
at my feet), he said : “then they cut off those things and took them to the <term type="collective">white men</term>, who said : 
‘It is true, you have killed men.’”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“You mean to tell me that any <term type="collective">white man</term> ordered your bodies to be mutilated like 
that, and those parts of you carried to him?”</p>

<p><persName>P P</persName>, <persName>O O</persName>, and all (shouting) : “Yes!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>many <term type="collective">white men</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>D E did it.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“You say this is true?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Were many of you so treated after being shot?”</p>

<p>All (shouting out) : “Nkoto!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Nkoto!”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(Very many!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Very many!)</p>

<p>There was no doubt that these people were not inventing.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Their vehemence, their flashing 
eyes, their excitement, was not simulated.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Doubtless they exaggerated the numbers, but they 
were clearly telling what they knew and loathed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I was told that they often became so furious 
at the recollection of what had been done to them that they lost control over themselves.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
One of the men before me was getting into this state now.</p>

<p>I asked whether <term type="collective">L* tribes</term> were still running from their country, or whether they now 
stayed at home and worked voluntarily.</p>

<p><persName>N N</persName> answered : “They cannot run away now&#8212;not easily; there are sentries in the country 
there between the Lake and this; besides, there are few people left.”</p>

<p><persName>P P</persName> said : “We heard that letters came to the <term type="collective">white men</term> to say that the people were 
to be well treated.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We heard that these letters had been sent by the <term type="collective">big white men in 
<bloc>‘<foreign>Mputu</foreign>’ (Europe)</bloc></term>; but our <term type="collective">white men</term> tore up these letters, laughing, saying : ‘We are the 
“<foreign>basango</foreign>” and “<foreign>banyanga</foreign>” (fathers and mothers, i.e., elders).<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Those who write to us are only 
“<foreign>bana</foreign>” (children).’ Since we left our homes the <term type="collective">white men</term> have asked us to go home again.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
We have heard that they want us to go back, but we will not go.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We are not warriors, and 
do not want to fight.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We only want to live in peace with our wives and children, and so 
we stay here among the <term type="collective">K*</term>, who are kind to us, and will not return to our homes.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Would you not like to go back to your homes?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Would you not, in your hearts, all wish 
to return?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(By many.)<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“We loved our country, but we will not trust ourselves to go back.”</p>

<p><persName>P P</persName> : “Go, you <term type="collective">white men</term>, with the steamer to <settlement>I*</settlement>, and see what we have told you is true.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Perhaps 
if other <term type="collective">white men</term>, who do not hate us, go there, <orgName>Bula Matadi</orgName> may stop from hating 
us, and we may be able to go home again.”</p>

<p>I asked to be pointed out any refugees from other tribes, if there were such, and they 
brought forward a lad who was a <term type="collective">X**</term>, and a man of the <term type="collective">Z**</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These two, answering me, 
said there were many with them from their tribes who had fled from their country.</p>

<p>Went on about fifteen minutes to another <term type="collective">L*</term> group of houses in the midst of the 
<settlement><term type="collective">K*</term> town</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Found here mostly <term type="collective">W**</term>, an old Chief sitting in the open village Council-house 
with a <term  type="collective">Z** man</term> and two lads.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>An old woman soon came and joined, and another 
man.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The woman began talking with much earnestness.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She said the <orgName>Government</orgName> had 
worked them so hard they had had no time to tend their fields and gardens, and they had 
starved to death.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Her children had died; her sons had been killed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The two men, as she spoke, 
muttered murmurs of assent.</p>

<p>The old Chief said : “We used to hunt <term type="animal">elephants</term> long ago, there were plenty in our forests, 
and we got much <term type="foodstuff">meat</term>; but <orgName>Bula Matadi</orgName> killed the <term type="animal">elephant</term> hunters because they could not get 
rubber, and so we starved.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We were sent out to get rubber, and when we came back with little 
rubber we were shot.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Who shot you?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“The <term type="collective">white men</term><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>sent their soldiers out to kill us.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“How do you know it was the <term type="collective">white man</term> who sent the soldiers?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It might be only these 
savage soldiers themselves.”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“No, no.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sometimes we brought rubber into the <term type="collective">white man</term>’s stations.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We took rubber to 
<placeName><persName>D E</persName>’s station</placeName>, <persName>E E*</persName>, and to <persName>F F*</persName> and to <placeName><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.’s station</placeName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When it was not enough rubber 
the <term type="collective">white man</term> would put some of us in lines, one behind the other, and would shoot through all 
our bodies.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sometimes he would shoot us like that with his own hand; sometimes his soldiers 
would do it.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“You mean to say you were killed in the <orgName>Government</orgName> posts themselves by the <orgName>Government 
<term type="collective">white men</term></orgName> themselves, or under their eyes?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(Emphatically.)<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“We were killed in the stations of the <term type="collective">white men</term> themselves.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We were 
killed by the <term type="collective">white man</term> himself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We were shot before his eyes.”</p>

<p>The names <persName>D E</persName>, <persName>B C</persName>, and <persName>L M</persName>, were names I heard repeatedly uttered.</p>

<p>The <term type="collective">Z** man</term> said he, too, had fled; now he lived at peace with the <term type="collective">K*</term>.</p>

<p>The abnormal refugee population in this one <term type="collective">K*</term> town must equal the actual <term type="collective">K*</term> population 
itself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>On every hand one finds these refugees.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They seem, too, to pass busier lives than their 
<term type="collective">K*</term> hosts, for during all the hot hours of the afternoon, wherever I walked through the town&#8212; 
and I went all through <settlement>N*</settlement> until the sun set&#8212;I found <term type="collective"><term type="collective">L*</term> weavers, or iron and brass workers</term>, at 
work.</p>

<p>Slept at <persName>M M</persName>’s house.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Many people coming to talk to us after dark.</p>

<p>Left <settlement>N*</settlement> about 8 to return to the <geogName>Congo</geogName> bank.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>On the way back left the main path and 
struck into one of the side towns, a village called <settlement>A A*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This lies only some 4 or 5 miles 
from the river.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Found here thirty-two <term type="collective">L*</term> houses with forty-three <term type="collective">K*</term>, so that the influx of 
fugitives here is almost equal to the original population.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Saw many <term type="collective">L*</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>All were frightened, 
and they and the <term type="collective">K*</term> were evidently so ill at ease that I did not care to pause.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Spoke to one or 
two men only as we walked through the town.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">L*</term> drew away from us, but on looking 
back saw many heads popped out of doors of the houses we had passed.</p>

<p>Got back to steamer about noon.</p>

<lb/>

<p>Heard that <term type="collective">L*</term> came sometimes to <settlement>M*</settlement> from <settlement>I*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I am now 100 miles (about) up-river from 
<settlement>N*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Went into one of the <term type="collective">M*</term> country farm towns called <settlement>B B*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Found on entering plantation 
two huts with five men and one woman, who I at once recognized by their head-dress as <term type="collective">L*</term>, 
like those at <settlement>N*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The chief speaker, a young man named .<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>who lives at <settlement>B B*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He 
seems about 22 or 23, and speaks with an air of frankness.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He says : “The <term type="collective">L*</term> here and 
others who come to <settlement>M*</settlement>, come from a place <settlement>C C*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It is connected with the lake by a stream.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His 
own town in the district of <region>C C*</region> is <settlement>D D*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><region>C C*</region> is a big district and had many people.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They 
now bring the <orgName>Government</orgName> india-rubber, <foreign>kwanga</foreign>, and <term type="foodstuff">fowls</term>, and work on broad paths connecting 
each village.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His own village has to take 300 baskets of india-rubber.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They get one piece of 
cotton cloth, called locally <foreign>sanza</foreign>, and no more.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(Note.&#8212;This cannot be true.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He is doubtless 
exaggerating.)<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Four other men with him were wearing the rough palm-fibre cloth of the 
country looms, and they pointed to this as proof that they got no cloth for their labours.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
<persName>K K</persName> continuing said : “We were then killed for not bringing in enough rubber.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“You say you were killed for not bringing in rubber.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Were you ever mutilated as proof 
that the soldiers had killed you?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“When we were killed the <term type="collective">white man</term> was there himself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>No proof was needed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Men 
and women were put in a line with a <term type="plant">palm tree</term> and were shot.”</p>

<p>Here he took three of the four men sitting down and put them one in line behind the other, 
and said : “The <term type="collective">white men</term> used to put us like that and shoot all with one cartridge.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>That was 
often done, and worse things.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“But how, if you now have to work so hard, are you yourselves able to come here to 
<settlement>M*</settlement> to see your friends?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“We came away without the sentries or soldiers knowing, but when we get home we 
may have trouble.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Do you know the <term type="collective">L*</term> who are now at <settlement>N*</settlement>?”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>(Here I gave the names of <persName>N N</persName>, <persName>O O</persName>, and 
<persName>P P</persName>.)</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Yes; many <term type="collective">L*</term> fled to that country.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>N N</persName> we know ran away on account of the things 
done to them by the <orgName>Government <term type="collective">white men</term></orgName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">K*</term> and <term type="collective">L*</term> have always been friends.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>That 
is why the <term type="collective">L*</term> fled to them for refuge.”</p>

<p>Q.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Are there sentries or soldiers in your villages now?”</p>

<p>A.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“In the chief villages there are always four soldiers with rifles.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When <term type="collective">natives</term> go out 
into the forest to collect rubber they would leave one of their number behind to stay and protect 
the women.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sometimes the soldiers finding him thus refused to believe what he said, and killed 
him for shirking his work.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This often happens.”</p>

<p>Asked how far it was from <settlement>M*</settlement> to their country they say three days’ journey, and then 
about two days more on to <settlement>I*</settlement> by water, or three if by land.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They begged us to go to their 
country, they said : “We will show you the road, we will take you there, and you will see how 
things are, and that our country has been spoiled, and we are speaking the truth.”</p>

<p>Left them here and returned to the river bank.</p>

<lb/>

<p>The foregoing entries made at the time in my note-book seemed to me, if not false, greatly 
exaggerated, although the statements were made with every air of conviction and sincerity.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I 
did not again meet with any more <term type="collective">L* refugees</term>, for on my return to <settlement>G*</settlement> I stayed only a few


    <pb facs="liv_020058_0063" n="0063"/>
<fw><seg rend="center">63</seg></fw> 
hours.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A few days afterwards, while I was at <geogName>Stanley Pool</geogName>, I received further evidence in a letter 
of which the following is an extract :&#8212;</p>

<p rend="center">*<space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>*<space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>*<space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>*<space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>*<space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>*<space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>*</p>

<p>“I was sorry not to see you as you passed down, and so missed the opportunity of conveying 
to you personally a lot of evidence as to the terrible maladministration practised in the past in 
the district.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I saw the official at the post of <settlement>E E*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He is the successor of the infamous wretch 
<persName>D E</persName>, of whom you heard so much yourself from the refugees at <settlement>N*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This <persName>D E</persName> was in this 
dis<!-- - -->trict in <placeName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.</placeName>, <placeName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.</placeName>, and <placeName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.</placeName>, and he it was that depopulated the country.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His successor, <persName>M N</persName>, is 
very vehement in his denunciations of him, and declares that he will leave nothing undone that 
he can do to bring him to justice.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He is now stationed at <settlement>G G*</settlement>, near our station at <settlement>H H*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Of <persName>M N</persName> I have nothing to say but praise.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In a very difficult position he has done wonderfully.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
The people are beginning to show themselves and gathering about the many posts under his 
charge.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>M N</persName> told me that when he took over the station at <settlement>E E*</settlement> from <persName>D E</persName> he visited the prison, 
and almost fainted, so horrible was the condition of the place and the poor wretches in it.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He 
told me of many things he had heard of from the soldiers.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Of <persName>D E</persName> shooting with his own hand 
man after man who had come with an insufficient quantity of rubber.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Of his putting several one 
behind the other and shooting them all with one cartridge.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Those who accompanied me, 
also heard from the soldiers many frightful stories and abundant confirmation of what was told us 
at <settlement>N*</settlement> about the taking to <persName>D E</persName> of the organs of the men slain by the sentries of the various posts.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I 
saw a letter from the present officer at <settlement>F F*</settlement> to <persName>M N</persName>, in which he upbraids him for not using 
more vigorous means, telling him to talk less and shoot more, and reprimanding him for not 
killing more than one in a district under his care where there was a little trouble.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>M N</persName> is due in 
<country>Belgium</country> in about three months, and says he will land one day and begin denouncing his prede- 
cessor the next.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I received many favours from him, and should be sorry to injure him in any 
way<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He has already accepted a position in one of the Companies, being unable to 
continue longer in the service of the <orgName>State</orgName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I have never seen in all the different parts of the 
<orgName>State</orgName> which I have visited a neater station, or a district more under control than that over 
which this <persName>M N</persName> presides.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He is the <persName>M N</persName> the <term type="collective">people of <settlement>N*</settlement></term> told us of, who they said was kind.</p>

<p>“If I can give you any more information, or if there are any questions you would like to put 
to me, I shall be glad to serve you, and through you these persecuted people.”</p>

<p>From a separate communication, I extract the following paragraphs :&#8212;</p>

<p>“.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I heard of some half-dozen <term type="collective">L*</term> who were anxious to visit their old home, 
and would be willing to go with me; so, after procuring some necessary articles in the 
shape of provisions and barter, I started from our post at <settlement>N*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was the end of the 
dry season, and many of the water-courses were quite dry, and during some days we 
even found the lack of water somewhat trying.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The first two days’ travelling was 
through alternating forest and grass plain, our guides, as far as possible, avoiding the 
villages<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Getting fresh guides from a little village, we got into a region almost 
entirely forested, and later descended into a gloomy valley still dripping from the rain.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>According 
to our guides we should soon be through this, but it was not until the afternoon of the 
second day after entering that we once more emerged from the gloom.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Several times we lost 
the track, and I had little inclination to blame the guides, for several times the undergrowth and 
a species of <term type="plant">thorn palm</term> were trodden down in all directions by the <term type="animal">elephants</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It would seem to 
be a favourite hunting ground of theirs, and once we got very close to a large herd who went off 
at a furious pace, smashing down the small trees, trumpeting, and making altogether a most 
terrifying noise.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The second night in this forest we came across, when looking for the track, a 
little village of runaways from the rubber district.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When assured of our friendliness they took 
us in and gave us what shelter they could.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>During the night another tornado swept the country 
and blew down a rotten tree, some branches of which fell in amongst my tent and the little huts 
in which some of the boys were sleeping.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was another most narrow escape.</p>

<p>“Early the next day we were conducted by one of the men of this village to the right road, 
and very soon found ourselves travelling along a track which had evidently been, at only a recent 
date, opened up by a number of <term type="collective">natives</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>‘What was it?’ ‘Oh!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>it is the road along which we 
used to carry rubber to the white men.’ ‘But why used to?’ ‘Oh, all the people have either 
run away, or have been killed or died of starvation, and so there is no one to get rubber 
any longer.’</p>

<p>“That day we made a very long march, being nearly nine and a-half hours walking, and 
passing through several other large depopulated districts.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>On all sides were signs of a very recent 
large population, but all was as quiet as death, and <term type="animal">buffaloes</term> roamed at will amongst the still growing 
<term type="foodstuff">manioc</term> and <term type="foodstuff">bananas</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was a sad day, and when, as the sun was setting, we came upon a large 
<orgName>State</orgName> post we were plunged into still greater grief.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>True, there was a comfortable house at our 
service, and houses for all the party; but we had not been long there before we found that we 
had reached the centre of what was once a very thickly populated region, known as <region>C C*</region>, from 
which many refugees in the neighbourhood of <settlement>G*</settlement> had come.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was here a <term type="collective">white man</term>, 
known by the name of <persName>D E</persName>, lived<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He came to the district, and, after seven months 
of diabolical work, left it a waste.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Some of the stories current about him are not fit to record 
here, but the <term type="collective">native</term> evidence is so consistent and so universal that it is difficult to disbelieve 
that murder and rapine on a large scale were carried on here.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His successor, a man of a different 
nature, and much liked by the people, after more than two and a-half years has succeeded in 
winning back to the side of the <orgName>State</orgName> post a few <term type="collective">natives</term>, and there I saw them in their wretched 
little huts, hardly able to call their lives their own in the presence of the new <term type="collective">white man</term> (myself), 
whose coming among them had set them all a-wondering.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>From this there was no 
fear of losing the track.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>For many miles it was a broad road, from 6 to 10 feet in width,

<fw><seg rend="center">64</seg></fw>
and wherever there was a possibility of water settling logs were laid down.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Some of these 
viaducts were miles in length, and must have entailed immense labour; whilst rejoicing in the 
great facility with which we could continue our journey, we could not help picturing the many 
cruel scenes which, in all probability, were a constant accompaniment to the laying of these huge 
logs.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I wish to emphasize as much as possible the desolation and emptiness of the country we 
passed through.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>That it was only very recently a well-populated country, and, as things go out 
here, rather more densely than usual, was very evident.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After a few hours we came to a <orgName>State</orgName> 
rubber post.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In nearly every instance these posts are most imposing, some of them giving rise to 
the supposition that several <term type="collective">white men</term> were residing in them.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>But in only one did we find a 
<term type="collective">white man</term>&#8212;the successor of <persName>D E</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At one place I saw lying about in the grass surrounding 
the post, which is built on the site of several very large towns, human bones, skulls, and, in 
some places, complete skeletons.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>On inquiring the reason for this unusual sight : ‘Oh!’ said 
my informant, ‘When the <foreign>bambote</foreign> (soldiers) were sent to make us cut rubber there were so many 
killed we got tired of burying, and sometimes when we wanted to bury we were not allowed to.’</p>

<p>“‘But why did they kill you so?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>sometimes we were ordered to go, and the sentry would find us preparing food to 
eat while in the forest, and he would shoot two or three to hurry us along.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sometimes we would 
try and do a little work on our plantations, so that when the harvest time came we should have 
something to eat, and the sentry would shoot some of us to teach us that our business was not to 
plant but to get rubber.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sometimes we were driven off to live for a fortnight in the forest 
without any food and without anything to make a fire with, and many died of cold and hunger.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sometimes 
the quantity brought was not sufficient, and then several would be killed to frighten 
us to bring more.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Some tried to run away, and died of hunger and privation in the forest in 
trying to avoid the <orgName>State</orgName> posts.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said I, ‘if the sentries killed you like that, what was the use?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You could not bring 
more rubber when there were fewer people.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh!<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>as to that, we do not understand it.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These are the facts.’</p>

<p>“And looking around on the scene of desolation, on the untended farms and neglected <term type="plant">palms</term>, 
one could not but believe that in the main the story was true.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>From <term type="collective"><orgName>State</orgName> sentries</term> came 
confirma<!-- - -->tion and particulars even more horrifying, and the evidence of a <term type="collective">white man</term> as to the state of the 
country&#8212;the unspeakable condition of the prisons at the <orgName>State</orgName> posts&#8212;all combined to convince 
me over and over again that, during the last seven years, this ‘domaine privé’ of <persName>King Leopold</persName> 
has been a veritable ‘hell on earth.’</p>

<p>“The present régime seems to be more tolerable.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A small payment is made for the rubber 
now brought in.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A little salt&#8212;say a pennyworth&#8212;for 2 kilogrammes of rubber, worth in <bloc>Europe</bloc> 
from 6 to 8 fr.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The collection is still compulsory, but, compared with what has gone before, the 
<term type="collective">natives</term> consider themselves fairly treated.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There is a coming together of families and 
com<!-- - -->munities and the re-establishment of villages; but oh! in what sadly diminished numbers, and 
with what terrible gaps in the families<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Near a large <orgName>State</orgName> post we saw the only large 
and apparently normal village we came across in all the three weeks we spent in the district.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
One was able to form here some estimate of what the population was before the advent of the 
<term type="collective">white man</term> and the search for rubber<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.”</p>

<lb/>

<p>It will be observed that the devastated region whence had come the refugees I saw at <settlement>N*</settlement>, 
comprises a part of the “<region><foreign>Domaine de la Couronne</foreign></region>.”</p>
