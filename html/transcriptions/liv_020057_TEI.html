<br><p class="p "><span class="seg caps ">Hearing</span> of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L* refugees</span> from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">I*</span>, I decided to visit the nearest Settlement of these
fugitives, some 20 miles away, to see them for myself.</p>
<p class="p ">At <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span> found large town of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">K*</span>, and scattered through it many small settlements of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*
refugees</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The town of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span> consists approximately of seventy-one <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">K*</span> houses, and seventy-three
occupied by <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These latter seemed industrious, simple folk, many weaving palm fibre into
mats or <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> cloth; others had smithies, working brass wire into bracelets, chains, and anklets;
some iron-workers making knives.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sitting down in one of these blacksmith’s sheds, the five men
at work ceased and came over to talk to us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I counted ten women, six grown-up men, and eight
lads and women in this one shed of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I then asked them to tell me why they had left their
homes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Three of the men sat down in front of me, and told a tale which I cannot think can
be true,
but it seemed to come straight from their hearts.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I repeatedly asked certain parts to be
gone over again while I wrote in my note-book.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fact of my writing down and asking for
names, &amp;c., seemed to impress them, and they spoke with what certainly impressed me
as being
great sincerity.</p>
<p class="p ">I asked, first, why they had left their homes, and had come to live in a strange far-off
country
among the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">K*</span>, where they owned nothing, and were little better than servitors.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All, when this
question was put, women as well, shouted out, “On account of the rubber tax levied
by the
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> posts.”</p>
<p class="p ">I asked particularly the names of the places whence they had come.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They answered they
were from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">V**</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Other <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L* refugees</span> here at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span> were <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">W**</span>, others again were <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">X**</span>, but all
had fled from their homes for the same reason—it was the “rubber tax.”</p>
<p class="p ">I asked then how this tax was imposed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of them, who had been hammering out an iron
neck collar on my arrival, spoke first.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He <span class="seg word ">said :—</span></p>
<p class="p ">“I am <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">N N</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These other two beside me are <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">O O</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">P P</span>, all of us <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Y**</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From
our country each village had to take twenty loads of rubber.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These loads were <span class="seg word ">big :</span> they
were as big as this<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Producing an empty basket which came nearly up to the handle of my
walking-stick.)<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“That was the first size.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We had to fill that up, but as rubber got scarcer the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> reduced the amount.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We had to take these loads in four times a-month.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“How much pay did you get for this?”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Entire audience.)<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We got no pay!<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We got nothing!”</p>
<p class="p ">And then N N, whom I asked, again <span class="seg word ">said :—</span></p>
<p class="p ">“Our village got cloth and a little salt, but not the people who did the work.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our Chiefs
eat up the cloth; the workers got nothing.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The pay was a fathom of cloth and a little salt
for every big basket full, but it was given to the Chief, never to the men.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It used to take ten
days to get the twenty baskets of rubber—we were always in the forest and then when
we were
late we were killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We had to go further and further into the forest to find the rubber
vines, to go without food, and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and
gardens.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Then we starved.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wild beasts—the leopards—killed some of us when we were working away in
the forest, and others got lost or died from exposure and starvation, and we begged
the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white
man</span> to leave us alone, saying we could get no more rubber, but the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men and their soldiers</span>
<span class="seg word ">said : ‘Go!</span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You are only beasts yourselves, you are nyama (meat).’<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We tried, always going
further into the forest, and when we failed and our rubber was short, the soldiers
came to our
towns and killed us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many were shot, some had their ears cut off; others were tied up with
ropes around their necks and bodies and taken away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> sometimes at the posts <br>
<span class="pb-title">0061</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center ">61</span></span>
did not know of the bad things the soldiers did to us, but it was the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> who sent the
soldiers to punish us for not bringing in enough rubber.”</p>
<p class="p ">Here <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">P P</span> took up the tale from <span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">N N</span> :—</span></p>
<p class="p ">“We said to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span>, ‘We are not enough people now to do what you want us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our
country has not many people in it and we are dying fast.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We are killed by the work you make
us do, by the stoppage of our plantations, and the breaking up of our homes.’<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>
looked at us and <span class="seg word ">said :</span> ‘There are lots of people in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Mputu</span>’”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(<span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Europe</span>, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>’s country).<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
“‘If there are lots of people in the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>’s country there must be many people in the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">black
man</span>’s country.’<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> who said this was the chief <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">F F*</span>, his name was
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">A B</span>, he was a very bad man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Other <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> of Bula Matadi</span> who had been bad and wicked
were <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">B C</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">C D</span>, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D E</span>.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“These had killed us often, and killed us by their own hands as well
as by their soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> were good.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These were <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">E F</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">F G</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">G H</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">H I</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I K</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K L</span>.”</p>
<p class="p ">These ones told them to stay in their homes and did not hunt and chase them as the
others
had done, but after what they had suffered they did not trust more any one’s word,
and they had
fled from their country and were now going to stay here, far from their homes, in
this country
where there was no rubber.</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“How long is it since you left your homes, since the big trouble you speak of?”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It lasted for three full seasons, and it is now four seasons since we fled and came
into
the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">K*</span> country</span>.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“How many days is it from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span> to your own country?”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Six days of quick marching.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We fled because we could not endure the things done to
us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our Chiefs were hanged, and we were killed and starved and worked beyond endurance
to
get rubber.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“How do you know it was the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> themselves who ordered these cruel things to
be done to you?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These things must have been done without the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>’s knowledge by
the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">black soldiers</span>.”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">(<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">P P</span>) :</span> “The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> told their <span class="seg word ">soldiers :</span> ‘You kill only women; you cannot kill
men.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You must prove that you kill men.’ So then the soldiers when they killed us” (here
he
stopped and hesitated, and then pointing to the private parts of my bulldog—it was
lying asleep
at my feet), he <span class="seg word ">said :</span> “then they cut off those things and took them to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span>, who <span class="seg word ">said :</span> ‘It is true, you have killed men.’”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“You mean to tell me that any <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> ordered your bodies to be mutilated like
that, and those parts of you carried to him?”</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">P P</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">O O</span>, and all <span class="seg word ">(shouting) :</span> “Yes!<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>many <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>D E did it.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“You say this is true?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Were many of you so treated after being shot?”</p>
<p class="p ">All (shouting <span class="seg word ">out) :</span> “Nkoto!<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nkoto!”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Very many!<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Very many!)</p>
<p class="p ">There was no doubt that these people were not inventing.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their vehemence, their flashing
eyes, their excitement, was not simulated.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Doubtless they exaggerated the numbers, but they
were clearly telling what they knew and loathed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I was told that they often became so furious
at the recollection of what had been done to them that they lost control over themselves.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
One of the men before me was getting into this state now.</p>
<p class="p ">I asked whether <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L* tribes</span> were still running from their country, or whether they now
stayed at home and worked voluntarily.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">N N</span> <span class="seg word ">answered :</span> “They cannot run away now—not easily; there are sentries in the country
there between the Lake and this; besides, there are few people left.”</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">P P</span> <span class="seg word ">said :</span> “We heard that letters came to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> to say that the people were
to be well treated.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We heard that these letters had been sent by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">big white men in
<span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">‘Mputu’ (Europe)</span></span>; but our <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> tore up these letters, laughing, <span class="seg word ">saying :</span> ‘We are the
“basango” and “banyanga” (fathers and mothers, i.e., elders).<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Those who write to us are only
“bana” (children).’ Since we left our homes the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> have asked us to go home again.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
We have heard that they want us to go back, but we will not go.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We are not warriors, and
do not want to fight.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We only want to live in peace with our wives and children, and so
we stay here among the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">K*</span>, who are kind to us, and will not return to our homes.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Would you not like to go back to your homes?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Would you not, in your hearts, all wish
to return?”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(By many.)<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We loved our country, but we will not trust ourselves to go back.”</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">P P</span> :</span> “Go, you <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span>, with the steamer to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">I*</span>, and see what we have told you is true.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Perhaps
if other <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span>, who do not hate us, go there, <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Bula Matadi</span> may stop from hating
us, and we may be able to go home again.”</p>
<p class="p ">I asked to be pointed out any refugees from other tribes, if there were such, and
they
brought forward a lad who was a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">X**</span>, and a man of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Z**</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These two, answering me,
said there were many with them from their tribes who had fled from their country.</p>
<br>
<p class="p ">Went on about fifteen minutes to another <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*</span> group of houses in the midst of the
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">K*</span> town</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Found here mostly <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">W**</span>, an old Chief sitting in the open village Council-house
with a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Z** man</span> and two lads.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An old woman soon came and joined, and another
man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The woman began talking with much earnestness.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She said the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> had
worked them so hard they had had no time to tend their fields and gardens, and they
had
starved to death.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her children had died; her sons had been killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The two men, as she spoke,
muttered murmurs of assent.</p>
<p class="p ">The old Chief <span class="seg word ">said :</span> “We used to hunt elephants long ago, there were plenty in our forests,
and we got much meat; but <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Bula Matadi</span> killed the elephant hunters because they could not get
rubber, and so we starved.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We were sent out to get rubber, and when we came back with little

<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Who shot you?”</p>

savage soldiers themselves.”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“No, no.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes we brought rubber into the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>’s stations.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We took rubber to

the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> would put some of us in lines, one behind the other, and would shoot through all
our bodies.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes he would shoot us like that with his own hand; sometimes his soldiers
would do it.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“You mean to say you were killed in the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> posts themselves by the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government

<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Emphatically.)<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We were killed in the stations of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> themselves.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We were

cotton cloth, called locally sanza, and no more.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Note.—This cannot be true.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He is doubtless
exaggerating.)<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Four other men with him were wearing the rough palm-fibre cloth of the
country looms, and they pointed to this as proof that they got no cloth for their
labours.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> continuing <span class="seg word ">said :</span> “We were then killed for not bringing in enough rubber.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“You say you were killed for not bringing in rubber.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Were you ever mutilated as proof
that the soldiers had killed you?”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“When we were killed the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> was there himself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No proof was needed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Men
and women were put in a line with a palm tree and were shot.”</p>
<p class="p ">Here he took three of the four men sitting down and put them one in line behind the
other,
and <span class="seg word ">said :</span> “The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> used to put us like that and shoot all with one cartridge.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That was
often done, and worse things.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“But how, if you now have to work so hard, are you yourselves able to come here to
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">M*</span> to see your friends?”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We came away without the sentries or soldiers knowing, but when we get home we
may have trouble.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Do you know the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*</span> who are now at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span>?”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Here I gave the names of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">N N</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">O O</span>, and
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">P P</span>.)</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Yes; many <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*</span> fled to that country.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">N N</span> we know ran away on account of the things

is why the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*</span> fled to them for refuge.”</p>
<p class="p ">Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Are there sentries or soldiers in your villages now?”</p>
<p class="p ">A.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“In the chief villages there are always four soldiers with rifles.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> go out
into the forest to collect rubber they would leave one of their number behind to stay
and protect
the women.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes the soldiers finding him thus refused to believe what he said, and killed
him for shirking his work.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This often happens.”</p>
<p class="p ">Asked how far it was from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">M*</span> to their country they say three days’ journey, and then
about two days more on to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">I*</span> by water, or three if by land.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They begged us to go to their
country, they <span class="seg word ">said :</span> “We will show you the road, we will take you there, and you will see how
things are, and that our country has been spoiled, and we are speaking the truth.”</p>
<p class="p ">Left them here and returned to the river bank.</p>
<br>
<p class="p ">The foregoing entries made at the time in my note-book seemed to me, if not false,
greatly
exaggerated, although the statements were made with every air of conviction and sincerity.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I
did not again meet with any more <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L* refugees</span>, for on my return to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">G*</span> I stayed only a few

hours.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A few days afterwards, while I was at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Stanley Pool</span>, I received further evidence in a letter

which this <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M N</span> presides.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He is the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M N</span> the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">people of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span></span> told us of, who they said was kind.</p>
<p class="p ">“If I can give you any more information, or if there are any questions you would like
to put
to me, I shall be glad to serve you, and through you these persecuted people.”</p>
<p class="p ">From a separate communication, I extract the following <span class="seg word ">paragraphs :—</span></p>
<p class="p ">“.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I heard of some half-dozen <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">L*</span> who were anxious to visit their old home,
and would be willing to go with me; so, after procuring some necessary articles in
the
shape of provisions and barter, I started from our post at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was the end of the
dry season, and many of the water-courses were quite dry, and during some days we
even found the lack of water somewhat trying.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first two days’ travelling was
through alternating forest and grass plain, our guides, as far as possible, avoiding
the
villages<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Getting fresh guides from a little village, we got into a region almost
entirely forested, and later descended into a gloomy valley still dripping from the
rain.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>According
to our guides we should soon be through this, but it was not until the afternoon of
the
second day after entering that we once more emerged from the gloom.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several times we lost
the track, and I had little inclination to blame the guides, for several times the
undergrowth and
a species of thorn palm were trodden down in all directions by the elephants.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It would seem to
be a favourite hunting ground of theirs, and once we got very close to a large herd
who went off
at a furious pace, smashing down the small trees, trumpeting, and making altogether
a most
terrifying noise.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second night in this forest we came across, when looking for the track, a
little village of runaways from the rubber district.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When assured of our friendliness they took
us in and gave us what shelter they could.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>During the night another tornado swept the country
and blew down a rotten tree, some branches of which fell in amongst my tent and the
little huts
in which some of the boys were sleeping.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was another most narrow escape.</p>
<p class="p ">“Early the next day we were conducted by one of the men of this village to the right
road,
and very soon found ourselves travelling along a track which had evidently been, at
only a recent
date, opened up by a number of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘What was it?’ ‘Oh!<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>it is the road along which we
used to carry rubber to the white men.’ ‘But why used to?’ ‘Oh, all the people have
either
run away, or have been killed or died of starvation, and so there is no one to get
rubber
any longer.’</p>
<p class="p ">“That day we made a very long march, being nearly nine and a-half hours walking, and
passing through several other large depopulated districts.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On all sides were signs of a very recent
large population, but all was as quiet as death, and buffaloes roamed at will amongst
the still growing
manioc and bananas.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was a sad day, and when, as the sun was setting, we came upon a large
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> post we were plunged into still greater grief.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>True, there was a comfortable house at our
service, and houses for all the party; but we had not been long there before we found
that we
had reached the centre of what was once a very thickly populated region, known as
<span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">C C*</span>, from
which many refugees in the neighbourhood of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">G*</span> had come.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was here a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>,
known by the name of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D E</span>, lived<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He came to the district, and, after seven months
of diabolical work, left it a waste.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of the stories current about him are not fit to record
here, but the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> evidence is so consistent and so universal that it is difficult to disbelieve
that murder and rapine on a large scale were carried on here.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His successor, a man of a different
nature, and much liked by the people, after more than two and a-half years has succeeded
in
winning back to the side of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> post a few <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span>, and there I saw them in their wretched
little huts, hardly able to call their lives their own in the presence of the new
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> (myself),
whose coming among them had set them all a-wondering.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From this there was no
fear of losing the track.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For many miles it was a broad road, from 6 to 10 feet in width,
<span class="fw "><span class="seg left "><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[247]</span> <span class="seg right ">K<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>
<span class="pb-title">0064</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center ">64</span></span>
and wherever there was a possibility of water settling logs were laid down.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of these
viaducts were miles in length, and must have entailed immense labour; whilst rejoicing
in the
great facility with which we could continue our journey, we could not help picturing
the many
cruel scenes which, in all probability, were a constant accompaniment to the laying
of these huge
logs.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I wish to emphasize as much as possible the desolation and emptiness of the country
we
passed through.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That it was only very recently a well-populated country, and, as things go out
here, rather more densely than usual, was very evident.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After a few hours we came to a <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span>
rubber post.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In nearly every instance these posts are most imposing, some of them giving rise to
the supposition that several <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white men</span> were residing in them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But in only one did we find a
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>—the successor of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D E</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At one place I saw lying about in the grass surrounding
the post, which is built on the site of several very large towns, human bones, skulls,
and, in
some places, complete skeletons.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On inquiring the reason for this unusual <span class="seg word ">sight :</span> ‘Oh!’ said
my informant, ‘When the bambote (soldiers) were sent to make us cut rubber there were
so many
killed we got tired of burying, and sometimes when we wanted to bury we were not allowed
to.’</p>
<p class="p ">“‘But why did they kill you so?’</p>
<p class="p ">“‘Oh!<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>sometimes we were ordered to go, and the sentry would find us preparing food to
eat while in the forest, and he would shoot two or three to hurry us along.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes we would
try and do a little work on our plantations, so that when the harvest time came we
should have
something to eat, and the sentry would shoot some of us to teach us that our business
was not to
plant but to get rubber.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes we were driven off to live for a fortnight in the forest
without any food and without anything to make a fire with, and many died of cold and
hunger.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes
the quantity brought was not sufficient, and then several would be killed to frighten
us to bring more.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some tried to run away, and died of hunger and privation in the forest in
trying to avoid the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> posts.’</p>
<p class="p ">“‘But,’ said I, ‘if the sentries killed you like that, what was the use?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You could not bring
more rubber when there were fewer people.’</p>
<p class="p ">“‘Oh!<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as to that, we do not understand it.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These are the facts.’</p>
<p class="p ">“And looking around on the scene of desolation, on the untended farms and neglected
palms,
one could not but believe that in the main the story was true.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> sentries</span> came
confirmation and particulars even more horrifying, and the evidence of a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> as to the state of the
country—the unspeakable condition of the prisons at the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> posts—all combined to convince
me over and over again that, during the last seven years, this ‘domaine privé’ of
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">King Leopold</span>
has been a veritable ‘hell on earth.’</p>
<p class="p ">“The present régime seems to be more tolerable.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A small payment is made for the rubber
now brought in.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A little salt—say a pennyworth—for 2 kilogrammes of rubber, worth in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Europe</span>
from 6 to 8 fr.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The collection is still compulsory, but, compared with what has gone before, the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> consider themselves fairly treated.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a coming together of families and
communities and the re-establishment of villages; but oh! in what sadly diminished
numbers, and
with what terrible gaps in the families<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Near a large <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> post we saw the only large
and apparently normal village we came across in all the three weeks we spent in the
district.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
One was able to form here some estimate of what the population was before the advent
of the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> and the search for rubber<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.”</p>
<br>
<p class="p ">It will be observed that the devastated region whence had come the refugees I saw
at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">N*</span>,
comprises a part of the “<span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Domaine de la Couronne</span>.”</p>
