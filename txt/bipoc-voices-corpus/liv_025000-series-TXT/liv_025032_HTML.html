  <h5 style="text-align: center;">THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF POONAPUN, A HEATHEN, BAPTIZED ON FEBRUARY 17,
    1850, BY THE NAME OF NATHANIEL.</h5>

  <p>"I was born at Madras in 1833, of heathen parents, and from my infancy was brought up in the
    superstitions and follies of idolatry. I followed the vain customs and manners of my
    fellow-idolaters, and wholly gave myself up to the pleasures of this sinful world, and was quite
    indifferent to the consequences of such a course till 1848; when God, who is rich in mercy, had
    compassion on me, and, though I was ignorant of Him, yet, by His kind providence, so ordered
    that I should be employed as a <em>maty</em> in the service of the Rev. Mr. Wardlaw, when I was
    led to read the blessed gospel, and attend the services of the sanctuary, and in course of time
    felt in some measure impressed as to the truth of Christianity, and the folly and sin of
    idolatry. About this time, through temptation, I fell into sin; and, after some time elapsed, I
    was united in matrimony to a young woman connected with the church and congregation assembling
    at the Mission Chapel. After my marriage, I entered into the employ of a pious doctor, located
    in the cantonment, and attended the Tamil services held at the Rev. J. Shrieves' house, and was
    instructed at my house by Lazarus, catechist; when I was led deeply to feel and lament my lost
    and miserable condition, and my need of salvation: consequently, I went to Mr. Shrieves, and was
    duly instructed from time to time in the doctrines and precepts of the gospel; and, having cast
    myself at the foot of the cross, and sought the mercy of the Lord with weeping and supplication,
    I obtained peace and joy, and on February 17, 1850, before the church and congregation, I was
    questioned relative to my knowledge and experience by the Rev. J. Shrieves, and baptized in the
    name of the Triune Jehovah, and admitted into church-fellowship. May the Lord enable me to
    glorify Him by a consistent walk and conversation to the end of my life! to whom be glory for
    ever and ever. Amen."</p>
