<p rend="center">&#8211;&#8212;&#8212;&#9670;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

<p rend="center">(From the <hi rend="italic"><settlement>Cape Town</settlement> Mail Extra</hi>.)</p>

<p>Foremost in importance among the events of the past 
month, we have to notice the expedition of <persName>General <w>Cath<!-- - -->cart</w></persName> 
into the <region>country of the <term type="collective">Basuta</term> chief <persName>Moshesh</persName></region>, and 
the sanguinary battle of <settlement>Berea</settlement>; followed by the submission 
of that chief and the prompt return of the troops into the 
colony.</p> 

<p>Having issued the proclamation which appeared in our 
last summary&#8212;declaring that his object was, "not to make 
war, but to settle all disputes, and to establish the blessings 
of peace," and commanding "all chiefs and men of all 
classes and tribes" to remain quiet and abide by his <w>judg<!-- - -->ment</w> 
and decision&#8212;<persName>General Cathcart</persName> proceeded across the 
<geogName>Orange River</geogName> into the <region>Sovereignty</region>, and on the <date when="1852-12-01">1st of <w>De<!-- - -->cember</w></date> 
encamped at <placeName>Commissie Drift</placeName>, on the <geogName>Caledon River</geogName>, 
where he was joined by <persName>Colonel Eyre</persName>, <orgName>73d Regiment</orgName>, and 
<persName>Colonel Duff</persName>, <orgName>74th</orgName>, with their respective columns; the 
whole force, including the column under his Excellenecy's 
immediate command, amounting to about 2,500 men of all 
arms. Here, in reply to an address presented to him by the 
inhabitants of <settlement>Caledon</settlement>, <persName>General Cathcart</persName> announced that 
he had summoned the chiefs <persName>Moshesh</persName>, <persName>Molitsani</persName>, <persName>Sikonyella</persName>, 
<persName>Moroko</persName>, and <persName>Gert Taaybosch</persName> to meet him at <geogName>Platberg</geogName> on
the <date when="1852-12-13">13th</date>, and that each of those chiefs would be compelled 
to pay the amount of <term type="animal">cattle</term> which the Commissioners, after 
due investigation, should think fit to award. On the <date when="1852-12-08">8th</date> 
the camp moved forward towards <geogName>Platberg</geogName>, and was joined 
by a <choice><sic>dctachment</sic><corr>detachment</corr></choice> of the <orgName>45th Regiment</orgName>, under <persName>Lieutenant 
Howard</persName>, with some fieldpieces; while 40 burghers, of a 
neighbouring field-cornetcy, turned out to protect the 
border, in the rear of the Governor's operations. <w>Un<!-- - -->fortunately</w>, 
during the first day's march, his Excellency 
lost the valuable aid of his military secretary, <persName>Colonel <w>Sey<!-- - -->mour</w></persName>, 
who was thrown violently from his <term type="animal">horse</term>, by which 
his left shoulder was fractured, and he had consequently to 
be conveyed in a cart to the neighbouring village of <settlement><w>Smith<!-- - -->field</w></settlement>.</p>

<p>On the morning of the <date when="1852-12-13">13th</date> his Excellency arrived at 
<geogName>Platberg</geogName>, which he found deserted by the natives. In the 
evening two young chiefs, sons of <persName>Moshesh</persName>, came to the 
camp, but <persName>General Cathcart</persName> refused to see them, and next 
morning they returned to their father's "great place," 
<geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossigo</orig><corr>Thaba Bosiu</corr></choice></geogName>, accompanied by <persName>Mr. Commissioner Owen</persName> 
who was the bearer of the following message:&#8212;</p> 

<p rend="right">"<geogName>Platberg</geogName>, <date when="1852-12-13">Dec. 13, 1852</date>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></p>

<p>"<persName>Chief Moshesh</persName>,&#8212;When I was sent by the <persName>Queen</persName> to be 
Governor, and to command her army in this part of the 
world, six months past, I wrote to acquaint you and the 
other chiefs, and I told you that I would visit you as soon 
as the rebellion of the <term type="collective">Gaikas</term> and <term type="collective">Tambookies</term> and the <term type="collective"><w>Hot<!-- - -->tentots</w></term> 
was ended. This has been done, as you have no 
doubt learnt, and I now visit this country as I promised, 
and desire to see you and the other chiefs, as my friends, at 
my camp at <geogName>Platberg</geogName>, without delay.</p> 

<p rend="no-indent">"My proclamation will have told you the righteous cause 
in which I am come and what it is my duty to do.</p> 

<p>"As I told you in my letter, I now hope my visit to you 
may be in peace; but I must do justice, whether it be by 
war or in peace. I had been told that you are a great chief 
and a good man, but I find that though you were a man of 
good words you have not done what you promised.</p> 

<p>"I find, not only that you have not paid the fine of <term type="animal">cattle</term> 
imposed on you by the Assistant Commissioners, <persName>Major 
Hogge</persName> and <persName>Mr. Owen</persName>, and which you promised to pay for 
the robberies of <term type="animal">cattle</term> and <term type="animal">horses</term> committed by your people 
and with your knowledge, up to the time of your agreement 
with them; but since then you and the people over whom 
you rule, including <persName>Molitsani</persName> and <persName>Morosi</persName> and your own son 
<persName>Letsea</persName>, with their people, and certain robbers called <persName>Jan</persName> 
<persName>Letell</persName> and <persName>Bashuli</persName>, have been stealing <term type="animal">cattle</term> from your 
neighbours, and otherwise doing them harm. Even <w>mur<!-- - -->ders</w> 
have been committed by them, and this village has been 
plundered and destroyed. In short, the <term type="collective">Basuta</term> people <w>un<!-- - -->der</w> 
your rule have become a nation of thieves.</p> 

<p>"This state of things must not be, and I have come to 
put an end to it, and to restore peace between you and your 
neighbours if I can, and if not, to put you and your people 
out of the way of doing them wrong, and this I must do 
promptly.</p> 

<p>"I will not therefore stop to talk, but tell you now once 
for all, that having carefully inquired into the business, and 
judging as justly and as mercifully as I can what is the 
amount of <term type="animal">cattle</term> and damage you should be required to <w>re<!-- - -->store</w>, 
I demand of you 10,000 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term> and 1,000 <term type="animal">horses</term> 
to be delivered over to the <term type="collective">British</term> resident at this place, 
within three days' time, in order to be restored to those from 
whom they have been stolen.</p>

<p>"If this be not done, I must go and take either <term type="animal">cattle</term> or 
other things from you and your people, and from <persName>Molitsani</persName> 
and his people, and if resistance be made it will then be 
war between us, and I must then take three times the 
amount of <term type="animal">cattle</term>, as well as kill many of your people and 
destroy their dwellings and kraals, which I should be very 
sorry to be obliged to do. But if this <term type="animal">cattle</term> be paid within 
three days, and that I am assured peace is restored, I will 
take the army back again in peace.</p> 

<p>"Now, <persName>Chief</persName>, if you are an honest man, it is for you to 
pay the just fine, which is not more than the <term type="animal">cattle</term> stolen, 
and save yourself and your people from ruin, or else <w>pre<!-- - -->pare</w> 
for war, for on the fourth day I must bring you to <w>ac<!-- - -->count</w>.</p> 

<p>"You must also pay back to <persName>Sikonyella</persName> and <persName>Moroka</persName> what 
you have stolen from them, and be at peace with them. 
<persName>Carolus Batjee</persName> and his people must return to <geogName>Platberg</geogName>, and 
the boundaries fixed by <persName>Governor Sir Harry Smith</persName> must be 
respected.</p> 

<p>"When all this is done, you must remain at peace with 
all your neighbours, and the <term type="collective">Basutas</term> must cease to be a 
nation of thieves, for if I come again it will not be to talk,
but to make an end of the <term type="collective">Basuta</term> nation, as has been done 
of the <term type="collective">Gaikas</term> and <term type="collective">Tambookie</term> tribe of <region>Mapassa</region>.</p>

<p rend="right">"<persName><seg rend="caps">G. Cathcart</seg></persName>."<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></p>

<p>Next day <persName>Moshesh</persName> himself made his appearance, and an 
interview took place between him and the General, highly 
characteristic on both sides. The "talk" is thus reported in 
an official notice afterwards published:&#8212;</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;I am glad to see you and to make your <w>ac<!-- - -->quaintance</w>.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I am glad to see the governor, as since his 
arrival in the country I have been expecting a visit from 
him, which his letter in October last led me to expect.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;I told you in that letter that I hoped to 
meet you in peace, and I still hope so, as I look to you as 
the <persName>Great Chief</persName> in this part.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I hope so, too; for peace is like the rain that 
makes the grass grow, while war is like the wind which 
dries it up. You are right in looking to me; that is in <w>ac<!-- - -->cordance</w> 
with the treaties.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;I will not now talk much, but wish to know 
whether you received my message yesterday, in which I 
made the demand of <term type="animal">cattle</term> and <term type="animal">horses</term>? I have nothing to 
alter in that letter.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Do you mean the letter I received from <persName>Mr. 
Owen</persName>?</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;Yes.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I received the letter, but do not know where 
I shall get the <term type="animal">cattle</term> from. Am I to understand that the 
10,000 head demanded are a fine imposed for the thefts <w>com<!-- - -->mitted</w> 
by my people, in addition to the <term type="animal">cattle</term> stolen?</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;I demand but 10,000 head, though your 
people have stolen many more, and I consider this a just 
award. It must be paid in three days.</p>

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Do the three days count from yesterday, or 
to-day?</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;To-day is the first of the three.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;The time is short, and the <term type="animal">cattle</term> many, will 
you not allow me six days to collect them?</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;You had time given you when <persName>Major Hogge</persName> 
and <persName>Mr. Owen</persName> made the first demand, and then promised 
to comply with it, but did not.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;But I was not quite idle. Do not the papers 
in the commissioner's hands show that I collected <term type="animal">cattle</term>?</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;They do, but not half of the number <w>de<!-- - -->manded</w>.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;That is true, but I have not now control 
enough over my people to induce them to comply with the 
demand, however anxious I may be to do so.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;If you are not able to collect them, I must 
go and do it, and if any resistance be made it will then be 
war, and I shall not be satisfied with 10,000 head, but shall 
take all I can.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Do not talk of war, for however anxious I 
may be to avoid it, you know that a <term type="animal">dog</term> when beaten will 
show his teeth.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;It will, therefore, be better that you should 
give up the <term type="animal">cattle</term> than that I should go for them.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I wish for peace; but have the same 
difficulty with my people that you have in the <region>colony</region>&#8212;your 
prisons are never empty, and I have thieves among 
my people.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;I would, then, recommend you to catch the 
thieves and bring them to me, and I will hang them.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I do not wish you to hang them, but to talk 
to them, and give them advice. If you hang them they 
cannot talk.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;If I hang them they cannot steal, and I 
am not going to talk any more. I have said that if you 
do not give up the <term type="animal">cattle</term> in three days, I must come and 
take them.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>&#8212;I beg of you not to talk of war.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Governor</persName>.&#8212;I have no more to say; I must either leave 
this in peace in three days, or go to <geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossigo</orig><corr>Thaba Bosiu</corr></choice></geogName>. I 
therefore advise you to go and collect the <term type="animal">cattle</term> as quickly 
as possible.</p> 

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Do not talk of coming to <geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossigo</orig><corr>Thaba Bosiu</corr></choice></geogName>; if 
you do I shall lay the blame on the <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> from whom the 
<term type="animal">cattle</term> were stolen, and whom I requested to come and 
point out to me their <term type="animal">cattle</term> that I might restore them. 
I will go at once and do my best, and, perhaps, God will 
help me.</p> 

<p>"After leaving his Excellency's tent, but before <w>return<!-- - -->ing</w> 
home, <persName>Moshesh</persName> sent to request that the day on which 
the interview took place might not count in the three. 
This request his Excellency acceded to."</p> 

<p>After the action in which <persName>Moshesh</persName> was defeated, as <w>de<!-- - -->scribed</w> 
in our yesterday's impression, a messenger arrived 
in camp, bearing a flag of truce, and the following letter to 
<persName>General Cathcart</persName>:&#8212;</p> 

<p rend="right">"<geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossigo</orig><corr>Thaba Bosiu</corr></choice></geogName>, Midnight, <date when="1852-12-20">Dec. 20, 1852</date>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></p> 

<p>"Your Excellency,&#8212;This day you have fought against 
my people and taken much <term type="animal">cattle</term>. As the object for which 
you have come is to have a compensation for <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term>, I beg 
you will be satisfied with what you have taken. I entreat 
peace from you&#8212;you have shown your power&#8212;you have

longer considered an enemy of the <persName>Queen</persName>. I will try all I 
can to keep my people in order in the future.</p>


<p rend="right">"Your humble servant,<space extent="2" unit="words"/></p> 

<p rend="right">"<persName><seg rend="caps">Moshesh</seg></persName>."<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></p>

<p>To which his Excellency returned the following reply:&#8212;</p> 

<p rend="right">"<placeName>Camp</placeName>, <geogName>Caledon River</geogName>, <date when="1852-12-21">Dec. 21, 1852</date>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></p>

<p>"<persName>Chief Moshesh</persName>,&#8212;I have received your letter. The 
words are those of a great chief, and of one who has the 
interests of his people at heart. But I care little for words. 
I judge of men by their actions. I told you that if you did 
not pay the fine I must go and take it. I am a man who 
never breaks his word, otherwise the <persName>Queen</persName> would not have 
sent me here. I have taken the fine by force, and I am 
satisfied.</p> 

<p>"I am not angry with your people for fighting in defence 
of their property; for those who fought&#8212;and fought well&#8212;were 
not all of them thieves, and I am sorry that many were 
killed. This is your fault; for if you had paid the fine it 
would not have happened. I now desire not to consider 
you, <persName>Chief</persName>, as an enemy <choice><sic>ot</sic><corr>to</corr></choice> the <persName>Queen</persName>, but I must proclaim 
martial law in the <region>Sovereignty</region>, to give to Commandants 
and Field-Cornets power to make commandos in a regular 
manner, and, with the consent of the Resident, enter your 
country in search of plundered <term type="animal">horses</term> and <term type="animal">cattle</term> that may 
be stolen after this time. And I expect you to assist them; 
for though you are a great chief, it seems that you either do 
not, or cannot, keep your own people from stealing; and 
among the <term type="animal">cattle</term> you sent as part of your fine there were 
three <term type="animal">oxen</term>, the property of <persName>Mr. Hain</persName>, of <settlement>Bloemfontein</settlement>, 
stolen since I crossed the <geogName>Caledon river</geogName>. Now, therefore, 
<persName>Chief Moshesh</persName>, I consider your past obligations fulfilled, and 
hope that you will take measures for preventing such abuses
