PREFACE.
IT must appear astounding to those who have carefully and
thoughtfully read the history of England in connexion with
the subject of the African race, when its greatest statesman,
so long ago as 1838, stated in Parliament the endeavours
his Government had been making to induce the various
continental and transatlantic ones to put down slavery, that
the abolition of that institution in the Southern States of
America should have produced so much bile amongst a
small section in England ; who, although they have had un-
deniable proofs of the fallacy of their arguments, and incon-
sistency of their statements with existing facts, have formed
themselves into an association (sic Anthropological Society)
to rake up old malice and encourage their agents abroad to
search out the worst possible characteristics of the African,
so to furnish material for venting their animus against him.
' Its object,' as has been stated, 'is to prove him unim-
provable, therefore unimproved since the beginning, and,
consequently, ?tted only to remain a hewer of wood and
drawer of water for the members of that select society.' It
would have been su?icient to treat this with the contempt
it deserves, were it not that leading statesmen of the present
day have shown themselves easily carried away by the
malicious views of these negrophobists, to the great pre-
judice of that race.

ii PREFACE.
It is without doubt an uphill work for those who have
always combated that vile crusade of prejudice, especially
when considering themselves at the point of putting a
crowning stroke to the superstructure which had taken
them years to erect, to ?nd the foundation undermined by
rats of a somewhat formidable size, and therefore requiring
a renewed and a more unassailable structure. One of the
anthropological myths is to prove that, up to the age of
puberty, the negro can combat successfully, and even show
a precocity superior to that of the more enlightened race of
a temperate climate, but that after this period, which corre-
sponds to the closing of the sutures, he is doomed—a limit
is set upon his further progress. But to prove more con-
vincingly that this malign statement is fallacious, let those
who are interested in the subject refer to the Principals of
the Church Missionary College, Islington ; King's College,
London; and Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone; where full-
blooded Africans, who have had the complete development
of their sutures, have been under tuition, and they will then
be able to form an opinion from unbiassed testimony. I do
not for a moment attempt here to prove that, as a whole, a
race whose past generations have been in utter darkness,
the mental faculty of whose ancestors has never received any
culture for nearly a thousand years, could attempt to com-
pete successfully in their present state with one whose
ancestors have successively been under mental training and
moulding for centuries. To think so would be to expect an
ordinary-bred horse to have equal chances in a grand race
with a thorough-bred one. But I say that the African race,
as exempli?ed by the results of enterprises in Western
Africa, if put in comparison with any race on the face of the

globe, whether Caucasian, Mongolian, Teutonic, Celtic, or
any other just emerging from a state of barbarism, as they
are, will never be found a whit behind. But to draw deduc-
tions by comparing their present state with the civilization
of the nineteenth century is not only absurd, but most
unphilosophical.
Even Captain Burton, the noli me tangere of the African
race, the greatest authority in the present school of English
anthropologists (their vice-president), who, from his writ-
ings, has led everyone to believe that he has a ?endish
hatred against the negro, whilst animadverting in all his
works on Western Africa, in the most unmistakably mali-
cious language, on the impossibilty of improving that race
he so hates, forgot himself in one place, and exclaimed,
as to their intellectual superiority, 'There are about 100
Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many
excellent fellows, but it is an unpleasant confession to make,
the others appear to be inferior to the Africans, native as
well as mulatto. The possibility of such a thing had never
yet reached my brain. At last, in colloquy with an old
friend upon the Coast, the idea started up, and, after due
discussion, we adopted it. I speak of morale. In intellect
the black race is palpably superior, and it is fast advancing
in the path of civilization.' The ?rst and last italics are
ours.
But these anthropologists have still worse designs for
Africa, since we ?nd them seriously arguing in their meetings
and proclaiming in the public press that the Mohammedan
religion, in all cases where Western Africa is concerned,
should supplant that of Christianity; that the belief in the
False Prophet is substantially better than the belief in Christ

for the African. And when we see the chief of them suiting
his actions to his words, kneeling in the presence of the
native population every morning with his face towards the
rising sun, bowing and making signs, in the attitude and
after the fashion of a true believer in Mohammedanism ;
when, I say, we see such men seriously arguing that
polygamy is the natural and more genial institution, and
monogamy not, and laying aside and totally ignoring the
biblical revelation, what else can the negro expect but a com-
plete falsi?cation of every circumstance relating to his race ?
I believe and ?rmly hold, that it is not by Mohammedan-
izing the inhabitants of Western Africa according to the
present school of anthropologists, that they can or will be
civilized 3 and I maintain that no civilization would take root
nd bear fruit except that based on the principles of the
' Christian religion; and that the people had far better re-
main as they are, than to have any other religious belief ex-
cept the Christian introduced and propagated amongst them.
I, amongst a great many others, appreciate every European
element that enters Western Africa, whether in the capacity
of merchants or pioneers of civilization, or in that of mission-
aries ; and whilst I hail their efforts, respect their talents,
and revere the civilization they are capable of imparting, I
will never permit any unjust abuse, any unfounded diatribe
against the African race, to be ruthlessly lavished on them
without repelling or exposing the calumny. I am aware
juxthat such explicit and independent statements as are con-
tained in this work, do not tend to advance a man's worldly
interest ; but if they tend to expose the weak and one-sided
opinions of those who take every opportunity to advance
theories about Africa and the Africans contrary to the truth,

PREFACE. V
and if they lead to the better appreciation of, and a proper
application of means to meet the growing wants and require-
ments of Her Majesty's West African Settlements, I shall
feel suf?ciently repaid for my labours.
This work has been divided into three parts :—
Part I. An endeavour is made to disprove many of the
fallacious doctrines and statements of anthropologists
(detrimental to the interests of the African race) from exist-
ing facts.
' I commenced by giving a detailed account of the various
phases of existence found among the uncivilized nations of
Western Africa ; and then proceeded to consider the various
forms of Government met with on the Coast, and, among
others, that of the Republic of Liberia. In the subse-
quent chapters I endeavoured, from personal observations
and by quotations from the writings of various authors, to
disprove those mischievous doctrines which have been pro-
mulgated to the detriment of the growing races of Western
Africa. As conformation forms the sheet anchor of many of
their arguments I have endeavoured to prove that a race of
the most perfect Caucasian type would degenerate according
to the in?uences brought to bear on the undeveloped and
delicate structure of _ the infant; and that when once a de-
formity has become established, the laws of physiology have
shown that it has a tendency to perpetuate. Adopting this
View, the present conformation of the negro race can be
traced to natural causes, depending most materially on the
pernicious mode of managing the young, who undergo
every degree of compression or distortion. During infancy,
when ?rmly secured on the back of its nurse for several hours
daily, the soft, yielding, undeveloped tissues of the infant

vi PREFACE.
undergo various degrees of distortion, which ultimately form,
after some generations, a permanent type; capable, however,
of great improvement by careful manipulation of the young.
That this is the most fruitful source, may be traced in the
number of forms found in typical tribes, having the same
origin, but variously brought up; and I will prove my point,
by quoting from the writings of the most determined
African hater—the Vice-President of the Anthropological
Society. Captain Burton, in describing the Egbas
of Abeokuta, writes, ' never have I seen such villainous
crania and countenances as amongst the seniors of Abeo-
kuta. Their calvaria, depressed in front and projecting
cocoa-nut like behind, the absence of beards, the hideous
lines and wrinkles that seamed and furrowed the external
parchment, and the cold unrelenting cruelty of their physio-
gnomies in repose, suggested the idea of the eunuch torturers
so common in Asia.' Yet this very same author, whilst
describing this same tribe, located only a few miles south of
Abeokuta, where they might be expected to be still worse,
writes thus: ' The race—the Egbadoes or Lower Egba—is
distinctly negroid, without showing the characteristics of
the full-blooded negro. The skin is of a dark dilute copper,
sometimes black, whilst several of the chiefs are almost light
coloured. When the eyelashes and brows are plucked, the
eye is ?ne. . . . The lips are not thick, but the gums are
blue, and the teeth are by no means improved by the process
of chewing. . . . Their diet is poor, their climate poorer;
calisthenics are unknown; they are not boxers or runners,
like the people of Nu?e, and even gymnastics, except
tumbling, are little practised. What,' he exclaimed, ' can,
then, account for the beauty of their conformation ? ' If we



## p. vii (#23) #############################################

PREFACE. vii
examine closely the doctrines of modern anthropologists, as
exhibited by the published works of Hunt, Burton, &c., it
will be evident that by a little manipulation of the young
we might be able to make two brothers of the same African
parentage of two distinct Huntean or Burtonean races, one
of the typical Huntean Congo negro, and the other of Bur-
ton's negroid race.
Part II. refers to the Self-government of Western Africa,
according to Resolution 3 of the House of Commons Com-
mittee—viz., 'that the object of the policy of the Govern-
ment should be to encourage in the natives the exercise of
those qualities which may render it possible for it more
and more to transfer to them the administration Of all the
goverments, with a view to our ultimate withdrawal from
all, except, perhaps, Sierra Leone.'
Taking advantage of this declaration, a stanch friend of
Afriéan advancement has remarked that the ambition of
Great Britain in these days is to see her colonies attain, one
by one, to the position of wealth and power, and to form
themselves into nations. It is her desire 'to have inde-
pendent nations, once her feeble offspring, associated with
her in the great work of the world's natural development
and the spread of Christian civilization;' whilst her whole
aim is ' to raise the nations of Africa from the debased and
degraded state to which they have fallen, both morally and
physically, to free them from the bloody and demoralizing
in?uence of beastly superstition; from polygamy; from
domestic slavery; from the paralysing effects, as regards
productive industry, of customs and institutions which, by
the insecurity they create, as well as the licentious and
foolish extravagance they prescribe and encourage, prevent

the creation of that capital by which alone the works neces-
sarily attendant on civilization can be executed.' In the
chapters included in this part of the work, I have
endeavoured to point out the bene?t Western Africa has
received through British rule; and the condition Of the
peoplchwhether or not they are in that position in which
they can be left to govern themselves—as well as their
relation to the civil authorities.
Part III. relates to the requirements of the various
colonies. If the Third Resolution, above quoted, meant at all
what it seems to indicate, the various subjects considered in
Part II. will show the lamentable de?ciency, in many
material points, in the moral and social condition of the
people, and the necessity for speedy and valuable reforms in
the institutions of the various colonies. In Part III. I have
endeavoured to lay down a few of the numerous absolute re—
quirements of the colonies, and which Resolution 3 makes
imperative. But I have overstepped the ordinary limits Of
a preface, and, consequently, on leaving my readers, I hope
the following pages, although, I fear, full of imperfections,
will convince them that the Africans are not incapable Of
improvement ; but that by the assistance of good and able
men they are destined to ?gure in the course of time, and to
take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ORIGINAL AND UNCIVILISED STATE OF
THE NATIVE TBIBES.
TnE hypothesis based on the ingenious demonstrative analogies of
the manners, customs, and tenets of the inhabitants at present
occupying this globe, as compared with those of a few centuries
ago, may be safely regarded as a truism—viz., that mankind by the
knowledge of metallurgy and other useful arts emerge from a
primitive state of barbarism, and have gradually brought to them-
selves the bene?ts of a civilised life. Of this primitive state or
mythic epoch but little is furnished us in history, and very little is
actually known; but from analogical references we are led to believe
the speculative traditions of the ancient Romans?" that 'mankind,
as the state of political community now exists, advance from a rude
and helpless state to the formation of political society;' and entirely
disapprove of the Greek mythological legend, that 'mankind emerge
from a state of innocence and b1iss.'+
Bearing in mind the foregoing, it will be my province to prove

the capability of the African for possessing a real political Govern-
ment and national independence; and that a more stable and e?icient
Government might yet be formed in Western Africa, under the
supervision of a civilised nation, in conformity with the present
Resolution of the Committee of the House of Commons.
In viewing the map of West Africa, and tracing out those
political communities which are not due to the agency of more
civilised politicians, we af?rm that there are amongst them ?xed and
established Governments, although rude and barbarous; that the
obedience to the supreme power in many cases is implicit, the right
of property is enforced by adj udicature; and, although the power
of the supreme head has been used with extreme despotism, as in
Dahomey and Ashantee, yet still it is as truly a political Govern-
ment as that of France or England. By nature the African is a
social being, possessing the capacity of commanding and obeying,
and that type of improvement which advances as the reason is
cultivated, which are the essential elements both of a political
Government and a political community; and therefore Africans bear
no relation whatever to those gregarious species of animals—apes,
monkeys, &c.—to which some fantastic writers have likened them.
Examining Western Africa in its entirety, we ?nd it to be com-
posed of a number of political communities, each ruled by a national
Government, formed in many cases of distinct nationalities occupy-
ing determined territory ; but some national communities are broken
up into innumerable fractional sections, governed by rebel chiefs, or
satraps; others depend upon a political body whose sovereign chief
rules over life and property; and others, again, are under well-
regulated civilised government. But in order to develop among
these different nationalities a true political science, it is necessary
that the inhabitants should be made acquainted with the useful
arts, and the physical conditions which in?uence other more civilised
and re?ned political Governments.
What, it may be asked, are the different forms of government
now in existence on the West Coast of Africa? The two principal
forms are the monarchieal and the republican.
In the purely native community we observe the recognition of
power, in many cases, vested in a single individual, variously called

DIFFERENT FORMS OF GOVERNMENT. 3
by the di?erent tribes, but to which we apply the name of basileus,
or king; surrounded by a number of headmen, who pledge them-
selves to do his will. Some of these basileus, such as those of
Ashantee and Dahomey, have implicit power over life and property,
and therefore are held in dread by their subjects. Of the tribes
who are governed by these autocrats we may well apply the
language of Merivalc,* when speaking of the Asiatic races, that
' they have acquiesced in their own immemorial despotisms to which
they have been abandoned. To them the names of liberty and
equality, invoked in turn by their neighbours, are unintelligible;
their sympathies are centred always in men, and not in government.'
A desperate and successful warrior, such as an Owoosookorkor, a
Mahbah, and a Gezo, commanded all their devotions, and for them
the 'foundation of laws lay in the bosom of the autocrat.'
Among other political native communities we ?nd that in some
the form of government resembles very closely a limited monarchy
-—in others a democracy, in which all the caboceers or head men
stand almost on equal terms. Among those tribes who are goaded
with religious tenets and in?nitesmal rites and ceremonies, who
believe implicitly in the supernatural powers of their fetish and
medicine man, whom they suppose to have the power of communi-
cating with the world of spirits, and using their agency in human
a?airs, the population are subject to a spiritual despotism not
easily comprehended by civilised nations. In matters of great
interest, in many cases a whole nation assemble together for
deliberation; but the counsels of the aged, from their experience,
especially when backed by previous sage advice and reputation of
wisdom, a sober and thoughtful deportment, and a vigorous and
energetic character, generally decide the will of the multitude. The
authority of a chief is hereditary, but this hereditary descent differs
materially from that in civilised countries; the individual to whom
the succession falls being, not the eldest son of the chief, but the
son of his sister; and this is accounted for by the plurality of wives
which each man maintains. But men who have shown themselves
to possess great tact, courage, and strength in time of war, although

they might have been originally slaves, may in time of peace
arrogate to themselves such predominant in?uence, that they soon
create themselves chiefs (such as the present King of Denkera on
the Gold Coast).
Not being acqilainted with letters, they have no history, and are
absolutely ignorant of events for any long period beyond the memory of
their head men; successive events once out of sight are for ever lest;
they pass away like the spectres in a phantasmagoria, leaving no
other trace behind them than a dreamy recollection of some distant
circumstances that had taken place. They satisfy the curiosity of
their generation by the aged among them giving the oral narration
of legendary tales, heroic myths, vague traditions, &c., descriptive
of deeds of wonder at an uncertain and undated antiquity, and
which forms the only channel by which their 'thoughts can be
transmitted from one country and one age to another.' Not know-
ing anything of the useful arts, their Governments are feeble and
unenterprising, and their military organization impotent and inef?-
cient; amongst the higher classes in some of them the head wives
occupy important positions in the domestic circle, whilst all the
other women occupy a degraded position.
Proper legislative science is entirely unknown to them; they
possess no means by which a continuous and pro?table revenue can
be brought into their imperial coffers; no proper determination of
political causes, and, consequently, no established principle which
might be made to form a guide to the Legislature in the making of
new laws or the alteration of old ones, and thus for ages they have
shown no improvement in the executive administration; and possess
no proper legal status, and no generalized principle of international
law. There is an entire absence of any domestic history amongst
them. By them a society is never contemplated, either in its con-
stituent elements or mutual relations; in its private recesses or
habitual intercourses. A fact, an anecdote, a speech, or remark,
which would illustrate the condition of the common people, or of
any rank subordinate to the highest, is considered too insigni?cant
to intrude upon a relation which concerns only grandees and minis-
ters, thrones and imperial powers. Some towns there are which are
governed entirely by chiefs, who exercise an uncertain rule over the

GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE PRIMITIVE RACE. 9
inhabitants—who are regarded more as a father of the community
than a political head; some of them are nomadic in their nature,
but others constitute themselves into a political society of the most
primitive order.
The Bakalai tribe, for example, are particularly distinguished for
their roving character, and this is principally caused by their great
fear of death. ' They never stay long in one place. A Bakalai
village is scarcely built—often the plantations have not borne fruit
the ?rst time—when they feel impelled to move. Then everything
is abandoned; they gather up what few stores of provisions they
may have, and start off, often for great distances, to make, with
in?nite pains, a new settlement, which will be abandoned in turn;
sometimes after a few months, though occasionally they remain a
year or two, and even more, in the same place.' In localities where
they can carry out commercial speculations they remain for a few
years, but yielding at times to their natural propensity they shift
from one place to another about one or two miles distant.
With those in this primitive state of ignorance and poverty we
observe their chief occupation to consist in the cultivation of a
small plot of ground, where they plant various species of cereals,
besides squash, casada, pumpkins, yams, sweet potato, and several
sorts of edible fruits. Not being in connexion with civilised nations,
their agricultural instruments consist of large shells, sharpened
sticks, or rude iron hoes, all consequently of a barbarous nature.
They make baskets and mats from the ?bre and hard outer-
covering of the bamboo. Their dress is very scanty, and in many
instances consists of a small piece of plaited straw placed as a
frontal covering. They know no intoxicating liquor except the
palm wine, the product of nature, after it has been kept for several
hours to undergo fermentation; they amuse themselves by rude
dances, consisting of severe athletic pantomimic gymnasium, per-
formed'with the hands and feet, accompanied with the clapping of
hands, and rude dramatic reeitations of the bystanders, or musicians.
They carry on warfare with clubs, bow and arrows, and stones,
and their system always is to surprise their enemy. Each warrior
and hunter (in some cases) manufactures for himself his weapons
and his implements; his war-clubs of hard and heavy wood,

wrought and ornamented with great ingenuity; his bows shaped
and polished; his arrows pointed with ?ints, shells, or sharp bones,
which serve as cutting instruments. They reckon by the number of
the ' moon,' and by the occurrence of some remarkable events; they
fell large trees by ?re, and in all things exhibit great rudeness and
extreme simplicity.
Some, such as the Fans, show considerable ingenuity in the
manufacture of iron. In their country, interior of the Gaboon,
iron ore is found in considerable quantity, cropping out at the
surface. To obtain the iron, they 'build a huge pile of wood,
heap on this a considerable quantity of the ore broken up, then
come with more wood,' and apply ?re to the whole; wood is con-
tinually being thrown into it until the ore becomes ?uid, when it is
allowed to cool down, and cast iron is obtained. To temper and
make it malleable, 'they put it through a most tedious series of
heating and hammerings, till at last they turn out a very superior
article of iron and steel,' which is much better than the trade
quality brought out from Europe. Of this they make their knives,
arrowheads, and swords. They reverence their charms and fetishes,
and believe in witchcraft; some are cannibals, and others make very
disagreeable enemies, by being very energetic, warlike, ?erce, and
possessing great courage and ingenuity.
Among those tribes who have made some onward step in the
career of civilization we observe that agriculture is supported by
regular labours at the proper season, the produce of which they
bring to European markets, to exchange for useful implements,
cotton goods, and rude luxuries; they weave a kind of cotton or
?bre cloth, which they employ as wearing apparel and for exporta-
tion, and some of it is much prized, even by Europeans, for the
dexterity of the workmanship ; and a particular rough kind (Bandy
cloth) forms an important medium of commerce in Western Africa.
The inhabitants collect themselves in large and populous towns,
with the idea of strengthening their powers of defence, as in
Abeokuta. Some, as the Fantees (Cromantees), in whose region
gold forms the medium of commerce, are fully aware of its value,
and possess a knowledge of the means of working it into various
trinkets and articles of domestic importance. In war they have

THEIR WAR TACTICS. 7
some knowledge of pitched battles, but the great point in their
tactics in war is to take their enemies by surprise; each warrior
carries his own provisions, consisting of the production of the land;
they possess no commissariat, but are allowed by the chieftain to go
out foraging in the enemies' country. They employ guns and
powder, c'utlasses and swords, and are very furious in their ?rst
attacks, killing every one before them, women and children not
excepted. After this impulsive passion in attack has been satiated,
the women are taken prisoners, and if attractive are received in the
domestic circles as wives; the men and children are held in slavery,
and in some instances the lives of the former are terminated by a
horrible death. They consider war as the most honourable and
glorious occupation for men, and they carry it on in the hope of
conquest and plunder, or for revenge. The heads of the great chiefs
who may be slain are carried on poles as'trophies of war. Among
the Ashantees, when a chief is killed in war his body is buried in a
selected and marked spot, concealed from their enemies, and on
their return they exhume the body, well wash it, and carry it to the
territorial mausoleum. If they return froma successful expedition,
they are met and escorted to its last home by the women and
children, singing songs of praise, glory, and welcome. Fishing and
hunting form also a part of their pursuits, and in many cases they
excel in these to an appreciable degree. In North-Western and
Central West Africa, the regions of the Gambia and Sierra Leone
(as also in Dahomey), the inhabitants are accustomed every summer
to set ?re to the bush, and thus consume the grass and underwood,
giving the country an open appearance.* But in other parts there are
large, dense forests, impenetrable to man, and with di?iculty pene-
trable to the larger quadrupeds.
Some of the languages of the tribes are harsh and guttural, such
' 'The burning of the grass in Mandingo,' says Mungo Park, 'exhibits a
scene of terri?c grandeur. In the middle of the night I could see the plains
and mountains, as far as my eyes could reach, variegated with lines of ?re;
and the light re?ected on the sky made the heavens appear in a blaze. In
the day-time pillars of smoke were seen in every direction, while the birds of
prey were observed hovering round the con?agration, and pouncing down
upon the snakes, lizards, and other re tiles which attempt to esca e the ?ames.
The annual burning is soon followe by a fresh and sweet ver ure, and the
country is thereby rendered more healthy and pleasant.'

as the J ollofs and Calabars; others are soft and mellowy, as the
Mandingo, Teminemeh, and Fantee; and others again are palatal,
as the Accra, Awoonah, and Dahomey. The trading propensity is
most extensively developed among every tribe; in their native state
money, as a coin, is unknown to them ; in many places cowrie shell
is the prevailing medium—as from Accra to the Niger; in Bonny
and Calabar, iron bar; in the Gambia and Senegal and the Casa-
mangs, native-made cloth, called handy cloth; in Fantee, Basso,
Abanta, Apollonia, Ashantee, and Soosoo, gold; in some places,
however, domestic slaves form the principal article of barter. Al-
though advanced to some degree of civilization, some of these tribes
indulge in witchcraft and various superstitious rites and ceremonies.
The sickness of a chief might lead to the death of many harmless
persons; a professed sorcerer is summoned to ?nd the cause or
the individual who has bewitched him; 'this he does by inspecting
the inside of a mystic fowl, which has been killed and split into two
parts. Blackness or blemish about the wing is supposed to denote
treachery in children or kinsmen; in the backbone, it convicts mother
and grandmother; in the tail, it accuses the wives; and in the
thighs, the concubines; in the shank or feet, it condemns the
common slaves. Some are so entirely dominated by the super-
stitious ideas Of their country that even after they have been for
years under Christian teaching and civilising re-agents, they look
back with a sort of veneration and fear on some of the heathenish
customs of their fatherland. In these semi-savage countries the
inhabitants believe that the religious devotees are in league with
disembodied spirits, who transfer to them such supernatural powers
that they are recognized by every one to have the good fortune of
weaving the web of human fate; and these pretenders carry them—
selves with such striking dignity of look and action, such undoubt-
ing con?dence, at the same time evincing such strength of language
and energy of purpose, that these weak-minded people are involun-
tarily compelled to cherish a deep veneration for those pre-
tensions to supernatural knowledge, and always to hold them in
reverential awe. In those places where religion and knowledge have
made some progress, as in the seaeoast towns of a part of the
Gold Coast, these devotees are regarded with hatred and horror,

but in those parts where a higher degree of knowledge is attained,
they are regarded in the true light of impostors, and expelled
wheresoever they come with their pretensions.
Polygamy is very common among all the population who can
afford it; marriage is a sort of contract, by which the father or
parent receives a certain amount for the daughter, who at ?rst
meets with a great deal of attention and fondling, and in a few
months sinks into the state of a domestic slave.*- Some of the
tribes are subject to violent gusts of temper, but are plain and open-
hearted, such as the Egboes, along the banks of the Niger; whilst
others, such as the Yorubas, have a happy power of exercising a.
strict command over their passions. As a rule, the tribes in Western
Africa are very hospitable to strangers, generous, sociable, and
obliging; in some cases honest, harmless, faithful, kind, and aliec-
tionate to each other, and would, if needs be, share their last meal
with a companion,1' but in many cases they are tyrannical to their

sion of great jollity. Of course the husband has to buy his wife, and the
shrewd father makes a bargain with him as well as he can, putting on a.
good price if the man's love is very ardent. . . . When a wedding is in
prospect, the friends of the happy couple spend many days in obtaining and
aying in great stores of provision, chie?y smoked elephant meat and palm
wine. They engage hunters to keep up the supply, and accumulate enough
to feed the great numbers who are expected to come. When all is ready,
the whole town assembles, and without any ceremony, but merely as a
public sale, as it were, the father hands his daughter to her husband, who
as generally already paid her price.'—'Advcntures in Equatorial Africa,'

Lawrence, in his Lectures delivered in the Royal College of Surgeons,
says: ' Many of the dark races, although little civilised, display an open-
ness of heart, a friendly and generous disposition, the greatest hospitality,
and an observance of the point of honour, according to their own notions,
from which nations more advanced in knowledge might often take a lesson
with advantage. They possess a natural goodness of heart and warmth of
a?'ection.'
' The negroes,' says Adamson, in his visit to Senegal in 1754, ' are sociable,
humane, obliging, and hospitable, and they have generally preserved an in-
estimable simplicity of domestic manners. They are distinguished by their
tenderness for their parents, and great respect for the aged; a patriarchal
virtue which, in our days, is too little known.'
' The feelings of the negroes,' says a French writer, 'are extremely acute.
According to the manner in which they are treated they are gay or melan-
choly, laborious or slothful, friends or enemies. When well fed and not
maltreated they are contented, joyous, and ready for every engagement,
and the satisfaction of their mind is painted in their countenance. Of

slaves. Many of them, the Egboes and Mandingoes for example,
will never forget kindness or bene?ts, but will never forgive an
injury done them. The women work hard in the ?eld and in selling,
and they are the great supporters of the domestic circle. Divorce
is at the pleasure of the husband; if the wife divorce herself, her
parents are required to return the purchase money or dowry given
to them at marriage. Their wives and slaves are in some cases their
only property, a man's standing being estimated by the number of
his Wives. The Mohammedan portion have rude mosques for the
celebration of their religious ceremonies, while others resort to dark
groves and thick forests.
Some of the tribes make canoes from the trunk of the silk cotton-
tree, the bombaac, which they hollow out and afterwards burn; those
on the river Gambia make their canoes out of the mahogany tree,
which is very strong and durable, resisting the action of the power-
ful rays of the sun, which, with the effects of the water, easily
destroys other boats. They mould their rude cooking utensils—-
water-pot, plates, and dishes—from the clay of the land, and cut
out their spoons and combs from different kinds of wood.
The unmarried women in some countries, as from the Gold Coast
to the Gaboons, are allowed with little or no restraint to follow the
bent of their inclination ; in other parts they are tolerably continent.
The male sex are by no means remarkable for continence, which
cannot be expected in places where domestic slavery is in vogue.
The men having so many wives do not show a very profound liking
for their children, but the affection of the mother is unbounded.
Personal cleanliness is a chief trait in the character of most tribes ;
gambling forms part of the amusement of some; they practise
several athletic games, such as wrestling, boxing, and running for
sport and exercise. In some tribes they build large stockades of
bene?ts and abuses they are extremely sensible, and a ainst those who
injure them they bear a mortal hatred. On the other and, when they
contract an affection to a master, there is no of?ce, however hazardous,
which they will not boldly execute to demonstrate their zeal and attach-
ment. They are naturally aifectionate, and have an ardent love for their
children, friends, and countrymen. The little they possess they freely dis-
tribute among the necessitous, without any other motive than that of pure
compassion to the indigent. '—:' Hist. des Antillee,' p. 483.

wood or mud, which on examination exhibit undeniable evidence of
design and labour.
After the death of a near relative, in some tribes, there is great
moaning, weeping, and lamentation; but among others, as is the
practice on the Gold Coast, as soon as the funeral party returns
from the graveyard they are regaled with champagne and other
wines and with spirits; a dancing party is invariably given, either
in the same evening or a few days afterwards, in the house of the
deceased, the chief mourner being the chief dancer.
In a few isolated spots the chastity of the young female is care-
fully watched by the priests of the country, and the girls are known
by peculiar names; in the Sherbro and Qniah countries they are
called ' Boondoo girls,' and in Adogme and Crobboe ' Fetish girls.'
they are kept under strict surveillance, no intrusion is permitted ; a
discovery of any irregularity is attended with a heavy ?ne, slavery,
or even death on the part of the male. After remaining for some
years, varying from two to six, certain rites are performed by the
priests, and they are then allowed to return to their homes. In
some countries, such as Ningo and Prampram, there is an annual
custom which is practised for a week ; during this period the most
sacred matrimonial bond can with impunity be invaded by any man,
even before the eyes of the husband, who dares not make the least
remonstrance. At this period free licence is given to every man
and woman, except the Fetish girls, and the most horrible abomina-
tions are continually being practised.

CHAPTER II.
THE ORIGIN, DANCERS, AND PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE LIBERIAN REPUBLIC.
IN the Colonies the monarchical form of Government in substance
is observed; the di?'erent political heads are English, French,
Dutch, and Spanish. The French occupy Senegal, Grand Bassa,
and the Gaboons; the Dutch, a portion of the Fantee Territory;
and the Spanish, Fernando Po. It is not my intention here to
touch on the political bearings of these several Governments on the
Coast, but only of that in whose interest we are principally con-
cerned—viz., the English, who occupy the Gambia, Sierra Leone,
Cape Coast (or the greater part of the Gold Coast), and Lagos.
The only exception I feel bound to make is as regards Liberia,
the ?rst self-governing civilised black community on the West
Coast of Africa. This country is a Republic.
Under the auspices of the Colonization Society of Americaf" a
"' In the Rev. G. F. Fox's memoir of the Rev. Mr. Hoffman, the follow-
ing interesting account of the origin of the Liberian Republic is recorded :—
The Colony of Liberia had its origin in the sympathy felt by a small
section of people in the United States for the African race, and in a strong
desire which prompted them to colonize the free negroes of America on the
soil of their ancestors; thus at the same time removing them from the
scorn and downtrodden condition which they endured in the United States,
and likewise opening out to them a new ?eld of enterprise, which might
develop their latent powers, and afford them scope for self-government and
self-improvement, especially with a view to the future evangelization of
Africa.
Hence there sprung into existence in the year 1816, in the United States,
an organization known as the Colonization Society, the professed object of
which was to enable free American negroes to emigrate to the Coast of
\Vestern Africa, by the purchase of land, and the furnishing them with
such pecuniary assistance as was needful. Thus was founded the Colony
of Liberia, which extends along the coast of Western Africa, from 4° 15'
to 7° north latitude, its northern extremity being bounded by the Galinas
river, near Sherbro Island. From the commencement, neither the Coloniza-
tion Society, nor the colony planted by it, has ever had any direct con-
nexion with the Government of the United States, but during its earliest

colony of American liberated negroes was formed in the Kroo
coast. For the ?rst twenty-?ve years they had no independent
national existence; political power over the people was held by the
days, it engaged the sympathy and. substantial help of the United States
Government, in consequence of the deep interest which President Monroe
took in the scheme, and. which he was enabled to gratify by reason
of the capture at that period of some slaves by United States ships of war ;
for the Government having declared the slave-trade to be piracy, had taken
vigorous steps towards its suppression, and when slaves were recaptured
the question arose, What must be done with them ? The practical answer
which President Monroe rendered to this question was to make the, newly-
selected Colony of Liberia the depot for liberated slaves, which furnished
him with a plausible reason to justify his sending over agents of the
Government and vessels of war, to co-operate with the agents of the
Colonization Society in e?'ecting a settlement of the ?rst emigrants. This
timid and feeble body proceeded to Sierra Leone in the year 1819-20, and
from thence to the Island of Sherbro, which proved a very unhealthy spot,
where they obtained a temporary and. most unsatisfactory settlement from
a treacherous Prince. Failing in their attempt to get land on the Sherbro
river, the agents of the Government and the Colonization Society proceeded
to Cape Mesurado ; here, after much dif?culty, they made a purchase of
territory from the natives, and built a town which, in honour of the
President of the United States, was called Monrovia.
Subsequently, settlements were effected at Grand Cape Mount, forty
miles north-west of Monrovia, and south-east at the Junk, Bassa, and
Sinoe rivers, distant twenty, forty, and one hundred and twenty miles
from Cape Mesurado. The towns at these places were named Robert's
Port, Marshall, Buchanan City, and Greenville.
Such was the origin of Liberia, founded exclusively by persons of colour
'from the United States, under the guidance and with the pecuniary assist-
ance of the Colonization Society. Not being, however, a colony of the
United States, some form of political government was requisite. During
the' infancy of the colony a Governor was appointed by the Colonization
Society; but in the year 1845, when considerable progress had been made
in the consolidation of the colony, they felt themselves to be in a position
to assume the responsibilities of self-government, and at that period,
having liberated themselves from the control of the Colonization Society in
\Vashington, they proceeded to organize a Government upon the model of
the United States, which was to consist of a President, a Senate, and a
House of Representatives ; a fundamental condition being that its members
must consist of persons of African, or, more strictly speaking, of negro blood.
Monrovia was made the capital, where the Government is administered,
and where suitable public buildings have been erected—viz , two separate
halls for the Senate and House of Representatives, a residence for the
President, and. other Government buildings. ' * *
All the functions of a well-organized Government are administered in the
Colony; powers of taxation, both internal and by Custom-house duties,
are exercised ; and though a standing army is not kept up, yet in cases of
emergency the colonists have formed a temporary army under the adminis-
tration and. pay of the Government. * * "
But in addition to this there sprang up another colony, quite indepen-

Society, who appointed White agents as Governors, 'suggested,
formed, or_sanctioucd such laws as governed them, paid their
Government of?cers, erected their public buildings, and constructed
their public works; leaving to the people no other care than that of
educing from the soil or other sources their own private living, and of
protecting themselves against the onset of their savage neighbours.'
The Government was carried on without their assistance, their
natural wants were always supplied, and there was not the least
opportunity afforded them for the development of that 'large-
heartedness and public spirit which is the life of nascent com-
munities.' Di?iculties arose between the Liberians and the
foreigners as the territory increased, which produced a disruption
in the political tranquillity between the Government and the
colonists; the people by their representatives met in convention to
consider this important matter, and in thirty days presented to the
dent of Liberia, called Cape Palmas, situated 250 miles lower down the
coast than Monrovia, and which was founded by the Maryland Colonization
Society in the years 1834 and 1835. It, like Liberia, remained for some
years under the control of American administration, but eventually
followed the example of its neighbour, and became an independent state,
under the name of Maryland in Liberia, and elected the Hon. J. B.
Drayton as President. The natives, however, residing in the neighbour-
hood, and within the bounds of the territory of the colony, refused to
recognise the authority of the new Government. A collision arose, which
resulted in the removal of 1,500 of the natives from the point of land called
Cape Palmas, which they had hitherto occupied in common with the
colonists.
These natives, united with other allies, so strengthened themselves, and
organized such a formidable opposition, as to repel a. serious attack of the
colonists, hemming them in so as to make their situation critical in the
extreme.
In this predicament, the states of Maryland in Liberia, that is to say,
the colonists of Cape Palmas, appealed to the Republic of Liberia for aid.
Assistance was promptly sent, consisting of soldiers headed by err-President
Roberts; and the natives, being no longer able to face the joint forces, were
the more readily brought to terms. Everything was soon settled by
negotiation, and the Colony at Cape Palmas was formally annexed to
Liberia as one of the counties of the Republic. From this date Liberia. was
divided into four counties—viz, Mesurado, Bassa, Serise, and Maryland.
The distance between the extreme points—viz., from Cape Mount to Kablu.
on the Hora river—is 300 miles. The line of coast, however, claimed by
the Republic extends above and below these points, so as to make in all
above 500 miles, although not more than 600 square miles are as yet
occupied by the colonial population and their descendants.

world a Constitution and a Declaration of Independence. ' Liberia
was declared to be a free, sovereign, and an independent state.'
It will be necessary to take a retrospective view of the early
colonists of Liberia, and compare them with the inhabitants of the
other part of the coast; and then we may be able to prove how
far these are capable of self-government. 'The foundation of
Liberia,' writes the Rev. "7. Blyden, M.A., Professor in the
Liberian College, in an able pamphletf" 'was laid under circum-
stances peculiar in the history of the world. The emigrants were
urged to these shores by motives far different from those which led
to the founding of other colonies. They were not a restless
peeple, who, ?nding their advancement to wealth and honour in
their native country too slow for their ambitious and enterprizing
minds, resolved to accelerate their dilatory fortunes beneath a
foreign sky. They were not persons who had once been in a com
dition of opulence and splendour, and who, having fallen by luxury
and extravagance into penury and disrepute, sought new scenes to
repair their shattered fortunes. They were not politicians adhering
to some new principle in politics deemed by them all-important,
and seeking some new ?eld for its untrammelled exercise and fair
development. They were not the victims of religious persecution,
?eeing from the horrors of an enthralled conscience. No. Had ,
they belonged to any of these classes, they might, perhaps, 'have
contented themselves with cultivating small farms, and reaping
slow gains; they might have taken fresh courage, and by patient
industry restored measurably their dilapidated fortunes; they
might have changed their political or theological views, rather than
brave the dangers and undergo the privations of founding a home
and residing in a country proverbial for its unhealthy and dangerous
climate. ,But they belonged to none of these classes. They were
a peculiar people. They were those who themselves, or whose
ancestors had been, in the providence of God, suffered to be
carried away from heathenism into slavery among a civilised and
Christian people.' Being therefore slaves or their descendants,

they could not rise among slaveholders; force of circumstances
kept them hopelessly down. 'They felt the depression, they saw
its causes; they felt the deteriorating effects of these causes upon
their minds and the minds of their children. And they thus found
that it was useless to contend against these unfavourable in?uences.'
It was hopeless to contend against such mighty dif?culties. A
home, therefore, was necessary for them where they could enjoy
the rights and immunities of a civilised life, and a settlement on the
West Coast of Africa was then ?xed upon. 'They left the land
of their birth . . . with hearts heavy and distressed . . . forced
by irresistible circumstances from their native country in their
poverty and ignorance, to seek a home where to be of African
descent would involve no disgrace.' With this element, then, the
Republic of Liberia was formed.
The inhabitants now elect their own President and Representatives
in a National Congress, according to a constitution framed on the
principles of the American Republic. They ' display a degree of
intelligence in managing their a?'airs highly creditable to their
ability, and calculated to rebut the insinuations which have some-
times been put forth by the enemies of freedom, as to the supposed
mental inferiority of persons of African descent.' ,
The Liberian Government had its trials and dif?culties to en-
counter, but experience has proved that they are perfectly compe-
tent to carry on their own Government; and having mastered a
great many of the vicissitudes and drawbacks which a Government
brought to existence in the form in which they have been brought
must expect to meet with, they bid fair to occupy an important
place in regenerated Africa.
But it was necessary that they should have made limited scienti?c
experiments on the subject-matter of many branches of their
political science, not for the purpose of determining abstract truth,
but of establishing every portion of their executive administration
on a ?rm and healthy footing. Being a new political assembly,
when once they have chosen the subject of their experimentation,
they should gradually examine and note the true relation of each
phenomenon as it presents itself, its true political causation, and
what in?uence, ordinary and extraordinary, it has on the body

politic of the nation; for when once a practical mistake has been
made which acts extensively on the institutions and affects their
political economy, it acts like an ' electric af?nity with the rotten
parts of the social fabric, and dissolves them by combin {'ion.'
Thus the Liberian statesmen have not long ago fallen into a
grave error in the practical experiment which they made in their
?nancial department. The materials employed were sound and
valuable, but they were not used with that due correction and
allowances which are essential for material success. They issued
during one of their political crises a certain limited amount of
paper currency, which was easily redeemable by the Government.
The political success of this provisional experiment operated so
greatly on their better judgment that, instead of acting like
the pilot steering a vessel through an unknown and dangerous
channel, the Executive launched out an excessive number of this
medium. Mark the results; the greenbacks fall to a great dis-
count—the strength of the Government is tried—it ?nds itself
incapable of supporting the crisis; its paper issues now become
its weakest point, and as, by the mechanical aphorism, nothing is
stronger than its weakest point, so they ?nd that no effort of theirs
is capable of preventing a crisis :—
Multa quae nunc ex intervallo non apparent bellum aperiet.*
The merchants receive the notes from the people at a fearful dis-
count, and pay them to the Government for duty and taxes at their
full nominal value ; the specie being exported to foreign countries,
none is to be found in the State exchequer; and all Government
employés are paid in greenbacks.
For the last twenty years the people of Liberia have enjoyed an
independent political existence. Experiments have been assiduously
made in the various branches of the political affairs of the nation,
and at present the constitution, as it now stands, is found to be
lamentably de?cient in many points of vital importance to the
State; and however sacred and venerable the document may be, the
national existence and prosperity demand that it should receive a

thorough revision. The ?rst point requiring amendation, as re-
corded by Mr. Blyden, is the increase of the Presidential term of
office. At present it is limited to two years only. This term is so
short that the President, instead of devoting his attention and
ability to measures that will develop and advance materially the
prosperity of the State, is tempted to direct his administrative power
to electioneering expedients. The President, instead of becoming an
able statesman, becomes an electioneer; the body politic of the
nation suifers most severely; the whole nation consequently do not
suf?ciently pride themselves on their President; they do not suf?-
ciently venerate him as the sovereign power of the whole nation, and
thus in the election of a new President, party feelings run high, the
President is traduced in the most violent manner by the opposite
parties, his most laudable undertakings are scoffed at and greatly
misrepresented, and the whole nation is convulsed for a time by
violent political con?icts. That the President ought to be elected
for a longer period is self-evident ; a period of six years should be
the minimum term of o?ice, and he should not be immediately re-
eligible.
Again, by the constitution, after the election of a President, a
period of eight months is allowed to elapse, namely, from May to
January, before the new President can be inaugurated. The con-
sequence is pernicious to the nation, as the defeated President has
ample opportunity of carrying out such party views and adverse
plans as suit his purpose.
A third amendment necessary in the Liberian constitution is
to remove what is found to be a proli?c source of mischief
in a large republic, and still more so in a small but rising State,
such as Liberia—viz" the power conferred upon the President
of dismissing Government employés indiscriminately at his pleasure.
Mr. Blyden shows the deteriorating e?ect of this power when it was
?rst introduced into America, and how manifold and all mischievous
the consequences have been; indeed, so great has been the evil
resulting from its introduction, that in 1859, he says, the fact that a.
man holds a removeable Government of?ce is a presumptive
evidence that he is either an adventurer, an incompetent person, or
a scoundrel. The evils are threefold—First, ' Few men can obtain

any skill or experience in their of?ces, and the of?cial capacity of
the civil service must be deplorably impaired. Secondly, every man,
knowing that he has only a four years', or, at most, and by every
exertion, an eight years' tenure of of?ce, will be inclined to feather
his nest as fast and as daringly as he can. Thirdly, it renders it
impossible for men of intelligence, ability, and virtue, who wish for
a reasonable permanence and a decent independence, to become ser-
vants of the State.' If in America, where there are thousands of
men of ability, education, and experience in political matters, the
experiment is found to work so badly, how much worse must it
be for the small State of Liberia, where the Government ought to
concentrate around it the best abilities of the land. We hope
that the national Representatives in the House of Assembly will not
consider themselves helplessly bound to each item of a constitution
which their political existence and scienti?c experiments have
proved to be practically unsuited to the national prosperity and
advancement, but make such amendments as shall place their execu-
tive administration on a better and far healthier foundation.

EXPOSITION OF ERRONEOUS VlEWS RESPECTING THE AFRICAN.
Tm: British portion of the Government of Western Africa is in
a transition state, and it is Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of
State for the Colonies to whom we must now look as the guardian
of the practical policy of the Colonies of Western Africa in its
internal and foreign relations; and now that we have been carried
through the distress, danger, dif?culty, and doubts attendant on
the late Parliamentary Committee,* every African who deserves
to have his nationality based upon a stable footing, must regard
him as the statesman, whom we might liken to the steersman at the
helm of a ship, who, by his attentive and vigilant observations, will
guide the national policy to a successful end. We hope that ere
long a constitutional foundation will be erected which will greatly
improve the system of government on the Coast, and that the
natives will be really and properly brought up to self-government.

'l' Resolutions of the House of Commons Committee on Western Africa :—
1. That it is not possible to withdraw the British Government wholly or
im mediately from any settlements or engagements on the West African Coast.
2. That the settlement on the Gambia may be reduced by M'Carthy's
Island, which is 150 miles up the river, being no longer occupied ; and that
the settlement should be con?ned as much as possible to the mouth of the
river.
8. That all further extension of territory, or assumption of government, or

giving to the educated natives experience in the form of govern-
ment, ought to form an important step in the advance of African
history; they can, however, only be regarded for the present as
provisional and tentative experiments until con?rmed by proofs of
practical success. It will be the place of the local executive autho-
rities to watch carefully and cautiously their operation, reporting
faithfully on their progress, so that correct data may be drawn. It
was by similar reports furnished to the American Colonization So-
ciety, that they were subsequently led to transfer all authority to
the inhabitants, thus virtually giving them a nationalty.
In order that these propositions may be operative and effective,
it is necessary that a proper executive machinery should be pro-
vided to give that impulse to native industry, to encourage that
habit of independence and business, to excite that interest amongst
the inhabitants of each locality for public affairs and political
education, which' seems to have been an intention of the majority of
the members of the late Committee.
Those who have gone to such extremes in opposition to the
views entertained by Mr. Cardwellf Mr. Charles Buxton, Lord
new treaties offering any protection to the native tribes, would be inexpedient;
and that the object of our policy should be to encourage in the natives the
exercise of those qualities which may render it possible for us more and
more to transfer to them the administration of all the Governments, with a
view to our ultimate withdrawal from all, except, probably, Sierra Leone.
4. That this policy of non-extension admits of no exceptions as regards new
settlements, but cannot amount to an absolute prohibition of measures which,
in peculiar cases, may be necessary for the more ef?cient and economical
administration of the settlements We already possess.
5. That the reasons for the separation of West African Governments in
1842 having ceased to exist, it is desirable that a Central Government over all
the four settlements should be established at Sierra Leone, with steam coin-
munication with each Lieutenant Government.
6. That the evidence leads to the hope that such a central control may be
established, with considerable retrenchment of expenditure, and, at the same '
time, with a general increase of efficiency.
7. That in the newly-acquired territory of Lagos, the native practice of
domestic slavery exists still to a certainpdegree, although it is at variance with
British law ; and that it appears to the Committee that this state of things,
surrounded as it is by so many local dif?culties, demands the serious attention
of the local Government, with a view to its termination as soon as possible.—

Alfred Churchill,' and many others, as to run down the capacity of
the African race, and liken them to the anthropoid apes, ought to
know that the African, in common with the most enlightened
people, may be impelled by events into philosophical speculations;
and this is proved by the existence of a written language amongst
them, designed entirely by themselves. The origin of this lan-
guage, if their legend is reliable, was in the wonder excited
by some messengers of the Quiah tribe carrying a letter from an
educated person of a more civilized nation to an individual at a
distance, the reading of which conveyed to him the information of
what had taken place in their own town. Possessing 'clearly a
philosophical turn of mind, they became curious to discover the
contrivance which so struck their observation; and from that time
began to put in writing on leaves and barks of trees the language
of their country.
Well might Colonel D'Arcy, the late Administrator of the Govern-
ment of the Gambia, in his Blue Book Report for 1865, write,
with equal truth and justice: 'After many years of intercourse
with the race [African] I cannot see in the African any incapacity
for civilization ; on the contrary, I am convinced that the liberated
Africans contain in themselves all the elements of a commercial
people. If Adam Smith's theory is pronounced orthodox, that it is
to the principle of parsimony we owe our capital, and again to
capital we owe our comforts and enjoyment, we certainly have this
desideratumdn: the African, who is for the most part a parsimonious
citizen, ambitions to rise in the world, and consequently to save
and amass. They remind me much of the Banians in Eastern
cities, whose personal expenditure is m'l, but whose trade specula-
tions are mighty and adventurous ; but re?nement passes over these
half-civilized bigots, as the air of heaven over a stagnant lake,
and they are as we ?nd them in 1757; whereas the liberated
African is perhaps rather too eager to adapt our laws to his
immediate advantage before he can possibly understand them.'
The gallant Colonel thus forcibly concludes: 'As it takes three
generations at home to make an English gentleman, so likewise

does it take three generations to make an intelligent, well-educated
African gentleman.'
But the anthropologists of these days will not view the African
race, whether educated or uneducated, with a calm, quiet, and unpre-
judiced mind; could they but do so they would involuntarily come
to the conclusion that these people, even in their native rudeness,
where they have nothing to stir up the latent powers of improve-
ment in them but the book of nature, whose pages, truly, are ?lled
with objects of wonder and admiration, do, in many cases, show signs
of possessing wonderful powers of observation; and when once they
acquire the necessary information respecting natural objects by habits
of patient attention, which must be the inevitable result, when those
powers are brought into play, they are indelibly riveted in their
memory. Too true, the majestic trees of the forest, covered with
their evergreen foliage of a thousand variegated colours; the
numerous gay tropical birds with beautiful plumage; the solitary
and melancholy grandeur of many of the scenes with which they
are surrounded; the magni?cent rivers which run through their
country; the ocean, in all its forms of sublimity and terror; the
tremendous rocks which resound with the ceaseless roar of the
billows, and the numerous shells which stud the shores of their
country, form in a scienti?c point of view but a small portion of
their consideration, from their seeming insigni?cance, and from a.
want of scienti?c knowledge in the beholders ; yet still, the brillant
stars, the splendid midday sun, the resplendent full moon, and the
terri?c tornado, with its thunder and lightning, all call into exer-
cise the peculiar disposition and talents of their mind.
They calculate ?gures in their memory to an extent which would
surprise the most practised mathematician, without using any me-
chanical means for their aid. Thus an unlettered liberated African,
whom I knew and repeatedly questioned, could calculate within
an incredibly short space of time any amount of pennies, half-
pennies, 0r farthings, reducing them to pounds, shillings, and
pence. Some keep for years the debit and credit side of their
account in their memory with great accuracy.
This con?rms the account of Dr. Rush of a negro slave in
Maryland, Fuller by name, who could neither read nor write, but

who showed extraordinary quickness in mental calculation. He
was at one time asked in company, for the purpose of trying his
powers, how many seconds a person had lived who was seventy
years and some months old; he gave the answer in a. minute and a
half. On reckoning it up after him in ?gures, the result was
slightly different from his calculation, ' Have you not forgotten the
leap years?' he interrogated. On supplying this omission, the
answer agreed exactly with the number they obtained.
Barbot, in his large work on Africa, remarking on the acuteness
of the nncivilized Africans, said ' The blacks have suf?cient sense
and understanding; their conceptions are quick and accurate;
their memory possesses extraordinary strength. For, although
they can neither read nor write, they never fall into confusion or
error, in the greatest hurry of business and traf?c. Their experience
of the knavery of Europeans has put them on their guard in trans-
actions of exchange; they carefully examined all our goods piece
by piece, to ascertain if their quality and measure were correctly
stated, and showed as much sagacity and clearness in all these trans-
actions as any European tradesman could do.'
In an Essay on Colonization, written by Walstrom, speaking of
the acuteness 0f the African race, he said, ' Though on the whole
passion is more predominant in the African character than reason,
yet their intellects are so far from being of an inferior order, that
one ?nds it dif?cult to account for their acuteness, which so far
transcends their apparent means of improvement.'
If we compare these testimonies with some of the statements
made by but too many of the witnesses in the House of Commons
Committee, we must confess, to say the least of it, that the objects
of these latter were to suppress what was right and just, and to
expose those things which were bad and ludicrous.
Under the above considerations, it is necessary that we should
premise that the framers of the ordinance regulating the form of
Government now to exist in Western Africa should not expect to
meet perfection in the working of their plans; since it is a well-
known fact that no Government can be cepied from a plan. Our
Legislature, therefore, must receive with caution the report of the
ill-disposed, who will magnify any seeming failure in their scheme,

LORD HOLLAND ON PERFECT CONSTITUTION.
and should reply to them in the words of Lord Holland: 'Attempts
to form a perfect constitution have uniformly failed, and those in-
stitutions have thriven best which have sprung out of the necessity
of the occasion. Constitutions are, in fact, productions that can
neither be created nor transplanted; they are the growth of time,
not the invention of ingenuity; and to frame a complete system of
government depending on habits of reference and experience, is an
attempt as absurd as to build a tree or to manufacture an opinion.
' The chief objection to a constitution complete in all its parts is
that in the course of the last twenty years the experiment has been
tried under various circumstances, and among different people, and
that in no one instance can it be said to have succeeded. A con-
stitution so drawn raises expectations which are not easily realised,
and the disappointment produces either indifference to all law, or,
on the contrary, a fresh endeavour, by the exaggeration of every
principle of liberty and the subversion of every practical provision
in the constitution, to attain an ideal perfection, of which, perhaps,
no human society is capable. Securities are devised against dangers
which never exist, and inconveniences are soon felt which were not
foreseen, and which no means are left for providing against. These
dif?culties must be submitted to, or, if removed, the alteration
shakes the con?dence of the public in the stabilities of law, the
fundamental nature of which has been represented to them as their
only security.' *
It cannot be denied by even the most casual observer that the
British portion of Western Africa has made a very rapid stride in
improvement since Sierra Leone has been formed. {/Fancy a lot of
slaves—unlettered, rude, naked, possessing no knowledge of the
useful arts—thrown into a wild country, to cut down the woods
and build towns; fancy these ragged, wild natives under British,
and, consequently, civilised in?uences, after a lapse of a few
years, becoming large landowners, possessing large mercantile
establishments and money, claiming a voice in the legislative
government, and giving their offspring proper English and foreign
education ; and dare you tell me that the African is not susceptible

' of improvement of the highest order, that he does not possess in
himself a principle of progression and a desire of perfection far
surpassing many exising nations—since it cannot be shown in the
world's history that any people with so limited advantages has shown
such results within ?fty years. //
In 1818, the immortal Clarkson, in the Congress of Aim-la-
Clzapelle, exhibited certain articles of native African manufacture to
the Emperor of Russia, whilst endeavouring to secure support in
the suppression of the slave-trade; viewing the articles, the
Emperor said, 'You astonish me; you have given me a new idea
of the state of these poor people; I was not aware that they were
so advanced in society. The works you have shown me are not the
works of brutes, but of men endued with natural and intellectual
powers, and capable of being brought to as high a degree of pro-
?ciency as any other men. A frica ought to be allowed to have a fair
chance of raising her character in the scale of the civilized world.'
' They have not,' it must be admitted, as a learned author re-
marked, ' contributed much towards the advancement of human art
and science, but they have shown themselves willing and able to
pro?t by these advantages when introduced among them. The
civilization of many African nations is much superior to that of the
aborigines of Europe during the ages which preceded the Goths
and Swedes in the north, and the Romans in the southern parts.
The old Finnish inhabitants of Scandinavia had long, as it has been
proved by the learned investigations of Riitis, the religion of Fetishes,
and a vocabulary as scanty as that of the most barbarous Africans.'
From ages immemorial they lived without government, laws, or
social union; in all matters of domestic or political importance each
individual was the supreme arbiter of his own actions; ' and they
displayed as little capability of emerging from the squalid sloth of
their rude and merely animal existence. When conquered by a.
people of Indo-German origin, who brought with them from the
East the rudiments of mental culture, they emerged more slowly
from their pristine barbarism than many of the native African
nations have since done. Even at the present day there are
hordes in various parts of Northern Asia whose heads have the
form belonging to the Tartars, to the Sclavonians, and other

ment in all its different phases. These witnesses belonged to a
country where civilization exists in perfection, and where for the last
eighteen hundred years the arts and sciences have been gradually
but securely advancing, and they forgot that the country which
they now see, and the inhabitants which form the subjects of
their observations and report, have only been under civilizing assist-
ance within the last ?fty years, which was the only time (and, in
many cases, less than that) Occu ied in brin inn" them from a
state of utter barbarism to that Wh they
are now. They also forgot that the number of civilizing agents
were so extremely small, in comparison with the bulk of the liberated
population, that they were as one to three or four thousand; and
Mr. Harris showed that he was extremely narrow in his views when
he stated in his evidence that the result of missionary labours upon
the natives is not so effective as it ought to be._ It would be as
absurd to attempt to compare the civilization of Britain ?fty years
after the landing of Julius Caesar with the civilization of Rome,
then in the zenith of her prosperity, as to attempt to compare the
result of civilization of a savage, barbarous race of Africa, during
?fty years' feeble attempts at civilization, with the civilization of the
nineteenth century in England. And, in fact, if the comparison be made
between the degree of improvement exhibited by the two countries,
history informs us that the present degree of improvement exhibited
by the liberated Africans under missionary in?uence far exceeds that
of Britain under Roman in?uences during a similar period of time.
At the early establishment of the colony of Sierra Leone, ere the
Emancipation Act was promulgated, and captured negroes liberated
from slave ships were introduced there, the Maroons and settlers
formed the black civilised inhabitants of the colony; they were by
nature a bigoted, self-opinionated race, who had been driven from
Nova Scotia. They looked down with contempt on the liberated
Africans, or ' nata' as they called them, and would not condescend
to link their blood with theirs, nor would they attempt to impart
to them the smallest portion of the education which they had re-
ceived; and the spirit of exclusiveness ran rampant among them.

of consanguinity took place amongst them; a race sprang up less
healthy and less energetic than the preceding, and a fearful mortality
was the consequence; while the liberated Africans proved to be capa-
ble of far greater powers of improvement than they were, and in turn
looked down on them but more in pity andcompassion than in disdain.
The missionaries during thes periods, in their laudable exertions

complexion, and features, by the force and in?uence of the several

' certain moral sentiments, certain intellectual faculties, which are
common to the entire human race, assuming the body and mind to
be in a normal state. The desire of food, the sexual passions, the
feeling of revenge, anger, fear, jealousy, sympathy, compassion,
pride, expectation, disappointment, the love of pleasure, the dislike
of pain, are shared by all men.'
I might adduce a great many examples to prove that the natural
tendency of the now civilised European was exactly the same as the
natural tendency of the now uncivilised African; but I shall here
only give a simple proof to show that this is not dissimilar to that
of the ancient inhabitants of Britain. The inhabitants of the Gold
Coast and other parts, to this day, paint their bodies with exquisite
taste and beauty, although it is now gradually falling into disuse.
History informs us that these were the wants and desires of the
?rst inhabitants of England; and Dr. Johnson, in his 'Life of Sir
F. Drake," has said: ' 1t is observable that most nations amongst
whom the use of clothes is unknown paint their bodies. Such was
the practice of the ?rst inhabitants of our own country. From this
custom did our earliest enemies, the Picts, owe their denomination.
As it is not probable that caprice or fancy should be uniform, there
must be doubtless some reasons for a practice so general, and pre-
vailing in distant parts of the world which have no communication
with each other.'
In the pages of history we ?nd it recorded, by a no less reliable
historian than Cicero, that the ancient Britons went about most
scantily clothed; they painted their bodies in fantastic fashions,
'offered up human victims to uncouth idols, and lived in hollow
trees and rude habitations.' As regards the amount of development
of their intellectual and moral faculties, we are told by the same
writer that the ugliest and most stupid slaves came from England;
and so degraded were the Britons considered in Rome, that he
urges Atticus, his friend, 'not to buy slaves from Britain on account
of their stupidity and their inaptitude to learn music and other
accomplishments.' His own words are comprised in the following:

argenti scrupulum esse unum in illa insula, neque ullam spem
preedae nisi ex mancipiis; ex quibus nullos puto, te literis aut musicis
eruditos expectare?"
The tone in which Caesar speaks of the ancient Britons is no less
contemptuous, for he calls them 'a nation of very barbarous
manners ;' he says that 'most of the people in the interior never
saw corn, but live upon milk and ?esh and are clothed with skins,
He further remarked in another place: "In their domestic habits
they are as degraded as the most savage nations. They are clothed
with skins, wear the hair of their heads unshaven and long, but
shave the rest of their bodies, except their upper lip, and stain
themselves a blue colour with wood, which give them a horrible
aspect in battle.'
Remarking on the foregoing, Dr. Prichard observes that 'the
ancient Britons were nearly on a level with the New Zealanders and
Tahitians of the present day, or, perhaps, not very superior to the
Australians.' He in another place also remarked that ' of all, Pagan
nations the Gauls and Britons appeared to have had the most
sanguinary rites. They may well be compared in this respect with
the Ashanti, Dahomians, and other nations of Western Africa.'
Now let us ask would it be consistent with reason, with common
sense and justice, with humanity, for Tacitus, Caesar, or Pliny, to
have condemned the British island and the British nation to an
eternity of Boeotian darkness—' to be the of?cina of hereditary
bondage and transmitted helplessness '2' And yet if we read some
of the testimonies in the late Parliamentary Report (1865) and
most of the writings of the members of the Anthropological Society,
we ?nd that the negro race, from some supposed moral and intel-
lectual inferiority, are condemned by men who, in many respects,
can be regarded as generous and honourale to liye in perpetual
ignorance misery and barbarit forgetting that as the present un-
tutored negroes a ear to them,
' Just such [their] sires appeared in Caesar's eyes.'

Politics,' has laid down a general aphorism, which might be well
applied to the forthcoming measures of the Government—~viz., that
when the average and predominant operation of a political form
or institution is good, it may yet be frustrated by the badness of
those who use it. We hope, therefore, that we shall not have to
liken the persons on whom the execution of the scheme of the
Government depends to the tools of a re?ned maker placed in
the hands of a clumsy or ignorant artisan; since they may, from
their moral defects, convert wholesome food into poison through
the want of skill, intelligence, patience, and habits of sustained
attention and mutual forbearance; while the denier of African
advancement will not look to them as the cause of the failure, but
will entirely throw aside the legal maxim—
Quilibet prsesumitur bonus, donec probetur contrarium—
and lay the whole blame, unheard, on the incapacity of the African
race to support such a Government.
It cannot be expected that this tentative legislative improve-
ment will give unalloyed satisfaction in all the different govern-
ments on the Coast. It may produce displeasure amongst those
who from 1842 had independent action, which has become a- time-
honoured custom to them; and we do not blame them, since habit
is second nature; but they must remember that no legislative
changes could be made without producing some inconvenience, and
it is only by these means that they can progress in their
political history, and advance in civilization; that the world
would have been stationary through successive generations had
no changes taken place; and that the greatness of England is
dependent on the gradual and successive changes in her political
economy; and we must recommend to them the words of Lord
Bacon in his 'Essay on Innovation '*—' It is true that what
is settled by custom, though it be not good, yet at least it is ?t,
and those things which have long gone together are, as it were,
confederate within themselves; whereas new things piece not so
well, but though they help by their utility, yet they trouble by
their inconformity; besides they are, like strangers, more admired

and less favoured. All this is true, if time stood still; which
contrariwise would so sound, that a froward retention of custom
is as turbulent a thing as an innovation, and they that reverence
too much old things are but a scorn to the new.' As well as that
of Niebnhr*—' The noblest and most salutary forms and insti-
tutions, whether in civil or moral societies, when bequeathed from
generation to generation, after the lapse of centuries will prove
defective. However exquisitely ?t they may have been when they
were ?rst framed, it would be necessary that the vital power in
States and Churches should act instinctively, and evince a faculty
of perpetually adapting itself to the occasion.' Man is a dis-
satis?ed animal, and his m'sus, or natural tendency, is to improve
the status quo. But notwithstanding this progressive tendency which
always actuates him, the colonists must rest satis?ed now with what
they have obtained, and wait patiently until the time when their im-
provement will necessitate the adoption of a better and a more inde-
pendent form of Government; then their rulers will consider the
means best ?tted for the attainment of this end, and what prac-
tical, not ideal, form of Government will be best suited to their
condition ; whether the republican or monarchical.

CHAPTER IV.
FALSE THEORIES OF MODERN ANTHROPOLOGISTS.
I MUST say a few words on some grave errors in generalization
which men of science with restricted observation have arrived at
respecting the capacity of progression in the African race. Thus
it has been argued that their physical and mental peculiarities have
undergone no change since they were ?rst observed by civilized
nations. ' The type,' says Sir George Cornewall Lewis, 'is as un-
changed as that of the greyhound, since the time of the Romans.'*
Hume, in his Essay on 'Natural Characters/T says that, 'There
scarcely ever was a civilized nation of that complexion (negro), nor
even any individual eminent either in action or speculation. . . . In
Jamaica, indeed, they talk of one negro as a man of parts and
learning, but it is likely he is admired for slender accomplishments,
like a parrot who speaks a few words plainly.'
A witty writer, the late Dr. Knox, of Edinburgh, believes that
the races of men, particularly the negro, as they were several
centuries ago, still continue to be now; and that despite of
Christian in?uences and other civilizing agencies bearing on their
rude and savage character, they will still continue to be. Although
there might be something suggestive and interesting in this anti-
theological scienti?c doctrine propounded in his ' Fragment of the
Races of Men;' yet still we deprecate in the strongest terms the main
points of his arguments. Resting them on what has been discovered
in Egypt, he maintained that 'on the banks of the Nile still
wandered in considerable numbers the descendants of men who built
the Pyramids and carved the Sphinx and Memnon. On the tombs
of Egypt, the most valuable of all existing records, there stands the
Negro, the Jew, the Copt, the Persian, the Samaritan, nearly as we

?nd them still. Different races of men are sketched on the walls of
the tomb opened by Belzoni, showing that the characteristic dis-
tinctions of races were as well marked three thousand years ago as
now. The negro and other races existed there as they are at
present, or if a pure race has appeared to undergo permanent
change when transferred to a climate di?ering from its own, such
.change will be found on closer inquiry to be delusive.'
Now it must be acknowledged that the damaging in?uences to
which the negro race has for centuries been subjected, have not been
favourable to the improvement of their condition, nor in any way raising
their minds to a higher species of cultivation ; trampled under foot by
perpetual despotism, enslaved from one generation to another, in-
habiting the most wretched hovels that it is possible for humanity to
exist in, deprived of every means of education or of witnessing the
conquests of arts and science, pent up as it were within the circum-
ference of their own towns and villages, not daring to travel even a
few miles without an escort for fear of being captured and sold as
slaves, can there be the least doubt in the minds of the unprejudiced
that their present unimproved condition is the natural sequence of
the operation of these powerful demoralizing re-agents? True it_
is that certain peculiarities which are characteristic of a nation can
be traceable for generations, however greatly admixture and other
external in?uences may have operated on their general character;
but to insist on the broad dogma that no changes have taken place
in the races of men, or even animals, as far back as historical evi-
dences can be traced, is to insist on what is opposed to nature; and
none but the unre?ecting can be carried away by so sweeping a
doctrine. Dr. Knox regards everything to be subservient to race;
and his arguments are brought forward to show that the negro
race, in spite of all the exertions of Exeter Hall, or as his com-
mentators most sneeringly call them, the 'broad-brimmed philan-
thropy and dismal science school,' will still continue as they were.
To him, as he says, 'Race is everything—literature, science, art—in
a word, civilization depends on it. . . . \Nith me race or hereditary
descent is everything, it stamps the man.'
Of late years a society has been formed in England in imitation
of the Anthropological Society of Paris, which might be made of

great use to science had it not been for the profound prejudice
exhibited against the negro race in their discussions and in their
writings. They again revive the old and vexed question of race,
which the able researches of Blumenbach, Prichard, Pallas, Hunter,
Lacépéde, Quatrefages, Geoffrey St. Hilaire, and many others, had
years ago (as it was thought) settled. They placed the structure
of the anthropoid apes before them, and then commenced the dis-
cussion of a series of ideal structures of the negro which only
exist in their imagination, and thus endeavour to link the negroes
with the brute creation. Some of their statements are so bare-
facedly false, so utterly the subversion of scienti?c truth, that they
serve to exhibit the writers as perfectly ignorant of the subjects of
which they treat. The works of Carl Vogt, 'Lectures on Man ;'
of Dr. Hunt, 'Negroes' Place in Nature ;' and of Prunner Bey,
'Mémoire sur les Negres, 1861,' contain, in many respects, tissues
of the most deceptive statements, calculated to mislead those who
are unacquainted with the African race.
M. Prunner Bey rests his description on observations of the
most narrow nature con?ned to Egypt; his 'Jlfémoz're ' on the negro
race, which has been made so much of, and which forms the key-
stone for writers on negro formation in these days, was made on
slaves, who for the last two thousand years have been subjected
to the most damnifying degradation by their most austere Moham-
medan masters ; yet still this description is held up as the standard.
We can, therefore, account for his opening fallacy: ' The stature of
the negro approaches the middle size. . . . I know of no instance
of dwar?sm among negroes; though the monuments of Egypt
show that there were dwarfs among negroes at a very remote
epoch. . . . Obesity is exceptionally found in the males of high
rank and more frequently in women.' Now, from the above state-
ment it would appear that there are no dwarfs among the negroes,
and in fact these who quote or comment on his statement af?rm
that to be the case, which is a great mistake; there are very likely
none amongst the serfs of Egypt, whilst before me now, in J ames-
town, Accra, on the Gold Coast, there are three dwarfs, and in
every part of the West Coast I have met with them, except in
the Gambia. Obesity he considers not to be a common thing

among the negroes, and certainly not amongst those in Egypt; as
the negroes there follow the general rule in mankind, that obesity
is found among the rich, indolent, well fed, and little-to-do in-
habitants, and not generally among slaves.
Of Dr. Hunt we must truly state that he knows nothing of the
negro race, and his descriptions are borrowed from the writings of
men who are particularly prejudiced against that race; his absurd
pro-slavery views, as contained in his pamphlet, would perhaps have
suited a century ago; but all true Africans must dismiss them
with scorn.
Carl Vogt, in his lectures, takes the worst specimen of a hundred
and ?fty different negro races, such as the Austral negro, who
exhibits the worst possible form, to compare with the best
specimen of the proud Caucasian race—the Germans, and the
skull of the great mathematician, Gaus, the standard; at the
same time depriving the negro race of some of its best speci-
mens, the Mandingoes and Ka?irs, as these would not suit his pur-
pose. His descriptions are, therefore, one-sided, erroneous, and most
deceptive.
. Quatrefages has given the following most able statement as his
views respecting the difference between man and animals. He says :
' Shall we ?nd the characters of the human kingdom in the intel-
lectual capacity ? Certainly, the comparison of the mental develop-
ment of man with the rudimentary intelligence of even the most
gifted animals, never suggested itself to me. The interval between
brute and man is in this respect so great that a perfect difference
between them was admissible. But this is no longer tenable. The
animal does possess intelligence, and though their fundamental
capacities are less developed, they nevertheless exist; the animal
feels, wills, remembers, deliberates, and the correctness of his
judgment seems frequently miraculous; whilst the very errors
which the animal corrects give evidence that its judgments are not
the mere results of a blind and necessary impulse. We, moreover,
observe great inequalities in the various groups of animals. Thus,
among the vertebrata, we see that birds much excel ?shes and
reptiles, but are much inferior to mammals. It would, therefore,
not be surprising if among the latter we were to ?nd some animal

possessing a much higher intelligence; this would only be a progress,
but no fundamentally new phenomena.
' What we observe of intelligence in general applies also to his
highest manifestation—language. Man, it is true, alone possesses
articulate language; but two classes of animals possess voice.
They, like ourselves, produce tones which express feelings and
thoughts, and which are not only understood by individuals of the
same species, but even by man. The hunter learns quickly to
understand what is called the language of birds and beasts; nor
does it require a long apprenticeship to distinguish their sounds of
love, passion, pain, or alarm. This kind of language is no doubt
very rudimentary, consisting, it might be said, of mere interjections,
but it is suf?cient to establish the mutual relation of these creatures.
But does this language di?er fundamentally from that of man by
the mechanism of its production, its object, and its results?
Anatomy, physiology, and experience teach that it does not; here
also we ?nd a progress, an immense development, but nothing
absolutely new.
'Finally, as regards the qualities of the heart, which partly
depend on instinct and partly on intelligence, we ?nd their mani-
festations in the animal as we ?nd them in the man. The animal
loves and hates; it is known how greatly many of them are attached
to their young, and how strong is the instinctive hatred with which
some animals pursue each other. It is known how the congenital
faculties may be further developed by training. We also ?nd
among our domestic animals individual characters, as we ?nd
among men. We all know how docile and good-natured some dogs
are, and how vicious and irritable others. Man and brute resemble
each other, perhaps, most as regards character.
' Where then shall we ?nd this something new which is absent in
the animal and belongs exclusively to man, and which would justify
the establishment of a separate kingdom? In order to overcome
this di?iculty we shall follow the naturalist, and examine all the
characters of the being to which we are to assign a place. We
have hitherto directed our attention chie?y to the organic, physio-
logical, and intellectual characters of man; we must now consider
him in his moral aspect; here we ?nd the fundamental features

which have as yet escaped our notice. We ?nd in every society
possessing a language suf?ciently developed to express abstract
ideas words designating virtue and vice, good or evil. Where
language fails in this respect we ?nd opinions and habits which
plainly show that the notions exist, though not expressed in the
vocabulary. Even among the most savage peoples and tribes to
which by general consent is assigned the lowest rank in humanity,
we see public or individual actions performed, which show that
man recognizes something above what is physically good or eviL
Among nations further advanced the whole political economy rests
upon this basis.
'The abstract idea of moral good and evil thus exists in every
human society; nothing leads us to suppose that it also exists in
animals; here, then, we have the ?rst character of the human
kingdom. In order to avoid the word conscience, which is fre-
quently taken in too restricted a sense, I call morality that quality
which furnishes man with the above notions, just as we term sensi-
bility that quality which perceives impressions.
' There are other allied conceptions which are found in all, even
the smallest and most degraded societies of man. Everywhere man
believes in another world different from ours, in mysterious beings
of a higher nature which must be feared or worshipped, in a future
life after the destruction of the body; in other words, the notions
of a Deity and a future life prevail generally as those of good and
evil. However faint these ideas may be, they everywhere give rise
to important facts. From such notions arise a number of habits
and usages which, even among the most savage peoples, are the
equivalents of the greater manifestations among civilized peoples.
'Never has anything similar or analogous been observed in
animals ; we ?nd, therefore, in the existence of these conceptions a
second character of the human kingdom, and designate the sum of
the qualities which furnish man with these notions—religiousness.'
But Carl Vogt scoffs at the religious conception of Quatrefages,
as difference between man and animals, and accounts for the non-
existence of the idea in the latter from the supposition that man
forms ideas concerning certain phenomena which he cannot fathom,
which animals through their inferior mental capacity take no con-

sideration of. ' The idiotic Cretan,' says he, 'takes no notice of
thunder; the simple-minded in ignorance of causes fears it; the
heathen imagines a thunder-god; the Christians also believe that
God speaks in thunder; whilst the intelligent man produces himself
thunder and lightning, when provided with proper apparatus. This
is the usual march of religious ideas, and I know of no suf?cient
reason for endowing the human race with religiousness as an ex-
clusive quality.'
Whilst admitting that negro children, in schools, have shown in-
tellectual capacities in no point behind the white child, he emphati-
cally states that after puberty, and the closing of the sutures, and
the 'projecting of the jaws,' the intellectual faculties become
stationary, the individual, as well as his race, is incapable of further
improvement. 'The grown-up negro,' he writes, 'partakes, as re-
gards his intellectual faculties, of the nature of the child, the female,
and the senile white. He manifests a propensityyto pleasure, music,
dancing, physical enjoyments, and imitation, whilst his inconstanc;r
of impression and of feelings are those of the child. Like the child,
the negro has no soaring imagination, but he peoples surrounding
nature and endows even lifeless things with human and supernatural
powers. He makes himself a fetish of a piece of wood, and believes
that the ape remains dumb lest he should be compelled to work.
The negro resembles the female in his love to children, his family,
and his cabin; he resembles the old man in his indolence, apathy,
and his obstinacy. Temperate in common things, the negro
becomes intemperate if not kept within certain bounds. He
knows not steady work, cares little for the future; but his great
imitative instinct enables him to become a skilful workman and
artistic imitator.'
This is truly German; we have always been told that this
superior race are given to speculative theories of the most wild and
extravagant nature. No one who knows properly the character of
the negro race will read without a smile this exuberant ignorant
eloquence of Carl Vogt, which is a borrowed inspiration of the
late American slave-state school. When will that happy time come
when modern anthr0pological philosophers, who at present are one-
eyed, and totally ignorant of the capacity of the African race, will

desist from fabricating in their studies the most egregious calumnies
on the race already suf?ciently downtrodden?
But we have numerous evidences to prove the fallacy of such
statements as those of Carl Vogt. Captain Burton, who is one of
the greatest decriers of the negro race, an anthropologist himself, in
his evidence in the late Parliamentary Committee was obliged to
admit that the grown-up native of Sierra Leone is dreaded on the
rest of the coast; he can examine a witness in the police-court as
well as any lawyer in England. It is certainly impossible for an
imbecile to do this. He stated that some of the merchants have
considerable fortunes and they are men of 'considerable intellect.'
In his work. 'Wanderings in I/Vestern A ?ica from Liverpool to
Fernando Po,' where he displayed without reserve his hatred for the
African race, and where towards that race he is personally abusive,
turgidly illustrative, and illogically argumentative, talking of another
part of the Coast, he was reluctantly compelled to make a confession
from his practical knowledge which throws into shade the wild imagi-
nation of the German philosopher: 'There are,' says he, 'about 100
Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent
fellows, but it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear
to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulattoes. The
possibility of such a thing had never yet reached my brain. At
last, in colloquy with an old friend upon the Coast, the idea started
up, and after due discussion we adopted it. I speak as to morale.
In intellect the black race is palpabe superior, and it is, in fact,
advancing in the path of civilization.'* And Colonel Ord, B-.M.,
Governor of Bermuda, in his evidence, states that the high class of
natives of Sierra Leone, who are pure negroes, are decidedly in-
telligent, trustworthy, and highly respectable gentlemen, who have
risen entirely by their own exertions. Of the present master of the
grammar school, a pure negro, the Rev. J as. Quaker, Colonel 0rd
considers him to be ' a native gentleman and a clergyman of the
Church of England, of high character and considerable attaimnents.'
But Carl Vogt, who, perhaps, has never seen a negro in his life,
and who is perfectly ignorant as to the capabilities of the negro

race, must needs deceive his pupils in Geneva on subjects that he
knows nothing about. He tells them that as the young orangs and
chimpanzees are good-natured, amiable, intelligent, very apt to
learn and become civilized, so is the young negro; but that after
puberty and the necessary transformation has taken place, as the
former becomes an obstinate savage beast, incapable of any improve-
ment, so the intellect of the negro becomes stationary, and he is in-
capable of any further progress-that, in fact, the supposed sudden
metamorphoses (which rest only in his ideas) in puberty, said to
have taken place in the negro at this period, is not only intimately
connected with physical development, but is a repetition of the
phenomena occurring in the anthropoid apes.
If we follow Carl Vogt a little further, we ?nd that, after describ-
ing the gorilla as having long arms reaching to the forelegs, a short
powerful neck with narrow shoulder, a pendulous belly, a long great
toe, and a ?at foot, he endeavours to ?nd in his ideal faculty resem~
blance to the negro corporeal structure. ' The trunk,' he says, ' is
smaller in proportion to the extremities, especially to the arm, which
in the negro reaches below the middle of the femur. Most negroes
can, without stooping, reach with the ?ngers' end the regions above
the knee-cap. The neck is short, the civercal muscles very power-
ful, but the shoulders are narrower and less strong than in the
white. There is a certain resemblance in the form of the neck to
that of the gorilla, to which the remarkable development of the
cervical muscles, combined with the shortness and curvature of this
part, gives something of the aspect of the bull's neck. Surely it is
for this reason that the negro always carries his burden on the head,
rarely upon the shoulders or back 5 and it is for this reason that he,
like the ram, uses his hard skull in a ?ght. The chest is narrow,
the auteroposterior is always equal to the transverse diameter,
which predominates in the German; the belly is relaxed and pendu-
lous, and the navel situated nearer the symphises pubes than in the
European. Even in muscular negroes the arms are less rotund, the
hips narrow, the thighs laterally compressed, the calves lean. The
negro rarely stands quite upright, the knees are usually bent, and
the legs frequently bandy; hands and feet are long, narrow, and
?at, and they form the least attractive features in the negro ?gure.

CARL VOGT'S RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS. 43
Most of these external characterisitics,' he continues, 'remind us
irresistibly of the ape ; the short neck, the long lean limbs, the project-
ing pendulous belly; all this a?crds a glimmer of the ape beneath the
human envelope.' Thus far, Carl Vogt.
Now, is this not a base prostitution of scienti?c truth? I have
seen more than a hundred thousand negroes, but have not been able
to ?nd these characteristic differences which Carl Vogt, who has
never seen one, or Prunner Bey, who saw Egyptian negro slaves,
essay to describe. Indeed, as amongst every other tribe, white or
black, there are to be found some with short necks, and others whose
necks are peculiarly long; but where are to be found negroes with
pendulous bellies as the anthropoid apes ? not in Africa surely, for
from Senegal to the Cameroons the negroes I have met with are
peculiar for the perfect ?atness of their bellies. But Carl Vogt
descends from the absurd to the ridiculous; when, writing on the
peculiarities of the human foot as characters differentiating man and
ape, he went on to state that ' the foot of the gorilla is more
anthropoid than that of any other ape, and the foot of the negro
more apelike than that of the white man. The bones of the tarsus
in the gorilla exactly resemble those in the negro.' We must only
dismiss these absurdities by referring him to M. Aeby's measure-
ments, which led him to the conclusion that individual races are not
distinguishable from each other when the proportion of their limbs
and these parts are examined; that the difference between the fore-
arm of the European and the negro amounts to less than one per
cent., and even he thinks that this slight difference which he has
obtained may, by further and more extended measurement, be
greatly reduced. Thus, therefore, there is no material difference
in the proportion of the limbs between the European and negro.

CHAPTER V.
SOME ANATOMICAL ACCOUNTS OF NEGRO PHYSIQUE.
BUT it is in the development of the most important organ of the
b0dy,—the brain, and its investing parieties—that much stress has
been laid to prove the simian or apelike character of the negro
race. The development of its convolutions has been demonstrated
by Gratiolet and Wagner to be an important particular in the dis-
tinction between man and the anthropoid apes. In the latter,
during the development of the embryo, in utero, the convolutions of
the spheno-temporal lobe are ?rst developed, and then those of the
frontal lobe ; but in man the contrary is the case, the frontal con-
volutions are ?rst developed, and the spheno-temporal last.
If we take for granted the external projecting organ of the
brain,—-the skul is as regards the sutures intimately connected
with the brain; in man, we ?nd that the posterior sutures ?rst
close, and the frontal and coronal last, but in the anthropoid ape
the contrary is the case. Among the negro race, at least among
the thousands that have come under my notice, the posterior
sutures ?rst close, then the frontal and coronal, and the contrary
has never been observed by me in even a single instance, not even
among negro idiots ; and yet M. Gratiolet and Carl Vogt, without
an opportunity of investigating the subject to any extent, have un-
hesitatingly propagated the most absurd and erroneous doctrine,—
that the closing of the sutures in the negro follows the simious or
animal arrangement, di?ering from that already given as the
governing condition in man. ' We know, and Gratiolet has pointed
it out, that the negro skull follows, as regards the closing of the
sutures, a different law from the skull of the white man; that the
frontal and coronal sutures, as in the ape, close earlier than the
posterior sutures, whilst the reverse is the case in the white man.
Would it then be so very hazardous to assume that the simian de-
velopment of the skull in the negro extends also to the brain?'


## p. 45 (#69) ##############################################

DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEGRO BRAIN. . 45
Thus from erroneous data, Carl Vogt wishes to prove that, like the
orang-outang, the development of the spheno-temporal convolutions
of the cerebrum in the foetus appears ?rst in the negro, whilst the
frontal convolutions appear last; or, that the series of development
which in the white man is from Alpha to Omega, is in the Negro
and in the orang from Omega to Alpha. Can any doctrine be
found based upon a greater prostitution of scienti?c truth? The
supposed specimen of Gratiolet was described from the savage bush—
man, which Carl Vogt stamped as that of the typical negro.
In Dr. Hunt's brochure 'On the Negroes' Place in. Nature,' he
endeavoured to prove that the negro, being in his opinion intel-
lectually inferior to the European or white race, should occupy a
servile position in nature. In his edition of Carl Vogt, ' Lecture on
Man,' we ?nd the statement that the cranial capacity of the human
race in the course of centuries became gradually increased. He states
that the skulls of the Parisian population in the twelfth century,
when compared with that of the nineteenth century, show a great
difference in capacity in favour of the latter period; the civilized
modern population has greater increased capacity over the more
savage population of the twelfth century. Now by the measure;
ments made by Aitkin Meigs and Morton, it is proved beyond a
doubt that the negroes in Africa possess a far larger cranial capa-
city than the negroes in America. And again, according to Aitkin
Meigs, the negroes born in America present a cranial capacity, the
volume of which is represented by 1,323-90 cubic centimetres, and
according to the same observer, with the same method of measure-
ment, the cranial capacity of negroes born in Africa shows a volume
of 1,371-42, exhibiting therefore a difference of 46'52 volumes of
cubic centimetres.
Carl Vogt admits that if the tables of Aitkin Meigs and Morton
were to be examined with regard to races, they exhibit the remark-
able fact that all European nations, without exception, have a cranial
capacity of more than 1,400 cubic centimetres, although some have
less. He admits, also, that every demoralizing in?uence on a race
tends to diminish the capacity, as mental exercise tends to increase
it. The difference between the capacity of the negroes born in
Africa and that of the average European cranial capacity, is only

about 29-00 cubic centimetres. But the experiments of Aitkin
Meigs and Morton were made in America on the dead skulls of
negroes, who truly had been transported from their native land in
Africa to America, but who for years were subjected to the most
depressing in?uence of slavery, and after years of toil in the ?eld
became victims, either of the climate, or some other natural in-
?uences, which, of course, must have a damnifying effect on the de-
velopment of the brain, and, consequently, the cranial capacity, and
will at once account for the small difference which is said'to exist
(deduced from the experiments of the two observers above quoted)
between the European and the African negro skull. This con?rms
the statement of the great German philosopher, Tiedeman, who, by
careful measurement, weighing, and other investigations, proved
that there exists no material difference between the brain of the
white and black races. Besides Tiedeman, Blumenbach, the great
German physiologist, has contributed a vast deal of information
towards establishing this fact.
Well might Carl Vogt exclaim, 'Is this the eifect of that cursed
institution which degrades man to the condition of chattel, and de-
prives him of that liberty which alone can lead to a higher develop-
ment? ' He admits as an indisputable fact that those classes of
mankind which in successive generations follow mental occupations,
possess a greater development of the skull than the ignorant masses,
who are engaged in the meanest occupations. But we must depend
upon the direct investigations and experiments among natives of
Africa, who have mastered the necessary anatomical and physio-
logical knowledge in European Universities to make these experi-
ments in Africa upon dead and living subjects. This can only be
, accomplished by a Medical School being established in Africa, and
facilities offered for obtaining subjects for dissection and ex-
periments.*
' The Author feeling certain of the immense advantage which Africa will
derive from so important an establishment, and. knowing that for the popula-
tion to rise they require some tangible stimulus, proposed the following
scheme to the Home Government for a Medical School in Sierra Leone, the
Central Government of Western Africa, in a letter to the Secretary of State for
War (a portion of which is here quoted), dated 13th July, 1861. Dixcove Fort :-

NATURE OF NEGRO COLOUR. 47
It is needless to enter here into a discussion on colour, as
Prunner Bey himself admits that the negro colouring matter is
exactly the same as that found in freckles and the tanned skin of
that the greatest friends of the Africans are the philanthropic sons of Britain;
and that the Government under whose sway they obtained liberty, and can
consider themselves perfect free-men, and from whom also they have received
paramount blessings, both temporal and spiritual, is the English Government.
Africa, therefore, has everything to gain whilst Britannia rules the world. By
her squadron she keeps a watchful eye on all those nations who would follow
that nefarious practice—the slave trade ; her adventurous sons, the mis-
sionaries, pierce through the very den of barbarism to become pioneers of
civilization. The consequence therefore is that the Africans have a natural at-
tachment for the Government that espouses their cause, and also for the
philanthropic sons of that Government, who always take advantage of every
opportunity to better their condition. Many have been the means which the
English Government has used to raise the condition of the African. This is
universally known by every nation, and the African also thoroughly knows
and feels it.
"'he last act which is of great importance to the scienti?c world, to the
rising generation of Africa, and to the whole population of Western Africa, is
that which the Government has lately taken, and which was so strongly argued
by the late Minister of War, Lord Panmure—viz., of educating young sons of
Africa in the medical profession, and placing them in the Army to serve
principally in Western Africa. This in the very face of it, carries advantages
with it which no other Government has thought of; and we in Africa are
certain that when the Government has undertaken a. subject of such intrinsic
importance, and of so great utility to the country under their Government,
they will be the last to stop short when the work is in an embryonic state
and with nothing to prevent its germination.
' The system of educating African surgeons for the Army stationed on the
Coast of Africa has manifold advantages :—
' 1st, As to the Government and its o?icers on the Coast; 2nd, As to the
country and the people who inhabit it ; 3rd, As to the scienti?c world.
' Of all the British possessions, the Coast of Africa is rightly considered the
most unhealthy and deadly, in consequence of which the best educated pro-
fessional men are re uired to take care of those who are sent out to govern and
keep order in it. t is a well-known fact, that practical experience and a
thorough investigation of certain diseases make a man become acquainted
with the different phases which those diseases may take, as well as the best
remedies to combat them. The perfection of this truism cannot be accomplished
unless some years he spent where the disease is rife, and its pathology and
treatment carefully investigated.
' The Coast is so prejudicial to European constitutions, that the Government
has been pleased to allow medical officers to remain only one year in it.
During that short period it is impossible for them to take any vital interest in
the diseases of the Coast, and beyond the ordinary routine of business, the
fatigue from the heat of the sun prevents them from a study which some
would be only too happy to follow ; and after the lapse of twelve months, their
tour of duties being pro tem. expired, they are relieved ; or, even before the
end of the year, some are invalided home from disease contracted through the
baneful in?uence of the climate.

effect of malaria, and various a?ections 0f the spleen and liver. But
I may here remark that European children in the tropics, when
' But an African properly educated in Medicine, is in his native soil ; there
he remains (not that he is never ill—no—but in the majority of cases it is

to investigate the causes, effects, and patho ogy of the diseases belonging to the

many valuable lives might have been saved.

'The immortal Sir Fowell Buxton has truly affirmed that if Africa. is to be
civilized and evangelized it must be by her progeny. For reasons before
stated—viz., the injurious in?uence of the climate on European constitutions,
as well as the slow and gradual pace with which civilization and improvement
?nd their way amongst a population who are adverse to anything that appears
to destroy the customs of their forefathers, and also, the soil not being native
to the Euro eans, andthat they, therefore, cannot fraternise with the people who
are not hig ly-educated in the same degree as with persons from their own
native country—it is impossible for the surgeon employed for such a short and
temporary time on the Coast to take any deep interest in examining and de-
veloping the scienti?c resources of the country.
The Government look forward to the improvement of the country, and that
improvement can never be properly accomplished, unless by the aid of the
educated native portion of the cmnmum'ty. It is the African who can take a.
deep and vital interest in the rise of the country ; it is he who when placed in.
a position to raise the standard of his countrymen, will never give up on
slight disappointment, but will continue on, till he has accomplished his
end. It will, therefore, be of very great importance to the country and to the
people, should the Government continue to send to the Coast of Africa, well-
cducatcd natives, scienti?c and professional men to serve in it, for the country
will be largely bene?tted by it.
' 3rd, As to the scienti?c world.
' The scienti?c resources of Western Africa are entirely in embryo ; and we
can literally and truly state that we are perfectly ignorant of them. There are
vast treasures in the bowels of this extensive continent, potent medicines in
its picturesque ?eld, and objects of great importance to t e naturalist, as yet
unknown to the scienti?c world. Here then are subjects which the short stay
of a European surgeon on the Coast will not permit him to investigate ; but
the African surgeon, stationed in one place at ?rst, say the Gold Coast, and
then removed to the other stations—say, Sierra. Leone and the Gambia—has
ample opportunity of investigating these subjects ; and medicine and science
generally, will be greatly benc?tted by it.
'In every respect, then, the Government has begun an excellent and

delicately and carefully brought up, possessa great delicacy of
colour and complexion; but when thrown into the world at a very
early age, and subject to the climate and other demoralizing in-
praiseworthy undertaking, and which will make every African invoke blessing
on her efforts, as it is one of intrinsic value to the country, the people of
Africa, as well as the Government.
' Two out of the three who were ?rst sent to be educated in the
medical profession for the Army, have now ?nished their studies, and are at-
tached to the Army stationed on the Coast; the other, unfortunately, suc-
cumbed to the in?uence of the cold climate. The testimony, received through
the Church Missionary Society by the Government, as to the efficiency and
behaviour of the three African students, who were educated through the in-
strumentality of the Government, from the Dean of the Medical Faculty of
King's College, London, the College where they were educated, was of a
nature, I believe, to encourage further trial, and to prove that the African,
when placed in a proper position, employed his time to the best advantage ;
and all the Africans on the Coast, and the friends of African improvement,
consider it a misfortune to the country that the wish of the Government and
of the Church Missionary Society, that seven more Africans should be sent to
receive education in Medicine, has not been carried out.
' It may be asked what would be the best means of effectually carrying out
this excellent plan of educating young Africans in the science of Medicine?
Having had ample opportunity of carefully studying all the various bearings
of the subject, hope that the following suggestions will meet with your
approbation.
' Thata small Government Medical Establishment be made at Sierra Leone,
and that certain young men, not above the age of twenty, be selected from
those in the Church Missionary College or Schools, who have made some pro-
?ciency in Latin, Greek, and Mathematics. [In a subsequent letter the
Author proposed that selection should be made from the four Colonies and.
settlements—via, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, and Cape Coast] That they
should be prepared in the preliminaries of Medicine—viz, Anatomy,
Physiology, Chemistry, Botany (of Africa), Natural History, Hospital Practice
and Pharmacy, for a certain period, from one year and a half to two years.
That they should continue during that time their classical studies, limited to
those books required by the colleges, in the way the Master of the establish-
ment might think best. That the Master be an African, since, as we have en-
deavoured to prove, he will take a far greater interest in performing what will
tend to elevate his country. That he should have his full power and
credentials for selecting young men and managing the establishment from the
Home Government, and that he should in any case of doubt consult the
Church Missionary Society at Sierra Leone. Should it be left to the local
power, I am certain that his efforts would be paralysed. That a few wax-works
and books he sent for the establishment, according to the application of the
Master, who should also keep a laboratory for his chemical class. That the
students be allowed a certain amount, according to the discretion of the
Government, for their board, clothing, and other expenses, which I am certain
would not be too costly.
' For anatomy and dissection, monkeys may be advantageously used, as well
as the wax-work. The botany of \Vestern Africa as Well as the natural
history should be studied, and the Master, therefore, must be acquainted

?uences, become exceedingly dark, and show a marked difference in
their form, proportion, and features, the degree commensurating
with the amount of the deprivation to which the young has been
subjected. If this is true among European children born in the
tropics, how much more true is it with those who have been subju-
gated for numberless centuries to the baneful in?uence of demorali-
zation? Is it not the fact, then, as remarked by Mr. Armistcad,
that it is only when the negroes are in possession of privileges and
advantages equivalent to the rest of mankind, that a fair com-
parison can be drawn between the one and the other. 'The negro,'
said he, 'by nature our equal, made like ourselves, after the image
of. the Creator, gifted by the same intelligence, impelled by the
same passions and affections, and redeemed by the same Saviour,
has now become reduced through cupidity and oppression, nearly to
the level of the brute, spoiled of his humanity, plundered of his
rights, and often hurried to a premature grave, the miserable
victim of avarice and heedless tyranny.' How true are the remarks
of the great Clarkson, 'Men have presumptuously dared to wrest
from their fellows the most precious of their rights, to intercept, as
with these subjects. For hospital practice and pharmacy, abundant op-
portunities are offered at Sierra Leone.
' It is a very dif?cult thing for the student unacquainted with anything in
Medicine to begin in England, and compete with students who generally
have had preliminary education in some of the subjects before they enter the
proper colleges; and I am certain that by these means the Government
would have their wishes ful?lled, and the country and people be greatly
benc?tted.--&c., &c., &c.,

The Author received a most favourable reply from the Secretary of State for
War, who said that the subject should have his attention and consideration.
At the same time, communications were forwarded to the principal Medical
Of?cer and to the Oilicer Commanding on the Gold Coast, for information
bearing on the subject, so as to know how far the 'intended substitution,
either wholly or in part, of native African for European medical of?cers, is
likely to be successful.' The subject received a combined and warm
opposition, which nipped it in the bud.
The Author observing the fearful mortality of European engineers on the
Coast, proposed that natives from the three different Colonies should be
educated for that express purpose also; but the Home Government has now de-
cided that European of?cers who have got experience in the diseases of the
Coast, should serve as long as they like in it, with the advantage of each
year counting double for promotion and retirement. But, as yet, no atten-
tion has been paid to the subject of native engineers.

far as they can, the bounty and grace of the Almighty, to close the
door to their intellectual progress, to shut every avenue to their
moral and religious improvement, to stand between them and their
Maker,' 8:0.
On every occasion, modern anthropologists delight to descent 0n
the inferiority of the negro race as regards their intellectual and
moral improvement, withholding the fact that they have been for
ages exposed to in?uences not calculated to develop either the
moral, or the intellectual faculties, but, on the contrary, to destroy
them; such, indeed, as might have reduced them to the condition
of wild beasts. ' Treat men like beasts and you will make them such,'
is an old but true saying of a philosopher. This treatment had the
most degrading and destructive in?uence on their mental capacity;
and 'it might be fairly questioned whether any other people could
have endured the privations or the sufferings to which they (the
negroes) have been subjected, without becoming still more degraded
in the scale of humanity; for nothing has been left undone to
cripple their intellect, to darken their minds, to debase their moral
nature, and to obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind;
yet how wonderfully have they sustained the mighty load of 0p-
pression under which they have been groaning for centuries.'
It is not the negroes alone who, under pernicious in?uences, be-
come altered, but animals and Europeans also. M. Dupius has
conclusively proved this in his report on the effect of long captivity
and severe treatment on European Christians among the Arabs.
They lost their reason and feelings; their spirits broke and their
faculties sank in an indescribable stupor; and when subject to a
succession of hardships, they lost all their spirit of exertion and hope;
became indifferent, abject, servile, and brntish. If bondage and a
depraved life have such damnifying in?uence on the moral and in-
tellectual condition of man in general, will it here be out of place for
me to inquire of the anthropological negro denouncer, 'How men
can be elevated while the burdens which oppress are so great? how
can they be industrious when the sources of industry are so much
crippled? or how can they be expected to discover anything like
even a virtuous emulation, while precluded by their circumstances
from rising above a condition of slavery the most hopeless and

wretched? But let the shackles be loosed from the negro, let him
feel the invigorating in?uence of freedom, let hope enter his bosom,
and let him be cheered and animated with the prospect of reward
for his exertions, and the foul calumny of his great and inevitable
inferiority will soon be refuted in himself.'—Armistead. 'A Tribute
to the Negro.' .
But even Prunner Bey has been more generous in the place he
assigns to the negro race, although his commentators have en
deavoured to place them among the anthropomorphous apes. He
says : ' It results from the examination of the organism of the negro,
that it is admirably adapted to the geographical position he
occupies. The dark layer on his external integument, and its
velvety character, like all blackened and rough bodies, favour the
radiation of heat and act as coolers. Experience has proved that
black crape protects also the face from the solar re?ection in the
ascent of snow-covered mountains. The great development of the
glandular system of the skin favours the secretions, refreshing the
skin, and protecting it by an nnctuous secretion. The thickness of
the layers of the skin protects the negro from the night frost in his
usual condition of nudity. The same considerations apply to the inter-
nal integument, the mucous membrane, with its glutinous and abund-
ant secretions, and to all glands, without exception, which, by their
really enormous volume, in harmony with the excitation by heat,
favour and facilitate the change, and the reproduction of organic
matter so rapidly used up in the torrid zone. Do we pass beyond
the limits of science, and lose ourselves in the vicious circle of
teology, if we venture to suppose that even the infantile form of the
brain of the negro may have its relative advantages? What has
the noble Hindoo become under an Indian sun, drowned in a sea of
spiritualism the most obscure, with his cranium, which by its ad-
mirable harmony, its graceful mould, seems exactly to resemble the
organic egg which received the divine breath of Brahma? He has,
it is true, ful?lled an eminent task, but for many centuries he has
been a being severed from terrestrial regions, and of little use to his
fellow-beings. Let as ?nally endeavour to assign to the negro his
place in relation to . the quadrumana, to which some authors
seriously approximate him, and to that of other human races, which

either make use of or despise the negro. As for me, the moment that
an organized being uses for standing and motion that admirable pedestal,
the narrow base of which supports an enormous weight ; the moment he
makes use of the instrument of instruments—the hand—I look upon it
as a new order of things. While recognizing the undoubted value
of homologies, which form the bases of zoological science, I cannot
but admire the simplicity of the means employed by creative wisdom
to separate man from the anthropomorphous ape. The hair on the
skin is reduced, 21 suture is suppressed to draw the teeth closer, and
though prognathism is developed, the lips are thickened, the iliac
bones are turned aside instead of being adossed to the vertebral
column, the muscles of the thumb are strengthened, the great tee is
?xed; nature, ?nally, instead of the temporal lobe, selects the
anterior lobe of the brain, there to fashion the instrument of in-
telligence which re?ects her image.'
But it is not only the pure negro that has received so pernicious
a handling from the anthropologists of this day; they have been
unsparing also to their mixed production—the mulattoes—who are
said to be the most immoral people upon the face of the globe. Of
them, Captain Burton says, 'The worst class of all is the mulatto,
under which I include the quadroon and octaroon. He is every-
where, like wealth—irritamenta malorum. The "bar sinister," and
the uneasy idea that he is despised, naturally ?ll him with ineiiable
bile and bitterness. Inferior in point of morale to Europeans, and,
as far as regards physique, to Africans, he seeks strength in making
the families of his progenitors fall out.' The description of Bosman,
in his work on Guinea, published at the end of the seventeenth
century, is singled out as the most true and perfect picture of
mulattoes as a class. ' Though I have been tedious in this, I hope
you will pardon it, for I must own my itch of scribbling is not
yet over, and I cannot help giving you an account of a wonderful
and extraordinary sort of people—I mean the Tapoeyers or mulattoes
—a race begotten by the Europeans upon the negro or mulatto-
woman. This bastard strain is made up of a parcel of pro?igate
villains, neither true to the negroes nor us, nor indeed dare they
trust one another, so that you very rarely see them agree together.
They assume the name of Christians, but are as great idolators as

the negroes themselves. Most of the women are public whores to
the Europeans and private ones to the natives, so that I can hardly
give them a character so bad as they deserve. I can only tell you
whatever is in its 0Wn nature worse, in the Europeans and negroes
is united in them, so that they are the sink of both. The men, most
of whom are soldiers in our service, are clothed as we are, but the
women prink up themselves in a particular manner; those of any
fashion wear a ?ne shift, and over that a short jacket of silk or stuff
without sleeves, which reaches from under the arms to their hips,
fastened only at the shoulders. Upon their heads they wear
several caps, one upon the other, the uppermost of which is of silk,
plaited before and round at the top to make it ?t soft, upon all
which they have a sort of ?llet, which comes twice or thrice round
the head. Thus dressed they make no small show. On the lower
part of their body they are clothed as the negro women are; and
those who are poor are only distinguishable by their dress, they
going naked in the upper part of their body.
' The whole brood when young, are far from handsome; and
when old, are only ?t to fright children to their beds. If a painter
were obliged to paint envy, I could wish him no better original to
draw after than an old mulatto woman. In process of time, their
bodies become speckled with white, brown, and yellow spots, like
the tigers, which they also resemble in their barbarous natures.
But I shall here leave them, for fear it may be thought that I am
prejudiced by hatred against 'em ; but so far from that, there is
not a single person who hath anything to do with them, but he must
own they are not worth speaking to.'—Bosman. 500., cit. 141.
Such, then, is the description which is even now regarded as typical
of the mulattoes on the Coast. These people, when properly
educated, adorn and enliven society, and are chaste and faithful
when properly married. But in the generality of cases we ?nd that
whilst the European and the coloured women get married, the
mulattoes, especially if not properly educated, are very seldom so,
and are therefore placed in a position where they are obliged to live
a disreputable life. I have met with several mulatto ladies, who
are ladies in every sense of the word, agreeable, amiable, sociable,
chaste, and possessing a happy tact of making themselves agreeable

with every class ; and as regards their broods being frightfully
ugly, I emphatically deny this as the general rule.
In an article in the Saturday Review, the editor writing on the
subject of the negro race, says: 'The Africans are apt to imitate,
quick to seize, ambitions to achieve civilization. Whenever brought
into contact with Europeans they copy their manners, imbibe their
tastes, and endeavour to acquire their arts. The imitative disposi-
tion and the imitative faculty, are both in them particularly strong.
They are neither unwilling nor unable to learn the lessons, and en-
dure the toils and shackles of civilized existence. In those qualities
of acquiring and progressing which distinguish man from the brute,
they resemble man. They have now been for three centuries in con-
tact with Europeans, exposed during that period to the most bar-
barous treatment, and the most destroying and depressing in—
?uences, yet not only has nothing occurred to indicate for them the
fate of other unhappy races whom European cruelty or European
superiority has trodden out, but they have actually advanced under
circumstances the most hostile to advancement.'
Carl Vogt would not admit, in Lecture Seven, that any in?uence,
whether of locality, food, culture, or progressive civilization, has the
least effect of altering the negro ; he is now as he was thousands of
years ago, ' contemporaneous, probably, with the Biblical Adam ; '
and yet in Lecture Fi?een, he admits that 'many races, though they
remain on the same spot, are apt to undergo certain changes, the re-
sult of progressive civilization.' ' The same character,' he in
another place says, ' which distinguishes carefully the domestic
animals from their parent stock, may also be obtained in man by
culture.' Why admit this of Europeans and the lower animals, and
deny it of the negro race?
To prove that locality, culture, position, and calling, have a most
important in?uence in the formation and development of a race, I
must quote Prunner Bey and Quatrefages, on the change of character
in the Anglo-Saxon American or Yankees: ' Already, after the
second generation, the Yankees present features of the Indian type.
At a later period, the glandular system is reduced to the minimum
of its normal development. The skin becomes dry like leather, the
colour of the cheek lost, and is in the male replaced by a loamy

tint, and in the female by a sallow paleness. The head becomes
smaller and rounder, and is covered with stiff, dark hair; the neck
becomes longer, and there is a greater development of the cheek-
bones and the masseters. The temporal fossoe become deeper, the
jawbones more massive, the eyes lie in deep approximated sockets.
The iris is dark, the glance piercing and wild. The long bones,
especially in the superior extremities, are lengthened, so that the
gloves manufactured in England and France for American markets
are of a particular make, with very long ?ngers. The female pelvis
approaches that of the male.' If only in two generations such
changes have taken place, in a climate not far different from that of
England and France, through mere local and climatic causes, how
much more must such be the case in a race like the negro, who for
hundreds of generations have undergone series of metamorphic
changes, through climatic and other most depressing in?uences?
- Does not this indubitably go to prove the unity of the races of
mankind?
But Quatrefages has advanced a step further, and has shown how
depressing and degrading in?uences—the want of proper food and
comforts, exposure to the effects of climate, &c.—are capable of
materially altering and deforming a race of pure type, both phy-
sically and morally: ' On the plantation of Ulster,' he writes, ' and
on the successes of the British against the rebels in 1641 and 1689,
multitudes of native Irish were driven from Armagh and the south
of Down, into the mountainous tract extending from the Barony of
the Flews eastwards to the sea. The same race was on the other
side of the kingdom driven into Leitrim, Sligo, and Mayo. Ever
since that time these people have been exposed to the bad effects of
hunger and ignorance, the two great demoralisers of the human
race. The descendants of the refugees can still be distinguished
from their cognates in Meath and other districts. They have open
projecting months, with prominent teeth and exposed gums, high
cheekbones, depressed nose, and present barbarism on their front.
We thus see in Sligo and the north of Mayo, the consequence of
two hundred years' misery upon the whole physical structure, an
example of deterioration by known causes, which offers some com-
pensation by its importance for the future, in showing the sufferings

DEGENERATION OF A RACE BY PHYSICAL CAUSES.
through which former generations have passed. They are on the
average ?ve feet two inches high, big-bellied, handy-legged, their
clothes a bundle of rags—they walk about the spectres of a people
once well-grown, able-bodied, and handsome. In other parts of the
island, where the people have undergone no such degradation, the
same race furnishes the ?nest models of humanity and strength, both
physically and mentally.'
Quatrefages adds to this description the following just remarks:
' Every reader who is in any way acquainted with the distinguish-
ing characters of mankind, will, with the exception of the colour,
recognise here the character ascribed to the lowest negroes and the
Australian tribes.' The Irishman of Meath keeps the type of the
old stock, but that of Flews has undergone a change, and con-
sequently formed a new race quite distinct from the old stock.
All anthropologists admit that a race might become degenerate
by certain physical causes, and Carl Vogt also admits of accidental
abnormality becoming normal by its permanency; it is also ad-
mitted that young infants are the most susceptible to degenerating
in?uences, and to acquire deformities from physical causes through
the delicacy of their frame, and the ease with which they can be
moulded into different shapes and forms. Might we not trace the
peculiarities of the negro race, which have been the occasion of so
many learned dissertations to the unwarranted habit of the natives
in bringing up their 'young'? The infants are doubled up, twisted,
and ?rmly tied on the back with a cloth, where they remain for
hours at a time, their head and face pressed in the concavity of the
back, the hands and feet twisted up and properly secured; and this
process is carried out until the infant is grown up. Is this not a
system which, when persistently acted on, in the young and delicate
frame, must lead to fearful deformity '?
But there is another sort of degradation which still enthralls the
populatioh of Western Africa, and under whose debasing in?uence
it is impossible for them at present to raise their head, which is, the
employment to a very great extent, of female labour in the ?eld.
The young girls thus acquire a rude taste, and a most reckless
h'berty; a coarse, loose, and ?lthy mode of speaking, a rude and
uncouth conduct. They lose all re?ned and polished habits, and are

consequently made to hold a degraded position among their more
favoured equals—men. Again, in many places we ?nd young girls
going about from town to town, and from street to street, hawking
thread, and various kinds of cloth and other articles; this is a
practice which makes them acquire a wild habit and taste, and
which un?ts them entirely for that domestic regimen, when they be-
come women, which alone can make home happy and comfortable
to their husbands. Thus, there are now complaints and heart-
burnings in many cases among young married couples, of the un-
?tness of the girls for domestic duties ; it is found that they do not
possess those habits of modesty, morality, docility, and domestic use-
fulness, which are essential to the habits and comforts of a married
life. Their loose habits tell not only on their moral character, but
greatly on their physical conformation. I have noticed that girls
who have been exposed to hard labour in a nation, are generally the
most ill-formed; and this acting prejudicially from generation to
generation, leads to those abnormal developments for which anthro-
pologists of this age have so much denounced a whole race.

CHAPTER VI.
THE PROGRESSIVE ADVANCEMENT OF THE NEGRO RACE
UNDER CIVILIZING INFLUENCE.
11' may be asked, what advances in civilization have the negro race
exhibited since their free contact with civilized nations untrammelled
by the slave trade and slavery, that may tend to prove them not
to be behind the most favoured nations in their moral and intel-
lectual quali?cations?
Leaving unnoticed many genuine evidences of civilization to be
found now-a-days amongst the coloured inhabitants of Barbadoes
and other West Indian islands, and bearing in mind that mankind
(in all ages) in di?erent communities, when subject to proper
cul' ting/wiles, do not show an equable rate of advance
within a given' period, I shall endeavour to point out what
improvemenMave taken place amongst the negroes in one of
the colonies on the West Coast of Africa only within the last ?fty
years.
As Sierra Leone is the head-quarters of the British possessions
there, I shall select it as the subject of the example, and will com-
mence from the liberated Africans, who were there freed from the
fetters of slavery. Prior to their being kidnapped they were
governed by kings, or chiefs, who had a complete swaymgle'rlife
aw ; they possessed no written laws, and no proper
religion, but worshipped wood, stones, and other material sub-
stances; they were extremely cruel to each other; polygamy was
carried on to a fearful extent ; the lower class were kept in a state
of slavery; warfare was carried on in a most cruel style, and all
conquered populations were enslaved; they lived in huts, made
either with mud or cane; they made only one kind of cloth; they
lived either wholly naked or partially so; they tilled the ground; and

the Cramantees, from having gold as the medium of commerce,
knew weights and measures.
On their arrival at Sierra Leone, landed naked and in a state
of abjeetgrudeness'aillpoverty, without the least knowledge of
civilization they are placed under Governmentmr a
few months. A portion of land is given them, to cut down the
woods and build towns; then commences cultivation; missionary
schools are established; gradually they begin to read and write;
commerce, by degrees, forms a part of their occupation; they
begin slowly to throw Oitheill'itiEV/Of serfdom, which they had
imbibed fr0m_ pgeyiogsjreatment, and become interested in the
nature of theirf?overnment, so as to require improvement in its
administrative and judicial departments. The worship of the living
and true God is strictly observed by them, and they manifest great
sympathy for the condition of their countrymen. In time they begin
to inquire how their children are to be educated, and what are the
best means at their disposal for doing so. These, as they grow up
f' (which is the generation at present occupying Sierra Leone), seek
2 after and obtain justice; preach loudly the Christian ethics—viz.,
mutual charity, forgiveness of one another, fraternity, and equality.
Science and literature are taught in some of the schools; the
generation feel themselves to possess great liberty, physically and
mentally; philanthropic views are extensively circulated amongst
them ; they build large and expensive dwelling-houses; buy up the
former abodes of their European masters; carry on extensive
mercantile speculations; seek after the indulgences of civilized life,
and travel in foreign countries to seek after wealth. English
newspapers are very much circulated amongst them, and are read
with eagerness; and they require gadvoice in their legislative
f administratiop; They look out for a better Mgovern-
mental; administration, and desire to attain it; and they use the
2 best means for arriving at their wish ;—the essentials for political
progress.
fThe original condition of the people of Sierra Leone is thus de-
scribed by Mr. Ferguson, formerly governor of that Colony :—
'The condition of a body of captive slaves on their arrival at
Sierra Leone for liberation is the most miserable and wretched that

can be conceived—emaciated, squalid, sickly-looking, ill-fed, bar-
barous, con?ned in inadequate space, compelled to breathe an
atmosphere hardly ?t for the sustenance of animal life—-is it to be
wondered that, in such circumstances, the faculties of the soul
should be cramped and benumbed by the cruelties in?icted upon the
body? It is nevertheless from) among such people and their
descendants at Sierra Leone, their minds at length elevated by a
sense ofpelgnglireedom, and by the temperate administration of

they occu at the resent day. Of the liberated Africans as a
body, amen be said that there is not a more quiet,
inoffensive, and good-humoured population on the face of the earth.
Of their religious spirit it is not easy, from the very nature of the
subject, to form a decided opinion, but I know that their outward
observance of the Sabbath-day is most exemplary. On that day the
passion for amusements is altogether laid aside, and the whole body
of the people are to be found at one or other of the churches or
chapels which abound in the colony.'
But thegcrgole?s 'of __Sier_ra__L§_Qne have been stigmatized as the
most impertinent rogues in all the coast, even by men who know

who have had occasion to complain. There is undoubtedly among the

and mouths of those who represent it, assumes great magnitude and
importance. But we ?nd, nevertheless, that these creoles of Sierra
Leone occupy lucrative subordinate positions of trust in both the
military and civil service of the Government in the four colonies
and settlements on the coast—viz., Sierra Leone, the Gambia, the
Gold Coast, and Lagos; which speaks volumes for the indomitable
and arduous exertions and perseverance of the missionaries who
fornwdugational bpt?/gi?wlony. Besides this, they are
to be found in every part of the coast sighing after gold in the
capacity of merchants, traders, and clerks—in the French colony of
Senegal; in the Rivers Gambia, Casamanza, Nunez, Pongas, Sher-
broe and Galinas; in the Liberian Republic; on the Gold Coast; in
the Kingdom of Dahomey; in Lagos and Abeokuta; in the Niger;
at Bonny, Old and New Calabar, the Cameroons, Fernando Po, the
>Gab00ns, and the Islands of St. Helena and Ascension. If they
were not an industrious, exploring race, determined to advance
their position/in life y speculation and other legitimate means,
would they not have con?gedwthem-selves withWelhaits of the
Peninsula of Sierra Leone ; and do not their exertions above
alluded to, point to a similar trait in the character of Englishmen, who

The Obituary" on the death of William O'Connor Pratt, son of
the late William Henry Pratt, Esq., merchant, and Marshal of the-
Vice-Admiralty Court at Sierra Leone (a pure negro of the Eboe-
tribe), written by one of the European inhabitants of the colony of'
Sierra Leone, will furnish us with an example of the real worth of '
Christian and civilizing in?uence on the native African. He was
sent to England at an early age, where he received the rudiments of'
a sound English education. On his return to the colony, in 1853,
he was engaged in mercantile pursuits in his father's house. 'Irr
his career he was at once marked out as a young man who had
pro?ted, far more than is usually the case, by the advantages of am
English education. He proved himself deserving of the highest-
trust. He was hard-working, zealous, and attentive; and inthe-

year 1859 his father admitted him to a partnership in the ?rm of
W. H. Pratt and Sons.' He had only completed his twenty-sixth
year, when he suddenly met his death by the bursting of a blood
vessel. ' His death at any time could not have been otherwise than
sad, touchineg sad, because his friends and fellow-citizens must
always have looked upon him as a bright and living example of the
capacity of the African race to accept the civilization of EurOpe,
and of the holy in?uences of a pure Christianity. But he died, ac-
cording to human calculation, at an untimely age, before arriving at
the meridian of life, when the stronger and more enduring qualities
of manhood take the place of the imperfections and waywardness of
youth. His countrymen may well mourn for him, and that regret
is shared by every European who knew him. We give expression
to the unanimous sentiment of the inhabitants of this colony, when
we say that the death of so promising a young man, in a rising
community that possess so few like him, is a national calamity. He
was an African by birth; he loved his country; he disdained not to
associate with his less-favoured citizens ; but withal he was a gentle-
man in his bearing and in his language, and in every relation of life
he showed the depth and strength of the principles of a re?ned and
gentlemanly culture. Many Africans have received on occasion un-
quali?ed praise from the English press, but none ever deserved it
more than the young gentleman this colony now mourns. He was
far removed from that silly vanity which, doubtful of the reality of
equality, attempts to force its acknowledgment by impudence and
forwardness. On the contrary, William Pratt was conspicuous for
his simplicity and good breeding, and yet he never sacri?ced his un-
doubted and acknowledged position as an educated gentleman.
Besides being a partner in the ?rm of W. H. Pratt and Sons, he
held the appointment of lieutenant, paymaster, and quartermaster in
the Royal Sierra Leone Militia, and he discharged the duties of
those of?ces to the entire satisfaction and approbation of his Ex-
cellency Governor Hill, and the other authorities. During the late
Quiah war, he was conspicuous among the native of?cers for the
zeal and attention with which he performed his various duties. At
this time it was remarked that his constitution, which was evidently
never a robust one, showed signs of a premature decline ; yet he

bore up manfully, and fought the battle of life for a position of
honour and distinction in a manner which proved that a manly and
liberal education can bear fruit as strong on an African as on a
European soil. We must not omit to mention that for seven years
he was the organist of St. George's Cathedral. The emoluments of
this of?ce were of little consequence, but it was his wish to make his
talents of service to his fellow-townsmen; and his loss will for a
long time be felt by the congregation.' The writer thus concludes:
'The supply of such men as William Pratt is suf?ciently scarce to
make his loss severely felt. The most anxious demand cannot call
them forth. His intelligence was far above most of the native
young men of the colony, and, in his death, Sierra Leone has lost
its highest ornament, and Africa one of her illustrious sons. His
premature death cannot be too much deplored, and it is most
natural that we should dwell upon his life. The example which he
set of a dutiful son is rare enough to call for an expression of
public approbation. But we must especially dwell upon the quali-
ties of the heart, which impressed every one who knew him with
feelings of respect and regard. The best of us may learn from his
example how far good manners and a genial disposition will gain
the esteem and goodwill of even comparative strangers. A sphere
of great usefulness undoubtedly lay before him; but we must not
imagine that he died to leave no trace of his existence. His memory
will live after him to encourage others to gain the esteem of their
fellow-citizens, and to walk in the paths of duty and usefulness.'
But, unfortunately, in Western Africa there are no prizes held
out to ambition; in all well-constituted societies for the progressive
development of a community there must be a wholesome stimulus to
the aspirants. Invidious distinctions, by which one class of indi-
viduals, not because of any superior attainments, but from mere
physical con?guration, must always take the ?rst place, engender
amongst that privileged class pride, arrogance, and a spirit of op-
pression; whilst at the same time they lead to a spirit of combined
opposition to any and everything that appears to be noble and
praiseworthy in the less privileged class. Fortunately, within the
last few years, in Western Africa there are healthy symptoms of
improvement in this order of things; but it will be well that our

legislators should remember that, to improve a population, there
must be a stimulus to energy and exertion, a motive to industry;
and that when a peeple is kept under mental depression and dejec-
tion, indolence, poverty, and stupidity are the inseparable con-
comitants. 'Give the negro a motive,' says an eminent writer,
'and he is active and industrious enough ;' and Dr. Madden has
asserted that the negro is not the indolent, slothful being he is
everywhere considered to be, which is proved by the progress he
is now making in the British colonies; and the same writer is per-
fectly correct when he adds, 'I am well persuaded, in respect to
industry, physical strength, and activity, the Egyptian fellahs, the
Maltese labourer, and the Italian peasant, are far inferior to the
negro.' Dr. Madden considers that the blessing of education and
good government are alone wanting to make the natives of Africa
intellectually and morally equal to the people of any nation on the
surface of the globe.
But we have seen European nations who in years long passed
were themselves as barbarous and unenlightened as the negro
Africans are at present, and who have exhibited wonderful improve-
ment within the last century. This should urge the Africans to
increased exertions, so that their race may, in course of time, take
its proper stand in the world's history. ' The same race,' says Mr.
Armistead, 'which in the age of Tacitus dwelt in solitary dens
amid morasses, have built St. Petersburg and Moscow; and the
posterity of the cannibals now feed on wheaten bread. Little more
than a century ago Russia was covered with hordes of barbarians;
cheating, drinking, brutal lust, and the most pernicious excesses of
rage, were as well known, and as little blamed, among the better
classes of the nobles who frequented the Czar's court, as the more
polished and mitigated forms of the same vices are at this day in
St. Petersburg. Literature had never once appeared amongst its in-
habitants in a form to be recognized, and you might travel over
tracts Of several days' journey without meeting a man, even among
the higher classes, whose mind contained the materials of one
moment's rational conversation. Although the various circum-
stances of external improvement will certainly not disguise, even at
this day, and among the individuals of the ?rst classes, the vestz'gia

ruris, still no one can presume to dispute that the materials of which
Russians are made have been greatly and fundamentally ameliorated,
that their capacities are rapidly unfolding, and their virtues improv-
ing;' and this is mainly produced by the extension of their com-
munication with the more civilized portion of the globe, and by the
change of their habits and mode of life. 'A century ago it would
have been just as miraculous to read a tolerable Russian composi-
tion, as it would be at this day to ?nd the same phenomenon in
Haussa or at Timbuctoo; and speculators who argue about races,
and despise the effect of circumstances, would have had the same
right to decide upon the fate of all the Russians, from an inspection
of the Calmuc skulls, as they imagine they now have to condemn all
Africa to everlasting barbarism, from the head, the colour, and the
wool of its inhabitants.'
Africa, in ages past, was the nursery of science and literature;
from thence they were taught in Greece and Rome, so that it was
said that the ancient Greeks represented their favourite goddess of
Wisdom-—Minerva—as an African princess. Pilgrimages were
made to Africa in search of knowledge by such eminent men as
Solon, Plato, Pythagoras ; and several came to listen to the instruc-
tions of the African Euclid, who was at the head of the most cele-
brated mathematical school in the world, and who ?ourished 300
years before the birth of Christ. The conqueror 0f the great
African Hannibal made his associate and con?dant the African poet
Terence. ' Being emancipated by his master, he took him to Rome
and gave him a good education; the young African soon acquired
reputation for the talent be displayed in his comedies. His
dramatic works were much admired by the Romans for their pru-
dential maxims and moral sentences, and, compared with his
contemporaries, he was much in advance of them in point of style.'
Origen, Tertullian, Augustin, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Cyril,
who were fathers and writers of the Primitive Church, were tawny
African bishops of Apostolic renown. Many eminent writers and
historians agree that these ancient Ethiopians were negroes, but many
deny that this was the case. The accounts given by Herodotus,
who travelled in Egypt, and other writers, settle the question that
such they were. Herodotus describes them as ' woolly-haired blacks,

with projecting lz'ps.' In describing the people of Colchis, he says
that they were Egyptian colonists, who were ' black in complexion
and woolly-haired.' This description undoubtedly refers to a race
of negroes, as neither the Copts, their descendants, nor the mummies
which have been preserved, would lead us to believe that their com-
plexion was black. Even the large sphinx, which was excavated
by M. Caviglia in Egypt, and which is regarded by all scienti?c
men as a stupendous piece of sculpture, has its face ' of the negro
cast,' and is said to be of a mild and even of a sublime expression.
'If it be not admitted that these nations were black, they were un—
doubtedly of very dark complexion, having much of the negro
physiognomy, as depicted in Egyptian sculpture and painting, and
from them the negro population, indeed the whole race of Africa,
have sprung. Say not, then, I repeat it, that Africa is without her
heraldry of science and fame. Its inhabitants are the offshoots—
wild and untrained, it is true, but still the offshoots of a stem which
was once proudly luxuriant in the fruits of learning and taste;
whilst that from which the Goths, their calumniators, have sprung,
remained hard, and knotted, and barren." And why should not
the same race who governed Egypt,T attacked the most famous and
?ourishing city—Rome, who had her churches, her universities, and
her repositories of learning and science, once more stand on their legs
and endeavour to raise their characters in the scale of the civilized
world '?
In the examination of the world's history, we are led forcibly to
entertain the opinion that human affairs possess a gradual and pro-
gressive tendency to deterioration. Nations rise and fall ; the once
?ourishing and civilized degenerates into a semi-barbarous state;
and those who have lived in utter barbarism, after a lapse of time
become the standing nation. Yes, 'how wonderful are the vicissi-
tudes which history exhibits to us in the course of human affairs;
and how little foundation do they a?ord to our sanguine prospects
concerning futurity! If in those parts of the earth which were
formerly inhabited by barbarians, we now see the most splendid

exertions of genius, and the highest forms of civil policy, we be,
bold others, which in ancient times were the seats of science, of
cultivation, and of liberty, at present immersed in superstition, and
laid waste by despotism. After a short period of civil, of
military, and of literary glory, the prospect has changed at
once; the career of degeneracy has begun, and has prOceeded till
it could advance no further; or some unforeseen calamity has
occurred, which has obliterated for a time all memory of former
improvements, and has condemned mankind to retrace, step by step,
the same path by which their forefathers had risen to greatness. In
a word, on such retrospective views of human a?airs, man appears
to be doomed, by the condition of his nature, to run alternately the
career of improvement and of degeneracy; and to realise the
beautiful but melancholy fable of Sisyphus, by an eternal renova-
tion of h0pe and of disappointment."i
Such being the tendency of all national greatness, the nations of
Western Africa must live in the hope, that in process of time their
turn will come, when they will occupy a prominent position in the
world's history, and when they will command a voice in the council _
of nations.

PART II.
AFRICAN NATIONALITY.
CHAPTER VII.
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS—SELF-GOVERNMENT OF THE
GAMBIA.
WE come now to consider the most important subject of African
nationality. The desire to give an impetus to this grand develop-
ment seemed to have pervaded the minds of the members of the
late African Committee of the House of Commons. Their third
resolution lays it down plainly that the policy of the British Govern-
ment henceforth in Africa, 'should be to encourage in the natives
the exercise of those qualities which may render it possible for
us more and more to transfer to the natives the administration of all
the Governments, with a view to our ultimate withdrawal from all,
except probably Sierra Leone.'* This indeed is a grand conception,
which if developed into fact, will immortalize the name of Britain
as the most generous and enlightened nation that has adorned the
face of the globe. It is indeed a glorious idea to contemplate that
' Since placing the above in the hands of the printer, we have been grati-
?ed to ?nd that the present Governor-in-Chief, in an address to an in-
?uential deputation which waited on him, emphatically declared that educa-
tion would form an essential element in the government of the Coast. His
Excellency remarked : " I am in a position to assure you that Her Majesty's
Secretary of State for the Colonies, his Grace the Duke of Buckingham and.
Chandos, takes a. most lively interest in the subject of education throughout
the settlements of West Africa, and I am in hopes that ere long all reason-
able facilities and encouragement will be afforded for the education of the
people, which I regard as one of the ?rst duties of civilized government.
Education, like all else, is doubtless subject to abuse; but is, nevertheless,
the broadest, truest, and safest 'road to honour and prosperity here, and
happiness hereafter." The italics are ours.

the sun never sets in the vast dominious where the British ?ag ?ies,
and that the name of England is always associated with liberty,
justice, and humanity; but it will be still grander to contemplate
that same powerful nation, setting on foot the nationality of a race
down-trodden for ages, and giving to those whom she has nurtured
and fostered in the principles of government, ' a chance of raising
their character in the scale of the civilized world."
But we must consider some of the questions put by the late
Parliamentary Committee and the reply of witnesses of great
experience, before we can fully appreciate the above resolution :—v
In the evidence of Sir Benj. Pine, now Governor of St. Kitts,
formerly Acting-Governor of Sierra Leone, and Governor of the
Gold Coast, we ?nd the following questions and answers :—
Question. I think the sum of your views with regard to the
Government of the West Coast of Africa is, that unless we can
develop self-government for all the West Coast, we shall never
arrive at anything better than establishing very hopeless little
Crown Colonies?
Answer. Yes, that is my opinion.
Q. Mr. Cnrcrrnsrnn Fonrascoai What do you mean by develop-
ing self-government?
A. I mean gradually accustoming the people to manage their
own affairs, so that within a given time, it might be half a century,
and it might be a century, we should be free to a great extent, and
they might then manage their own affairs.
Q, You mean the people directly subject to our Government?
A. The people directly subject to our Government.
Q. In what way would you propose to train them 'i'
A. I should begin by giving them municipal institutions, by
making them drain their towns, and take care of their local affairs.
In Sierra Leone they have practically no municipal institutions.
* The Committee felt bound to Come to some such a decision, because in
private as well as public, in the daily press and in written works, when the
subject of West African Colonies is under consideration, we ?nd the following
questions in one form or other repeatedly asked—Why are we there? Why
not give it up? It is no country for uropeans? It is the worst climate in
the world Cl It is impossible for Europeans to civilize it 1? A white man can't
live there ? Give it up i It is a mistaken philanthropy ! &c., 800., 6:0.

The charter of Sierra Leone provided for that, but it was never
acted on.
Q. Lord STANLEY: You spoke of training the natives along the
Coast to do without English assistance; do you look forward to
any time within a reasonable space at which you think we can leave
them to themselves?
A. It is very hard to say what time, but I should say within half
a century, if they go on making the progress that I have seen them
make. I do not mean that they could be left entirely to themselves;
we might exercise control over them by sending some o?icer there.
Q. Do you think that that progress which you spoke of would
continue if they were left to themselves? Do you think that they
would be capable of adapting European ideas and habits without
the presence of Europeans amongst them to set the example '2
A. I think they would.
Q. But you look forward to a time, not very remote, when we
should have made suf?cient progress in extending civilization among
the African tribes, to be able to leave them to themselves and
abandon those settlements?
A. I think so.
In the evidence of R. Pine, Esq., late Governor on the Gold
Coast, we ?nd the following :—
Q. Do you think that this Governorship by the English of certain
fort-s on the Coast is a good system, or do you think we might
enable the native chiefs equally well to govern the country by
themselves ?
' A. I think that the removal of all apparent protection by the
British would have a bad effect.
Q. But yet you do not think that even in any process of time,
we could enable the chiefs to govern themselves?
A. Yes, I do think that we might, but not in my time. With
one exception, I have not had a difference with one native king or
chief in my time of two years and seven months.
In the evidence of Major Blackall, late Governor-General of the
West African Colonies and Settlements, are the following :—
Q. But looking to the future, may I ask what your views are
presuming that you look to the civilization of Africa, if you are

not going to increase the settlements, is it not best to create
governments in Africa which may themselves get rid of the slave-
trade '2
A. No doubt that would be the most effectual way of doing it,
but it is the cost that is in the way.
Q. It will not cost anything if you have got an African govern-
ment which is half civilized or, to a certain extent, civilized. Would
you consider that the right policy would be to take that and put it
under an English governor, or to endeavour, as far as possible, to
encourage and to foster a native government, with the assistance of
an English consul?
A. If you want to spread English civilization, I would rather-
take it entirely under the English Government, than have that kind
of half government of the natives tribes.
Q. Do you think that this is possible ".1
A. Not without great expense.
Q. Not of money merely, but of life'?
A. It would be attended with loss of life, certainly.
Q. To some extent, civilization having spread, do you think that
as much has been effected on the whole from the expenditure of life
and money, as you could expect ".1
A. I was very much pleased to ?nd so much done within the
Colony of Sierra Leone itself, and I think I can perceive a very
great improvement in the chiefs in the neighbourhood of Sherbro.
But the House of Commons Committee seems to have come to
this determination from the great mortality amongst Europeans in
the African Colonies. The yearly death-rate is so great, that it
could not contemplate the continuance of such slaughter; in fact,
tropical Africa must be left eventually for the Africans. In
America, in the Polynesian Islands, and in New Zealand and Aus-
tralia, where civilized nations have settled, the aboriginal inhabitants
become quickly exterminated; they die off. They cannot become
amalgamated either in social character or in civilized economy; the
presence of the one is antagonistic to the presence of the other.
The less powerful therefore recedes to a more quiet and undisturbed
spot. Exposure, the want of proper food, perpetual fear of the
stranger, and periodical outbursts against one another, operate

immensely-to increase the annihilating effect; until, in course of
time, the prior existence in the country of the aboriginal inhabitants
is known only as a matter of historical fact. But it is not, and can-
not be, so in Africa with the African race. _ European nations have
tried the exterminating effect on a grander and more general scale;
they have bereft Africa of millions upon millions of its inhabitants by
deportation. To obtain these they encouraged a suicidal extermina-
ting warfare among the diiferent chiefs, by which a tenfold number
were destroyed. They employed for centuries the most crushing
means to carry out their ends; and yet the race still stands and up-
holds its head. These means have done much to lessen the popula-
tion, to degrade them among the nations, to increase the desire for
the abominable slave-trade, and to have a most vilifying effect on
their political and. economical existence as nations; but they have
not been and cannot be destroyed or exterminated.
A European race may exist for a short time in any part of
Africa, but, ultimately, in tropical Africa, the reverse of what we
?nd in Australia and New Zealand happens to them, and in the
course of a very short space of time they die out, leaving their
places to be ?lled up by new emigrants, who also within an in-
credibly short period share the same fate. Whilst the aboriginal
inhabitants increase and multiply, the European race diminish and
are ultimately annihilated ; their offspring suifer seriously from birth
to manhood from internal diseases, the result of miasmatic and
climatic in?uences, and they must either be amalgamated with the
white or black race, or they die out in about the second generation.
In the tropical countries of Western Africa the idea of a permanent
occupation by European settlers, if ever entertained, is impossible of
realization; it is a mistake and a delusion. Again, we ?nd that
wherever the African race has been carried to, except, perhaps,
the East Indies, they increase, no matter under what depressing and
burdensome yoke they may su?er; from which it may be safely in-
ferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people;
and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will
go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery.
The English Government is conscious of this; and the House of
Commons Committee has now set on foot by resolution (and we

hope it will soon be by actual practice) that great principle of
establishing independent African nationalities as independent as the
present Liberian Government. But simple written resolutions
without being carried into practice, are worse than waste paper,
because they encourage hopes which may never be realized; and the
absence of the necessary means to effect such realization destroys
all con?dence of belief in several separate nationalities. There is,
however, every hope that the contemplated reform will be happily
carried into effect. It will, therefore, be well to make a review of
the different Colonies, and examine how far they are capable of up-
holding an independent separate nationality.
1. SELF-GOVERNMENT or BRITISH GAMBIA.
British Gambia consists of the island of St. Mary, situated on
the left bank and at the mouth of the river, on which is Bathurst,
the capital of the settlement; beyond this is a large tract of land
ceded by the King of Combo, known as British Combo, in which is
Cape St. Mary, which latter had, prior to the cession, been obtained
by purchase. On the right bank of the river a strip of land, one
mile in width, extending from Boonyadoo Creek to Swarra Cundah
Creek, beyond Albredah, became, in 1846, British territory by
cession, and about 150 miles from the mouth of the river is
'M'Carthy's Island. These constitute the British possessions in the
Gambia.
The principal native inhabitants of the British possessions are the
J ollofs and the liberated Africans and their descendants ; there are
besides a few Serias, J olahs, Mandingos, and Footah Foolahs.
The J OLLOFS are a ?ne race of people, who originally came from
Senegal and Goree and the countries between that and the Gambia,
as well as from Goonjour, and are, therefore, intimately connected
with families in these two places. The mulatto J ollof at one time had
extensive in?uence in the colony, but it is now gradually decaying ;
they, or two families (viz., the Lloyd's and Hughes'), are owners of
most of the large and substantial dwelling-houses in Bathurst.
Among the J ollof nation under French rule, slavery had existed for
a considerable time, and has only lately been abolished, and the
lower class even in Bathurst still possess that air of serfdom which

PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF THE JOLLOF TRIBE.
slavery always engenders. The females especially regard their
masters and mistresses with great reverence and fear ; they are in-
capable, or rather unwilling, to help themselves, but look to them
for support. The men and women congregate in one large yard,
building small huts in connexion with those of their mistresses.
The young men are excellent traders. At the trading season in
November and December, they receive a supply of goods from the
European merchants at Bathurst, with which they go up the river.
In June or July they return to make up their accounts, when they in
most cases receive a large amount of commission. But they are great
spendthrifts; after a few days the whole of the amount is spent,
principally on the fair sex, so that at present there is not one native
J ollof man who can boast of a large substantial dwelling-house. With
the exception of Goree and Senegal J ollofs, the Gambia J ollofs are
the best ship carpenters on the whole coast; they build boats and ves-
sels of more than ?fty tons; they are good carpenters, and as mechanics
they receive better pay than in any other part of the whole western
coast. The ?nest and most elaborately-made country cloths are
manufactured by the J ollofs of the Gambia and Senegal, but there
is scarcely to be found a wealthy J ollof man of in?uence and power;
they live on the fattest of the land, are very hospitable until the
small amount they have accumulated is exhausted, and then they
fall into debt. As a nation, the native J ollofs have made but very
slight progress in civilization ; the Roman Catholic religion is pro-
fessed by them, which has a still more depressing effect on an
ignorant population. The female inhabitants, whilst aiding in the
extravagance of the male, lend not an iota towards assisting in in-
'creasing the income. They dress most superbly in expensive native-
made clothes, gold trinkets of the purest native manufacture adorn
their bodies, and handkerchiefs of the ?nest French and English im-
portation their heads. They are generally beautifully made and well
proportioned 3 and most of those met in the Gambia are not a pure
race, but are an admixture of Footah Foolahs, Mandingoes, liberated
Africans, and Europeans.
Dr. Madden, in his Report to the Committee of 1842, thus com-
ments on the physical character of this tribe. He says: ' The pure,
unmixed, and high-spirited J ollofs, who have not been long enough

'in our settlements to have been demi-civilized and three-parts
demoralized by European vices, are the ?nest specimens of the negro
race that I have seen. They differ widely from the Kroomen in
their forms and features. They are far from muscular, and by no
means remarkable for their bodily vigour or robustness; but in that
air of natural nobility in deportment and the stateliness of their
carriage, the J ollofs so far surpass the other natives that strangers
are accustomed to look upon them as the gentlemen of Africa.'
They are warlike and generous in disposition, and, as artisans, are
remarkable for their ingenuity and manual dexterity. The mixture
of J ollof and Footah blood produces a race which, in many cases,
may be regarded as an absolute model of perfection; some of the
young girls, in point of form, appear so perfect that they would
satisfy even the fastidious taste of the classical sculptor—they are
round, ?rm, and charming.
The next important inhabitants are the liberated Africans. The
two principal tribes are the Yorubas or Akus, and the Egboes or
Eboes, the former in excess of the latter; in addition to these are
traders from Sierra Leone. In former years these people were
despised by the J ollof inhabitants of Bathurst. They had no voice in
their palavers and societies, but they were a people destined to rise.
They are not a spendthrift race; and whilst liberal to a certain
degree, they always manage to balance their income and expenditure
in such a manner as to leave a decided advantage in favour of the
former; and in course of time they aspire to and are now ?lling up
the positions which had been denied them. They are amongst the
foremost traders in the river Gambia, advancing to a considerable
distance in the interior. The spirit of parsimony exists among
them, and they accumulate wealth, and are new building large and
substantial houses. Some of them are very much respected; their
children are sent to educational establishments at Sierra Leone and
in England. Their female p0pulation are hard-working, and make
excellent traders ; they also accumulate great wealth, although some
of them enter into reckless speculation. I shall enter more fully
into consideration of these tribes in another place. Some of the
Yorubas are Mohammedans, but the greater part are Christians;
most, if not all, the Eboes are Christians. When ?rst located in

Bathurst they were considered indolent, lazy, and depraved, and Dr.
Madden justly remarked that 'if we look to their emancipation
alone for their improvement, and locate them where there are no
schools for their instruction, no ?t soil for their subsistence, and n0
steps taken for their civilization, we may expect to ?nd them
swarming our gaols or skulking about our market-places in idleness
and want.' Years have now passed, and the leading merchants at
Bathurst speak differently of the liberated African.
The Serias, or Sereres, and J olahs, who are found in British
Gambia, are unimportant races, as their numbers are so few that
they occupy no important political position in the colony; the
former are the labourers, who are employed for all menial occupa-
tions ; they are always cheerful in their work, but require to be
looked after. There is at present but a very small prospect of their
ever rising in the social scale; their earnings are spent in drink,
and on moonlight nights they are to be heard makipg the most
fearful noise, at the top of their voices, disturbing the repose of the
more quiet inhabitants. The Jolahs are a peculiarly quiet race;
generally short, they have curly, ?owing hair and well-shaped
features, and are very peaceful; their principal occupation is in
making palm-wine. They are remarkable for being exceedingly
dirty in their habits; neither their bodies nor their clothes undergo
that ablution which is necessary for health in the tropics.
Mmmeons.—The tribe in the immediate neighbourhood of
British Gambia is the Mandingo, a tall, athletic, warlike race of
men, who are always carrying on war with one another; they are
divided into two great classes—viz., IPIarabouts and Soninkies. The
Soninlcias are pagans, who do not believe in any religion; the
Marabouts, however, are Mohammedans, or followers of the great
false prophet. But the Mandingo Alarabouts are not exclusively
called Marabouts, as all Mohammedans receive the same appellation;
thus there are Jollof Marabouts and Yorubah Marabouts. The
Soninkies are strictly the non-Mohammedan portion of the Man-
dingoes.
The Soninlcies (as I have described them in another place) were
the original inhabitants of the land bordering on the river far into
the interior, extending from the mouth to about 600 to 700 miles

inland, and in times gone by they exercised so tyrannical a sway
over the Marabout inhabitants as to cause a rebellion and a general
rise for independence. They employ some of their time in agri-
culture; but when compared with the other tribes they are lazy
warlike, and troublesome, and are great drinkers of ardent spirits.
They live in the commonest cane huts, with grass roofs. They
cultivate a little land during the rains, and when the dry season is
fully set in, their poor stock being soon exhausted, they remain in a
half-starved state until the next season. Those along the sea-coast
and the river, by coming in constant relation with civilized nations,
become rather hard-working, and are prevented from carrying on
those predatory wars which they otherwise make to provide them-
selves with the necessaries of life. Beyond the reach of European
civilization they are excessively lazy, and in times past were in the
habit of existing on the Mohammedan population. The females are
industrious, clean, and handsome. The Soninkies worship the alli-
gator, a piece of iron, large stones, and trees. The Soninkie
government now exists in a part of Barra and Saloom (Sahloom)
on the north side of the river Gambia where Fort Bullon is built.
The Marabout inhabitants on the river form the most important,
in?uential, and powerful government in close proximity with the
British territory. They are a warlike, daring, strategic, crafty,
intriguing race, who through their late successes over their neigh-
bours, the Soninkies, have become most impudent and overbearing.
When not engaged in any warlike expedition they till the ground
extensively, spin yarns, dye clothes with native manufactured indigo,
plant large quantities of ground-nuts, Guinea and Indian corn,
indigo, cotton, and sweet potato; they tan leathers and dye them
in various colours, afterwards work them into slippers, sandals,
pouches, and bags, and into coverings for their charms and various
other articles of native importance. They are the principal pro-
ducers of the commercial wax which forms one of the exports of the
river Gambia.
There is another tribe met with along the river who are very
hard-working and harmless; they are great agriculturists and
excellent ?shermen; these are the Numinkas. Having ex-
amined the different races in and bordering on British Gambia, let

THE MARABOUTS or GOONJOUR. 79
us now consider the practicability of forming a native self-support-
ing government, capable of existing for a reasonable length of time.
Bathurst is situated on a small piece of land surrounded by water
called St. Mary's Island, which is divided from the mainland,
British Combo, by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek; this creek
is of no great dimensions, and with a plentiful supply of canoes can
easily be crossed by a large number of men within a very short time.
The inhabitants number from eight! to ten thousand, composed of
individuals of the different tribes already mentioned, who are not
bound together by any common interest, but, on the contrary, are
very much disunited. British Combo comprises, besides Combo, all
Sabbajee, the territory conquered from the Marabouts. In it are
scattered irregularly the following towns which are occupied by
British subjects—viz., Newcastle, Albert Town, Hamilton Town,
Jassewang, and Coto, besides a few other Mandingo villages.
These British towns are not really now worth the name of towns;
they are merely scattered villages, containing from a hundred to
two hundred inhabitants, the majority of them old and decrepit,
and entirely un?t to hold their ground against a Marabout force of
even one-fourth their number. The property and wealth of the
country is at Bathurst ; the young and robust, as soon as they are
capable of distinguishing between mcum and tuu-m, go off to Bathurst
for occupation.
Bordering on the interior boundary of British Combo are the
Marabouts of Goonjour, composed not only of the original inhabit-
ants of the country, but also of the refugees from Sabbajee—the
Mohammedan population who were expelled after the defeat in the
second engagement under Governor, now Major-General, O'Corner,
and whose territory was con?scated to the British Government.
These people have a deadly hatred against their powerful usurpers;
they would not give up the ownership of the land, but still look
wistfully for the time when they may have an opportunity of reclaim-
ing it. They are perpetually instigating their brethren of the same
faith in Goonjour against the powers that be, and these are ready at
any moment to pour their legions into British Combo. Thus, during
the late battle of Toobabcolong, where the British arms were
successful in a short, decisive, and, in these parts, unparallelled

engagement, the warriors at Gooujour were armed to the teeth,
prepared to take advantage of any misfortune that might happen to
the British force; they looked eagerly on the rich territory which
had been ceded through necessity to the British Crown, and were
determined, if the Marabouts of Neomy (Barra) had gained the
victory, to advance to British Combo and make themselves masters
of it before any assistance could be sent to that quarter; but
through the dashing gallantry of Colonel D'Arcy, who led the
attacking party, the handful of soldiers gained a complete victory
over the Moslem inhabitants, and the would-be invaders were
obliged to disarm quietly and send peaceful messages to the
Governor, avowing continued friendship.
The other Territory of British Gambia is on the right bank of
the river, and not in immediate connection with Bathurst; it is in
the neighbourhood partly of Soninkie and partly of Marabout
in?uences. With the Soninkies there is no fear of any disturbance,
but with the Marabouts the case is different. There will always be
contention between the Moslems and the Christians or Pagans.
These Mohammedan inhabitants were at ?rst the subjects of the
Soninkie government. When few, they were content to make pro-
selytes by peaceful means, and bow to the decision of existing
authorities; but no sooner did they ?nd themselves in great and
suf?cient numbers than they at once forcibly usurped political
power, and began to propagate their religion by ?re and sword,
They have now completely crippled the Soninkie power, who are in
awful fear of them; for, since 1862, they have destroyed numerous
Soninkie towns and villages, made captives of many of their in-
habitants, massacred a vast number, shaved the heads of the rest,
and make them turn their faces to the east at sunrise and sunset in
the attitude of prayer. This they did near to the boundary of the
British Territory of Barra, on the right bank of the river, in the
immediate neighbourhood of Fort Bullon, and would have stepped
over it had not his Excellency Colonel D'Arcy, at the risk of his
life, on the 24th June, 1863, burned the twelve stockades of the
belligerents, securing peace and cultivation to a troubled country for
three years. This portion of the territory is not only liable to the
incursion of the Marabouts in its immediate vicinity, but has also

been exposed to that of the most powerful Marabout chieftain in
the River—via, the late King of Badiboo, M 'lllba, who secretly
aided and abetted all the movements of the Marabout chiefs from
Cower to Barra, and who was a most treacherous, usurping, power-
ful, and dangerous neighbour.
The population of British Gambia is barely ?fteen thousand
souls; the Marabouts around number several hundred thousands.
The former, with very few exceptions, are weak and e?eminate,
composed of numerous tribes, who possess no common interest, and
who are jealous of one another. If the inhabitants were to be left to
govern themselves, there must be either a mouarchical or a repub-
lican form of government instituted. The latter is unsuited to the
taste and feelings of the people. A monarchical government must
be chosen, and the king elected by universal suffrage. If once left
to himself, without military support for a time, he would ?nd his
movements hampered by contending views; his territory, espe-
cially British Combo and British Barre, exposed to the inroads of
his most powerful enemy. The Marabout chieftains would get suf?-
cient information of all his internal arrangements, and would take
the earliest opportunity of trying his strength. In a ?nancial point
of view, his revenue would be increased or diminished according to
his capacity of affording protection to the merchants and traders.
He would ?nd nine-tenths of his population very ignorant and un-
educated; that his kingdom lacked good educational seminaries; and
that his greatest attention would require to be immediately devoted
to political economy and social details. His registrar-general would
report to him that the death-rate exceeds the birth by nearly a half;
that depopulation to a vast extent is going on every year. On
examining into the sanitary condition of his state, he would ?nd it
to be truly deplorable; that there is a large and extensive marsh
which stands out as a great barrier to the healthiness of his capital,
and which will require a large amount of money to drain, altogether
beyond the power of his exchequer to afford. The language of his
kingdom is in Babelic confusion, being Jollof, Mandingo, Serere,
Foolah, Jolah, and English; and although four-?fths of the popu-
lation do not understand English, he would have gradually to de-
velop it among the mass, and make it the spoken and diplomatic

language. Having no military at his command, he would ?nd his
untrained volunteers unable to stand before the impetuous charge
of the Marabouts.
The Marabouts, ?nding that the king was not powerful, and not
supported by any European powers, would make an unprovoked
attack on Combo and Sabbajee, and, before a suf?cient force could
be collected to oppose them, destroy the whole of the towns, and
massacre and enslave the inhabitants. And even were the volunteers
to meet them in a pitched battle, unless well supported by regular
artillery, they would not be able to stand the impetuous attack and
cavalry charge of the daring Marabouts; and a victory gained by them
would be fatal to the commercial interests of the country. Bathurst
wiH always be protected against any number of the Marabout force,
who will ?nd Oyster Creek a good barrier against their onward pro-
gress; as?fty volunteers,with good ri?es and well o?icered, could resist
the landing of two thousand Marabout warriors from the mainland.
On the right British Barra was always exposed to the
attack of the most powerful Marabout chieftain in the
River —- viz., Mahba of Badiboo. It is only a few months
ago that—hearing from Bathurst that the Parliamentary Com-
mittee had recommended that the Governors on the Coast were
not to interfere with the native Government, and that they
were on no account to go to war—Mahfal, the lieutenant of
Mahba, who commanded in Marabout Barra or Neomy, became
troublesome and overbearing, and afterwards made a desperate at-
tack on British Barra, as will be seen from the following account :—
"A few years ago his Excellency Colonel D'Arcy placed Masam-
bah Kokie in British Neomy or Barra, as a chief of that part of
the country, to cultivate the ground and keep peace. At this time
the Marabout in?uence had been growing very strong, and
they seemed certain to become very troublesome. Masambah Kokie,
being a Soninkie and a British subject, was more peaceful than the
Marabout, and all the Foolah ?ocked about his town—Bantang
Killing—with their bullocks, much to the annoyance of the Mara-
bouts in these parts, who, a few months ago, made a night attack
against them, and robbed them of all their cattle. Some remon-
strances were made to the chief, but nothing decided was done.

M'CARTHY's ISLAND—ITS DEFENCE. 83
They became more restless, and their chief, Mahfal, charged
Masambah Kokie with having robbed them of their land, telling
him that he was nothing buta stranger, and that the sooner he
made his exit the better it would be for him. Masambah Kokie
judiciously informed his Excellency the Administrator of what had
taken place, and intimated that the attitude of the Marabouts was
very warlike. Soon after this they made a desperate attack against
his stockade, but he met them resolutely, and after a severe contest
they retired, after destroying all his provision and the houses outside
the stockade. They taunted him about the con?dence he had in
the British Government, and told him that they would give him a
good thrashing without anything being done to them. The Ad-
ministrator, on hearing of the ?ght, went up to Albreda in H.M.S.
Mullet, and made himself well acquainted with the state of affairs.
Masambah Kokie informed him of the ideas of the Marabouts, and
told him that unless he was supported he must either remove to
Combo or succumb to the Marabouts. These latter behaved most
insolently and insultingly to the Governor, actually de?ed him to
his face, and told him in plain language that they were ready to
?ght him; and told the Soninkies that the Governor was always
peaceful, and that he was afraid to go to war with them. This led
to the battle of Toobabcolong, already referred to. If the Mara-
bouts show such determined resistance against a regular force, led
by an experienced English of?cer, how much will they care for an
undisciplined volunteer force, without an experienced officer "2 '
M'Carthy's Island, being the entrepdt of the trade in the upper
portion of the River Gambia, where the best quality of ground-nuts
is obtained, could not be relinquished. It is surrounded by a
natural stockade, impassable by the Marabouts—namely, the river;
and a handful of troops and a few good ?eld-pieces, with proper
management, would be able to prevent any crossing of ahostile
force. The inhabitants are ready and willing to defend themselves
against their enemy; and although the unhealthiness of the place
has led to unparalleled yearly depopulation, yet still those who
remain are willing to aid in maintaining it against any attack of the
Marabouts; and this is evident from the resolution passed by the
people, who were represented by the merchants and principal in-

habitants in a council (holden a day after the island was totally
abandoned by the British troops) called together by the Com-
mandant. The following were the members present, and the reso-
lutions passed (vide African Times, July 23, 1866) :—
'President, J. Africanus B. Horton, M.D., Provisional Civil
and Military Commandant; Members: James Gray Savage, J.P.,
Edward Dusseault, John Melbury, John D. Attride, James
Dodgin, Joseph I. Owens, George Randell, James Bell, and George
Robert.
'The President explained that his intention in calling them to-
gether was to deliberate on the best means they should adopt in
protecting themselves against any outbreak among their warlike
neighbours, as all the soldiers had now been removed, and the
island left in a very defenceless state; that any measure now
adopted would be only provisional until the Manager who has been
appointed takes over the command of the place.
' Resolution 1.--Moved by Mr. John Melbury, seconded by Mr.
Jas. Dodgin, and agreed to, "That twelve men be enlisted as
volunteers, and kept up until such time as the newly-appointed
Manager with his police force should arrive. That the, men be
armed, and employed in all cases of emergency."
' Resolution 2.-—Moved by Mr. James Gray Savage, seconded by
Mr. Edward Dusseault, and agreed to, "That of the twelve men,
nine should be habited within the barracks, and three enrolled as
constables; and that the privates be allowed one shilling and six-
pence per diem each for pay and subsistence; the corporal, two
shillings; and the sergeant, two shillings and sixpence."
' Resolution 3.—Moved by Dr. Horton, seconded by Mr. John D.
Attride, and agreed to, " That special constables be enrolled out of
the respectable portion of the inhabitants, and that the subjoined
oaths be taken by each."
'Resolution 4.—Moved by Dr. Horton, seconded by Mr. James
G. Savage, and agreed to, " That the following gentlemen be sworn
in as special constables: Mr. Edward Dnsseault, Mr. John Mel-
bury, Mr. J. D. Attride, Mr. James Dodgin, Mr. James Bell, Mr.
George Randell, Mr. George Roberts, Mr. Joseph L. Owens, and
Mr. Lomanee Fatee."

' Resolution 5.—Moved by Mr. George Randell, seconded by Mr.
Joseph L. Owens, and agreed to, "That a notice be given to the
inhabitants of the island that after eight o'clock in the evening no
tom-toming, ?ring of arms, or any noise will be allowed without
special permission."
'Resolution 6.—Moved by Mr. Edward Dusseault, seconded by
Mr. Joseph L. Owens, and agreed to, " That the special constables
be furnished with arms and ammunition, to be used only in cases of
emergency, and that they be made responsible for them."
'Resolution 7.——Moved by Mr. John Melbury, seconded by Mr.
George Roberts, and agreed to, 2' That the owners of canoes be
particularly requested to have their canoes on this side of the river
after six o'clock in the evening, and placed under lock and key;
that, after the proposed hour, should any of the canoes be seen on
the other side, the Sergeant of Police should give notice to the
owners, and should it not be immediately brought over, he should
be deprived of its use for three days, or pay a ?ne of 2s. 6d.
'Resolution 8.—Moved by Mr. George Randell, seconded by Mr.
James Bell, and agreed to, "That the head men at Fatoto'and
Burabah Oundah be instructed not to cross over after six o'clock in
the evening more than six men from the mainland to the island."
'Resolution 9.-—Moved by Mr. James G. Savage, seconded by
Mr. Edward Dusseault, and unanimously agreed to, " That the
inhabitants of the island be called upon by voluntary subscription
to support the volunteer force, and that the mercantile community
undertake to guarantee the payment of their cost, according to the
following daily rate: Messrs. Forster and Smith, 5s.; Thomas
Brown and 00., 5s.; W. H. Goddard, Esq, 3s. ; T. F. Quin, Esq.,
2s. 6d.; Mr. John Melbury, 1s. 6d.; Mr. James Dodgin, 1s. 6d.;
Mrs. Price, 1s. 6d."
' Oath administered to each Special Constable : No. 1. I swear
that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty
Queen Victoria, so help me God.
'No. 2. I swear that I will well and faithfully serve our Sovereign
Lady the Queen provisionally in the capacity of a special constable
in the Settlement of M'Carthy's Island; and that I will not conceal
any apparent danger, damage, or harm which may likely or possibly

arise, without giving, or causing to be given, speedy notice thereof;
and that I will truly, faithfully, and disinterestedly endeavour to use
calm and peaceable means to quell any and every disturbance that
may arise in any part of the said island, or give immediate notice
to the Sergeant of Police, or to any of Her Majesty's Justices of
the Peace. So help me God." '
This is an excellent manifestation of a spirit of self-government,
esprit de corps, and of mutual support against a common enemy—
a spirit which, if always encouraged, would lead to most happy
results. The whole of the inhabitants went cheerfully and heartin
to work in carrying out these resolutions; there was not the least
trouble experienced in enlisting the volunteers, and every one threw
in his mite towards their support.
From the foregoing it is evident that in the present condition of
the Settlement of the Gambia it cannot be left to govern itself.
An esteemed Governor remarked, after reading the third resolution
of the Parliamentary Committee, that it will take a hundred years
before Gambia will be capable of self-government; but I say that if
the present system of governing the people be persisted in, it will
take more than two hundred years; while if radical reform be made,
and if the people be properly trained, it will take less than a
quarter of a century to bring the country into such a state of im-
provement as might enable it to be left with safety in the hands of
an enlightened native king, chosen by universal suffrage. How this
can be attained, and what are the essential improvements which
should commence this new era of West African history, I shall
enter upon fully when considering the requirements of British
Gambia; and show how by judicious management the native Govern-
ment can be made strong enough to oppose all the attacks of its
Mandingo neighbours, and to insure esteem and admiration through-
out the whole of the Mohammedan districts of the Gambia.

CHAPTER VIII.
SELF-GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE—KINGDOM OF
SIERRA LEONE.
' High on a rock, in solitary state,
Sublimely musing, pale Britannia sate ;
Her awful forehead on her spear reclined,
Her robe and tresses streaming with the wind ;
Chill through her frame foreboding tremors crept !
The mother thought upon her sons and wept.
' Shame ?ush'd her noble cheek, her bosom burn'd,
To helpless, hopeless Africa. she turn'd ;
She saw her sister in the mourner's face, '
And rush'd with tears into her dark embrace.
" Oh hail," exclaim'd the empress of the sea,
" Thy chains are broken—Africa, be free !" '
Thus wrote Montgomery. Africa, through Britannic in?uence, is
free from foreign slavery, and through that same in?uence has made,
and hopes still to make, important progressive improvements in her
history. There are several peculiarities characteristic of the
physical geography of Sierra Leone, which will enable her to sustain
a good and powerful self-government, not threatened by any native
tribe of consequence in its neighbourhood, and not easily by any
European or foreign nations. Sierra Leone possesses a safe haven
where distressed vessels can put aplre?t, and the entrance of its
hubbilFIs/throumfriarrow channel completely covered by several
important elevations and hills. In her claim for independence she
ranks with Liberia, her immediate neighbour, having a strong,
vigorous, and persevering population, who speak one language.
Education of the masses has been going on to a very encouraging
extent, and missionary efforts have had most salutary and bene?cial
results on the population who 7 ?gholdiug their ground in various

' that the British Government (to carry out their laudable intentions
for Africa) could give up to self-government with hope of success,
and a due appreciation of the advantages granted thereby. It has a
better and more increasing revenue than any other part of the Coast;
in it are congregated all the blood and shows/obthuarious tribes
in every part of the Coast; and, according tQVvK'gLoelle's polyglot
calculation, th/ere afegore'thama hundred'di?emt tribes among
its inhabitants, the principal, both in numbers'andjn?uence, being
the Akus and Egboes. In the Blue-book of 1852, Governor
Kennedy, in his report, states that 'the direct monthly communica-
tion with England and the whole of the West Coast of Africa, by
means of Her Majesty's mail contract steamers, has already esta-
blished a new era in the political, social, and commercial condition
of the Colony. Many of the native population and liberated
Africans are doing pro?table and safe business, and competing suc—
cessfully with the European merchants and traders. The improved
habits, the increased comforts, and investment of capital by the
native population, are all highly indicative of prosperity and pro-
gress. The absence of serious crime is also very remarkable. In
no part of the world have I seen the Sabbath-day observed with
more decency and decorum. Crime is repressed and order main-
tained in Freetown (containing a population of 16,000 persons) by
one police magistrate, one police superintendent, and seventy-?ve
policemen. This latter fact speaks more for the orderly habits and
disposition of the people than any comment I could offer. En-
couragement and, above all, good example are all the people require
to enable them to ful?l the high intentions with which this Colony
was established.'
I shall in another place speak more particularly of the characters
and habits of the various tribes in the colony, but in passing I may
here remark that, as a body, the in?uence exercised by the aged of
the most numerous tribe, produces a most depressing and decrepit
effect on the rising generation of that race. They possess a secret,
freemasonlike in?uence which checks any exuberance of spirit and of
enterprise in their young, and thus produces an injurious result on the
race. Not independent of such in?uences, they feel afraid of coming
out openly, fearing a check from some superior in?uence. If they

enter into speculation on an extensive scale so as to outstrip the
aged of the same class; if they follow the bent of their inclination
and employ their money in the purchasing of large buildings and
extensive estates, they receive a warning voice from some
suspicious quarter. This in?uence is certainly dying away, but
much still remains which tells against the body politic of the nation.
The next important tribe has offspring who are independent, rather
impertinent, and possess but very little of that graceful respect
which is due to their superiors in age, in?uence, &0. ; they would
take up an unmeaning phrase as insulting, and would make much
ado about nothing ; and, consequently, there are always disunion and
private piques amongst them. But the inhabitants of the Colony
have been gradually blending into one race, and a national spirit is
being developed. The language of the self-government when formed
must of necessity be English, and all of?cial and private business
must be done in it. It comes readily to all those born in the Colony.
There will be no spirit of a native language counteracting, modifying,
and balancing it, because it is now the universal language of the
Colony.
When Liberia was given up to self-government, the progress pre-
viously made as regards the working of state government, was not at
all to be compared with what now exists at Sierra Leone; yet still '
we ?nd that the Liberians have maintained their own ground, have
extended their dominions, and are making every year great and rapid
progress. Might we not hope that if the latter country were to be
placed under somewhat similar circumstances a material progressive
advance would take place, which would ultimately lead to a greater
consolidation of power, aided and assisted by the fostering mother
government ".1
Of the government of Sierra Leone, the most important town is
the city of Freetown, situated at the foot of the hills which run in
an easterly direction, of which Leicester Mountain is the highest.
It contains a population of more more than twenty thousand in-
habitants, which is yearly increasing. The wealth of the Colony is in
Freetown; in it are the best educational establishments, the centre of
the various missionary establishments, and the seat of government.
It possesses many large substantial buildings and a thriving com-

mercial prospect. It extends from Granville Brook to Congo Town
Bridge, a distance of nearly two and a-half miles. There is no fertile
land about its neighbourhood, so that the people depend on the
other parts of the Colony for articles of food, although a small
' quantity of the garden and surrounding arid land is cultivated.
The harbour can receive vessels of any tonnage, being very deep;
and from the circumstance of its entrance being completely com-
manded by hills and elevated lands, it can be easily protected from
hostile inroads by good artillery properly arranged and manned.
At King Tom there is a dilapidated battery, which, if it were in
good condition, would have a telling effect on an enemy's vessels
approaching the harbour. But Cape Sierra Leone and Signal Hill
are spots where good substantial batteries or forti?cations ought to
be without delay erected, as they would there completely check the
progress of a hostile ?eet. In the centre of the town, on a small
promontory, is the lower battery, which commands the east side of
the river. Freetown, therefore, as a safe haven and as a capital, is
well chosen, and would form a nucleus of a very extensive power
over the countries north and south of it. The increase of popu1a~
tion, the wealth and strength of the city, will ever form a great
barrier to its being threatened by the surrounding native tribes,
who, I am certain, would never harbour the remotest .idea of
attacking it.
But we must divide Sierra Leone into several districts, and con-
sider each separately. The districts are the Mountain, River, and
Sea.
Mountain District.— The Mountain District comprises the
following towns : Leicester, Gloster, Regent, Wilberforce, Bathurst,
and Charlotte. The country, in its present state, is unsuited to the
growth of any commercial articles. The heavy rains robbing the
soil of its manure leave it gravelly and without strength, and di?icult
to work; the inhabitants are therefore principally poor. The only
exportable article which formerly was cultivated to a large extent
was arrowroot, but the reduction of the marketable value has
greatly discouraged the planters. The people are, however, not
lazy; they supply Freetown with fruits and vegetables of every kind
and other dietetic articles. Sugar-cane and coffee are planted in

small quantities. Depopnlation is going on in this district to a
fearful extent, for the young and robust and healthy seek for
employment in the capital, where they ultimately remain. The popu-
lation grow old, and although some are stricken with extreme
poverty, yet still we ?nd them live to a very good age; they do not
die off as rapidly as the inhabitants of the lowland. The people
are most peaceful. Slight litigation may occasionally exist
amongst them, but that is all. This fact is attested by their having
no resident magistrate in any of the towns ; one police-constable in
each is su?icient to repress all disturbance. They know and care
very little for politics. All their children are sent to schools and
educated, so that nearly the whole of the present generation can
read.
River District.—The River District contains the following towns:
Kissy, Wellington, Hastings, and Waterloo; besides a few small
villages, such as Allen Town, Grafts Town, Bengeuma, and Prince
Albert Town. Next to Freetown the River District is the most
?ourishing and well populated. Kissy, by its near approach to the
capital and by a peculiar pride of the growing inhabitants for it, is
more populated, and is the ?rst in the district. The people are not
as simple as those in the mountains; they are in close proximity with
the neighbouring tribes, and, consequently, trade largely with them;
they are richer and more in?uential. Most of their children are
educated, but education is not so general as in the Mountain District.
This district supplies Freetown with some of the most staple articles
of food. The people are industrious, and make good agriculturists.
They are the principal producers of commercial ginger, which they
bring to the market partially clean and exchange for cash or goods.
Those in close proximity to the city are more litigious than the
others, but they have never taken up arms against each other,
except in the infant state of the Colony several years ago, when
some tribal difference happened; but to the Government they
have always been submissive. As a general rule, all over the
Colony the inhabitants do not keep ?rearms, differing thus from all
other parts of the Coast. At Waterloo and Hastings the people are
principally farmers; they are very quiet, tolerably educated, hardy
men, who love their homes. They bring the produce of their labour

twice a-week to Freetown, where it is readily sold. The ground
is ?at, and contains rich alluvium. The young population in the
towns nearest Freetown take some interest in politics. One or two
magistrates are always stationed in this district, who wield very
extensive power. The towns contain a few good and large houses,
but frame and quarter-frame buildings prevail. Albert Town is in
the lately-acquired territory in Quiah, which is open to and con-
tinuous with the territories of the neighbouring tribes.
Sea District—This is the third district, and comprises Kent,
York, and Banana Island. In former years these towns were
tolerably large, and contained a good population, but they are
rapidly decreasing. There is, to my knowledge, no export whatever
from this district. The inhabitants are poor—21a, they do not possess
money in abundance, but they have large tracts of land at their
disposal, and are well supplied with the necessaries of life. The palm
trees give them abundant supplies of wine, which is sold at a tri?ing
price; when kept for a short time it becomes alcoholic and intoxi-
cating. These people are, as it were, separated from the body
politic of the Colony by the high mountains which run through it.
They are most of them ?shermen, and after drying their ?sh they
send them up to the market of the capital. A resident magistrate
is always amongst them, which is necessary, because of the distance
from head-quarters. The people do not care at all about politics;
they are very simple in their habits, even more than those in the
Mountain District; and will bend to whatever form of government is
given them, but they love their Queen and reverence her repre-
sentative.
We must now consider the character of the tribes in the imme-
diate neighbourhood of Sierra Leone, and those countries which
are dependent on, and form part of the Colony and its dependencies.
1. Timneh Tribe—These are the nearest neighbours of the Pe-
ninsula of Sierra Leone, and to them formerly it belonged. They
are somewhat an industrious race, cultivating large tracts of swampy
lands with rice, with which they supply the Colony. They are by no
means speculative, and their country is overrun by the people of the '
peninsula, who trade with them to a limited extent, in European
goods in exchange for rice, ground-nut, Kola, timber, and beni-seed.


## p. 93 (#117) #############################################

sonsou AND KORSOR TRIBES. 93
When they land at Freetown they seem to be great cowards; a
little boy ten years of age would frighten and drive away ten men.
Here they are peaceful, quiet, dirty in their dress and person, and
walk about in Indian ?le. They are terribly frightened at the
people of the Colony within the Colony; but as soon as they leave
it they become cruel and domineering. If they are maltreated
by any of the creoles whilst in the Colony, they endure it with
patience and take it in good part; but should he be caught in
Timneh land he receives a tenfold reward. He is tied to a tree, re-
ceives a good castigation, and is then exposed to great indignities;
and if he has no means at his command to effect his escape, his life
in many cases will be in danger. Whilst in their country they are
very treacherous, and for the least provocation they would fall on the
stores of the trader and pillage them of every article. They are
excessively cruel in their treatment to one another. For a most
trivial oifence a master would tie up his slave and place faggots
about him and set them on ?re. In war they are great cowards,
but extremely cruel; they almost always employ mercenary soldiers
from the Sousou and Korsor tribes. Christianity makes but very
little progress among them; they are hardy and incapable of an
advancing, civilizing progression. Their females are, in many cases,
handsome, clean, and industrious; their offspring with Europeans
are intelligent and hard-working. The language is Timneh, which
is sweet and sonorous, and very few of the people understand, or
can speak, English.
2. Sousou and Kaiser Tribes.—The Sousou and Korsor are allied
nations to the Timnehs, but they are very warlike and troublesome;
and most of the disturbances which have, from time to time, con-
vulsed the Rivers of Sierra Leone, are, more or less, to be attri-
buted to these tribes. In war their stratagem consists in taking
their enemies by surprise. They would not face well-disciplined
troops in a pitched battle; but, feeling their weakness, they invariably
lie in ambush, and fall upon the troops as they are passing through
some narrow path. There are very tall, ?ne-looking, noble men
among them. Domestic slavery prevails to a fearful extent. At-
tempts at civilizing them have hitherto failed, so that the saying has
become proverbial, 'Teach a Korsor man howsoever you like, he

will ultimately return to the bush.' As a race they are very intel-
ligent, apt, and quick to learn, but they are equally as quick to lose
the bene?t of it. In their social state, they are simple, clean, but
very litigious, and hire out themselves to go to war for plunder.
They are Pagans. The men are very deceitful, especially to traders.
The females are chaste, and the traders are particularly cautious in
their dealings with them. As soon as a trader enters a town he is
o?'ered a female attendant or a wife. If he accepts her, he pays the
parents or guardian a tri?ing dowry, but if not, he is bound to keep
himself continent; for any trespass on his part would lead to the
con?scation of nearly all the goods in his store, or a payment of a
heavy ?ne. In some cases snares are set to decoy a trader, by any
one who is hard up. If he is in need of tobacco, pipe, rum, or
cotton goods, he sends his choice wife to importnne the foreigner
for that article. If, in pity, he makes her a present of a pipe, a leaf
of tobacco, or any other tri?e, the husband presently brings up a
large box and demands to have it ?lled with the same article.
Should this be refused, a large 'palaver' is brought against him;
his store broken open, and his goods stolen, or he is brought before
the king, and his trade stopped until he pays a heavy ?ne. The
law of the country strictly forbids any man making presents to
another man's wife.
But the Korsors and Sousous are not in the immediate neighbour-
bourhood of Sierra Leone. They are separated from it by Timneh
land, and are placed to the north of the Colony, and opposite
Matacong and Is' de Los. They are in close proximity with the
Mandingo tribe, and a great many of them are Mohammedans. We
have fought against them in the Scarcies and Malagea with varied
results ; and also in combination with the Timnehs, in the late
Quiah War.
But, besides the Timnehs of Sierra Leone, our territory extends, or
more properly we own land in Sherbro, which was ceded afew years
ago, and in Bulama. The former place is in close proximity with
Sierra Leone and can be easily communicated with. The Sherbroes or
Shabras are very much like the Timnehs in character, but they are
cleaner, braver, and less cruel ; progression among them is not very
rapid, although they are very acute in some things.


## p. 95 (#119) #############################################

snnmmo AND BULAMA. 95
The Sherbroes or Shabras are lighter in colour, and in physique
not to be compared with the Sousous. Guerilla warfare is practised
by them, but they are, on the whole, peaceful. They trade exten-
sively with European merchants ; make good, large, and heavy
country cloth; and are, in fact, a very intelligent race of people.
Very few amongst them speak the English—the Sherbro language
being chie?y spoken. Bulama is a small island, which is
peopled principally by a race of men called Manjagoes, or black
Portuguese. The Portuguese still claim the island, but they had
no ?xed government in it. The men are of middle size, small build,
and are very good seamen. They hire themselves to work the small
craft belonging to the merchants in the River Gambia, and when they
have saved a small sum (independent for a time 1 !) they return to
their native land and remain idle, after buying a slave or a wife. But
Bulama is now extensively peopled by the inhabitants of Sierra
Leone, so that there will soon be an intelligent population in it.
We come now to the consideration of the practicability or im-
practicability of forming a substantial, intelligent government; and
how far it is likely to succeed.
As we have noticed, Sierra Leone is a peninsula, having a popula-
tion of more than ?fty thousand persons; that the people are almost
all educated, especially the creoles of the country; that it is well
protected against any native inroads; that there are no strong native
governments in its immediate neighbourhood capable of giving trou-
ble or great disturbance; that the inhabitants in the city are very com-
mercial, and endeavour to amass wealth, and their wives lend them
great assistance in mercantile pursuits ; that the city alone contains
more than twenty thousand inhabitants, and its in?uence is great in
the interior, where the extension of commerce and the intercourse of
the inhabitants with the educated of the Colony are gradually pro-
ducing civilization.
The population in the Sea and Mountain Districts are rural in their
habits and ideas,'and unopposed to any liberal form of government
that may be offered them ; they are generally poor; the government
has oifered no encouragement for developing commercial articles of
mountain growth ; and there being no government agricultural
inspector to increase the natural agricultural plant, there is no ad-

vance in that direction. From the Mouptain and Sea Districts come
no article of export at present; but the children of the poorest can
read or write. In the River District the people are comparatively
advanced—they are good agriculturalists, their soil is excellent, and
they are the principal producers of the commercial ginger, and
supply the market of Freetown with provisions. They trade ex-
tensively with the neighbouring tribes, exchanging European or
American imported articles for native produce, which they bring
down to the city and exchange for goods and cloth.
The only exposed part of the Colony is the newly-acquired ter-
ritory of Quiah, with Prince Alfred Town as its chief place. It is
in the mainland, exposed to the inroads of its former inhabitants,
but it is a garrison town, and the Timneh and Sousou warriors are
by no means so desperate as the Marabout Mandingoes of the River
Gambia; they received such severe handling during the late war
that they would not easily jeopardize the rest of the territory by at—
tempting a war. The rest of the Colony is surrounded by water, and
although the Timnehs and Sousous are well supplied with large war
canoes, yet still they will not attempt a hostile landing, as they are
well aware what kind of reception they will meet with.
Sherbro is being peopled by colonists from Sierra Leone, as is
Bulama. The inhabitants speak a distinct language from the
Timnehs, and are very peaceful. They may, if they see any weak-
ness, attempt to wage war against the inhabitants of the island; but
by good government this can be easily avoided. The natives are
good agriculturalists, and Mr. M. P. Horton, a native of Sierra
Leone, is endeavouring to teach them, by example, the mode of
tilling the ground, and the best means of bringing the produce to
market. In Bulama the Portuguese in?uence might ultimately lead
to complications, but the population are quiet and contented.
The language of the British possessions is English, which is uni-
versally spoken in the Colony; but the language of the surrounding
tribes, on whom we depend for commercial produce, is various and
distinct; thus we have, the Timneh, Mandingo, Sousou, Korsor,
Sherbro, and then at Bulama, the Manjagoe. The population in the
British Territory will be found not less than sixty or seventy thou-
sand inhabitants, scattered in isolated spots from lat. 7° N. to lat.

NATIVE MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT. 97
12° N. These spots are principally islands or peninsulas, which, to
a certain extent, are separated from those in?uences which always
disturb the mainland. But as it is proposed to teach the people
self-government, to the ultimate withdrawal of British in?uence or
power, and to leave the natives to govern themselves, there must be
chosen either a monarchical or a republican form of government.
As in the Gambia a republic is unsuited to the taste of the people,
so it is at Sierra Leone. It will never have among the native in-
habitants, who have always looked up to their king, the same in-
?uence and effect. A national government should be selected, which
should be made so powerful and in?uential as to create an interest
in its support, extensive and strong enough to counterbalance all
other in?uences. A monarchical government, then, will be the only
form, and the, king should be elected by universal suffrage, sup-
ported for some time by the British Government; he should for a
short period be initiated into the art of governing, by serving the
subordinate position of a governor over the Colony and its De-
pendencies, whilst the English Governor should act as Governor-
General of all the Coast.
His ?rst policy should be to show himself to be on the popular
side, identifying himself with the growth of the people's liberties, by
which means he will secure an under basis of popular affection,
which will be an important auxiliary in his infant kingdom, where,
at the commencement, con?icting views and opinions are possible.
He should make merit the great high road to public trusts, honours,
and rewards, thus proving to every one that he measures the intel-
lectual worth and dignity of a man, not by the truths which he pos-
sesses, or fancies he possesses, but by the sincere and honest pains
which he takes to discover them. He should be a native-born Sierra
Leonist or a citizen by constitutional adoption. On his accession
he will ?nd that his treasury is not impoverished, that his people are
intelligent, industrious, and willing to give him every assistance in
establishing and completing the national edi?ce. He will have a
population comparatively well advanced and progressing in civiliza-
tion, who, by the zealous efforts of the missionary societies, have
nearly one-?fth of the whole of the inhabitants at school, which is an
unusually large proportion in any country. By the census of 1860 the

' percentage of the population under education was 22, whereas in
Prussia the percentage was 16, and in England 13;' and the effect is
manifested in the intellectual, moral, and religious improvements
visible in the country. The schools are supported in some measure
by fees and endowments obtained by the exertions of the people.
They are good and useful establishments, but open to great improve-
ment. In Sierra Leone there is a good grammar school, where
Latin, Greek, mathematics, and other branches of English education
are taught by a native clergyman, which bears most pro?table
fruit, and is fully self-supporting. Besides this there is a large
Theological College, where the higher branches are taught, under the
Church Missionary Society, and which the king could do no better
than convert into a university.
One of his principal objects should be to annex the neighbouring
territory as an integral part of his kingdom, and to endeavour to
give protection and support to the merchants trading in it; this
will in every way improve his growing revenue, which it should be
his utmost endeavour to increase; as a good and healthy revenue is
indispensable for the support of his authority. The effect of Sierra
Leone in improving the capabilities of the countries in its neigh-
bourhood may be estimated from the report on the subject by a
merchant of that Colony, published in the Blue Book of 1856.
'Let any one who knew the Mellicourie and other rivers in our'
vicinity twenty years ago, visit them to-day, and then let him testify
to the almost miraculous change that has taken place in the manners
and habits of the people, in their intelligence—in short, in their
entire physique and morale ,- this change dates entirely from the time
the culture of the ground-nut was introduced among them. Material
causes produce the same effect on the African in his country as
on the Englishman in his ; the only difference will be in the rapidity
with which effect will follow the cause; the change is slower with
the savage, but not less certain.
'The natives are, moreover, physically and mentally,'inferior to
the tribes south of Cape Palmas; but in spite of all this, the trade
has become what it is in the short space of four years. Now, I
have a right from this to assume that its growth will be still more
rapid amongst those so much more favourably situated. If we

wanted additional evidence of this, we have only to look at the
marvellous progress of our palm oil trade. It scarcely dates so far
back as the present century. In 1808 the quantity imported into
England was only 200 tons, in 1851 it had reached to 50,000 tons;
and it is only during the last ?ve years of that period that the
steamship has come to the aid of the African commerce. . . . No
quarter of the world affords such natural facilities for such a trade.
The whole country is a network of natural canalization; it commences
at Cape St. Paul and extends to the Bonny, running parallel to the
coast in its whole length, and extending hundreds of miles into the
interior in every direction.'
A constitutional form of government must form the basis of his
administration, consisting of a House of Assembly which should be
composed of men elected by the people, as it will be dif?cult for
his Government to stand without popular con?dence, and the only
means by which that can be secured is by giving the people the
power of election of one branch of the Legislature; they will be re-
quired to direct their attention to the internal government of the
State, to sanction the amount of duty to be levied on foreign impor-
tation, and regulate the trade with foreign nations, and the imposi-
tion of stamp, postal, and other duties. Each member should
possess landed property, be over the age of twenty-two, and
be properly educated. Besides the House of Assembly, there
should be the senate, consisting of men above the age of thirty-?ve
years, and having extensive means, and who may be recognised by
all as possessing good practical common sense. The senator should
be chosen by the king-elect, and should retain of?ce so long as his
character is unimpeachable, either for life or a period not less than
ten years, and then be eligible for re-election.
Gold and silver should be made the legal tender for the payment of
debts; English money be recognised for a period as the State coin,
until such a time as the country will be able to establish a mint.
The object of the king-elect should be to discover all those salutary
measures which are necessary for the government of his people, and
counteract those noxious in?uences which may sap the healthy pro-
gress of the community. He should make himself perfectly ac-
quainted with the internal affairs of each colony, its revenue and

expenses, its commerce and agriculture, and with the national cha-
racter of the inhabitants of each section of the Government; he
should endeavour to form a correct judgment of the character of
each prominent of?cial in his Government, so that he might be able
to select ?t instruments for dif?cult appointments. He should
establish good schools in every part of his kingdom, especially in
those parts where there are no schools and where the native lan-
guage is prevalent, and make it compulsory for even a child under
the age of fourteen to attend; by this means English, which will be
the fundamental language, will be generally taught, and the future
generation become well acquainted with it.
The progress and advance of the inhabitants in this kingdom,
as attested in the Blue Book report of Colonel Stephen John
Hill, O.B., late Governor of the Colony, will prove their capacity for
progressive enlightenment and improvement. ' Re?ect,' says he, ' on
the history of Sierra Leone, and considering the di?iculties arising
from the peculiarities of its climate, its geological structure, and the
habits of its various native tribes, its progress steadily obtaining the
philanthropic results intended for it, not only testi?es to the bene?ts
following the free exercise of British rule, but encourages also the
development of greater efforts for its welfare. For that which has
been already attained yields the promise that advantages will ac-
crue to this colony in a ratio such as to excel that even of its past
career.
'This seems evident from ?ve principal sources, viz :—
'1. The stimulus to native improvement and enterprise already
abundantly elicited through British protection.
' 2. Commodions anchorage and facilities for river tra?ic.
' 3. The access of civilized nations competing in commercial
activity.
' 4. The abundance of its exportable productions.
' 5. The effective system of its colonial administration.
' It is a proof of civilization, in no small degree established, when
a census can be taken of the existing population of this colony, such
as I have the honour now to exhibit, for thus it becomes manifest
that the inducements to seek a settled habitation have been success-
ful; that the interests of the people, no longer to be considered

COLONEL HILL's REPORT. 101
transient, have been adequately provided for, whether in the en-
couragement afforded to them by commerce, trade, or manufacture,
or the restraints of just, and therefore useful, government.
' This is the more striking when the various elements of the popu-
lation are considered. Accustomed to separation as factions and
jealous tribes, now they seek whatever may be deemed advantageous
in combination as a community, acknowledging the shelter of our pro-
tecting power, rapidly learning the general customs of civilized society,
engaging in commercial transactions with surprising intelligence and
avidity, and submitting to the various necessary imposts on the
one hand, while on the other gladly reaping the bene?ts of enlarged
communications, and in many instances amassing wealth, enabling
them to vie with European enterprise. I would further remark,
that in obtaining a criterion of comparing one period of this colony's
history with another, and thereby testing its condition, it must be
borne in mind that from one of its distinguishing characteristics—-
the suppression of slavery, and offering a refuge to the liberated
African—a retarding element continually infuses itself into the
means conducive to advancement. For the civil power the task is
to give transition from the degraded habits of barbarism to those of
civilization, enlightening and elevating from the fear of the 0p-
pressor and dislike of superior power, to respect for just laws and
con?dence in a Government that has to subdue and regulate while it
protects; for the religious teacher, it is to surmount the dif?culties
of dialects unknown ere he imparts instruction, to overcome deep-
rooted prejudices, and to convince of idolatry, from which it is
nothing less than regeneration to desist; and for the social community,
which receives the oft-recurring in?ux of emancipated slaves, it is
to show a sympathy which seems to be retrospective, with but little
corresponding impetus to progression; or to regard them as an in-
ferior caste, as those worthy only to render them servitude, forget-
ful of their own similar origin, their once helpless dependence, and
the source of. that partial progress which has made them to differ.
' I state these as obstacles to progress, but not insuperable. They
only urge to renewed exertion, whether in the adoption of means to
meet every such emergency or vigilance to secure the ef?ciency of
those already in operation. It is clear that the mind and disposi-

tion of the African race can be cultivated, that the result of patient,
determined, and intelligent procedure has been and will be success-
ful; but it is not less certain that if the ends of British rule
are to be ful?lled, there must be no relaxation of effort,
no diminution of means, because the change of this race is
from ruthless oppression to an entire dependence on aliberating
power; and if by reason of its fostering care and wise encourage-
ment, however expensive, extraordinary instances of talented enter-
prise and accumulated wealth have occurred, it will, I trust, appear
evident that both for the maintenance of the Colonial Government
and the valid realization of its great and indispensable objects, the
statistics I have the honour of now submitting should be considered
pr00fs of what is absolutely requisite for the proper management
of the population of this Colony. This being secured, I can foresee
general progress in morality and integrity, social welfare, and, as a
worthy result, grateful acknowledgment of British administration.'
From the foregoing it is evident that there is growing at Sierra
Leone an enlightened population, and that under the fostering care
of the mother Government the people can, within a short time, be
left to govern themselves; that with an enlightened monarch, elected
by universal su?'rage, and an ef?cient legislation, the African element,
so essential to African civilization, will receive a powerful impetus to

with Liberia in virtuous emulation towards progressive civilization,
and in endeavours to raise their much-abused race and country in
the scale of civilized nations.
The late Governor - in- Chief, Major Blackall, on the 7th
February, 1867, in an address which was received with great ap-
plause, remarked on the advancement of the Colony in material
prosperity. ' I ?nd,' said he, 'in the town of Freetown good and
substantial houses in course of erection, replacing the very inferior
class of houses which formerly stood on the same site; in the
neighbourhood of Freetown, and more especially in the direction of
Kissy, the same improvement may be observed. Land is being
cleared and good fences put round it, and everywhere there is a
marked improvement in the mode of cultivation. Employment is
very general; and lately having occasion to seek for labourers in the

none under two shillings per day, as all were busy with their ginger

.of those applying to me for charity, and an evident improvement in
the appearance and dress of the inhabitants generally, all which
leads me to believe that, notwithstanding individual complaints of
the dulness of trade, the material prosperity of the bulk of the
. population is advancing.'

CHAPTER IX.
SELF-GOVERNMENT OF THE GOLD COAST.
THE Report of the Parliamentary Committee on the summary of
their inquiries states the following :—
'Your committee think it would have been better if the actual
assumption of Government had in all cases been at ?rst avoided in
countries which the English race can never colonize, and where
British law is inapplicable to native customs, which have been
connived at, but which might have been eradicated by the gradual
in?uence of commerce without such interference.
'The protectorate of tribes about our forts on the Gold Coast
assumes an inde?nite and unintelligible responsibility on our part, un-
compensated by any adequatc advantage to the tribes. It is even
the opinion of the Colonial Secretary of the Government that it has
enervated and disunited the protected chiefs, and that, so far from
training the chiefs to a better conduct of their own affairs, it only
leads them to lean on the English.
' It rests on no documentary evidence or conditions, excites vague-
expectations among the chiefs, and practically engages the English.
Government in maintaining weak tribes against their former sove-
reigns, and in keeping peace among them all, or even in compensating
for losses mutually occasioned by invasion, and generally in admin-
istering a territory which we cannot even tax as subjects.
' Even for the object in view, of suppressing the slave-trade,
simple commercial treaties with native powers, or the occupation of
posts without adjoining territory, might have been a wiser policy.
'Bnt in the sole interests of trade the evidence of merchants is-
that it is better that their agents should feel the necessity of keeping
on good terms with native powers, than that they should be backed

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.
by English Governments, or even by consuls, more than is necessary
for a reference of disputes t0 constituted authorities.
' Your committee also deprecate the needless employment of
English of?cers and military on such a shore as costly to this coun-
try, not only by actual mortality, but by the numbers invalided in
mind and body, and rendered un?t for other active service. The
discipline, also, of the naval service in Africa is stated to be most
trying and severe.
' The scattering of forces, both naval and military, in such parts
of the world is an additional evil, which, in case of general war,
would be of serious consideration.
' To govern effectually such settlements would require much
larger expenditure than has been made, and more thorough occu-
pation, and undertaking of public works of much larger extent than
we are ready to recommend, or Parliament would be likely to
consent to.'
In their recommendations to Parliament, they emphatically state
that ' the protectorate should only be retained while the chiefs may
be as speedily as possible made to do without it. Nothing should
be done to encourage them to lean on British help, or trust to British
administration of their affairs, whether military or judicial. The
Judicial Assessor does not ful?l the ?rst intention of the of?ce—
assisting the chiefs in administering justice—but supersedes their
authority by decisions according to his own sole judgment. This
of?ce, instituted with the best intentions, has been attended by the
introduction of needless technicalities and expense, and the employ-
ment of attorneys when the natives had better speak for themselves.
The chiefs should be rather left to exercise their own jurisdiction,
with only an appeal, when necessary, to the English magistracy;
Queen's advocates seem wholly unnecessary, and trials by jury
inapplicable in many cases.' _
The Gold Coast under British in?uence extends over a coast-line
of not more than three hundred miles, comprising Appolonia, Ahan t8:
Fantee, Winnebah, Accra, and Adangme. The inhabitants are the
possessors of the lands they now occupy from time immemorial.
The natives are almost all alike in habits and customs, in their mode
of living, and almost in that of thinking. The effect of British rule

is to moderate in a great measure some of their customs; but
domestic slavery, the great drawback to material improvement,
runs rampant among them. In the interior, the country is open to
the attacks of a powerful and hostile neighbour, the King of
Ashantee, who lusts after extending his territory to the water side,
and has always interfered with the peaceful government of the
country. On the sea-coast, with the exception of a few places—
viz., Cape Coast, Anamaboe, and Dix Cove, where there are forti?-
cations more or less strong, and armed with heavy guns, it is ex-
posed in every direction to the attacks of a hostile naval force,
which can ride at anchor on the roadstead, and do a great deal of
mischief to the towns along the coast, without receiving any check.
There is a European Power (the Dutch) whose territories are dove-
tailed with those under British in?uence, consisting, with the
exception of Elmina, of small, miserable towns, scattered in every
direction on the coast, not extending beyond ten miles from the
coast, except, perhaps, at Axim, and surrounded in every direction,
except seawards, by the British territory; the native inhabitants of
its government are Fantees, Ahantees, and Accras; they are closely
related to the natives of the same tribes in the English territory.*
As a whole, the inhabitants of the Gold Coast are generally of
middle size, kind, good-natured, and hospitable; they are always
generous to strangers, but in many instances not particularly so to
one another; they are not entirely under British rule, nor are they
British subjects; they have their own kings, their own chiefs and
caboceers, who exercise inde?nite power over them; among those
on the sea-coast this power is very limited; the in?uence of a
civilized Government in close proximity to theirs has greatly
enlightened the people, and prevented them from receiving any
arbitrary treatment from their chiefs. In those who are a little
distant from the guns of the forts, their power is more extensive;
but they dread being called upon to give an account to the English
Governor of their actions, as many of their subjects are always
availing themselves of the protecting in?uence of the English courts.
5* Exchanges of territory between these and the English took place on
the 1st January, 1868, by which the dovetailing is done away with.

Those in the interior, although to some extent they dread the in?uence
of the British rule, yet still exercise extensive and arbitrary power
over their subjects. They possess secret means of menacing those
who would attempt to divulge the actions of their kings and chiefs,
as they and their family are likely to be the greatest sufferers in the
long run. In a word, the in?uence of the kings on the Gold Coast
over their subjects, the fear they engender, and the greater con—
sideration which surrounding tribes have for them, are inversely to
their close proximity to the British rule on the Coast, directly to
the great distance they are from the guns of the forts.
The people on the Gold Coast are by no means an industrious
race; the system of domestic slavery has enervated and almost
destroyed the energy of the people; there are extensive countries
rich in gold and other minerals ; a soil exceedingly fertile in many
places, especially in the interior; and yet the mines are not properly
worked, and the fertile grounds are left to waste ; a small plot only is
cultivated for planting corn, yams, beans, and other cereals, and a
few other articles for home consumption. Go into any town, and
you will ?nd most of the men sitting down doing nothing but
telling tales. They are content with the rudimentary forms of
food, consisting of Indian corn, yams, and plantain, with ?sh and
but a tri?ing quantity of beef. The gold and other mines receive
but little attention from their hands, and a country which should be
one of the richest in Western Africa is left unexplored and un-
developed from the want of energy in its native element. The female
are the most laborious part of the population; they till the ground,
make earthenware pots of great beauty and durability, and supply
food to the husband. If a steady and continuous work is required
to be done, the female population are the best to be employed, when
the work is light enough for them to do. This shows a very low
scale of civilization. In the coast towns, such as Cape Coast,
Anamaboe, and Accra, there is comparatively a. great advance in
civilization, although there is vast room for improvement. The
principal portion of the inhabitants, who are educated men, are hard~
working, pushing, and in many cases thriving; they possess con-
siderable enlightenment of manner. Agriculture forms no part of
their occupation, but they are merchants, traders, and agents for

English ?rms. They build and live in large houses, which possess
all the air and comforts of civilization; they dress in European
costumes, speak English, some can even speak four or ?ve
European languages; a great many have received sound education
in England and Scotland; and even some of those who are educated
in the old schools of the Coast are not by any means inferior to
them; those who have received a middling education, and could
read and write letters in English, are called among themselves
'scholars.'
But the great bulk of the people are still uncivilized. Their
dress consists of an original or adamic apron, called skim, variously
arranged around the middle, and made of cloth of cotton or silk
manufacture; and the rest of the body is covered by a loose cloth of
native or European manufacture, which is sometimes very costly,
being made of silks, satin, and velvet, and is placed around the
shoulders like the Roman toga; but the ordinary inhabitants use
common cotton cloth; they wear no shirts or drawers underneath to
cover their body, so that they are half naked. The uneducated
females cover their bodies with a piece of cloth which extends from
their middle to their feet; unlike the females in the Gambia, they
put on no chemise or short gown to cover the nakedness of the
superior portions of the body, but these are left open and exposed,
and exhibit a very uncivilizcd appearance, especially to strangers.
The J ollof natives in the Gambia put on four, or even ?ve, of these
cloths at a time, whilst on the Gold Coast they use only one, and
very seldom two; the consequence is that when there is a strong
breeze many parts of the body are exposed. In some part of the
Territory, such as the district of Crobboe, the sight is disgusting,
the females are perfectly naked; girls, of whatever age—eighteen,
twenty, and twenty-four—before they are legally married, although
not in any way incontinent, go about almost in complete nudity.
They use a small, long, narrow piece of cloth, about from four or
?ve inches broad, which is attached to beads of showy hue around
their waist, hanging down behind to below their knees, giving the
appearance at a great distance of a tail. These girls are known on
the coast as tail girls, and would account for the description of
ancient narrators, who, passing by in ships along the coast, have de-

scribed negroes with long tails. They use no other cloth around
any part of the body, and appear in public markets and travel from
one town to the other in the same peculiar lack of habit. Among
the mulattoes 0r educated females, principally in the sea-coast
towns, the dress is made after European patterns, but not after the
fashions of the period; it is set very loosely over the body.
The marriage consists in the male paying a certain dowry to the
parents or guardian of the fair sex, ranging from one to four ounces
of gold. The damsel then becomes his property; she is bound to do
whatever he bids her; to labour to feed him. After a time his affec-
tion grows cool, and he may, if he chooses, divorce her by merely
telling her parents that she may go to Whomsoever she likes ; or if
in the sea-coast towns, he gives her a free-book—zla, a paper to say
that she is no more his wife. On the other hand, if she becomes
tired of his embraces, and wishes to free herself of his, it may be,
tyrannical rule, or if she is found enamoured with another, her
parents are called upon to repay all the dowry and presents he has
ever made her, from the time of courting up to the time of her leav-
ing his establishment. Even among the educated natives of the
coast, this convenient mode of marriage is preferred; and there are
frequent changes in their domestic arrangements. Marriage accord-
ing to the rites and ceremonies of civilized life, is, unfortunately, but
seldom practised; the young gentlemen dislike the restraint which
it engenders, and even when it has been entered into, there are
frequent misunderstandings from the holy institution not receiving
due attention; and separation and divorce are, in many cases, the
inevitable consequences. But this mode of living is not suf?ciently
denounced on the coast; it is a practice which is engendered and
fostered by the most disreputable of all institutions, domestic
slavery. Polygamy is a law of the country from time immemorial;
the chief and wealthy men are the possessors of a great many wives.
The love of the mothers for their children is unbounded, and the
non-possession of any is almost regarded as a divine curse on the
woman. The love of the father is not so deep and lasting. The
children love their mother, and their brothers and sisters by the same
mother, more than they do their father, or his numerous offspring.
In case of death, the property goes to the eldest brother by the same

mother, to the sister or to her children; and if not secured by will,
or given before death, the children of the deceased are served out.
The infants are never tattooed ; it is a habit detestcd by the natives,
and every individual who is seen tattooed is regarded as a slave, and
called Donkor, or slave, whether he be a free man or not.
In some parts of the Gold Coast, as at Cape Coast, there is a
very strong feeling against the soldiers of the West Indian Regi-
ments, which has led to outbreaks between them. The existence of
a different language from English, Fantee, which the soldiers could
not understand, the half-civilized dress of the natives, which gives the
appearance of a barbarous condition, induce the soldiers to have but
little respect for the common people; and the inhabitants, smarting
with the rough treatment they have received from time to time from
the soldiers, and the ungenial spirit exhibited by them, are roused to
arms at the earliest notice. There is a great deal of antagonism
between the soldiers and the civil population here, which is not to
be found in any other part of the Coast, and reminds one of the out-
breaks in Barbadoes, one of the West Indian Islands. Since the
disbandment of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps, and that the West
Indian soldiers have garrisoned the forts, many rows have taken
place at Cape Coast, which have led to very serious results to both
the military and the town; the civilians have been killed, and one
of the soldiers was mysteriously lost, and his body, after a few days,
found ?oating down the sea. Reports ran riot as to the cause of
his death, but nothing positive was known.
The languages of the Gold Coast are numerous. They are
Fantee, Appolonia, Ahanta, Accra, and Adangme. The Fantee
is the most extensively spoken, and is almost the current language
of the Gold Coast. Its principal seat extends from Secundee to
the Seccoom river, a distance of about a hundred and ?fty miles,
and far into the interior beyond Ashantee under another name. Be-
hind Accra it is spoken in Aquapim, Aquamboo, and Creepee. It
is a soft, agreeable language; it is only a dialect, which is called
Otyz', 0r Tyi, that is spoken in the interior, in Ashantee, and
among those tribes in the protected Territory who formerly
were politically united with the kingdom of Ashantee, but having
separated from it, are now only united by ethnological consanguinity.

LANGUAGES USED ON THE GOLD COAST. 111
These are the Assins, Denkeras, Akims, Aquapims, and Aquambus.
The difference between the Fantee and Otyi is, however, not great,
as individuals of the two nations can easily converse and understand
each other. There is slight difference in the pronunciation of
some sounds, the Otyi being more agreeable than the Fantee; there
are also discrepancies in the terminations and forms of words. The
Fantee language has, as yet, not been reduced to writing, but the
Rev. Mr. Riis, of the Basle Missionaries, has published a small but
elaborate and scholastic volume of the grammar and vocabulary of
the Otyi, which, unfortunately, is not made the subject of study by
the educated natives of the Coast.
The Ahanta and Appolonia languages are harsher and less melo-
dious than the Otyi and Fantee. They are alike to one another,
and spring from the Awoween language, which is spoken in the
interior of Assin and Appolonia. The dialectic difference between
the Ahanta and Awoween is greater than that which exists between
the Fantee and Otyi. The Awoween, with slight dialectic
difference, is spoken in Dutch and English Ahanta, in Wassaw
-—especially Western Wassaw—Axim, Appolonia, Asinee, and the
extensive country of Awoween, and terminates where it meets with
the Krew in the Grain Coast. It has not been reduced into writing.
All the people in the British Ahanta understand and speak Fantee,
and it is the commercial language.
Accra or Ga language is spoken by a very small class of people.
It was, no doubt, in years past, a large and in?uential tribe, which
has been crippled and destroyed by the Otyi tribe during their
bloody wars for ascendency, by whom they are called "Enkran."
It is a harsher language than the Otyi, and very palatal and
sonorous. Among the grown-up people the Otyi language is
spoken, and in the interior it forms the medium of public inter-
course; and the songs of the Gas are in Otyi, probably from the
di?iculty with which a palatal language can be pronounced in a
song. The Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, sen., of the Basle Mission, who
had charge of the arrangement of the Ga language, has reduced it
into writing, a grammar, and vocabulary. Part of the Old and
New Testament, and other scriptural books, have been translated.
The Adangme or Adampe language is spoken in Adangme and

Crohboe, and is only a dialect of the Awoonah language, which must
originally have belonged to the same stock as the Dabomy, Pope, or
Ewe language. It is less palatal than the Accra, in which many
Ga words have been found to be incorporated. The Awoonah
dialect has been reduced to writing by the German missionaries of
North Germany, or Bremen Missionaries, a sister mission to the
Basle at Accra. West of the Volta the Otyi, and east of it the
Ewe (Dahomy), languages are prevalent, each of which is spoken by
about four or ?ve millions (i) of people.
Only in the- triangle described by the lower Volta, the sea, and
the Aquapim mountains, the Accra language is spoken by about
200,000 C!) people. Three colonies of the Accra people have
emigrated into the Ewe Country. Among the Otyi and Ewe people
on both sides of the middle course of the Volta, a conquered tribe,
speaking the Kyerepong or Guang language, but also respectively
Otyi or Ewe, are to be found.
Otyi, Accra, and Ewe (as well as Guang) are distinct languages,
about as different as German, English, and French, if not more so,
and each is again subdivided into different dialects. East of Ewe
the Aku or Yoruba language is spoken. Accra, Ewe, and Aku
belong to the same, but Otyi to a different, family of languages,
though many Otyi words have mixed with Accra and Ewe. ' All
these languages are rich and very ?exible, and beautifully regular, so
that there is not the least doubt or hindrance as to the possibility of
their being ?xed bywriting and printing, or the translation of thewhole
of the Word of God into them. And any statement of a foreigner or
native of their being poor, rough, or unadapted to civilization and
regeneration; or of the necessity or desirability of changing them
for a European language (which is pretty nearly the same as cutting
one's tongue and driving out his soul), shows only the gross igno-
rance of such a person. But as the African has a wonderful gift of
learning a foreign language, such as is seldom met with in any other
part of the globe, it is certainly of the greatest importance to en-
courage the study of old (classic) and modern languages among the
educated and gifted Africans, to make the riches of classic and
foreign literature accessible to them, to translate them into the
native languages, and by that means make them by-and-bye the pro-

COMMERCE AND CURRENCY OF THE GOLD COAST. 113
perty of all, but not as some foolish young gentlemen seem to under-
stand, to forget and despise the mother t0ngue.'—Christian Mes-
senger and Examiner.
The commercial relations of the Gold Coast are extensive, and
could be made very productive, but have been of late years reduced
in a considerable degree. In the Western District, gold forms the
most important and principal article of export. It is obtained
principally from the interior countries beyond the Protectorate,
especially from Ashantee, but small quantities are brought down
from Denkera, Wassaw, Awoween, and Appolonia. 'It is exported
principally in dust; the natives, being partial to the nuggets, have
always kept them. The largest nugget I have seen on this Coast was
at Dixcove, in the possession of the late Mr. Essien. It weighed a
little over thirteen ounces, but unfortunately when he died it was,
with other nuggets, buried with him, such being the custom of this part
of the Coast. In the Eastern District, palm-oil in large quantities is
brought down through the river Volta and on the heads of carriers
into various towns on the sea-coast. The quantity exported is large,
and the oil of excellent quality. Besides palm-oil and gold, gum
copal, ivory, and, in former years, Indian corn, were largely ex-
ported. For these articles the people received cowries, and articles
of Manchester, Birmingham, Shef?eld, and Glasgow manufacture.
The currency of the country is gold-dust, an ounce of which is
sold for 3l. 12s. The smallest quantity recognised in trade or for
general use is a pessua, or 1%d., which is regarded by a Fantee man
in the same light as we regard a farthing. Thus, when a thing is
considered worthless, a Fantee man will say that it is not worth
a pessua. The sum is equal in weight to a small bead, or the seed
of the Aviculum, or bird's-eye. The next in value is Simpoir, 3d;
and then Teycoopkan, or Teycoo, 6d. A compound is used to
denote higher value; thus, 9d. is called Simpoz'r na Teycoophan,
or, Teycoo na Simpoi'r. The most general calculation is one dollar,
which in gold is called Arcki, and equal to 4s. 6d. These con-
ventional names were not originally native, but given probably by
the old African Trading Company, so as to produce a uniformity
of the currency of the country with the English coin. In the
Eastern District, besides a small quantity of gold-dust, cowries, a

small shell, the Cypress moneta, is extensively used in the interior,
and is much employed for buying palm-oil. It is a cumbrous cir-
culating medium, and ?uctuates greatly in value. One head is
supposed to be equal to half-a-dollar, being 50 strings, each
string containing 40 cowries. For silver coin, I have known more
than 60 strings given for half-a-dollar, or 2s. 3d. Besides cowries
and gold-dust, which are purely native currency, English coin,
dollars (American, Mexican, and Spanish) are found in large
quantity; but for general use the natives prefer the English, from
its standing value and convenience; it is very much sought after.
The dollars are principally used to buy oil with from the people in
the bush. The star, or Mexican dollars, are preferred, as their
value is always 4s. 6d., while the others are subject to great
?uctuation. The currency value of a dollar is 5s.; but the sterling
value, 4s. 6d. This sometimes leads to great confusion among
novices; four dollars are always spoken of as a pound, i. e., a pound
currency, although its real value is 18s. sterling.
Education.—At present the Gold Coast, as a whole, is fearfully
neglected in point of education. The population, according to the
latest and lowest estimate, is about 151,000 (1858); but it is in
fact more than 450,000. Taking it at the lowest reckoning,
there is less than 1 in 300 educated. Among such a large popula-
tion, there are scarcely 500 persons who can read and write, and
not 50 who can boast of a good, sound education. But the educa-
tional staff at the Gold Coast is declining every year, so that at
present, in some respects, it is a mockery and a delusion. The
missionaries belong to the Wesleyan and the Basle Societies.
The Wesleyan missionaries have their stations principally in the
Western, and the Basle in the Eastern District. In the interior,
the \Vesleyans have stations at Dominassie; in the latter district they
have stations at Jamestown, Accra, and Aquamboo. In former
years, under the superintendence of Mr. Freeman, they had stations
in various parts of the interior, where large school-houses were
built, and the children educated; but, as a necessary consequence
of the extension of the mission-stations, the expenses also increased;
the parent committee was displeased with their agent on this account,
and he was superseded, which led to their losing a most useful and

EDUCATION AND MISSIONS. 115
energetic servant. In former years this body possessed a good
institution at Accra, where such men as Timothy Laing, James
Soloman, and John Plange, now native ministers, were educated;
but as in the Gambia, so here, they are now pursuing a retrogade
course, through the want of funds, and all their educational establish-
ment consists of small schools, where the mere rudiments of learning
are taught. They have not, as they did in former years at Sierra
Leone, and as the Church Missionary Society have and are doing
at Sierra Leone and Lagos, sent young 'men Who have made some
pro?ciency in their schools to ?nish their education in Europe; and
even one of the native ministers, the Rev. T. Laing, having written
asking to be permitted to ?nish his education in the Wesleyan Theo-
logical College in England, and offering to pay his passage, was re-
fused. This Society, it must be acknowledged, has_ done well in
diffusing useful knowledge and civilizing the natives, but there is
great room for improvement in their educational establishment.
The chiefs of this Coast feel and confess this want, and have lately
sent a most urgent appeal to the Church Missionary Society to
extend to them the bene?ts provided by that Society for Sierra.
Leone, by providing establishments for a higher education than the
schools now in existence; but it appears that, as yet, this appeal has
not been complied with.
The Basle Missionary Society is composed of energetic Germans,
who have done an immense deal towards cultivating and enlarging
the native literature; they have reduced the language of the Eastern
District into writing, and taught the people how to communicate
with one another in their own tongue; they have large female and
male seminaries and schools in the interior, where a sound education
is given to the natives in the higher branches, as may be observed
from the following report: ' Five pupils came up for ?nal exami-
nation lately, at the Theological Seminary of the Basle Mission at
Akropong, Gold Coast. They had gone through a course of three
years, and were examined in Greek and Hebrew, Church history,
logic, exegeses of the Old and New Testaments in the original
language, &c. Their answers were prompt, distinct, and clear, in
evidence that they had well mastered their work. When these
young men have served some years as catechists they will be pre-

sented for ordination. It would have been very interesting for the
members of the Anthropological Society to be present at the
examination—which was conducted for the most part in English—so
that they could have judged for themselves whether the negro
deserves a place among his con?'éres of the J aphetic and Shemitic
races. Four out of the ?ve are of the purest negro blood.' May I
not suggest to the neighbouring mission, the Wesleyan, the neces-
sity of observing the same principle. What an advantage it would
be to the Gold Coast if that body could have presented to the
world a similar report!
There is a small school at the head-quarters of the Gold Coast
maintained by the British authorities; it is said to be very de?cient,
and at present scarcely numbers forty scholars; which, when the
population of the whole Protectorate is from 151,000 to 450,000, is
really a 'bagatelle and a play-house.' In former years, the G0-
vernment school was the most prosperous and respectable on the
Gold Coast. European teachers were sent out for the express pur-
pose of educating the growing population. Sir Charles M'Carthy
gave it his entire support. Prizes were offered to deserving
students, and this school turned out men like George Blankson,
Samuel Brew, Francis Grant, and the late Henry Barnes, and many
others; even more recently the Government school turned out well
educated young men, such as Samuel Davies, Mark Hansen, and
Joseph Adams; but for many years a process of degeneracy has been
gradually going on, until it has arrived at its present low condition.
An excellent lady, Mrs. Moseley, wife of a late energetic and
much esteemed Chief Justice of the Gold Coast, has been endeavour-
ing to raise up a fund for establishing a female school on the Gold
Coast ; her heart burned with Christian and English generosity for
the neglected children whom she saw, when she ?rst arrived on the
Coast; and she has now collected a sum with which she expects to
commence a school. But it behoves the people of the Gold Coast to
help themselves also, and imitate the examples of the other colonies.
They have recently read what improvements are going on in Lagos,
and that the educated native merchants there, who are composed
principally of young men from Sierra Leone, have established an
academy, called the Lagos Academy, which is an institution for the
promotion of literature, arts, and science; it was opened to sub-

scribers, and presided over by the Bishop of the Niger, the Rev.
Dr. Crowther. Let them put their shoulders to the wheel, and
carry out material reforms in their own country; they have the
means ; why not use them in the proper way?
One of the greatest drawbacks to the civilization and improve-
ment of the Gold Coast is Domestic Slavery. This institution, wher-
ever it-exists, produces the most deplorable effects on the moral and
physical condition of the population; it enervates and deteriorates
their strength, destroys the doctrine of man's equality, demoralizes
their social condition, places a deterrent effect on the energies of
the missionaries, vitiates the mind and principles, and has a most
damnifying effect on the body politic of a nation. Civilization
and domestic slavery are antagonistic terms; where the one exists,
it is impossible for the other to thrive; and where civilization pro-
gresses, this slavery must be abolished.
Our rule in this unfortunate Coast has been that of an unde?ned,
undetermined, unmeasured power; extensive under one ruler, very
much con?ned under another. The coast line is so considerable, and
the interior so extensive, that it is almost impossible for the G0-
vernor, with the limited means at his command, to localize certain
measures that are essential to the improvement of the Coast; and
these obnoxious institutions, which have shaped the customs of the
native community from time immemorial, and which are diametrically
opposed to the British Constitution, cannot be properly handled. If
the Governor of the Gold Coast should proclaim that, by the power
in him vested, he abolishes domestic slavery on this Coast, .as being
an illegal institution, his proclamation would be a dead letter, as the
area of his government occupies several thousand miles, with a popu-
lation ranging from 151,000 to 450,000, of which three-fourths are
slaves or descendants of slaves. He could not see that his proclama-
tion was carried out; he might liberate a few who presented them-
selves to him, but the country would still Suffer from slavery, and the
treatment by the masters, especially of those in the interior, would
even become worse. The land is very large, and the people too
much scattered about; so that a concentrated action, with the
minimum force and empty exchequer at his dispdsal, is inipoSSible.

Domestic slavery is the great cause of that lazy habit and im-
morality which are traceable on the Gold Coast. A man has a lot
of domestic slaves. He invariably does nothing. A few of the
slaves work for three or four hours of the day, and sleep away the
rest of it. They are fed by their masters, who give them a piece of
canky and ?sh in the morning and evening. They possess no energy;
there is no life in anything they do; no intellectual vigour; no effort
such as springs from the rights, duties, responsibilities, and cares
of property. They know that they are slaves, and that slaves they
must always be; that though they might improve the property by
their exertion, their sound judgment, and persevering labour, none
of the results would be, in any way, their own; and, consequently,
they only look to the treatment of their masters for an incentive to
work, which generally vacillates with their strength- If the state-
ment of Professor Fawcett is true about hired labour, how much
more true it is of domestic slave labour! 'The condition of a
man who can enjoy the entire fruit of his own labour,' says the
Professor, 'is in every respect superior to the condition of one who
is simply a hired labourer, and who, consequently, has no direct in-
terest in thework upon which he is employed. The faculties of the
latter are never fully stimulated; his hopes are not excited by suc-
cess ; his energies are not called forth to contend with the dif?culties
and disorders to which every employer is liable. His life is, in fact,
one of dull routine. It may be said, that he is spared many
anxieties, with which.- the labourer, who is his own master, has to
contend. But it is almost a truism to assert that these cares and
anxieties are the most valuable instruments of education, and that
without them the human faculties can never be adequately de-
veloped.' It is this slavery that effeminates the Gold Coast,
and leads to such a deplorable lack of enterprising spirits.
The land is rich to over?owing. Extensive gold mines are
waiting; but the pe0ple, satis?ed with the costless articles of
food, remain in miserable huts, when they should be ploughing
the mountain sides and changing the courses of the rivers in which
these precious metals are to be found. This is not a time for
mincing matters, and my friends on the Gold Coast must under-
stand that I speak of the natives at large; and although a few,

comparatively very few, hard-working men may be found in the
Coast towns, yet still, by their keeping domestic slaves, they are
supporting an institution which has a most deplorable effect on
the rise of their country. Instead of the population ?ourishing, and
the people becoming great men (advancing with the world's ad-
vancing civilization), they are degenerating; and when the few
men who now occupy important posts in the country, such as
Blankson, Grant, and Brew, shall have passed away, Cape
Coast will not have men to point out as evidences of its import-
ance. Who among the rising generation, 'so far as we can
now judge, is there to ?ll up the places of a Bannerman, a Hansen,
a Richter, and a Barnes 0f olden time? and so long as the edu-
cated population support domestic slavery, so long will Cape Coast
—the oldest establishment of the English on the Coast—occupy
an inferior position as regards progressive civilization.
Domestic slavery also engenders and fosters great immorality
and polygamy. This is essentially the case on the Gold Coast.
In the interior towns I have noticed most of the female slaves
become wives or concubines of their masters, whose offspring are,
in some cases, particularly despised by the children of the free
women. In a yard or family, many of these slave women are the
mothers of pretty daughters, who all become the property of the
master, or pass to the indiscriminate use and indulgence of their
sons; and thus boys commence such matters very early in life, before
the age of puberty, and, in many cases, come to early maturity,
and are puny and short-lived.
One circumstance which produces a positive injury on the energies
of domestic slaves is that after their death their property goes to
their master or mistress, as the case may be, and their children are
set adrift or still kept in slavery. The system of domestic slavery,
therefore, is rotten and vile in every respect..
Foreign Neighbours.--There are only two foreign nations in close
proximity with the Protected Territory of the Gold Coast, which
might occasion some trouble to the head of a native self-govern-
ment—viz., the Dutch and Ashantee. The Dutch Territory is
in the neighbourhood of Cape Coast Castle ; its greatest extent of
country is in Ashanta; and the chief town is St, George d'Elmina

a well-forti?ed place, about seven and a-half miles from the Castle at
Cape Coast. The Dutch possess few native troops, and in case of.
hostilities could not, if backed with their native force, withstand
the combined action of the natives in the Western District of the
English Territory. But should there be a disturbance between
them and the native government, and this be unprotected by
any European Government, they would at once bombard the sea-
coast towns with a man of war. The Dutch power will give much
trouble and constant annoyance to a native government, if the latter
be entirely unsupported by the English.
The Ashantee Neighbour is the most powerful and most dreaded.
The Kingdom of Ashantee" skirts the interior of all the Protected
tribes. The Ashantee men I have seen are a short, thin, ?lthy, bony
race, of a nervine (neurine) temperament, who are immersed in
gross ignorance and superstition; they are sharp, active, and very
warlike; and possess a remarkable power of combination. Their
military organization is very creditable for a savage race ; implicit
obedience is forced by military laws. In time of war, to the
Ashantee life is of no consideration, but the pleasure of the king is
everything. The least display of cowardice, or any questionable
strategic movement which may lead to the supposition of fear, is im-
mediately punished with death.- Victory or death is generally their
war-cry at the commencement of- an- engagement; and, conse-
quently, the nation has founded a large empire. The king resides
at Coomasi (Kumasi), his capital, and extends his. despotic sway
not only over several kindred tribes of common descent and
language, but also over 'Mohammedan tribes of different speech,
who, in the more remote interior, are said.to furrow with their
ploughs and feed their herds of cattle on grass-grown plains dividing
the Kong Mountains from that woody and mountainous district in
which the Asante themselves and their consanguineous tribes have
their abode. They even, during the ?rst part of the present cen-

tury, went so far as to assail the English settlements on the Gold
Coast; and by carrying on a bloody war with the Protectorate,
made themselves formidable for a time to the settlers, and the
name of Asante generally known to Europeans.' They are'the
great supporters of the merchants in the Western District. When
at peace with the Protectorate, trade ?ourishes, and wealth ac-
cumulates; but when there is misunderstanding, trade diminishes,
and general bankruptcy is the result. They are of the greatest im-
portance-to the Coast towns. They buy up a large quantity
of the imported goods, with which they carry on extensive
commerce with tribes interior to their countries, and bring down
many thousand ounces of gold-dust in exchange; they also bring
down for sale monkey-skins and ivory. They are a formidable
enemy, and ought always to be much conciliated and tolerated;
Each of the different countries within the Protectorate Territory
has its own king, its own caboceers, or head men, and is governed
by its own laws. They. are distinct, separate from, and inde-
pendent of one another, connected only by tribal ties. They
respect each other according to the number of their subjects,
their reputed fame, and the distance they are from. the guns of. the
fort. There is not one of the kings who can be said to have a
commanding in?uence over the whole country. The British
Governor possesses authority over the whole Territory according
to his mode of dealing with them. If he is kind, affable, and
friendly to them, respects their authority, but entirely prevents
their carrying out any barbarous customs, he is respected and
beloved; his in?uence and power is extensive; and the kings readily
obey his authority and do anything for him. Thus, during the
government of Mr. Richard Pine, when the country had been for
several years suffering from misgovernment and the authority of
the governors was not respected in the interior, through his urbanity
of manners and magnanimous disposition, he exercised considerable_
in?uence over the kings in the interior of the Protectorate;
his orders received obedience; his word was law; his summons
met with quick reply; he respected the kings, and they, in turn, re-
verenced him; he grappled with dif?culties which his predecessors
dared not meddle with. But he was unfortunate. The Ashantee

war broke out as he was in the zenith of his popularity; the
kings and their people crowded to his standard, and went
willingly to the ?eld; but there was no engagement with the
enemy, and a great many of the population died from the effects
of bush life. A second expedition was organized, which shared
the same fate. The natives did not go to the ?eld this time, but a
large body of the troops penetrated far into the interior. The
climate proved deadly to a great many of the European of?cers
and the West Indian soldiers; and the whole affair was fatal to
the interests of the country and to Pine's administration.
As it is now under contemplation to give up the Gold Coast to
native rule, the ?rst point for consideration is to establish one or
more kings who should exercise great in?uence over the others
during the period that the British rule still exists. How this can
be done I shall consider in another place.
Before entering more fully on the subject of self-government in
the Gold Coast, I shall say a few words on the feelings of the
military of?cers serving in the Gold Coast command. In the pre-
sent condition of the country, the feeling is that of disgust. I re-
member the time when o?icers were glad to come to the Gold
Coast service; when they preferred it to even Sierra Leone or the
Gambia; but this is not the case now. The Gold Coast, in point of
healthiness, is not behind the other two places ; in fact, so long as
bush work is prevented, it is superior to those places in point of
healthiness; it is not subject to those periodic epidemics of yellow
fever which devastate those two colonies. Its exposure to the in-
?uence of the strong south-west wind places a veto on its de-
velopment. Unhealthiness is not therefore the cause, as a great
improvement has lately been made in its sanitary state. In former
years there were a great many jolly merchants, European and
natives, on the Gold Coast, who were constantly giving dinner
parties, picnics, and fetes, and, consequently, there was much
life and activity in the place; but at present everything is almost at
astandstill; the merchants are in a state of semi-bankruptcy, most of
the jolly fellows are either dead or reduced to poverty, and the Gold
Coast service is that of a dull, monotonous routine; whilst at
Sierra Leone and the Gambia, but especially the latter, there are

MILITARY SERVICE ON THE GOLD ooasrp 123
always social parties for the o?icers and pleasant gatherings, which
diminish that dull routine of service which is so disagreeable.
In former years the military of?cers on the Gold Coast command
held several colonial appointments, which brought them. ayearly in-
come of from 1001. to 4001. pounds, and seemed to occupy most of
their time, and improved and enlivened the service. These were that
of commandant of Dixcove (1501.), Anamaboe (1.501.), Winnebah
(1251.), Prampram (2001.), and Quillah (1501.); the appointment of
Collector of Customs (3001.), and Acting Queen's Advocate (2001.),
being a total of 1,2751. These appointments have either been
abolished according to the new arrangement, or are otherwise
?lled up.
As, according to the decision of the Home Government, the
Protectorate 0f the Territory is to be retained, whilst the ' chiefs may
be, as speedily as possible, made to do without it,' and that they
are on no account to lean on British help, or trust to British ad-
ministration of their affairs, let us consider what would be the
most judicious and most ?tting self-administration of such an ex-
tensive Coast. The British Gold Coast must be divided into two
parts, each governed separately, called respectively Fantee and
Accra. The form of government best suited to Fantee is
monarchical; and that to Accra, a republic. I shall, therefore,
consider these two separately, under the heads of the Kingdom of
Fantee ,' and the Republic qf Accra.

CHAPTER X.
SELF-GOVERNMENT OF THE GOLD COAST.'—KINGDOM OF
FANTEE.
I HAVE in the last chapter detailed the extent of territory com- '
prised within the term, Protectorate Territory of the Gold Coast, and
stated that it is formed of separate kingdoms ruled by separate
and independent kings; but the people regard the Governor of the
Forts as supreme head. The country extends from Apollonia to the
River Volta. The Dutch Government owned lands in this extent of
coast line which were inconveniently placed between the English
towns.
The ?rst point on the Gold Coast to be taken into consideration,
whilst endeavouring to prepare the people for self-government, was
either to buy the Dutch out of the Coast entirely, or to separate the
country into two distinct halves, one under the sole government of
the Dutch, and'the other under the English; and both have the
same Customs regulations. This latter method has lately been
arranged by treaty with the Dutch Government, and its pro-
visoes place British Ahanta, Apollonia, and Wassaw under the
Dutch; and Dutch Accra, and a few miserable Dutch towns to
windward of it, under the English. In this arrangement the Dutch
are the gainers; they thus acquire a large extent of compact and
rich country, about 300 per cent. larger than the territory ex-
changed, the population containing about 100,000 at least, whilst
the exchanged land contains less than 15,000 inhabitants; but the
measure is of intrinsic political advantage to the British portion of
the Coast. Our Government will therefore exercise sole authority
over the countries from the Sweet River, near Elmina, to the River
Volta. This should be divided into two separate independent self-

governments—viz., the Kingdom of Fantee, extending from the
Sweet River to the borders of Winnebah; and the Republic qf
Accra, extending from Winnebah to the River Volta; the former
to comprise the kingdoms of Denkera, Abrah, or Abacrampah,
A'ssin, Western Akim, and Goomoor; the latter Eastern Akim,
Winnebah, Accra, Aquapim, Adangme, and Crobboe.
The next point to be considered is the political union of the
various kings in the kingdom of Fantee under one political head.
A man should be chosen, either by universal su?'rage, or appointed
by the Governor, and sanctioned and received by all the kings and
chiefs, and crowned as King of Fantee. He should be a man of
great sagacity, good common sense, not easily in?uenced by party
spirit, of a kind and generous disposition, a man of good education,
and who has done good service to the Coast Government. He
should be crowned before all the kings and caboceers within the
kingdom- of Fantee ; the kings should regard him as their chief ; his
authority should be recognised and supported by the Governor of
the Coast, who should refer to him matters of domestic importance
relative to the other'native kings, advise him as to the course he
should pursue, and see that-his decisions be immediately carried out.
He should be assisted by a number of councillors, who, for the
time, should swear allegiance to the British Government, until
such time as the country is considered ?t for delivery over
to self-government. They should consist not only of men of
education and good, sound common sense, residing in the Coast
towns, but also of responsible chiefs, as representatives of the
various kings within the kingdom.
One most important consideration is the yearly vote of a round
sum out of the revenue as stipend to the king elect whilst under
this probationary course, such as would allow him to keep up a
certain amount of State dignity, and would enable him to carry out
his authority over the kings and chiefs. Each State should be
made to contribute towards the support of the temporary Govern-
ment ; a native volunteer corps should be attached to the Govern-
ment, o?icered by natives of intelligence, who should be thoroughly
drilled by paid o?'icers and sergeants, supplied from West Indian
regiments stationed on the Coast. The English language should

be made the diplomatic language with foreign nations; but Fantee
should be made the medium of internal communication, and there—
fore ought at once to be reduced to writing.
The territory of the kingdom of Ashantee is larger than that of the
Protected Territory of the Gold Coast, but we ?nd the reigning king
possesses absolute power over the different tribes composing it.
True enough, the edi?ce was constructed on the blood of several
nationalities, which gives it greater strength; but the kingdom of
Fantee must be erected on a peaceable footing, supported, for a
time at least, by a civilized Government, with a prince at the head
who is versed in native diplomacy, and well known and respected
by the various kings; such a man as the Hon. George Blankson,
whose experience and deserved fame would make his appointment
meet with universal support; a prince who would be able, like the
potentate of Ashantee, to concentrate a large force at a very short
notice, at any given point, when menaced by their powerful neigh-
bours.
The appointment is absolutely necessary, since King John Aggery,
of Cape Coast, has been dethroned by the local government, and this
has been sanctioned by Her Majesty's Government. The proclama-
tion is de?nite, and runs thus: 'Be it therefore known and proclaimed
that the said John Aggery is for ever deprived of his stool and dignity,
and that the o?iee and title of King of Cape Coast no longer exists,
and is abolished from this day forth ' (the 21st March, 1867). The
Home Government have distinctly told the kings that they will
have to defend themselves against any hostile tribe, without ever
expecting to receive support from the British Government, except
when the few sea-coast towns are attacked. The condition of the
interior kingdoms is therefore in a most precarious state. Since the
last disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where
several lives were lost through encampment during the rains in the
?elds, and a large waste of money resulted without the least advan-
tage, the Home Government have turned their faces against all such
expeditions, as ' costly to England,' not only by actual mortality of
English q?icers and military, 'but by the number invalided in mind
and body, and rendered un?t for other active service.' They (the
Parliamentary Committee) therefore recommend to the Home Go-

NECESSITY FOR UNION. 127
'vernment, and this to that of the Coast, that the chiefs are to be
' as speedily as possible made to do without the British protectorate;
they were on no account to encourage them to lean on British help, or
trust to British administration of their afairs, whether military or
judicial.' The aim, therefore, should be to form a strong, compact
native Government, which would command the obedience of all the
native kings and chiefs, and which would immediately undertake the
quelling of all disturbances in the interior, and command the native
force if attacked.
But the present disunited condition of the kings of the Pro-
tectorate is woful in the extreme. If a war should break out with
Ashantee, they have got no superior authority to look to, except
the Governor, whose instruction is not to give them support in the
interior. He will supply them with a few guns and ammunition,
but each king will have to take care of his own ?reside, with a num-
ber of men so small as to be insuf?cient to withstand a detachment
of the Army of Ashantee. The stratagem of the Ashantee generals
has always'been to ?ght each king in detail; and having completely
mastered one, they proceed to another; and thus always come ed in
these wars victorious against the various kings. The Ashantee Army
numbers from forty to ?fty thousand men. Should the attack be
?rst made against the kingdom of Denkera, with a detachment
which could muster from ?ve to ten thousand ?ghting men, the
terror of the very name of Ashantee alone will make them take to
their heels to the sea-coast towns, and leave the country in their
hands. Exactly the same would be the result if the kingdoms of
Assin and Akim, frontier countries, were to be attacked. The con-
sequence would be that the people would always feel themselves per-
fectly insecure, life and property within the Protectorate unsafe,
and their condition worse than if they were under the despotic rule
of Ashantee.
Let them, therefore, have a ruler in whom they have con?dence,
and generals experienced in bush ?ghting ; let them be united, of-
fensive and defensive, to one another, under one head, whose
authority is paramount; let good, large, open roads be made con-
necting the kingdoms with one another, which would lead to the
easy movement of a large body of men; let the strength of every

kingdom be known by the head centre, who could call out at any
time what number of men he might require; let him have a good
magazine and a large supply of useful ri?es, and the people be taught
the use of them, and I guarantee that a compact, powerful, and in-
dependent Government will be formed, which would defy Ashantee
and give con?dence to the whole country.
We must now brie?y consider those countries or districts which
should combine to form the Kingdom of Fantee; and taking for
granted that Wassaw, British Ahanta, and Apollonia are trans-
ferred to Dutch rule (which, from their distances and disconnexion
with the towns in Fantee Proper, would be a source of great weak-
ness and perplexity rather than of strength), we have DENKERA,
Assm, FANTEE PROPER, WESTERN AKIM, and G00M00R. These
kingdoms occupy a coast line of nearly a hundred miles, taking into
account the various indentations; but they are extensive in the in-
terior, where they are interrupted by and bordering on the King-
dom of Ashantee. '
Denkera.-—This is the most western district, and is bounded on
the east by Assin, west by Wassaw and Ashantee, north by
Ashantee, and scuth by Fantee and a part of Wassaw. It is a
hilly country, and surrounded by large forests. The inhabitants
were formerly under the Ashantee rule; but, through the des-
potic and arbitrary treatment which they received from that po-
tentate, they claimed and received protection from the British au-
thorities on the Coast. The capital is called Denkera; but the
present king, Quakey Frame, from the late disturbances with
Ashantee, fearing that he might be secretly caught in a place so
near to his powerful enemy, made another large town—viz.,
Adjuquah—his royal residence. The population of Denkera is large,
being nearly ?fty thousand. The towns are small, containing from
a few hundred to four or ?ve thousand inhabitants, who are
in a perfect state of barbarism. Civilization has made no progress
whatever among them; the women labour in the ?elds; cultiva-
tion is limited, and only for home consumption, and consists prin-
cipally of corn and yams. The king exercises an absolute rule
over the people, assisted by his councillors, who are generally
old men. Each town is governed by a chief or a deputy from

the king. The king has absolute power over l.fe and property;
any one who disobeys his orders is secretly killed. This is known to
all the population, but none dare make it known to the British
Governor. They are secretly menaced by the Fetish man, whom
they dread; and should any one attempt to give information, his
life and those of his entire relatives will atone for it through secret
poisoning by unknown hands.
Denkera is celebrated for being rich in extensive gold-?elds.
Through it run two branches of the Boosom-Prah River—viz, the
O?n and the Prah—and by their banks the inhabitants collect a large
quantity of surface gold; but the people are lazy, and imbued with
superstitious and absurd ideas. Thus it is against the Fetish of
the country that the people should dig very deep for gold, as they
believe that that would lead to its escape; it is also against the
orders of the Fetish that any man in European dress or who can
read and write (scholars), should go to thepdiggings, for similar
reasons. The result is, that the extensive gold-fields of that
country are still undeveloped. My comrade, Dr. Davies, Whilst at
Acroful Denkera, during the late Ashantee expedition (1864), by
examining the subsoil of some of the districts, pointed out to some
of the'women who were washing for gold, certain places where gold
was to be found. They tried them, and after washing, found a large
quantity of gold-dust. The abundant gold-?elds of Denkera require
to be developed. \
Assin.-—Assin is situated on the east of Denkera, and was for-
merly a powerful province of Ashantee; it is bounded on the north
by Ashantee, south by Fantee, west by Denkera, and east by Akim.
There are two political heads or kings in Assin—viz., the King of
Assin, who resides in Assin Yancoomassie; and the King of Mansue.
The former is the superior king, and a young man who has but re-
cently ascended the throne. The of?ce of a king in these parts
consists in sitting down all day on a large stool, surrounded by his
chiefs and head men, who sing or speak words of praise to his
ears and drink his rum; he settles palaver, ?nes the people heavily,
and runs away when his territory is attacked by a powerful enemy.
. Not long ago the King of Mansue, who commands the district of
the Prah, attempted to declare his independence and to have nothing

to do with the young king at Yancoomassie. His people advised
him to buy plenty of rum, and treat his chiefs, and thus show
that he was equally as great a chief as the other. He did so, and
afterwards disobeyed the orders of the lawfully-constituted king,
who could not enforce them. The question was, however, referred
to the Governor of the Coast for settlement, and the King of
Mansue again became a vassal.
Assin is by no means a well populated country. It consists of
towns on the highway to Ashantee, with a few scattered hamlets
from the main road. The country is covered by thick impenetrable
forest; there are a few low hills here and there, but no mountains ;
the soil in most parts is very fertile, and could grow any quantity
of ground-nut, Indian corn, arrowroot, 820., but it is only partially
worked. A small quantity of gold exists in Assin, but there are, to
my knowledge, no gold mines, except, perhaps, towards the
borders of Denkera. The people are generally poor, their habita-
tions consisting of low, miserable mud-walled huts, which cost but a
tri?e in building. The women make a large quantity of croupie
or Touloocoona oil, principally for home consumption; a small
quantity is brought down to the markets on the Coast for sale.
The inhabitants are in utter barbarism and uneducated. In
former years there was a school at Mansue, and a large one at
Tabiesamang, which is a little village near Mansue in a divergent
line from the road to Essicoomah and Ajimacoo. When I visited.
these places in 1864 (25th January) the school-house was still stand-
ing, but it was now the residence of the king. It was an oblong
building, raised a few feet from the ground and ?oored, containing
four large bedrooms and two parlours ; the ceiling was also ?oored
and painted green; this useful establishment in Assin, as well as
many others, were long ago abandoned, and the people left in gross
ignorance and idolatry. The inhabitants respect the British rule,
in so far as it gives them protection.
Fantee—Under this designation I shall include all those countries
extending from Elmina, or the Sweet River, to Mumford, including
Cape Coast, Anamaboe, Abrah or Abahcrampah, Dunquah,
Dominassie, Mankasin and Ajimacoo, all which, and many other
towns, are governed by separate kings and chiefs. This is the most

FANTEE PROPER. 131
confused part of the Gold Coast as regards political existence ; the
close proximity to the guns of the forts, and the keener eyes with
which the domestic affairs of these states are watched by the Protect-
ing Government, enable any man who can plant a village, make a
stool, and sit himself on it, to call himself a king, without his claim
being called in question by the surrounding kings, or even disputed.
In every small croom or village there is a king, although his territory
does not extend beyond a mile round his capital; this is absurd in
the extreme, but the habit exists, and will remain so, unless a
radical change is made in the administrative department, or a power-
ful neighbouring chief, such as Ashantee, overruns the country and
puts it down. But Fantee is the most civilized portion of the
western district of the Gold Coast. Here the labours of the Wesleyan
missionaries are bearing fruit ; at Cape Coast are the head-quarters
of the mission, and they have sub-central stations in Anamaboe and
Dominassie. The children under instruction receive rudimentary
education in the day-schools, but they possess no colleges or large
central educational establishment. At Cape Coast and Anamaboe
there are a few substantial buildings, some of which are built of mud
called swish, and others of native-made bricks or stones. But these
towns are all devoid of properly laid streets; the small huts are
actually jumbled up together in a very confused manner; most,
especially at Cape Coast, are without roo?ng, excepting a plaster of
mud, presenting a barbarous and un?nished appearance, especially
to strangers. In Fantee about one out of every one hundred in-
habitants could read and write. Some of the natives dress in
European costume, especially those who are educated and'those in
a high state of social existence, but ninety-nine in a hundred wear
their native dress. The kings and chiefs, with the exception of
John Aggery, late king of Cape Coast, dress in the same fashion.
Gold is found in small quantities below the surface soil, which is
washed by the women; the men consider it infra dig. to be thus
occupied, although a large number are to be seen during the whole
of the day sitting lazily about under the cool shade of a tree.
Domestic slavery exists in all its various forms, even within ?fty
yards of the forti?cations ; men, women, and children are sold
within a few yards of the Governor's residence. The women are

most laborious; they till the ground, and bring to the market their
produce, which they exchange either for gold or silver. Yams,
plantains, cassada, Indian corn, and a large quantity of vegetables
are grown, principally in towns a few miles from the sea-coast. There
is nothing of native growth exported from this fertile and extensive
country. Any quantity of Indian corn might be grown in the
interior, but the system of domestic slavery and plurality of wives
enervates the energies of the male inhabitants; and, instead of thou-
sands of bushels produced yearly for exportation, there is scarcely
sufficient for home consumption.
The currency of Fantee is principally gold-dust and silver; but in
the towns leeward of Cape Coast, where a small quantity of palm-
oil is produced, cowry shells are also current. Gold, palm-oil,
monkey skins, and ivory, are the only articles of export from this
district. Gold and ivory are brought down from Ashantee; monkey
skins from the interior towns, such as Assiu and Akim ; and palm-
oil from the countries below Anamaboc—viz., Salt Pond, Assafa,
Ahkrah, Mumford, &c., and the towns in their immediate interior.
There are only a very few educated natives employed in the various
branches of the Government; the supply is generally from Sierra
Leone, and, consequently, there is a great want of political life amongst
them. An encouragement in this direction is very necessary. The
religion of a vast majority of the people is rank Fetishism ; among
the lower class it is much feared, as its priests go clandestiner to
work to injure those who dare to disregard its orders. Mankasin
in former years was a famous Fetish town for all the Fantees, and
exercised considerable control over the government of the country;
but, through the exertions of the Government, aided by the educated
inhabitants, it has now no in?uence.
Western Akim.——This is a woody forest country, situated on the
north-eastern borders of Ashantce and east of Assin; the inhabitants
were, till lately, under the King of Ashantee. Their late King, Ajeman
by name, was a brave old man, resolute and powerful, but governed
with moderation and good judgment, and was much liked by his
people. Western Akim is separated from Ashantee by the Quaho
Mountains, which look down upon his capital, Ojedam, which is
large and surrounded by a thick forest. The king formerly swore

allegiance to the Danish Government, and, when their Territory was
sold to the English, he also took the oath of allegiance to the
British rule. Ajeman always regarded Accra as his head-quarters,
but as his Territory is one of the high roads of Ashantee t0 the king-
dom of Fantee, and within its prescribed limit, it must be incor-
porated with it.
Ajeman did not favour missionary operations in his dominions,
so that his people are very ignorant. No export is obtained from
the country. The people are few, but very brave.
Gammon—Situated on the east of Fantee and south of Akim is
the large district of Goomoor, which has a very large population.
The towns are all surrounded by~ dense impenetrable forest, except
the seaport towns, the chief of which are Mumford and Tantum, or
Tantumquady. The pe0ple still maintain their barbarous practices,
and are uneducated. They plant a large quantity of Indian corn
and plantains, which form their principal articles of food.
Having examined the political state of the countries in the
Western District of the Protectorate, let us now consider the
practicability or impracticability of forming a powerful native self-
supporting government.
The Western District of the Gold Coast is composed of several dis-
tinct kingdoms, not united by any common bond. They regard the
Governor of the Coast as a supreme head and as a referee in all their
external and internal quarrels. They are within easy reach of a most
powerful and hostile nation, the Ashantee, which has constantly taken
advantage of their disunited and uncombined condition to overrun
the country and cut them up in detail. In former years they
looked to British help, and received it in time of need, and the
Ashantees were very much afraid of British power and in?uence;
but now the Governors are on no account to order troops to the
interior, but are only to defend the coast towns if attacked; and
the kings and chiefs are not to be encouraged to lean on British
help. The sending of troops in dense forests where no enemy is to
be found has proved not only fatal to life, but expensive in the
extreme to the Home Government, without any advantage being
derived from it; the kings, therefore, have been told to ?ght their
own battles. In the present political state of the country no king is

safe in his capital. Should Assin be the point of attack, the King of
Ashantee (such have always been his tactics) will send a large corps
of observation on the borders of Akim and Denkera. Assin would
be overrun, and neither the Kings of Denkera, Fantee, Akim, or
Goomoor would stir from their kingdoms to assist the Assins, if not
impelled to it by the British Government; and even then the people,
especially those on the frontiers, not being under any military
organization, would remain to defend their own ?resides; and
before the people at Cape Coast, Anamaboe, and Fantee could move
to the interior, the Ashantees would have done their work in Assin.
But the Assins, on the mere report of an Ashantee invasion,
would not remain for a second in their towns or croons, but would
fall back on the sea-coast towns for support. After invading Assin
the corps of observation over Akim would descend to Akim and
join the Assin division, and they would clear everything before
them; for the whole of the interior countries would fall on the
sea-coast towns, and the Ashantees would become masters of the
important interior towns. There are no roads between any of the
various kingdoms, so that on an attack the people have to move in
Indian ?le, and, consequently, are unable to withstand a body of men
well disciplined and accustomed to bush ?ghting. The result of
this is that every invasion made by the King of Ashantee on the
Fantee or Protected Territories, has always produced and always
will produce a general panic all over the country.
Cape Coast Town is well guarded against any attacks of a native
tribe, being well commanded and protected by excellent forts, which
look down on all the hills, valleys, and avenues to the town; and no
Ashantee army, however numerous, will ever attempt to measure
the effects of their brass, lead, and iron slugs, their pebbles from
the rivers, ?red from rusty, unserviceable Dane guns, with the rockets,
shells, canister, round balls, and lead bullets of a well-disciplined
European troop. The Ashantees will therefore always keep on the
interior, and will carry on a guerilla warfare against their traditionary
enemy.
The Fantees, or the Western portion of the Protected Territory,
have no chief to look upon as their head, none whom they can
regard and obey as their superior chief; they have therefore no

RADICAL REFORMS nncnss'mv. 135
organization and no discipline, and can never, in their present confused
state, withstand the active bravery of their powerful neighbours; and
if left exactly as they are to ?ght their own battles, it would
be almost better—0r, at all events, it would lead to great saving
of life and property—were they to become at once vassals to the
King of Ashantee. Ninety-nine in a hundred of the population are
still in a barbarous condition, without education or the means of
educating their children. There are in the countries large gold
mines which are not developed and worked; and no article of com-
mercial importance is grown and exported, except a small quantity of
palm-oil. The languge, which is Fantee, with the prevalence of the
Otyi dialect, is unwritten, and the people do not communicate with
one another in it.
From the foregoing, it is evident that from the unsatisfactory
political state of the Western District of the Gold Coast, it cannot,
at present, be left to govern itself; that radical reforms are impera-
tively necessary before this can be done with safety to the population;
that no sooner would the British Government be Withdrawn, than
intestine warfare would spring up, resulting in fearful and barbaric
massacre and bloodshed, and every man's hand would be against his
, neighbour. Before the country should be given up to self-govern-
ment, a responsible king, of education and experience, must be
crowned, assisted, acknowledged and supported by the British
authority, both on the Coast and in Downing-street; and a British
Consular Agency should be formed, and the Consul appointed be a
man who would aid and advise the native Government, and guarantee
it against European invasion.

CHAPTER XI.
SELF-GOVERNMENT OF THE GOLD COAST—REPUBLIC OF
ACCRA.
THE territory to be included within this Republic should extend
from Winnebah to the River Volta. Awoonah, at present, should
be no part of it, as it would only be a point of weakness t0 the
young Republic. The constitution of the several states in it, the»
feelings of the inhabitants, the physical geography of the country,
as well as the peculiar habits and customs of the people, lead me to
believe that no form of government would be so suited to their
wants and requirements as the republican form. Within this territory,
which extends over a coast line of about a hundred miles, and to a
very great distance into the interior, are included Eas'rnan Anna,
WINNEBAH, ACCRA PROPER, ADANGME, AQUAPIM, CROBBOE,
AQUAMBOO, CREEPEE, Aneo'rnun, containing a population of at
least 200,000 souls. The capital of all these places, or, more properly,
the principal sea-port town, is James Town, commonly called English
Accra; it is the picnic spot of Western Africa. The educated
population are always jolly; life is made a source of perpetual en-
j oyment. In no part of the Coast is the caste distinction of colour
so trampled under foot as at this place. Many of the natives are
properly educated, and would countenance no tampering with their
privileges 'as a man and a brother.' Some attempts were re--
cently made to originate here that party Americanized feeling
which existed on other parts of the Coast; but the originators were
scouted and almost ' cut ' by every one; and in a place like Accra,
this is not a tri?e, as it destroys their social well-being. The old
European inhabitants are identical with the educated natives in in-
terest and social habits, and are ready to ?ght their battles against
any invidious attacks which new comers in their superior wisdom.
(rather ignorance) might think ?t to make. There is always a

happy union and agreement between the Europeans and natives—
the counsel of the latter is sought after in important matters. There
is not that display of empty boasted dignity which is only inherited
whilst on the West Coast of Africa; nor the existence of private
pique, which in other parts disorganizes the social happiness of every
class of the population. In time of pleasure all enter into it with
heart and soul, expense being of no consideration; but when time of
business commences it is all work and no play. '
James Town, Dutch Accra, and Christiansborg are within an
area of two and a-half miles, but they are governed by separate
kings. The towns contain a few large houses, but the majority of
the native huts are so completely jumbled up together that they pre-
sent a confused mass. There are no properly laid-out streets, but the
towns are intersected with crooked lanes. The men are generally
of middling size, not hard-working as a rule, except, perhaps, the
upper class. Domestic slavery exists in all its forms, and morality
is at a very low ebb. The lower class of the population is very
litigious.
If this place must ultimately be left to govern itself, a republican
form of government should be chosen. An educated native gentle-
man, of high character and good common sense, who has the welfare
of his country at heart (such, for example, as Libercht Hesse, Esq.,
of Christiansborg), should be selected by the Government as a can-
didate for the presidency, and offered for the votes of the populace
in the various districts; and, when once elected, he must be regarded
as supreme in everything, and the natural referee in all their
quarrels and differences. He should be assisted by counsellors
chosen by the people as their representatives. The term of of?ce
of the president should not be less than eight years, and he should
be eligible for re-election.
The absurd custom of having kings in every petty town should
be, as speedily as possible, abolished. They should be called by
other names than that of kings, and in case of their death the
' stool' should be done away with. The president for the time
being should be the recognized constitutional king. A good strong
government would thus be formed, which would receive the assist-
ance of the European residents. If a proper custom-house is esta-

blished a large revenue will be collected. There should be one at
Prampram and-another at Addah, and every effort should be made
to develop the vast resources of the country.
Let us now consider, seriatim, the various countries which should
enter into the formation of the Republic of Accra, viz. :—
Easte1-nAl-z'm.—Like the "'estern Akim with the Danes during their
occupation, the Eastern swore allegiance to the Danish Government,
ever since its escape from the despotic rule of the King of Ashantee.
It has always regarded Accra as its head-quarters. It is bounded
on the east by Aquapim, west by Western Akim, south by Goomoor,
and north by Ashantee. Under the Danish sway, the King of Akim
ruled with absolute despotism and did exactly as he pleased. De-
capitation and con?scation of the property of the wealthy were
very frequent, and for very slight misdemeanours; even now the
same practices are carried on by the king, although not so pub-
licly as before. Life and property are unsafe in the rapacious hands
of the kings and chiefs. Under the most ludicrous pretences heavy
?nes are in?icted, for trivial offences, amounting only to indiscretion
on the part of the offender ; and in such cases, sometimes in?uential
men have been beheaded, and their property con?scated for the
bene?t of the kings and chiefs.
The inhabitants of Eastern Akim are very brave; they are the
most warlike people in the whole Protectorate, and single-handed
they have fought successfully against the Ashantee power when it
was in its greatest strength and glory. The country is surrounded
by thick, impenetrable forest; agriculture forms but a very small
portion of their labour; their principal occupation is gold-digging.
They, however, plant a small quantity of articles for provision for
home consumption, but their chief supply is from Goomoor. Akim
contains one of the largest and most extensive gold districts in all
the Gold Coast ; the mines are generally dug to the depth of
from eighteen to twenty feet in a horizontal direction, and, from a.
superstitious notion entertained by the diggers, they do not make
horizontal shafts. The soil is loose, sandy, and de?cient in tenacity,
so that 'it falls down as soon as they out under it in that manner,
without support ; ' and they believe that the Fetish, who is regarded
here as the guardian spirit of the gold, is the prime cause of this

accident, which he causes in order to put a limit to human avarice,
impelled by the auri sacrafames. Thus the gold mines are im-
perfectly worked, and immense wealth lies buried in the earth.
The people are wholly uneducated; they speak the Otyi dialect
of the Fantee language; some of them understand the Ga or Accra
language. The king is very wealthy, which, together with his des-
potism, inspires fear and implicit obedience. The currency of the
country is gold-dust; any large nugget found is absolutely and in-
defeasibly the property of the king; this rule holds good in every
part of the Gold Coast.
Winnebah—The district of Winnebah has a coast line of nearly
forty miles, extending from long. 25 to 52 west; it comprises an
extent of country rich and fertile, which, in its general features, is
?at and very much cultivated. The principal town is Winnebah,
which is situated near the river Iyensu. ' The inhabitants are great
agriculturists; industrious and hard-working, and cultivate planta-
tions of ground-nut, palm-oil, plantain, banana, and various other
articles. They are remarkable for supplying the Coast with a large
quantity of native-made canoes ; even the inhabitants of the Bight
of Benin are always in quest of them. They trade in palm-oil,
maize, and gold-dust.
The inhabitants are partially educated. The \Vesleyans have
established schools in some of the towns, where English is taught ;
but the native language is disregarded. Political life is in a. very
low state; the people acknowledge a king, who resides within a
stonesthrow of the Civil Commandant. He is a man of education, of
good common sense, and, unlike the host of other kings in this
Protectorate, not only respects the Sabbath, but also makes his people
respect it. He is civilized in manners and habits, and his resi-
dence is got up in European style. But King Henry Aquah's in-
?uence is very limited, and does not extend to all the districts of
Winnebah, which, following the patriarchal mode of government,
has kings in every petty town.
The forest of Winnebah contains large durable'and valuable woods,
which would turn out excellent timber. Among the number may
be mentioned the Doom or Edoom, the Duntah, the mahogany, and
the African cedar. In the interior the district is rich, extensive, and

fairly populated; being surrounded by friendly tribes, the inhabi-
tants are generally free from those political panics which have from
time to time convulsed the various towns and districts in other parts
of the Protectorate. They are, for the most part, peaceablc in their
habits and respectful to strangers. Winnebah is about forty miles from
James Town, Accra. The language is Fantee, but a vast majority
of the population also speak the Accra or Ga language.
Aquapim.—This is a mountainous country, situated on the north
and north-west of Accra, and contains a small, but active, warlike,
and industrious people. The principal town is Acropong, where
exists a large establishment of the German missionaries. The young
generation are educated both in English and in their native tongue ;
they are also taught the art of agriculture. Politically, they dread
their king, but this despotic in?uence is greatlymodi?ed by the peace-
able and happy teaching of the missionaries. Palm-oil, gold-dust,
and coffee form the principal exports from Aquapim. The country
is partially sheltered from the inroads of the Ashantee potentate by
the powerful kingdom of Akim. The inhabitants are all farmers.
The language is Otyi, but Go. is also spoken.
Accra Propcr.—-This is the metropolis of the eastern district of
the Gold Coast, and comprises James Town, or English Accra;
Dutch Accra; and Danish Accra, or Christiansborg. The ?rst two
are united to one another, forming one town; the latter is
situated about a mile and a-half to leeward of these. Each town
has its own king, Cudjoe in the ?rst place, Taccie in the second,
and Dawoonah in the third ; but the King of Dutch Town is con-
sidered the head from the circumstance that the head Fetish man re-
sides in it, and from the extensive in?uence of the late king. With
a very few exceptions, the people are by no means an industrious,
hard-working population. A few of the merchants have large
coffee plantations at some distance from the town, but the majority
of the men lounge lazily about all day in the town, doing nothing.
Education in the English town is favourably progressing. The Wes-
leyans in James Town and the Basle missionaries in Christiansborg
are doing good service to the rising generation. Some of the inhabi-
tants have a very superior education,with a fair knowledge of law and
government. Accra extends a short distance into the interior, but

is limited by the Aquapim mountains. The country is ?at and dry,
and towards the interior is dotted with a few plantations of coffee
and other articles of domestic importance. Its capability is very
limited so far as it has been developed; in fact, there is nothing ex—
ported from the district of Accra Proper, but all its exportable
articles are derived from the interior. The spoken language is Ga.
Adangme—This district is situated on the east of Accra, andextends
from it to the River Volta. The country is generally ?at, but con-
tains several abrupt hills, such as the Shai Mountains, Ningo Grand,
and other small hills. The inhabitants are closely related to the
Awoonahs, who are from the same national stock, speak the
same language, and resemble each other in manners and customs.
They are generally tall, ?ne, athletic men, who trade considerably
in palm-oil, which they buy from the interior. The soil is admir-
ably adapted for planting yams and ground-nut. The ?nest speci-
men of yams which I have met with on the whole Coast was in
Adangme ; it weighed thirty pounds, but the country had produced
larger specimens. The people are still in a most degraded and
savage state, and imbued with superstitious Fetishism. The principal
towns are Prampram, Ningo, and Addah, in which mercantile fac-
tories are established for buying oil. In the last place there is an
old dilapidated fort which was built by the Danes when slavery was
being carried on in this Coast, but it is now in complete ruins.
The inhabitants are no agriculturists; the women plant a small
quantity of articles for domestic consumption, the men occupy their
time principally. in trading. There are no missionary establish-
ments among them, as the general working of the Basle Society has
not as yet been extended to them. Politically they would accept
any liberal government given them, and even now they consider
themselves under the government of Accra. They speak the
Adangme dialect of the Awoonah language, but they understand and
speak Ga equally as well.
Crobboe.-Crobboe is the richest district of this portion of the
Protected Territory of the Gold Coast, and is the place from which
the largest quantity of palm-oil is obtained. It is about forty
miles from the sea-coast, and consists of an extensive plain covered
with palm-trees. It is the largest palm plantation I have seen, and

for several miles one could walk in the shady groves of these,
queens of the forest. The inhabitants are very industrious, and
labour hard in the manufacture of the oil. The rising generation
are more or less educated. The Basle missionaries have laboured
amongst them for some time, and have taught them not only to read
and write, but also agricultural pursuits. The people are governed
by two kings—viz., Ologo Patoo and Odonko Assu. The latter is
well-disposed, supports the missionaries, and receives them as his
counsellors; the former is very treacherous, and not to be relied upon.
The currency of the country is cowry-shells; they are used for buy-
ing oil. A rich man has a house full of them, which are generally
buried in the earth. The inhabitants are not very warlike; but when
attacked they ascend a natural fortress—the Crobboe Mountain—
(which is an abrupt volcanic hill) and defy the approach of even a
regular army. It has been well designated the African Gibraltar.
The dress of the men partakes of the character of those in the
Gold Coast generally; but the females go about in all but perfect
nudity. The Crobboe girls are known for their nakedness, but they
are generally well formed. The commercial port of Crobboe is
Kpong, which is on the banks of the river Volta, and was once a
Government station. They speak the Adangme and Ga languages.
Aquamboo.—A small country situated beyond the range of hills
known as the Aquamboo Mountains is the district of the same
name. The inhabitants are few, but very brave. They are now
not regarded as within the Protectorate, having a few years ago
disobeyed the commands of the British Government, At present
they are in league with the enemies of the Coast towns, and even
seek an opportunity of combining against them. They speak Ga
and Adangme.
A1-gotime.—This is a small trans-Volta tribe, who are considered
brave and energetic by the tribes around. The country has some
resemblance to that of Crobboe. The towns and villages are
partly concealed by cocoa-nut trees. These people are Ga colonists,
who emigrated from the neighbourhood of Ningo, Shai, and Addah,
and settled there some 80 or 100 years ago. Through Mlam?
they have intercourse with the Coast towns, especially Ningo. They
possess no political connexion with the people of Little Popo and

Saigodshi, who years ago migrated from the Shai and Ga. 'A
curious feature of their towns are the town-halls, if we may so call
them, which are common shady street trees, whose limbs are propped
up by wood, and drawn like vines to form a spacious shed in the midst
of the market-places.' The people are said to be very industrious and
respectable. The country is well supplied with water. There are
good houses, and much industry is observable. In every yard there
are cotton spinners, weavers, and dyers. The language is Adangme;
but being so much blended in manners, customs, and intermarriage
with their neighbours of the Ewe language, that language is becom-
ing more predominant among the younger generation. Argotime is
situated between Creepee and Awoonah, 0n the left bank of the
liver Volta.
Creepee.~—This is a large, well-cultivated, and extensive country
on the banks of the Volta and interior of Argotime. The Basle
missionaries have stations here. It supplies the large quantity of
cotton shipped from Accra and Awoonah. The inhabitants are
amongst the most hardworking people on the Gold Coast. The
country is in close proximity with Dahomy on the one hand, and
Ashantee on the other. The Ewe language is spoken.
The countries composing the Eastern District, which can with
pro?t be included within the Republic of Accra, are much more
united than those in the Western; they have always regarded Accra
as their head-quarters, and would gladly form with it any combina-
tion. Their only enemies are the Ashantees, who being at a great
distance from them would think twice before they attempted to ever-
run the country; in fact, since the engagement in the plains of
Dooduah, when Major Chisholm commanded the combined forces of
Fantee and Accra, and through the use of the Congreve rockets,
the Ashantees were thoroughly defeated and driven from the ?eld,
they (the Ashantees) have always regarded the Accras as a brave,
dashing, impetuous, and energetic people, who are not to be
trifled with; consequently their policy has always been to keep
them as friends, so that they would not form any hostile combination
with the Fantees against them. But since the late war between
Awoonah and Accra—where a few hundred of the former routed,
drove, and pursued nearly ten thousand of the latter, who sked-

dadled helter-skelter from the battle-?eld, disgracefully throwing
into the bush their guns, ammunition, and cloth, leaving the heavy
artillery lent to them by the British Government in the ?eld, until
their king, Cudjoe, after fruitlessly endeavouring to rally them, sat
on the howitzer, and proclaimed his willingness to allow himself to
be captured by the enemy unless his followers removed the British
gun—the Ashantees have become daring, and saw their mistake as to
the prowess of the Accras. They are now endeavouring to effect a
political combination with Awoonah, offensive and defensive. But
the Awoonahs know that they are on the sea side, leeward of the
Volta, and within very easy reach. They also know that in such
an alliance they have everything to lose and nothing whatever to
gain ; they therefore most prudently but politely declined the offer.
The only points open to an enemy on the borders of the Re-
public of Accra are Akim, Aquapim, and Aquamboo. In the two
former places the Ashantees know that they would meet with
powerful resistance in the mountain fastnesses of Akim and
Aquapim, and they will hesitate to make the attempt. The
Aquamboos are already in alliance offensive and defensive with
them, and they can easily pour hosts of their ill-clad army through
the Aquamboo mountain passes; but as soon as they enter the
plains of the Republic they will ?rst be met by a powerful tribe,
the Crobboes; and being in an open plain, a strong force can easily
be sent against them, and a second Dooduah would inevitably be
the result. it is, therefore, almost without a shadow of doubt that
the young Republic will exist without an external enemy capable of
giving her much trouble.
The Basle missionaries have completely renovated the aspect of
, the country, and the extreme savage and barbarous habits of the
people, wherever they have laboured; they have established the
literature of the language, and make the rising generation to feel
the beauty and pathos of their mother tongue when reduced to
writing; they have introduced the cultivation of new plants in the
country, and taught the people how to prepare them, some of which
are now becoming staple articles of commerce, such as coffee,
cocoa, Virginian and Kentucky tobacco; they labour continually
in the country, and many of them marry lawfully with the native

ladies, which increases their in?uence and power over the native
population; they make good, open roads into the interior, dig deep
and expensive wells (94 feet cost £600) in their stations where
water is scarce, and supply good wholesome water for their own use
and those of the inhabitants of the towns, who, consequently, highly
appreciate their e?orts for their welfare; they introduced European
horses, which, unfortunately, could not withstand the climate of the
country. Besides teaching the people the value of agricultural pur-
suits, and affording them every opportunity of realizing the value
of their produce, they teach them mechanical arts; they send out
shoemakers, tailors, wheelwrights, carpenters, and coopers, to teach
the people these useful employments, so that vast improvements are
being made by the natives; and yet I have heard the labours of
these pioneers of civilization scoffed at, and these laborious men
disrespectfully spoken of. In my opinion—and I think this is
shared by all men of sound judgment—they ought to be held up
and encouraged, not only by the European and native population of _
the country, but also by the Government, who should support and
recognise their efforts by giving employment to the best students of
the establishment. At one time the Government of Sierra Leone
was in the habit of sending to the Church and Wesleyan mis-
sionaries' schools for young men when there was a vacancy in some
of the Government departments; if such a system were now carried
out here, it would be a boon to the country.
The Republic of Accra can be made to be one of the richest
provinces in Western Africa; its resources are vast and extensive,
and require only to be developed. It presents a varied number of
exportable plants not easily found in other parts of the coast; the
soil is peculiarly fertile and rich, and could grow any articles
planted in it, rapidly and luxuriantly. It has a large river which
runs into its very interior, and which might be made use of for
bringing down the accumulated riches of the interior countries.
The principal articles of export are gold-dust, palm-oil, monkey -
skins, gum copal, and cotton.
Gold-dust.—There is only a small quantity of this valuable
article exported from Accra, which is obtained from Akin],
Aquapim, and Ashantee. Most of the tribes in the interior and

on the sea-coast regard gold as Fetish property, which if they keep
would kill them; they therefore would not on any account keep
gold-dust or even any gold coin, or touch it ; if they unwittingly do,
they immediately wipe their hands. They receive all gold coin on
pieces of paper or handkerchiefs; this is observed in Adangme and
Crobboe.
lllonker/Slcins.—At one time this was a very important importable
article on the Gold Coast. Mr. William Bruce, of Jamestown, was
the ?rst who commenced the trade, and he realized a very hand-
some amount for shipments made to England. In 1856 the black
monkey skins 'were exceedingly abundant and cheap, twenty to
twenty-?ve were sold for a dollar (4s. 6d.) After the trade had
commenced the price rose abruptly, so that in June, 1859, the
merchants were eagerly buying them at a shilling a-piece. In 1860
the price rose still higher, and a good skin could not be obtained for
less than a dollar. The black monkeys which furnish the skins are
abundant in the forest at Akim, the interior of Accra, and at
Crobboe. The natives hunt them in the months of May, June,
July, and August, when they are within range of musket-shot.
During the dry season they pass their time in the tops of lofty trees,
where they cannot be killed; but in the rains they descend to shelter
themselves among the trees and bushes from the rain. There is
scarcely any business doing now in monkey skins; the demand in
England has ceased.
Palm-oil.-—~This is the most important article of traf?c in the
eastern district. A small quantity is made in Winnebah and
Aquapim, but the largest supply is from Crobboe.
Gum Copal.—In the ?elds interior of the sea-coast towns of
Accra, in Aquapim, and in many other parts of this district, gum
copal, which is used in making varnish, is obtained in large_
quantities. Mr. William Addo was the ?rst to commence the trade,
but at present that which is exported does not produce a suf?cient
remuneration to encourage the trade. Not long ago a large
quantity was exported to England, which laid in store for nearly a
year, and, when sold, the amount realized scarcely covered the ex-
penses. The trade has greatly fallen off.
Cotton—This important article is now being abundantly shipped

from this part of the Coast. The merchants have given the impetus
to the people, who are certain that, whatever quantity they may
bring into the market, it will meet with a buyer. A large district—
Greepee—situated on the banks of the River Volta, beyond
Argotime, and between Ashantee and Dahomy, is fully under culti-
vation with cotton. The merchants have established factories there,
and have cotton-gins at work. The trade has only lately been
opened, and shiploads of cotton have been exported from the
country, and there is every hope of its further increase.
» Besides these articles, others of not less importance are gradually
making a show in the exportable list. Colfee was ?rst introduced
by the Basle missionaries, who planted a large quantity in their
station at Accrapong. At present they have in their plantation
60,000 trees, 30,000 of which are yielding fruit. Not only this,
the Christian and heathen population about their stations are fol-
lowing their examples, and have their own plantations of co?'ee.
The native merchants have also taken the initiative; Mr. Freeman
has about 30,000 trees; Messrs. Leutrot, Hesse, Briandt, Bruce,
and Dodo have all co?ee plantations more or less large.
The same missionaries have commenced the planting of Virginian
and Kentucky tobacco ; they thus supply all that is required for their
own use. Already they have sent specimens to Bremen, where it
was considered good, but required improvement in the preparation.
Besides this they are endeavouring to naturalise the Mexican cocoa
or chocolate plant in this part of the Coast. They have a few trees
growing at Accrapong which have borne very large fruit, and hopes
are entertained that it will be a complete success. The natural ad-
vancement of this country is therefore being vastly increased by
these Basle missionaries, who call themselves Gemnano-A?z'cans.
India-rubber and gutta-percha trees exist in the interior of
this district; the inhabitants (women) use it principally for repair-
ing earthenware pots. A small quantity was shipped to Bremen by
Mr. Hillginbergh, clerk to Mr. Julius Ungar, who is connected with
the German missionaries. It was in great request and remunerative,
but the mode adopted for collecting it by the natives is very
extravagant and destructive. They cut down the tree, burn one
end, and allow the gum to exude from the other; the tree is there-

fore destroyed. The mode to be adopted should be to make
?ssures on the thick bark of the trunk of the tree, and the gum
would easily ?ow out; when collected and exposed to the air, it
gradually coagulates.
The Indigo plant is abundant in the ?elds of the Eastern District, _
and the natives use it for dying their native-made clothes. Ebony
is also found in the woods of the interior, especially in a place
called Pallimah, or Adapalmah, where the trees are said to grow in
large numbers. A few sticks have been obtained on the Coast from
individuals in this district.
From considering and examining the geological structure of this
district, I am under the impression that there are extensive coal—
?elds in the interior of the country and in the kingdom of Dahomy,
and this view has been con?rmed by circumstantial evidence. When
the rainy season is very severe, and the streams of the Volta swell
up and become very rapid, large masses of coal have been known to
be brought down from the interior and left on its banks. The
last seen was at a place called Kpong, in Crobboe.
Seven years ago, whilst examining the conchology (shells) of this
part of the Coast, I was forcibly struck with their resemblance and
identity with those on the coast of Brazils. From the above
description of the plants, and also if reference be made to my ?ora
of the West Coast of Africa, it will be seen that there is great
resemblance in the botany of the two countries. The geological
structure of the two countries is almost identical. These facts
led me to the belief that when the resources of the country are much
more developed, diamonds will be found, not only in the Eastern
District, but also in the rivers and lagoons of Awoonah and
Dahomy. I made fruitless researches myself whilst stationed at
Quitah and Addah, but it is my ?rm belief that in years to come,
all things being equal, and development progressive, the diamond will
ultimately be one of the exportable articles.
The planting of ground-nut should now be encouraged, as the
soil of Accra district is in a great many places very much adapted
for it. It will bring a very large revenue to the Government, and
much cash into the country, to replace the cowry-shells, which
everyone preclaims a great nuisance. Its leaves will serve as

excellent fodder for horses, and strengthen them in?nitely better
than the common grass, which they now use.
One great circumstance which enthrals the population of this part
of the Coast is the implicit belief they have in the Fetish. We
have seen that in the Western District the people have little or no
belief in Fetish, but it is exactly the contrary here, where it is
feared and dreaded by the whole bulk of the population. They
build houses for it, sacri?ce sheep and oxen to it, consult it in all
their affairs; they dare not go to war without receiving its bene-
diction and undergoing certain forms and ceremonies ; and therefore
the mental freedom of the population is completely cowed down.
Not that the educated, nor even some of the illiterate and barbarous,
believe that a lump of clay, a feather, or a few heads, is really and
truly their god, and worship it as such; but the ?rst doctrine of
their natural religion is that there is one god, who is most high, and
everyone believes this; but the Fetish is a plurality of inferior gods,
and is regarded as the creator of man and all things in the world. It
is believed to be capable of at once killing and making alive, and to
human beings it communicates through the Fetish priest. But the
great terror felt by the followers of Fetishism is not for the 'un-
known god,' but for the secret in?uence which the Fetish priest has
over the minds of the people. Any disobedience to his command is
almost always followed by death through secret poisoning, which is
proclaimed as the act of the Fetish ; consequently, the ignorant, and
even those who know better, are terri?ed. An example of this will
not be out of place here. In 1866, when the war broke out between
Awoonah and Accra, the young King of Aquapim Was solicited to
take part in it. He consulted with the Fetish and was told not to
go. He, notwithstanding, went with his followers; he proved him-
self to be the bravest king in the whole campaign, and saved the
Accras from total destruction. He returned to his kingdom in
perfect health, with all the laurels of war; three days afterwards he
was a corpse, of course secretly poisoned; and the priest gave it
cut that 'the Fetish god had killed him because he disobeyed his
command.'
The Eastern District of the Gold Coast is composed of numerous
separate kingdoms, which are more or less unitedin habits, interest,

and nationality. Each king regards the principal Coast town as his
headquarters, any orders from which receive immediate obedience.
The Coast towns are not within easy reach of their powerful neigh-
bours, the Ashantees, who have, since the battle of Doodooah, re-
garded the Accras with a certain degree of fear, and would hesitate
to ?ght in plains with well-disciplined troops. Besides, situated in
the neighbourhood of the frontier towns are powerful tribes, who
have, years ago, fought single-handed with them with decided ad-
vantage. The mountain passes and de?les prevent a large body
of troops being marched into the country without their being cut off
in detail with the loss of many of their men. They therefore have
no great risk or fear of any molestation from an enemy in the interior.
Superior education is making gradual but certain progress in the
various districts of Accra; the language is in writing, and many of
the people could communicate in it. There are industrial establish-
ments, 8. great many carpenters, bricklayers, and other mechanics;
agricultural pursuits have taken a great hold on the minds of the
population, and new commercial plants are being introduced. In a
word, this district has vast resources, and, the country being level,
if these are developed, with a very small outlay, a railway can be
made from Christiansborg to Crobboe. A small steamer, having a
small draught of water, launched in the Volta and plying to beyond
Creepee, would certame develop and bring down the ivory, cotton,
and other products of the country.
Domestic slavery exists here, as in other parts of the Coast, with
all the enervating in?uence which it engenders; but one of the
greatest drawbacks to any improvement is the presence of petty
kings in every small town, within a stonesthrow of each other.
This should be done away with; after the death of the king the
title should be abolished and a headman appointed.
Before the place should be given up to self-government (say two
or three years before) the different kings and headmen should be
assembled at Accra, and a treaty drawn up, binding them, offensive
and defensive, with one another. The Government should intro-
duce to them one of the natives, whom it may consider to be of good
practical common sense, educated, and possessed of in?uence in the
country, as their nominee for the post of head centre, or President

of the Republic of Accra—such a man, for instance, as Libercht
Hesse, of Christiansborg. They should give in their votes, and, when
elected, he should be inaugurated in their presence, and considered as
their chief. As soon as this is done, he should be made to regulate
the internal government of the country, under the supervision of the
Governor. A yearly grant out of the revenue should be voted
him; schools and educational seminaries should be established in
every town. A militia force should be enrolled, and drilled by paid
of?cers and sergeants of West Indian regiments. In all such efforts
I am certain that he would receive the assistance, not only of the
educated natives of the place, but also of the Europeans of long
residence in the country, who would lend him the weight of their
in?uence, as well as assist in developing the resources of the
country.
It is, therefore, evident from the foregoing that there are more
advantages in the Eastern District than the Western for forming a
good, useful, native self-government, which would ultimately be
pro?table to the British Government and the native population;
but that there are vast rooms for improvement in the various
branches. That if the kings be left as they are to govern themselves,
the base being rotten, the whole fabric will, within a very short time,
tumble to the ground. Confusion, massacre, and bloodshed would
be the inevitable result. That before the people be given up to govern
themselves a new order of things must be established, and an entirely
new government formed, under the auspices of the British Govern-
ment, supported by all the kings of the districts; and the British
Consul of the Gold Coast should always be ready to advise them
in political matters, and preserve the country from foreign invasion.

CHAPTER XII.
SELF-GOVERNMENT OF LAGOS AND ITS INTERIOR COUNTRIES.
KINGDOM OF THE AKUS.
THE Committee of the House of Commons, in their report, state
that 'the annexation of Lagos was a strong measure, of which not
only the wisdom may be questioned, but the alleged justi?cation
also—viz., the incapacity and faithlessness of a king, who was ?rst
set up by the English against a very doubtful usurper, and whose
powerlessness over his subjects was much caused by their inter-
ference. The wisdom of the act may be tested by the consideration
that, had we refrained from assuming the government, we need not
have been complicated in the Egba Wars, nor in the perplexity of
having to recognise at the same time that we prohibit, slavery
within our own territory.'
Among the questions put to witnesses examined, and their
answers, we ?nd the following :—
To William Wylde, Esq., Superintendent of the Slave-trade
Department of the Foreign-of?ce, referring to the annexation of
Lagos, we ?nd the following reply :—
Answer. The annexation was because we found that, notwith-
standing all the in?uence we possessed there by having a Consul,
the traf?c in slaves, although it was watched closely around Lagos,
was carried on up and down the lagoon just the same as it was be-
fore. Wars were going on, depopulating the country, and where
there had been valuable trade, it was at a standstill; and we sent
our ships with a view to put a stop entirely to the slave-trade all
through the lagoons, for the purpose of using our in?uence on the
surrounding countries, and compelling them, if possible, to keep the
peace, so as thereby very considerably to augment legitimate trade
there. If you suppress the slave-trade, you must supply its place by en- '
couraging legitimate trade, or they will take up the ?rst opportunity

PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE AND LAGOS. 153
they can of reverting again to the slave-trade. We ?nd that where
we put a stop to the slave-trade, and a legitimate trade is de-
veloped, the slave-trade will not break out again, because there are
so many parties that get interested in the legitimate trade, that if
they ?nd the chiefs or any parties in the neighbourhood are
encouraging the slave-trade they tell of it.
Q. But there is a paper laid on the table of the House of
Commons—a paper from the Secretary of State in the Queen's
name: 'You will carefully explain to Docemo the motives which
have induced Her Majesty's Government to take this step. You
will inform him that Her Majesty's Government are not actuated
by any dissatisfaction with his conduct, but that, on the contrary,
they have every wish to deal with him in a. liberal and friendly
spirit, and that their object in taking this step is to secure for ever
the free population of Lagos from the slave-traders and kidnappers
who formerly oppressed them; to protect and develop the im-
portant trade of which that town is a seat; and to exercise an
in?uence on the surrounding tribes, which may, it is hoped, be per-
manently bene?cial to the African race.' Now, does Lord John
Russell there in the slightest degree charge King Docemo with
having connived at the slave-trade?
A. No ; and he never did. I am not aware that there had been
any charge against him.
Q. Other witnesses before the Committee have made statements
that Docemo had broken the treaty. Are the Committee to under-
stand your opinion to be that these statements of Lord John
Russell's contained the real reasons, and that Docemo had never
broken the treaty ".1
A. He most certainly had never broken the treaty, but he had not
the power of preventing his subjects and people living in Lagos
from doing so. They were as much engaged in the slave-trade as
before, though indirectly. Slaves were even taken out of Lagos
and sent up the lagoons and sold at Whydah.
David Chinery, Esq., Managing Director of the London and
African Trading Company, gave the following evidence.
Referring to the bombardment of Porto Novo, he was asked :—
Q. Was it your brother's opinion, and is it your opinion, that

there was the same injustice in what was done by the English there
as in the assumption of Docemo's Government?
A. I think it was a most glaring piece of injustice and cruelty.
Q. What was the ground on which it was justi?ed '1'
A. It was upon a point of etiquette only. Mr. Consul Foote
went up in the gunboat, accompanied by the troops, and after
lowering his anchor, he sent to the King to say that he had come for
the purpose of getting him to sign a treaty, and that he must go off
to him on board the steamer. The King received his messenger
very politely, but told him that he feared that the Consul had for-
gotten himself, and that the King of Porto Novo was a man of as
much importance in Porto Novo as the Queen of England was in
England, and demanded a corresponding amount of respect; and
he thought that if the Consul required him to sign a treaty, that he
should take the treaty to his house. To that the Consul replied
that he thought that the dignity of his position there demanded
that he should not stoop so low to the King of Porto Novo, but
that the King should go off and sign the treaty on board the steamer;
and, taking that view of the case, he gave him a given hour to con-
sider it, and if he failed by that hour, the town would be blown up
at all hazards. The King did not do so, and the town was at once
?red on without further to-do ; some 600 or 700 human beings
were sacri?ced by our gunboats. The town was burnt down, and
the trade was destroyed for an immense time; all upon a point
which I consider absurd and ridiculous, and a lasting disgrace to us.
Q. Has the nature of your imports changed of late, on account
of a more civilized demand there for cloth and other things, so as to
lead you to suppose that the civilization of the interior was im-
proving 2
A. Yes. The last advice from my brother as to our taking
Badagry, writing from January, 1864, says, as to Okeodam, which
is a very important place, that he had just returned from there, and
that trade bids fair to increase in all the towns, not even excepting
Abeokuta. He says: 'I have taken a large piece of ground to
build stores on, and to begin to trade, and it is to be hoped that
there will be no Government o?icial sent there to imperil our interest.'
Q. Are you aware that in 1860, Consul Brand, writing to Lord


## p. 155 (#179) ############################################

EVIDENCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 155
John Russell, described the state of things in Lagos in this way:
' Lagos at present may be said to have no government; there is no
effective protection to property, and no mode of enforcing the pay-
ment of debts.' He goes on to say that the small vessel, the
'Brune,' was their only protection; that whatever government
did exist was carried on by the British Consul; that King Docemo
was a mere puppet, who was quite unable to preserve law and order.
Do you differ from that statement?
A. I should, myself, certainly differ from that statement, from
my own experience; things must have been vastly changed since I
was there with Consul Campbell, not two years previously.
Q. Mr. CHICHEerR FORTESCUE: I ?nd in 1861 that Lord
John Russell wrote to Consul Foote in these words: ' Her Majesty's
Government would be most unwilling that the establishment of
British sovereignty at Lagos should be attended with any injustice
to Docemo, the present chief of the island; but they conceive that
as his tenure of the island, in point of fact, depends entirely upon
the continuance of the protection which has been afforded to him
and his predecessor by the British naval authorities, since the ex-
pulsion of Kosoko, no injustice will be in?icted upon him by chang-
ing his anomalous protectorate into an avowed occupation, pro-
vided his material interests are secured.' Do you state to the Com-
mittee that you take an entirely different view of Docemo's position
'from that?
A. I do.
Q. You think that he was bond-?de governor of the country, and
able to maintain himself against the wars of his neighbours without
our protection?
A. From my experience, I must say yes, decidedly ; from all the
information I have ever had from my brother and on the spot, and
very recently too. I think the safety of Lagos, or its inhabitants,
or the trade, would be as good under Docemo, with an English
consul, as it is now. -
Q. You think that if we were to withdraw to-morrow, Docemo
would be able to make Lagos a safe place for trade?
A. I think that if we continued our consulship at Lagos, it
would be so; and for my part, I should prefer my interests in

the trade to be subject to a consular agent rather than a colonial
government.
On the subject of the decline of trade by native wars, he replied:—
Q. At all events you would admit the native wars to be in a
great degree the cause?
' A. Certainly. When Consul Taylor went to Abeokuta he was
told by the king himself that the English people ?rst sent a consul
to Lagos, and then, after the consul had been there a little time,
they came and took the place away from them; and he said ' We
cannot let a consul come here, because if he does you will do so
again.' The consequence was that he was sent home without being
allowed to be treated with common courtesy, or being received for
even a day.
Q. I understood you to say that you thought that the presence
of the Government of?cials was an obstruction to the trade at Lagos?
A. Yes.
Q. I ask whether that might be avoided by a different conduct
on the part of the authorities '4'
A. Partially so. If it had remained a consulate we should not
have had that misunderstanding.
Q. You say that the Government has not had anything to do
with the Abeokutas ; with what tribes have we had misunderstand-
ing since 1860, which has hindered trade?
A. I do not know with what other tribes we have had amisunder-
standing, but I can speak for Badagry, Palma, and Porto Novo ; it
is a fact that our having taken Lagos at once depressed trade to a
great extent, and it caused a general ill-?aeling at all qf these places,
a feeling Qf distrust and almost revolt.
In the evidence of James Aspinall Tobin, Esq., Director of the
Company of African Merchants, we ?nd the following :—
Q. Do you think a British merchant would rather have a consul
than a government to deal with.
A. I think so; but I have not had experience of Lagos. If it
were asked me whether I would at those places where there are not
English settlements at this moment rather have commercial treaties,
with a consul to visit them from time to time, than an English set-
tlement, I should say I would rather have commercial treaties with

a consul. At a settlement custom dues must be heavier, and that
must drive trade to the nearest free port.
Q. Mr. OHICHESTER FORTESCUE: Are you speaking with re-
ference to the oil rivers?
A. The oil rivers and other places.
Q. CHAIRMAN: Take Bonny ; do you think that King Pepel is
more likely to maintain peace there and to promote commerce than
an English governor placed there?
A. I should be very sorry to see any English governor placed
there.
In the evidence of Captain R. F. Burton, late British Consul in
the Bight of Biafra, we ?nd the following :—
Q. Do you think that, with our present purpose in view—namely,
the suppression of the slave-trade, it is necessary for us to hold the
four posts of Badagry, Lagos, Palma, and Leckie?
A. I believe that a consul there with the crusiers would do, at
Lagos, for instance, as much as our present settlement.
Q. In saying that you think a consul would be suf?cient, do you
imply that the Government establishment might be dispensed with,
both civil and military?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you think, then, that we might dispense with all the civil
and military establishments on that Coast?
A. At Lagos I am of opinion that you might.
Upon the above and other evidence, the Committee in, their re-
commendations, states that 'Lagos will require an English com-
mandant until the native rule can be re-established, when he would
resume the of?ce of consul, or rather, con?ne himself to that o?ice,
which he now incongruously holds with the Government of Lagos,
as Consul of Benin.
' That Houssa police should suf?ce for all military purposes.
'Nothing but the most necessary establishments should be re-
tained or put in order on the island itself, trusting to the squadron
preventing any slave export reviving from the shore.
' The assumption of territory round Lagos, while domestic slavery
continues under our legal prohibition but practical recognition,
seems most undesirable ; nor is it possible at once to abolish slavery.

Possibly English commerce, with less of Governmental interference,
may gradually effectually eradicate the custom.'
From the foregoing evidence it will be supposed by the casual
reader that the existence of British rule was a curse to this part of
the Coast; that the country was in?nitely superior, commerce
much more advanced, and life and property safer in the hands of
the superseded native government than under the sovereignty of
Britain. But viewing the growing civilization of Lagos and its
suburbs, the immense and progressive improvement going on, the
march of intellectual development among the mass of the population,
the increase of commerce both in imports and exports, the sanitary
improvements everywhere observed, and the imitation of the civilized
mode of government among surrounding potentates, we must un-
hesitatingly state that it was the greatest blessing that could have
happened to Lagos and the whole of the Yoruba or Aku tribe, that
such a responsible, civilized, and powerful government should have
at that opportune moment commenced her regeneration.
I do not at all by this intend to justify the means adopted, but,
looking to the results achieved, we must forget the past and hail
what has been so instrumental for the country's good. Lagos is,
therefore, a star from which must radiate the refulgent rays of
civilization into the interior of the Yoruba or Aka Country, and
every effort must be made, especially by the native inhabitants, to
support the hands of the Government in their work of regeneration.
It should have been expected that the assumption of the territory
would have, at ?rst, led to internal rows and distrust on the part of
the interior population, who knew nothing of British arms and power,
and after this storm which might have led to destruction of trade,
and even to open hostility, with all its concomitant woes, there
would be a happy lull, and things would take an entirely opposite
turn. It was on this account that we applaud the manly and
determined actions of Governor Glover, who succeeded to the
government of Lagos soon after it became a British colony. It was
necessary that the savage tribes around should be made to acknow-
ledge the supremacy of British power; it was necessary that they
should look to the new authority as one which cannot be cowed
down by any native king, that they should feel that any trespass on

British property will be met with peremptory and severe rewards
from the Government of the island ; in a word, it was necessary, for
the Government of Lagos to be carried on successfully, that the
surrounding tribes should respect it and otherwise regard it with
fear. Governor Glover knew this, and his whole policy turned on
this point, and as each sign of disrespect met with severe punish—
ment, and as complication in the interior war was unavoidable, he
soon made the interior tribes taste the power of the new Government.
Trade, as a necessary effect, was temporarily stopped; he was
traduced by some of the merchants and traders, and no diatribe was
found sufficient to characterise his rule, but time wore away, and
trade again began to be healthy, and now produce is ?ocking
abundantly into the port of Lagos from all sides, and there is more
certain hope of a long and continuous peace.
But Lagos is only an isolated and important seaport town in the
kingdom of the Akus. From want of a more speci?c name and
from the whole of the tribes being once subjected to the king of
Yoruba, the Church Missionary Society has designated it the
'Yoruba Country,' but as most of the tribes, such as the Egbas
and Egbadoes, have objected to their being 'called Yorubas, and as
there is no national name by which all the tribes speaking the same
language but differently governed is known, I have employed the
name which is given to the whole nation at Sierra Leone, and which
is generally adopted in every part of the Coast—viz., the Akus.
The kingdom is bounded on the north by the right or Quora branch
of the River Niger, on the south by the Atlantic, on the east by
Benin, Kakanda, and part of Igara, and on the west by the kingdom
of Dahomy.
The_kingdom is divided into various tribes, who are governed by
their own chiefs and by their_ own laws, but who are extremely
jealous of one another. The principal tribes are the Egbadoes,
which include 'Otta and Lagos, near the sea-coast, forming a belt
of country on the banks of the Lagoon in the forest, to Ketu, on the
border of Dahomy. * The next tribe occupy Ketu and Shabe, on

the border of Dahomy on the west, then comes Ijebu on the east,
on the border of Benin, then the Egbas of the forest, now known by
the name of Egbas of Abeokuta; then comes Yoruba Proper north-
ward of the plain. Ife, Ijesha, Iyamo, Efou, Oudo, Ideko, Igbomna,
and Ado, near the banks of the Niger, from which the creek or
stream a little below Iddah is called Do or Ido.' Years ago all
these tribes were politically united under one head as tributaries to
the King of Yoruba, amongst whom were included Benin on the
east and Dahomy on the west. A large portion of Yoruba Proper
is governed by a Mussulman king, who is subject to the Sultan of
Sokoto, on the other side of the Niger ; the principal town and seat
of government is Ilorin.
Properly speaking there are seven independent provinces in the
kingdom of the Akus. Captain Burton * thus gives a summary of
them :—
1. Iketu, in our maps Ketu, with a capital of the same name, is
a small country lying between Agbome and the River Ogun, south
of Yoruba Proper, and shut out from the sea. It has hitherto with-
stood the power of Dahomy, and as the soil is poor, whilst timber
and water are far from abundant, it is not much coveted by its
neighbour. Population, 100,000.
2. E/cleo, or Lagos (Portuguese). The chief town is Aoni, or
Awini—i.e., descended from Ini or Bini-Benin. The limits are
Egba-land to the north, the sea to the south, the Ijebu Country on
the east of Badagry, now its dependency, on the west. Population,
80,000.
3. Egba is a small kingdom lying on both sides of the Ogun
River, but principally on the left bank. It is bounded on the north
by Yoruba Proper, south by Ekko, east by Ijebu, and west by
Iketu. It includes the kingdom of Otta. This is the head-quarters
of the Aku nation; its capital is Abeokuta. Population, 200,000.
delicate copper, sometimes black, whilst several of the chiefs are almost light
coloured. The lips are not thick, but the gums are blue, and the teeth not
improved by chewing. The diet is poor, their climate poorer ; calesthenics un-
known ; they are industrious. In the country pottery is abundant, netsf'are
hung everywhere, canoes numerous ; the men skid their little creeks with ?sh
traps and the women ply the paddle.

IJEBU, IJESHA, KAKANDA, AND 11.0111. 161
4. Ijebu, or Jaboo, is situated between Egba-land and Benin;
it is bounded northwards by Yoruba Proper and Kakanda, south-
wards by the sea, or more properly by the Lagoon, called the
Ikoradu or Cradoo Waters. It is divided into two parts, the
Ijebu Ode to the east, and westward the Ijebu Remo. The Awajali,
or great king, however, resides at Ode. The Ijebus are warlike,
and are the most deadly enemies of the Egbas. Population, 200,000.
5. Ijesha, capital Ijesha, lies between Yoruba and Kakanda.
Very little is known of it. Population, 200,000.
6. Kakanda, more properly called E?ong or Effon, extends
from Yoruba Proper to the Niger and the Kwara Rivers. The
people are celebrated for working copper.
7. Ilori, a province and city of the same name, inhabited by
Moslem, Fulas, and Gambari, a tribe of Hausa men, together with
a few Pagan Yorubas. The king is a Fula, and the chiefs mostly
Gambari and Kaniki. It is one of the great marts of Central Africa.
The tribes included within this territorial de?nition, although
they differ from one another in interest and religion, form one nation,
speaking the same language, having identical customs and usages.
They have suffered more than any other nation in Western Africa
from the depredations of the slave-trade)" Before Lagos fell under
the power of the British, it formed, with Badagry and Whydah,
the principal slave-port towns on the seaboard of Western Inter-
tropical Africa. The number of Akus emancipated as slaves in
" ' According to Mr. T. B. Freeman, one of the earliest visitors to
Abeokuta, a war had lasted nearly a century between the Kings of Dahomy
and of Great Benin. The lands lying between the two rivals had suffered
greatly; and even in the present day, the line of country between Badagry
and Abeokuta, which is 100 miles long, does not contain more than 500 souls.
In those days the Egbas dwelt to the eastward of their resent homes, but
were driven out by their neighbours the Ijebus, who ha sided with Benin.
Under their chief, Ladmodi, the Egbas made head against the violence of the
enemy, but he was at last slain, and the tribe dispersed.
' Without attempting to decide which account is true, it is evident that dur-
ing the ?rst quarter of the present century there was a general dispersion of the
Egbas. We know that about 1820-22 there was a great in?ux of Aku captives into
Sierra Leone, and that they found their way east and west, to the United States,
Gambia, Fernando Po, Hausa, Borneo, Central Africa, the Fezzan, Egypt, and
even to Stamboul. It was a race worsted and spoiled, not, as is commonly
asserted, byEuro eans, but by its own folly and want of proper despotism.'-—

Sierra Leone, the West Indies, and Americal is almost double that
from any other part; and even until this day the country is a prey
to the rapacious slave-hunting expeditions of the King of Dahomy,
who makes nightly attacks on small and unprotected towns, carrying
away their inhabitants captives to Abomy, disposing of some by
supplying the slave market at Whydah, and sacri?cing others in his
inhuman annual ' custom.' But the country has ever and anon been
largely supplying the slavedealers on the Coast,'who gave them the im-
petus; and the Mohammedan chieftains beyond the Niger carry on wars
of destruction and depredation wholesale, to swell the slave markets
of Yoruba. Hausa and other interior tribes are brought down
from Central Africa ; most of the men sold as slaves, and the women
and girls, especially if they have any pretensions to beauty, become
wives of the native slavedealers. Through the continual drain
from the land, and the destructive wars which were generally waged
among themselves, the nation has entirely lost its purity, and may be
rightly considered as Hausa, Kakanda, Nu?, and other interior
tribes.
The Akus, as a race, are amongst the most industrious, persever-
ing, and hard-working people on the West Coast of Africa. They
are, as a rule, parsimonious in the extreme, and are consequently
very wealthy. They make excellent traders, are very speculative,
but saving. The men are generally hardy, strong, and cunning in
their dealings with one another; when their interests are concerned
they (the uneducated especially) are very obedient, and would an-
dergo any degree of insult without manifesting any great dis-
pleasure; they are particularly jealous of one another, and hate to
be opposed by any of their own tribe. The heathen portion espe-
cially deal greatly in poisonous medicine, which some employ for
secretly depriving individuals of their lives, or otherwise producing in
them some bodily distemper. At Sierra Leone and other parts of
the Coast the Akus are very much feared; not so much by people of
di?erent nationality, but by those of the same tribe."i Various kinds

said: 'The chiefs were bareheaded, naked to the waist, wholly unorna-
mented, except with a few cheap beads, and clothed with a common native
loin wrap, or a bit of unbleached domestics. To retain wealth in such lands

of poisonous drugs—' agoomoos'—are exported from Lagos,
and are employed for different purposes. They believe that, by
the aid of medicine, riches, honour, education, and worldly favour
can be secured, so that their medicine-men are generally sought
after?"
The Akus have a strong power of combination; they obey im-
plicitly, and put great con?dence in the advice and orders of the
old men, around whose banner they will rally ,- this is done not
out of pure love of combination, as it is well known that their head-
men have a secret way of making their orders obeyed, and when it
forms a case of life and death this obedience is not to be wondered
at. Cases are on record, or report makes cases, where very wealthy
men have disobeyed these councillors; they were threatened at the
time, and within a very few weeks or months they were carried to
their long home.

age 138. ' The Alake is waxing old, his legs are weary of him ; there is a re-
port that he has made too much money, and signs appear that his subjects
will send him a quiet message to "go to sleep " '—page 144. ' When present
at Abeokuta they were celebrating the obsequies of the Akpena, or messenger
of Igemna, a high of?cer who had lately died, not without strong suspicions
of poison. He had been engaged in a quarrel with his superiors, the Ibash-
orum of his town. The people found business at a standstill ; they therefore sent
to the less useful personage—the messenger—their compliments and a humble
request that he would " go to sleep ;" so to sleep he went '-—page 157. It is
not an unfrequent habit to tell one to go and eat grass; the individual, although
previously perfectly sane, gets in the course of a short time a regular lunatic.
* The Akus or Yorubas are eminently elannish; 'they have strong virtues
and vices, and by dwelling upon one side, to the neglect of the rest of the
moral development, it would be easy to make them the best or the worst of
men. They are kind and courteous, hospitable, and not eminently dishonest ;
on the other hand, they are covetous, cruel, and wholly de?cient in what the
civilized man calls conscience. With considerable shrewdness in business,
they are simple in some points as children. They are somewhat litigious, and
there is at numerous judiciary, whilst private disputes are settled by a kind of
consing dz' famiglia. Their cruelty is shown rather in their religion than in
their laws. Murder, treason, and arson, sometimes adultery and theft, are
unished by death, the offender being beheaded or garrotted with a rope. In
lbore the neck is broken with an iron mace ; minor offences are visited with
the whi , ?ne, or imprisonment. Men amongst the Egboes are farmers,
tillers of, ground, blacksmiths, woodcutters, carpenters, weavers, tailors, and
barbers. Women do the housework and sell at markets ; betWeen whiles
they spin, wash, cook, draw water, dye cloth, and make.soap and pottery.
They rise early, and after a bath repair to their farms, then: meals consisting
of vegetables, farinaceous food, and meat.'

The women make excellent traders; withina very short time they
would double, treble, and even quadruple a very small amount.
Their diet and living are generally simple and inexpensive; they
are very litigious ; some of them are very good looking, nicely
shaped and formed, although marked; others are hideously tattooed."E
With the old Akus, as a general rule, it is di?icult to know when
you have offended them. They take offence quietly, and maybe an
apology is made, which apparently is accepted; but the insult or
o?ence is still harboured, and at some future day it will be satis-
factorin reVenged.
The educated Akus are making great advances in civilization,
especially when nntrammelled by any secret in?uences; some of them
are most liberal and patriotic, and would spend a great deal towards
developing the resources of their country. In the Colony of Sierra
Leone they are numerous, and rising in wealth and in?uence, off-
shoots of whom are now at Lagos, who form the educated and thriv- '
ing population of that infant Colony. Of the Akus in general it
must be admitted without a question that there are no people on the
Coast who are so hard-working and so long-suffering in proportion
* Captain Burton well describes these marks : ' There was a vast variety
of tattooes and ornaments. . . . The skin patterns were of every variety, from
the diminutive prick, to the great gash and the large boil-like lumps. They
affect various ?gures—tortoise, alligator, and the favourite lizard, stars, con-
centric circles, lozenges, right lines, welts, gouts of gore, marble or button-
like knobs of ?esh, and elevated scars resembling scalds, which are opened for
the introduction of Fetish medicines, and to expel evil in?uences. In this
country every tribe, sub-tribe, and even family, has its blazon, whose in?nite
diversi?cations may be compared with the lines and ordinances of European
heraldry; a volume would not suf?ce to explain all the marks in detail. The
chief are as follows : The distinguishing mark of the Egbas is a gridiron of
three cuts, or a multiplication of three u on each cheek. Free-born women
have one, two, or three raised lines, threa -like scars from the wrist u to the
back of the arm, and down the dorsal regions, like long necklaces. T ey call
this " entice my husband. " The Yorubas draw perpendicular marks from the
temples to the level of the chin, with slight lateral incisions, hardly percept-
ible, because allowed soon to heal. The E?'ons of Kakanda wear a blue "patch,
sometimes highly developed, from the cheek bones to the ear. The akpas
of Nupe make one long cut from the upper wheel of the nostril, sweeping
towards the ear. At Ijesha, a country lying east of Yoruba Proper, the tattoo
is a long parallelogram of seven perpendicular and ?ve transverse lines. The
areola in the female was not unfrequently a dull dark blue, the colouring
matter being native antimony, found in Yoruba and on the Niger, and levi-
gated with pepper and nitron upon a stone.'

LANGUAGE AND RELIGION OF THE AKUS. 165
to what they expect in return as they; they are generally passive,
supine, inaccessible to curiosity, or love of pleasure, and not easily
moved by political vicissitude.
The language of the district under consideration is the Aku or
Yoruba Division of the great Ewe, or Dahomean, family. The Aku,
Dahomy, Popo, Awoonah, and Accra or Ga, are cognate lan-
guages, which are spoken in the extensive tract of country lying
between the River Volta and the Niger. Through the labours of the
Church Missionary Society, the Aku or Yoruba dialect has been re-
duced to writing; the Bible, Prayer-book, Bible stories, and other
religious books have been translated into it. The mass of the popu-
' lation has for some time been taught to write and communicate
with one another in their own language; a great many of the in-
habitants, especially those in the interior countries, can read and
write the manuscript Arabic. Unfortunately no scienti?c work has
as yet been translated into Yoruba; the mysteries and beauties of
the arts and sciences, of modern and ancient history, and of geo-
graphy, have not yet been brought, through the medium of their
own language, within the comprehension of the natives, but ad-
vances are being made which we hope will ultimately lead to that
very desirable result.
The religion of the Yoruba or Aku Kingdom is Mohammedanism
and heathenism; the former has made great progress in the northern
portion of the country—11a, in Yoruba proper; from the principal
town of Ilorin, the Mohammedans travel into various parts, making
proselytes of the heathen population, whilst at the same time carry-
ing on active commerce in slaves. Intellectually and morally they are
superior to the heathen population, who, on their part, assert a still
greater superiority over them after their conversion from heathenism
to Christianity. Their idolatrous worship is similar throughout
the country. ' There is an established religion connected with
the government, which is the worship of the dead, or their deceased
ancestors, the secret of which every male is acquainted with, and is
bound to keep the female ignorant of, on pain of death on its being
revealed to the weaker sex. Thus it has become a sacred law to be
observed by all the male population throughout the land; not-
withstanding the national enmity against each other, yet this law is

observed to be unviolated, even during those times of bitter
rancour and revenge, when slave wars depopulated the country,
The people are very superstitious; besides the worship of their de-
ceased ancestors, they worship the gods of thunder and lightning,
the devil, snakes, rivers, some particular trees, the white-ant hills,
and rocks with caves, in which they suppose the spirits of the gods to
dwell. To these objects of worship, sacri?ces of bullocks, goats and
sheep, fowls and pigeons are made, and sometimes human beings
also.'
The country is governed by separate kings, whose right is here-
ditary, but only in the male issue of the king's daughter ; his power
is, in many instances, absolute; his person and those of the royal
family, sacred. He is assisted in making laws and settling palavers
by the elders in the kingdom, who are designated in Yoruba, qu?'a.
The capabilities of the kingdom of the Akus are very great and ex-
tensive ; populated, as it is, by a hardworking, persevering people, with
a rich, well-watered country. This territory, when fully developed
and explored, bids fair to become one of the richest in Western
Africa. The conversion of Lagos into a Colony, with a display of
all the improvements, power, and civilization of a European nation, is
a work of vast importance to those regions. The country is inter-
sected by small streams, which swell considerably during the rainy
season; they are only navigable for boats and canoes, or vessels of
very small tonnage. The principal streams are the Opara, which
divides the kingdom of Aku from Dahomy, running between Ketu
and the latter country ; the Ogun, which runs through the centre of
the kingdom at the back of Lagos through Abeokuta ; the
Iyewa, which empties its waters into the Lagoon a few miles from
Badagry; and the Palma, which runs through Gebee, east of Lagos.
Lagos is one of the richest Colonies in Western Africa, and the
kingdom of the Akus is abundantly supplied with a vast number of
marketable articles. The chief exports are palm-oil, palm-kernel oil,
shea butter, cotton, and ivory. Ever since Lagos has become a
British Colony, although intestine warfare has interfered with the
general trade of the country, every circumstance points out that,
within a very short time, the trade will be more than double
its present extension, and this is the natural effect of the healthy

in?uence of legitimate trade over that inhuman tra?ic, the
slave-trade; and so long as the naturally vigorous natives
are kept away from kidnapping and selling each other, so long
will their energies be turned towards the developement of the
rich resources of the country. The most recent contributions on
the subject of this extensive kingdom give the following interesting
details: ' Yoruba is a valuable and an unexplored ?eld. Its pro-
ducts are cereals (maize and millet), vegetables (peas, beans, cassava,
yams, koko, onions, and sweet potatoes), sugar-cane, ginger in
small quantities, and lately introduced cubahs, and various oil
seeds, bene or sesamun, talfaria, caster plant, ground-nuts, cocoa-
nuts, and physic-nuts. Colfee has been grown, but it has
been allowed to die out. Copper abounds in places. Indigo and
coarse tobacco would ?ourish anywhere, and the minerals have not
been explored.' Thus there is an extensive room for the adventurer.
The spirit of self-government seems to be taking a healthy hold on the
inhabitants of the metropolis of Aku—viz., Abeokuta; the savage old
native government is now undergoing a very decided change for the
better, and it is modelled according to civilized constitutions, which
shows the happy in?uence which British civilization has upon minds
otherwise disposed to improvement. It is true that in Abeokuta, libe-
rated slaves (and their descendants) of the country, who had been in-
structed and educated at school at Sierra Leone, had returned and
made it their permanent abode and rendered the existing native
government great service ; but it was not until there was established in
Lagos a European Christian power that we saw the march of im-
provement rapidly advancing. At present, there is established at
Abeokuta a board of management for the express purpose of direct-
ing the native government, of forwarding civilization, and promoting
the spread of Christianity, as well as of protecting the property of
European merchants and British subjects. The Secretary and
Director of this Board, which is styled the Egba United Board of
Management, is an educated native of Sierra Leone?" The ?rst

ordinance enacted relates to the imposing of custom duties, which
is necessary for the development of the Government. Such duties
are imposed on exports, which must have an injurious effect on
trade. The conditions of the ordinance are :—
1. That it shall be lawful for any person or persons (without
exception) to have free access in Abeokuta for the purposes of
trade, and to export therefrom any goods or produce, passing from
Abeokuta to Lagos by the River Ogun, or elsewhere, subject to the
regulations hereinafter mentioned.
2. That on all goods exported from Abeokuta to Lagos, by the
River Ogun, or elsewhere, there shall be paid the following duty in
cowries or produce, at the time of such exportation—viz., ivory
and shea butter, three strings of cowries on every pound ; palm and
nut-oil, one string on every gallon ; cotton, twenty cowrie on every
pound.
3. That all other goods not named shall be charged or charge-
able with a duty of three per cent. on the marketable value of such
goods and produce at Abeokuta at the time of such exportation.
4. That such duty shall be payable and paid at the Custom-
house of Abeokuta, on all such goods and produce as shall be in-
tended to be exported by the River Ogun, and that on such payment
a permit for the export thereof shall be granted by the collector,
deputy collector, or such other person or persons as shall be sent
with and accompany such goods or produce on their exportation,
and shall be produced, if required, by any person or persons in charge
supposed encroachment of the British Government of Lagos on Abeokutan Terri-
tory, and consequently the dread that such aggrandizement might lead to the
ultimate absorption of the whole Abeokutan Territory. There has been corre-
spondence between the two Governments which throws but afaint light on the
cause of attack upon that most unoffending and harmless body, the mis-
sionaries. The Bashorum Secretary has received his share of blame, but it
must be remembered that Abeokuta was never in such organized social con-
dition and progress as it was before the outbreak—that a secretary in a
heathen court, however good might be his intentions, however sane his ad-
vice, however civilized his state, can never without national force stop the
infuriate zeal of a dozen obdurate heathen chieftains. Whilst disapproving in
toto the late barbarous and savage actions of the heathen Abeokutans, I hope
Christianity will soon be triumphant in that land, and that a progressive and.
civilized form of government will be carried out upon a better and more aus-
picious footing.

of such goods or produce, and that the payment of the duty on
goods and produce exported will and shall be payable at such place
as shall be from time to time appointed.
5. That any goods or produce being exported from Abeokuta
by the River Ogun or elsewhere, for which a permit shall not on de-
mand be produced to any person appointed for the examination of
such permits, shall and may be seized, and on proof before the
Board of Management, or any four justices of the peace appointed
for that purpose, and the non-production of such permit, the goods
or produce shall be declared forfeited; and on sale, the produce of
such sale shall, after deducting the necessary expenses, be paid as
follows: viz., one-third thereof to the seizer and collector, and the
balance to the Treasurer of the Board of Management for the use of
the Egba Government.

tion thereof.

The most powerful and troublesome neighbour to Aku or Yoruba
Land is the kingdom of Dahomy, which has for a long time been
looking eagerly for the destruction of Abeokuta; twice has the
Dahomean potentate attempted to destroy that town, and twice has
he received a signal thrashing, with the loss of several thousands of
his warriors; the last was so terri?c, that it is certain that Abeo-
kuta will never again be made a point of attack. It will still
continue to harass the small towns on the frontier, until such time
as a combined action of all the petty kingdoms is made against the
common enemy, and Dahomy receives a ?nal check in the slave-
hunting exploits eastward of its dominion.
The natural capital of the Aku or Yoruba Territory is Abeokuta,
and its best seaport town—orLiverpool—is Lagos. As yetthe coun-
try and people are unprepared to be thrown on their own resources,
it still requires more nursing. There are no roads inthe interior, the

water communications are not yet properly opened, and no regular
native police or soldiery is paid by the native government. Things are
only just germinating, and it would be an unwise step in the British
Government were it to withdraw at once from the place. Abeokuta
is by no means strong enough to withstand the several native grow-
ing powers. Ibadan, for example, will not receive any dictation from
it, and it is not in a position to make it do so; should, therefore, the
country be given up, anarchy and disorder will run riot throughout

CHAPTER XIII.
EMPIRE OF THE EBOES (IBOES, IGBOES, EGBOES).
SITUATED between the Rivers Niger and Old Calabar, and bounded
on the north by the left or Binnue branch of the ?rst river, on the
south by the Atlantic, on the east by Old Calabar and the Dwalla
Countries, and on the west by the River Niger, Benin, and Igara,
is the extensive and well-watered tract of territory included in the
Empire of the Egboes.ale According to Dr. Baikie, Egboe extends
east and west from the Old Calabar River to the banks of the Niger,
0r Kwora, and possesses also some territory at Abo, in the westward
of the stream; on the north it borders on Igara and Akpoto, and
is separated from the sea only by petty tribes, all of which trace
their origin from the great race.
It is divided into several districts or counties, each speaking dif-
ferent dialects, although derived from one root. The principal
counties are Isuama, Elugu, Isielu, Isiago, Abaga, _Mitshie, and
D juku, all of which are situated on the north; in the middle are
Abo, Abazim, Aro, and Amazunie; and in the south are Brass,
N imbe, Okrika, Ebane or Bonny, and Adony. Very little is
known of these districts ; their histories are shrouded in impenetrable
darkness; expeditions have been made through the great water course
into the interior; but no cross expedition, starting from the eastern
banks of the Niger to the Old Calabar River, has as yet been at-
tempted.
* Egba, Igbo, Ebo, and Ibo are the various spellings met with in books
describing the race inhabiting this part of the Coast. Among the soft
Isuama and Elugu, the soft Ebo and Ibo is used ; but among the inhabitants
on the coast, such as Bonny and Okrika, the harsher name Egbo is preva-
lent. In the interior north of the Territory, the nations are called Igbo, which
approaches more to the original name of the inhabitants.

In the south the districts are intersected by numerous streams
and rivulets, which enter to form the delta of the Niger ; mangrove
swamps are abundant in various places; except between Bonny and
Old Calabar, the soil is rich and fertile. Further up, the country is
more open and elevated, and numerously populated. In Isuama most
of the towns are built on rising grounds, dry, and well selected ; so
that Isuama, Elugu, and Isiago, are far healthier and dryer than
the sea-coast towns. But there are yet several large and important
countries in the interior of Egboe of which nothing is known,
as the country has not received that attention among civilized
settlers that other parts of the Coast have. After the great failure
0f the expedition of 1841, no adequate attempt was made to open
the River Niger until 1854 when a new impetus was given by the
complete success of that year, but which, unfortunately, has been fol-
lowed by tardy operations. The country is governed by independent
kings and chiefs, whose extent of dominion varies greatly; some
exercise authority over large and extensive districts; others rule
over a town or village ; and amongst these latter, such as in Oru or
Jamen, the inhabitants are found to be wild, rude, savage, and
treacherous. The title of king, unlike in the countries west of the
Niger to as far as Senegambia, is hereditary in the male line. After
the death of the father, the son is proclaimed king ; in default, the
brother. This may be seen in the coronation of the Kings of Benny.
So far back as could be remembered, Papa reigned for a certain
period, and was succeeded at his death by his son Zhedie, who was
also succeeded by his son Peppel I., who was succeeded by his son
Peppel 11., then by his son Opnbu, who was succeeded by his son
Peppel III. Bribo, his cousin, then succeeded him, or Peppel IV.,
and on his death, Dappa, the son of Peppel III., ascended the
throne, and was succeeded by George, his son, the now reigning
king.
In some of the districts the people endeavour to assume the
elective power; thus, after the death of King Obi, of Abo, two
parties sprung up, one supporting the claims of the king's sons,
whilst the other advanced an in?uential person named Orisa as a
candidate for the vacant crown ; these two sections were known re-
spectively as king's people, and the Oshiodapara. party. Whilst

the rights of the parties were still in dispute, law and justice were
administered by a neutral party, having no connexion whatever with
either side. The kings exercise very extensive powers over their
subjects, but they are not absolute monarchs, as any excessive
use of power may lead to their dethronement; they are assisted in
making laws and transacting public business by councillors, who in
Isuama are generally four principal persons ; here the king is called
Obi, and is addressed by his subjects kneeling, by the title of Igue,
or supreme head; in Abo the king is called Ese. The king very
seldom goes out beyond the precincts of his premises, especially in the
interior countries, because, before publicly showing himself in the
town, a human sacri?ce must be made to propitiate the gods. His
revenue consists of a portion of the ?nes in?icted for misdemeanour,
and a portion of the game obtained in hunting. His throne 'is a
raised bank of mud in the verandah, about four feet long, two wide,
and two feet high from the level of the ?oor ; ' on this is spread a
mat and a white piece of calico over it, which cloth is also spread
on the walls against the king's back, extending from the top of the
wall to that spread on the ?oor of the throne. ' This is a sign of
royalty and the prerogative of the king, which no one in the country
is to imitate.' No stranger is allowed in the king's palace a seat of
any kind before his majesty, whether mat or stool, excepting the
l ose red earth, as the king took an oath to that effect.
/ Among the Egboes, women hold a very superior rank in the
-' social scale; they are not regarded, as among other heathen tribes, as
/ - an inferior creation and doomed to perpetual degradation, but occupy
( their 'rightful status in society.' Nothing would, however, induce
them to place a woman 011 the throne as their ruler ; this they con-
.sider as subverting nature itself. In colloquy with the King of
.Nsub Mr. Taylor was asked what was the name of his king. On
$ing told that he had no king, but a queen, the king drew back
with astonishment and said, ' What! Can woman rule over man ? '
"This, he afterwards said, accounts for the greatness of England, as
there is no partiality among her people.
The language of the whole of the district is Egboe, but there are
vstrong dialectic differences as we recede from the interior to the
Coast towns. In Isuama, or by contraction Isu, the purest and

softest Egboe is spoken, and from it more or less differences occur
as we enter different districts; even the language spoken in Old
Calabar and Dwalla is derived from the great family of Egboe, only
far removed. Oru, Brass, Bonny, Okrika, and Andoney bear
dialectic af?nity to Isuama Egboe, and are derived from the same
root, as may be noticed in the following collections made by the late
Dr. Baikie :—

The language of the Egboes differs entirely from that of the
Yoruba or Ewe, westward of the Niger; after crossing that great
river we are brought at once among an entirely new and distinct
tribe, who are allied in tongue to the Lichuana, the Gala on the
north, the Tumali, and the Kai?r, which ethnologically forms the
South African Alteral family; this relation of the Egboe to the
Ka?ir tongue has been also pronounced by' the great ethnologist,
Dr. Latham.
The population of Egboe is unknown. Unlike the countries be-
tween the River Volta and the Niger, where at this present moment
\/ external slavery is being carried on, and Dahomy making yearly
' devastation among peaceful populations, Egboe, since 1835, has
been freed from these internal convulsions.* There is no large, in-
dependent, warlike power in its neighbourhood, as in Ashantee and
Dahomy; but the population, since the limitation of the external
slave-trade has been known to be wonderfully increased; and, judg-
ing from the extent and population of the known towns along the
banks of the river and on the sea-coast, it will not be far short of

heard of, but petty quarrels often occur. The ast time Abo was at war
was about 1851, with Dasaba, when one Abo man and ten or twelve of
Dasaba's party were killed. The usual style of disputes generally ends in
the capture of a canoe, or the con?scation of a cargo.'—Expl0ring Voyage,

the mark if we state the whole at from 10,000,000 to 12,000,000,
all of whom speak one language, with slight dialectic differences.
In stature the Egboes di?er very considerably according to the
region whence they are taken. In Isuama and the north central dis-
tricts the inhabitants are tall and majestic looking, some well
formed and shaped; they carry themselves very erect and con-
sequentially. In other parts they are of a middling size, averaging
?ve feet two. In the deltas of the rivers the inhabitants are short,
stout, bull-necked, and very strong; specimens of them are even now
to be found in Sierra Leone or the Gambia; they are scarcely above
If ur and a-half feet, having very broad shoulders, and are stoutly built.
/' The Egboes are considered the most imitative and emulative
'1 people in the whole of Western Africa ; place them where you will,
or introduce to them any manners and customs, you will ?nd that
they very easily adapt themselves to them. Stout-hearted, or, to use
the more common phraseology, big-hearted, they always possess a
desire of superiority, and make attempts to attain it, or excel in what
is praiseworthy, without a desire of depressing others. To them
we may well apply the language of Dryden——
A noble emulation beats their breasts.
-~h_..
Place an Egboe man in a comfortable position, and he will never
rest satis?ed until he sees others occupying the same or a similar
position. Of this emulative power, the Right Rev. Bishop
Crowther, scarcely a year after the establishment of the Church
Missionary station at Onitsha, in Isuama Egbo, thus wrote: 'From
all I could gather by observatio'u, the Iboes are very emulative. As
in other things, so it will be in book learning. Other towns will not
rest satis?ed until they have also learned the mystery of reading
and writing, by which their neighbours might surpass them and put
them in the shade.'
' Again, when the Expedition of 1854 ascended the Niger, the Com-
missioner, on visiting the son of the late king, Tshnkumia by name,
found him attired in the following style, ready to receive him. He
had on a 'woollen nightcap, a white shirt, and home-built panta-
lo_ons of native manufacture, shaped after an extreme Dutch de-
sign.' The younger brother, who was received on board, appeared

'dressed in home-made scarlet cloth trousers, a scarlet uniform
coat, a pink beaver hat, under which, apparently to make it ?t, was
a red worsted nightcap, no shoes, beads round the neck, and in his
hand a Niger Expedition sword.' Now these men have never been
on the seacoast, and have no connexion or communication direct
or even indirectly with civilized men, so as to learn their habits, so
that their imitative faculty must have been excited by the Expedi-
tion of 1841, which made but a few hours' stay in their town, and
yet they persevere and imitate what then struck them.
But this quality is essential to civilization and advancement; it is
the second passion belonging to society. 'This passion' writes
Burke, 'arises from much the same cause as sympathy. This
forms our manners, our opinions, our lives. It is one of the strong-
est links of society.' This is proved in the fact, as says the Rev.
Alex. Crummel, 'that all civilization is carried down from genera-
tion to generation, or handed over from the superior to the inferior,
by means of the principles of imitation, based on sympathy. A
people devoid of this passion are incapable of improvement, and not
only must stand still, unimpressive, but, by another law of nature,
which makes progress a condition of vitality, must go down and
perish; for stagnation necessitates decay and ruin. Thus through
this stolidity and rigid self-consciousness, has followed the inevit-
able failure of the American Indian. On the other hand, the negro,
with his pliable and plastic nature, with a greed of absorption,
which, in fact, is the principle of receptibility, seizes upon and
makes over to himself, by imitation, the qualities of others. First
of all observe that, by a spontaneous native assimilation, he re-
pudiates himself by becoming the like of the people to whom he is
subject. He is always characteristically the negro; but among
Frenchmen, he becomes the lively and sardonic Frenchman ; among
Americans, the keen, enterprising, progressive American; among
Spaniards, the stately, solemn Spaniard; among Englishmen, the
phlegmatic and solid Englishman.' *
The Egboes divide society into various social ranks; the higher

grades are only obtained after a heavy sacri?ce. Before merging
from one rank to another of a superior poaition, a large sum must
be paid, as each rank carries its own in?uence, consideration, and
estimation in society. On the day of admission or initiation into
such there is great merriment; this may be exempli?ed by the
account of the Rev. J. C. Taylor, of the Onitsha Mission, who was
an eyewitness to the honour of Jasere being conferred on Orikabue.
He said: 'as I approached nearer our abode, I saw the people were in
high glee, marking their faces with stripes of red ochre, or are, and
white clay. The deafening sounds of musketry, the play of swords
and spears, the decoration of Orikabue's house with pieces of hand-
kerchiefs, young men and women, old men and children, all vigor-
ously employed in giggling, clapping their hands, and uniting in
boisterous mirth, each in their turn dropping into a circle.'
The highest nobility, called Ndidzi-boriba, which rank is ob-
tained by paying a very large sum, carry bells attached to their bags
or borne before them wherever they go, producing a continuous jing-
ling sound. The number of this rank, even in towns containing
from 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants, is comparatively small; at Onit-
sha there are only six. Bishop Crowther, in his observation of the
dignitaries, says: 'The bell they carry about them is called Mborz'ba.
Upon their entering a room, everyone must stoop and address each
of them by the title he hears; thus, if an Onown, he is addressed
Onown, Onown, Onown, ever so many times; if Ogene, or Adze, in
like manner. It is a great insult to salute these gentlemen with the
common salutation, except by the title they bear. Each one must
occupy a separate seat; and a bench may be twelve feet long, but as
soon as Onown or Adze has made towards it, it must be quitted by
all its previous occupiers, in honour of him. On this account each
one carries his sheepskin or goatskin about him, and sometimes
his stool.' Even this destinction is observed in the churches, so that
small stools are made expressly to accommodate them when they do
attend service, in order that people of inferior rank on the benches
may not be disturbed by giving room to them. It is no wonder to
?nd that they are not a little proud of their greatness.
Another rank in the social scale, inferior to the above, is that

known among a class of gentry called Ndi Nze, or Ndo Nze. Now,
to obtain this rank a smaller sum than that required for the rank of
nobility is paid. This sum, when compared with the impoverished
state of the country, must be regarded as considerable, and yet we
?nd a vast number of the population vie with each other to obtain
it. It consists of 15 large Egboe goats, 200 fowls, 100,000 cowries,
a large quantity of yams, from one to two tons, and an immense
supply of the country beverage, palm wim. As insignia of this
rank, each individual is allowed to carry a horn made of ivory, with
a hole made in it to blow into. Its sound is shrill and discordant ;
when heard, he in whose hand the ivory horn, or odan, is seen, is
recognized as a great man or Nze—oue of the gentry who has pur-
chased his rank.
An individual, however rich, cannot assume any title unless by
purchase, or conferred by the king, which last seldom occurs; a
man of property is called Ogan-ranyan. In Isuama a hideous
practice is observed; it consists in entirely destroying the natural
skin of the forehead, as if with a hot iron, of the sons of the wealthy,
among whom it is con?ned. It is regarded by the inhabitants as very
becoming, and entitles them to respect; the people so tattooed are
called Mbrz'tshi, or Itslzi. We have a very early account of them in
the description of Captain John Adams (pages 133 and 134): ' A
class of Heeboes (the Ibo or Eboe, whose chief town is Abo, at the
head of the Negretian Delta) called Breeche, and whom many have
very erroneously considered to be a distinct nation, masters of slave
ships have always had a strong aversion to purchase, because the
impression made on their minds by their degraded situation was
rendered more galling and permanent from the exalted rank which
they occupied in their own country, and which was thought to have
a very unfavourable in?uence on their shipmates and countymen in
misfortune. Breeche, in the Heebo language, signi?es gentleman,
or the eldest son of one, one who is not allowed to perform in his
own country any menial o?ice. He inherits, at his father's death,
all his slaves, and has the absolute control over his wives and
children which he has left behind him. Before attaining the age of
manhood his forehead is scari?ed, and the skin brought down from
the hair to the eyebrows, so as to form a line of indurated skin from

one temple to the other. This peculiar mark is distinctive of his
rank, the ordinary mark of the Heebo being formed by numerous
perpendicular incisions in each temple, as if the operation of cupping
had been often performed.'
One distinguishing rank among the Egboes is the Odogo, or.
captain of war, of which there are several grades; the title is dis-
tinguished by the individual carrying on his cap a long feather,
which signi?es that the wearer has killed in war a person of rank.
These feathers are either white or red. The highest rank of captain,
equal to a general, wears six, and the ?eld-marshal is entitled to
display seven. To perpetuate their valour in war, not having any
written chronicle to leave their name to posterity, they plant a
young bombax whenever they kill an enemy of consequence. As
regards the management of warfare, they have peculiar laws.
Bishop Crowther gives the following: 'It is a peculiar law among
the Ibos, that when the inhabitants of one town are at war with
another, and one part or division of the town will not join in the
war, they can, without molestation, visit their relatives in the
town which is at war with a division of their own, whether men or
women, no person touching them.' Strangers living in the country
might visit the belligerent towns freely, without apprehension,
because they are said not to have a hand in their quarrels. ' Should
there be an intermediate town between the two contending towns,
neither the one nor the other can step over the intermediate one to
attack his enemies without a due notice and permission from the
intermediate one, unless they beat their way in a roundabout direc-
tion to e?ect their purpose. When they do come to an open ?ght
in the plain it is said they are ?erce. They do not capture to
make slaves, but they kill everyone they lay hold of, and take their
heads as trophies to their homes, to prevent their dead bodies being
taken away by their enemies. Women follow them to their battles,
and are employed in removing the dead and wounded out of the
way, so that the men do not lose time in doing this, but continue to
force their enemies.'
The doctor, or libia, is by no means an inferior personage; he is
also a priest, and carries himself with great pretensions; is much
feared, and exercises a great sway over the people. He pretends
N 2

to foretell things to come, to drive out evil spirits, and discover
secrets, and, consequently, is much respected. Dr. Baikie fell in
with the shop of one of these learned gentlemen in Angiama. ' It
is a small round room,' writes he, 'wonderfully clean and painted,
the sides being striped with blue, black, red, and white, and the
back checked with the same colours. Two pots of herbs in steep
were placed on a tripod, composed of three branches springing from
a common origin. Two divining rods and many long-pointed sticks
(one cut like a crocodile's head, another carved to resemble a
tortoise, and a third painted rudely to represent a man,) were in
different corners, while hanging around the walls were numerous
strings of cowries and other charms.'
The doctor's service is much required in time of war; he has
to administer the oath of allegiance and faithfulness to the Crown
and to ?ght valiantly. He ?rst takes a wooden bowl and ?lls it
with pebbles and stones; with this he walks round three times, the
assembled warriors standing, and everyone cries unanimously, 'Ac-
cording to this oath so would we have it.' Before the troops a black
stone is placed on a green leaf. The troops standing, the doctor or
one of the captains, taking up the stone with the leaf, says, ' Young
men or troops, be on your guard, and ?ght for your rights; none
must be a coward, but be bold and manly. Remember this izi
(oath-stone); it has been done so in byegone days by our fore-
fathers. They were stout-hearted, and never shrunk back in any\
thing they had determined to perform.'
The introduction of the new yam is, as among many other Coast
tribes, an occasion for the performance of several rites and cere-
monies. Here the doctor ?gures conspicuously. This Fetish cus-
tom is called Waje, or the eating of the new yam. It is not, as
in other parts, participated in by the general public, but is performed
by a certain class of people who carry a long trumpet tusk about
them. Mr. Taylor gives the following as the manner in which the
custom is performed: Each head-man brings out six yams, besides
some kola nuts and ?sh, and cuts down young branches of palm
leaves, and places them before his gate; three of the yams are
roasted, after which the libia, or doctor, takes and scrapes them
into a meal, and then divides it in two. He then takes one piece

and places it on the lip of the person who is going to eat the new
yam. The eater blows out the steam from the hot yarn, and after-
wards pokes the whole into his mouth and says, 'I thank God for
being permitted to eat the new yam.' He then begins to chew it
heartily, with ?sh. The doctor receives as a fee for performing the
ceremony the three remaining yams.
In their salutation, individuals of an inferior position, on meeting
their superiors, place one knee on the ground and then bow with
great reverence. Among equals they shake hands, which is performed
?rst in the regular manner, but before separating the hands, they
partly take loose hold of the ?ngers of each other, and then sharply
slipping them so as to make at the same instant a snapping sound;
this process is assisted by the thumb.
In Yoruba, Nu?, and many other parts of the Coast, the mothers
carry their children about on their backs, but not so in Egboe;
there they are carried chie?y in their arms. The children are very
seldom punished, consequently are found to be self-willed and have
their own way; 'yet they are docile and imitative, and with very
little trouble will soon be made intelligent scholars.' Life for 12' e is a
law throughout the country ; whether taken accidentally or not, one
life must go for the other; this is imperative. If the murderer him-
self manage to escape, some one of his family must be killed in
his stead. If the murderer or homicide be inferior in rank to
the murdered man, some one of equal rank in the family must be
delivered in his stead. Neither the king nor any individual member
of a family has any right to alienate land; and before any sale or
gift of land belonging to any family is made, the consent of the lead-
ing members of the family must ?rst be obtained, as amongst
Egboes land is possessed by inheritance.
The Egboes are generally copper-coloured, but on the eastern
border a very small tribe is darker than the rest; the majority
possessing blue eyes. They are of a determined nature, and, when
uncivilized, ?erce in their appearance and boisterous in their
quarrels. Captain Burton regards them as one of ' the most fero-
cious and dangerous of the African tribes.' When exasperated
they would coolly and quietly do the most determined act, regard-
less of the consequences. They would as soon run a knife through

anyone as blow out their own brains. A case may be cited as an
example of the wanton determination of this tribe. An Egboe
man at a certain village in Sierra Leone, not long ago, was exas-
perated by some domestic disturbance. He deliberately smashed
his skull, by violently butting his head against a wall. 'Yet no
sooner is the storm paci?ed, than they are again extremely quiet and
yielding; even in common transactions,' writes Bishop Crowther,
' as buying and selling, &c., they get so warm at a little difference
or misunderstanding in settling the price between them, that I often
imagined they were going to give blows; but they soon settle it, and
all is calm and quiet again.' The Egboes cannot be driven to an
act; they become most stubborn and bull-headed; but with kind-
ness they could be made to do anything, even to deny themselves of
thei comforts. They would not, as a rule, allow anyone to act the
su rior over them, nor sway their conscience, by coercion, to the
p formance of any act, whether good or bad, when they have not
e inclination to do so ; hence there is not that unity among them
that is found among other tribes; in fact, everyone likes to be his
own master. As a rule, they like to see every African prosper.
Among their own tribe, be they ever so rich, they feel no ill-will
toward them. A poor man or woman of that tribe, if they meet
with a rising young person of the same nationality, are ready to
render him the utmost service in their power. They give him
gratuitous advice, and 'embrace him as their child ;' but'if he is
arrogant and overbearing, they regard him with scorn and disdain
wherever he is met. When half-educated, the young men are head-
strong and very sensitive; they take offence at the least unmeaning
phrase, and become very impertinent.
Although there are considerable dialectic differences among the
Egboes in the different parts of this extensive country, such as
those between Elugu 0n the north and Ebane or Bonny on the
south, yet still in their country or in Egboeland 'each person hails,
as a- sailor would say, from the particular district where he was
born ;' but when in a foreign country or when away from their
home all are Egboes. The Bonnians and Eluguans are hailed by
one national name. In some districts of Egboe, in Ndoko and
Ngwa, the inhabitants are cannibals; but they generally eat the

?esh of their enemies slain in war on some great festive occasion;
this is connected with some religious rites.
We come now to the consideration of the most important
subject relative to the Egboe race—viz., their religion and probable
orz' in.
he religion of the Egboes is Judaism, intermixed with numerous
pagan rites and ceremonies. They believe in the existence of one
Almighty, Omnipotent, Omnipresent Being, whom they worship as
such, and regard as the Omniscient God who concerns himself with
the affairs of man. He is known by the name of Tshuku, contracted
sometimes into Tshi. They also admit the existence of another
God, or a superior being, who, in one part of the country, is called
Orissa, and in another Tshuku-Olceke, or ' God the Creator,' or 'the
Supreme God,' thus showing that the nation believes in the divi-
sion of the Godhead—in two beings each equal in power and in?u-
ence, yet differing in the Godhead; but the existence of a third per-
son does not seem to be admitted or known by them.
Tshuku,* the Omniscient God, who is supposed to preserve them
from harm, communicates with his people through his priests, who
reside in a city set apart as holy by all the nation. This place is
calle' or Ano, to which pilgrimages are made, not only from
all parts of Egboe, including the tribes along the Coast—vim, Oru,
Nimbe, and Brass—but also from Old Calabar in the far east. This
city, where the holy shrine of Tshuku exists, is extremely populous,
and is spoken of with great reverence and respect, ' almost at times
with a degree of veneration. The inhabitants speak the languages
of the surrounding tribes, which are heard among the crowded
pilgrim votaries who throng the shrine,' but they speak principally
the dialects of Elugu and Isuama. They are said to be skilful
* The Rev. J. C. Taylor gives the following as a propitiatory prayer made

goat : 'Biko Tshi, mere'm ihoma, ngi 100 min, biko kpere Tshuku Abiama,

see your kola nuts ; see your rum and palm wine.'—-' Niger Expedition,

artisans, and manufacture swords, spears, and metallic ornaments,
specimens of which European travellers have pronounced to be very
neatly ?nished. The town is called God's Towh—' Tshuku ab 3/ a ma,'
or ' God lives there ;' and the inhabitants God's children, or Omo
Tshuku. The very fact of their residing in the town makes the
people to regard them with reverence, as being near the presence of
the holy deity. .
The shrine of Tshuku is placed in the centre of the town. 'When
a man goes to Aro to consult Tshuku,' writes Dr. Baikie, ' he is
received by some of the priests outside the town, near a small
stream; here he makes an offering, after which a fowl is killed, and
if it appears unpropitious, a quantity of red dye is spilt into the
water, which the priest tells the people is blood, and on this the
votary is hurried off by the priest and is seen no more, it being
given out that Tshuku has been displeased and has taken him away.
If, however, the omen is pronounced to be favourable, the pilgrim is
permitted to draw near to the shrine, and, after various rites and
ceremonies have been gone through, the question, whatever it may
be, is propounded, of course through the priests, and by them also
the reply is given. A yellow powder is given to the devotee, who
rubs it around his eyes, which powder is called in Egboe ' edo.' As
tokens of a person having actually consulted the sacred oracle, little
images, called ' Ofo Tshuku,' meaning images of God, are issued to
him, which he keeps as holy. After returning home from the sacred
city a person is considered sacred, or djudju, for seven days, during
which time he remains at home, speaking to no one, and the people
dread to approach him.
Both Bishop Crowther and the late Dr. Baikie encountered one
of these pilgrims. He went to Aro to inquire why his wife had no
children, and had just returned; and, consequently, was djudju, or
sacred, but being strangers they were permitted to visit him. He
was, however, unwilling to give any full account of the ceremony,
but said that Tshuku was only to be heard through his priests.
The account of his journey was the following: He embarked in a
canoe from Agbene, in Oru, to a creek nearly opposite Abo; on
entering it he proceeded to a place called Igbema, whence he
?nished his journey by land. On his arrival at Aro, the priest gave

him some yellow powder, telling him that if his heart was bad it
would kill him. According to his account, at Aro there were people
from far in the interior, as well as from Old Calabar and Ibibio,
consulting the sacred God—indeed, the UNKNOWN Gen.
Sacri?ces are made to Tshuku,'consisting of fowls, sheep, goats,
and bullocks; but human sacri?ces, as such, are never made.
There is, however, one propitiatory sacri?ce, which is practised to
a considerable extent in the interior towns, and which is decidedly
Judaistic in its origin. At the end of every year two important sacri-
?ces are made ; the ?rst, done in secret (in thick bush), to take away
the sins of the king during the past year; and the second, publicly
performed, to take away the sins of the whole peeple. Unlike the
Jews, human beings are procured for the purpose; none of the in-
habitants of the towns where it is performed are selected. A special
fund is raised by a contribution of twenty-eight ngugus (equal to our
2!. 0s. 7%d.) on all who, during the past year, were guilty of gross
sins—such, for example, as incendiarism, theft, fornication, adultery,
witchcraft, &c. The amount is taken into the interior, and two
persons are bought expressly to be offered for the sins of all the
inhabitants, and especially for those who have committed those
abominable sins. An individual from the neighbouring country is
specially hired to perform the deed, and is variously paid, at an
average of about twenty ngugus, or ll. 12s. 6d.
The Rev. J. C. Taylor, Church Missionary agent at Onitsha,
witnessed one of these sacri?ces, which was made to take away the
sins of the people and the land during the past year ; and from his
account we gather the following : A young virgin of from eighteen
to twenty years of age was selected. After several ceremonies had
been performed, by which the chiefs and people supposed that the
sins of the land were transferred to the poor victim, her hands were
tied behind her back, and her legs fastened together with a rope. She
was decorated with the young palm leaves, and, with her face to the
earth, drawn from the king's house to the river, a distance of two
miles. ' The motley group who accompanied the procession cried as
they drew along the unfortunate creature, victimized by the sins of
their land, Aro ye! are ! are l—i.e., Wickedness l wickedness l This
alarm is given to notify to the passers-by to screen themselves from

witnessing the dismal scene. The body was drawn along in a
merciless manner, as if the weight of all their wickedness were
carried away, whilst the life was still beating in the palpitating
bosom of that unfortunate girl.' On reaching the bank of the river,
the lifeless body was received in a canoe and paddled with all haste
to the deepest part of the river, and then drowned. This they do
believing that by that means they could 'atone for the individual
sins of those who had broken God's law during the past year.'
and thus, exclaims Mr. Taylor, 'these unhappy creatures fared like
Jehoiakim of old—they were buried with the burial of an ass,
drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of the city.' The Egboes
believe implicitly in the transmigration of souls, that after death the
individual appears in various forms, according to his actions whilst
on earth, either as wild beasts or human beings; so that slaves,
when ill-treated by their masters, generally console themselves that
after they have quitted this present tenement they will appear again
in another form among their friends and relatives from whom they
have been forcibly separated.
The existence of the devil, or evil spirits, is also among their
beliefs. The greatest and worst of these they call 'KAMALLO,'
which is equivalent to 'Satan,' the literal meaning being ' one going
about everywhere and in all directions.' In some parts, however, a
more impressive and characteristic name is given to it, distinctly
pointing it out as Satan the fallen angel; it is called ' IGWIK ALLA,'
which is derived from the two words, ' Igwik,' signifying ' one who
lived above before coming down,' and 'dlla,' the 'ground,' or earth.
He is worshipped, and ' persons make inquiries of it if they wish to
commit any wicked action, such as murder; bringing presents of
cowries and cloth to propitiate this evil being, and render him
favourable to their design.' They speak also of lesser evil spirits,
the angel of Kamallo, whom they call Mondjo.
Do not these religious rites and ceremonies remind us forcibly
of the Jewish Dispensation, when sacri?ces were made to atone for
the sins of the people? And does this not present an emphatic
proof of what Mr. Locker wrote, that apart from the native religion
of Africa, Judaism forms an element which enters Africa by the
natural current of nations from the north-east, from Egypt, Ethiopia,

and Northern Africa; that though there are comparatively few Jews
south of the Sahara and Abyssinia, still, by the connexion of the
Jews with African countries since the days of Moses, Abraham,
Joseph, Solomon, as well as the destruction of Jerusalem, and the
consequent scattering of the Jews all over the globe, the in?uence
of Judaism on Africa is greater and farther di?used than that of the
Jews and their geographical extension. If we take, for instance, the
race under consideration, I will go still further, and assert that the
more we study them in all their various relationships, the more shall
we be convinced that they form a portion of those lost tribes who
disobeyed the command of God and were dispersed, but are now
mingled with the original inhabitants of the country, and so
degenerate in the form in which they now appear.
But to prove this further we must admit the acknowledged and
every-day fact that the moving passion of men's minds, even from
time immemorial, is a disposition to change their abode; thus the
children of Israel, directed by some supernatural in?uence, migrated
from Egypt to Canaan, expelled its inhabitants, and became sole
masters of the land. The Phoenicia-us of ancient date were charac-
terised by their spirit of enterprise, and they formed colonies in various
quarters of the eastern hemisphere. Adopting the views entertained
in Northern Africa, we should conclude that migration was the
natural eifect of a far greater or more important cause. It is
af?rmed to be an immutable and essential decree of the Creator,
who, when he placed the sun and stars in the ?rmament, and directed
their diurnal and apparent courses from east to west, ordained that
mankind should not be an exception to a law which was intended
for all the earth. Under these considerations we see that the open-
ing line between Egypt andArabia—betweenAfrica and Asia—known
as the Isthmus of Suez, plays an important partin the history of Africa-
as it formed the gateway for Asiatic emigration, and, consequently,
at various times, numerous occidental tribes poured into Northern Africa
through Egypt, either peacefully as emigrants and settlers, receiving
special licence, as at the time of the Abaside monarchy, or by force
of arms. We ?nd amongst the earliest tribes who tread the soil of
Africa, the Babylonians, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the greater
part, if not all the Canaanites, which last were doomed to destruc-

tion by the hands of Joshua, and, if we believe the account of Pro—
copius, ' while the army was on its march in pursuit of Gillimere
who was afterwards led captive to Justinian by his general, Belli-
sarius, it halted near the Numedian frontier, where a sculptured
stone was found, whereon was written or engraved in Punic—i.e.
Phoenician—characters, which nearly correspond with the Hebrew,
" We are the remnants of those tribes who ?ed before the robber
Joshua, the son of Nun." '
In those early days Africa was known and famous amongst the
then civilized portion of the world, and the Assyrians and Baby-
lonians were among its earliest conquerors, so that about sixty-seven
years after the destruction of the Temple, we are told, in Esther i. 1,
that Ahasuerus, the king of Assyria, reigned from India unto
Ethiopia, over one hundred and seven and twenty provinces. And
since the King of Egypt was considered lord of the people of
Ethiopia or Soudan, we read in Isaiah that the 'king of Assyria
led away the Ethiopians captive, young and old, naked and bare-
footed, to the shame of Egypt.' Northern Egypt then was the most
known portion of the globe, and into it vast immigration took place
from time to time, even to the most remote period. The ten tribes
of Israel, after they were left to follow the dictates of their own
mind, and during the commotion and destructive warfare which
ensued, to escape utter extermination, migrated, according to the
usage of the times, in vast numbers into various countries, but
principally into Northern Africa, as it then presented the safest and
easiest route. Once settled, every commotion and intestine war had
the most powerful effect of inducing these migratory bands to shift
their abode still furtherf'E and so lose all connexion with the other
branch of the tribe. As hundreds of years pass on, and generation
after generation roll away, they lose a great many of their habits
and customs, becoming more amalgamated with the population with
which they associate. But when Mohammedanism overspread

another religion, the Israelitish descendants, or the inhabitants
occupying the central portion of Africa, passed forward, seeking
shelter to the south and west; a part, namely those from the east
central, crossing the Binue or J oliba branch of the Niger, descended
gradually southward, and became intermingled with the original
inhabitants. Protected from incursion on the north by the Binue
River, and quietly settled between the Great Niger and Old Kalabar
Rivers, they remained in peace, and grew from one generation to
another in idolatry, but still leaving tangible proofs in the form of
their religion of the J udaistic origin of the inhabitants.
After this slight digression, we will now proceed to investigate more
particulars relative to the tribes under consideration. The language,
or the little of it that is known, is full of Hebraisms ; the construc-
tions of sentences, the verbal signi?cations, the mode of comparison,
atherthefollowingfromMr. Kcelle's 'PolyglottaAfricana,'p. 18: 'The original
?omeof the Fulbe orPthawas in Lilubawa, nearFuta Loro, whose inhabitants
are called Toronko, and where they have been often molested by Ka?rs. To
escape this molestation they went gradually towards the east, in the capacity
of nomadic shepherds, till they arrived at Hausa. . . . After they had been
tending their ?ocks a long time in those forests and grass-?elds, without
towns, and subsisting simply on the produce of their herds, one of their
priests, of the name of Fodie, had an apparition of the Prophet Mohammed,
which was destined to form a most signal epoch in the history of Phula, and
indeed in the history of the whole of Central and Western Africa. In this
apparition Fodie was informed that the whole of that beautiful country '
around them, with all its populous towns and countless villages, belonged to
the believers in the Prophet, to wit the Phula; and that it was Fodie's
divine commission, with the hel of the faithful, to wrest all those ?owery
plains, those fruitful hills, and ovely valleys, from the hand of the Ka?rs,
and then to bring all the Ka?rs into subjection to the Islam, and to devote
to the sword everyone who refused to believe. Almost beside himself with
enthusiasm, and burning with fanaticism, Fodie summoned the believing
Fulbe, from every country to the very coast of the Atlantic, to rally around
his banner, and to ?ght with him the battle of the Prophet for the subjuga-
tion of all the Ka?r tribes of Africa to the religion of God and his Prophet.
And, like an electric shock, this message of Fodie ervaded all the lands
where Phula were sojourning ; and with a magica power converted the
shepherds into warriors. Soon Fodie was himself surrounded by an army
convinced of its own invincibility, and thirsty for the battle. Thus com-
menced those extraordinary Phula movements in Central Afria, which,
though unrecorded on the pages of our universal histories, are yet written in
streams of blood on the pages of the real natural history of our race, in which
every human action records itself. On the spot where Fodie had his appari-
tion, he afterwards built the town of Sokoto, now the great centre of Phula.

are all typical of the Hebrew. Like the Hebrew, from a single root
of verbs and other elementary parts of speech, substantives, adjectives
and adverbs are formed; and of the declension of nouns, the Rev.
J. F. Schon, Linguist to the Church Missionary Society, whilst
writing of the cases, said there are none in the sense they appear in
Latin, and consequently there are no declensions; but there are
cases in the sense ' in which it is applied in the Hebrew language—
namely, that form of nouns to which are appended or su?ixed the
attributive or possessive pronoun.' Well might a writer in the
African Times, when writing on the subject of ' Black, the Original
Colour of the White Race,' ?nish his article with the following
addeuda: 'The Isthmus of Suez plays an important part in the
history of Africa and the Ethiopian race. Ancient mythology has
proved that through it extensive migratory movements took place
several thousand years ago from Asia Minor to Africa. From a
little study of the ethnology of the language of Western Africa and
the Hebrew tongue, one is involuntarily brought to trace out a
similarity in one of them to that of the tribes which, from dis-
obedience to the will of God, were dispersed, and the greatest num-
ber of them possibly went to Africa—I mean the 10st tribes of
Israel. If the rites and ceremonies of the religion of the tribes
bordering on the banks of the River Niger be closely examined and
compared with the religion of the Hebrews at the earliest period—
viz., Egbo, Ebo (Heber, Eber) tribe; if the Egbo (Heber, Eber)
language, with all its corruptions, be compared with that of the
Hebrews, and if the peculiar disposition of the Hebrew tribes, as
detailed in Scripture, and that of the Egboes be properly investi~
gated, there will be (2 prim-i reasons for a serious inquiry whether
the Egbo tribe, which is but a branch of the Galla tribe in the
interior, is the offspring of the lost tribes of Israel, driven down from
Central Africa, and forced to cross the eastern or Binue branch of
the Niger, by Mohammedan fanaticism.'*
The Church Missionary Society has commenced to labour
among this tribe, under the superintendence of the Right Rev.
Bishop Crowther. The Rev. J. C. Taylor has translated the whole

RESOURCES OF THE EMPIRE OF THE EBOES.
of the books of the New Testament into the Central or Isauma
dialect of Egboe, with a copious vocabulary. The people are now
gradually being taught to read. Many have been converted from
heathenism to the true light of the Gospel. At Bonny, the people
who formerly considered the inguanas as sacred to the gods, and
consequently worshipped them, had, by the latest account, taken a
decided step against the superstitious worship; and on Easter-day
this year (1867), through the in?uence of the young king, the chiefs
having renounced and declared the animal no longer sacred, it was re-
solved that the town should be cleared of them. The whole town, men,
women, and children, at once set about their destruction, and within
a few hours no less than ?fty-seven were counted in only one market
place. It is certain that if the work of educating, Christianizing, and
civilizing the people be vigorously taken up, within a very short
time astonishing improvements will be recorded.
The resources of this extensive empire have not yet been de-
veloped; at present it is the largest and most constant market for
palm-oil on the whole western shore of Africa, and if proper
means of transport from the interior be introduced, the present
rate of shipment will be quadrupled within a very short time. Be-
sides palm-oil, the land produces abundantly shea butter, yams,
Guinea corn, kola-nut, cocoa, beans, banana, plantain, ground-nuts,
and many other important plants. An important mineral has been
discovered within this region, large lumps of lead-ore containing
silver have been brought to the market and sold for a tri?e. Ac-
cording to the native statement, they are abundantly obtained near
Arufo, and found near the surface. A specimen of the ore was
analyzed in London, yielding the following result: ' Galena, or lead
ore, sixteen hundredweight of lead (equal to eighty per cent.) and
three ounces of ?ne silver to the ton of twenty hundred weight.'
Camwood ivory, native-made cloth, and impure carbonate of soda
are abundantly found in the interior. In many places large blocks
of quartz rock are found. Dr. Baikie described some near Bird's
Island ' composed of mica slates, partly altered by the action
of ?re; the top covered with scales of mica, re?ecting beautifully
the rays of light, causing a shining silvery appearance.' Where
quartz and other silurian rocks are found, as in the Gold Coast and

interior regions of Sierra Leone, it is almost admitted that gold
enters into the composition of the soil. May we not, therefore,
advance the opinion that if the geology of this part of the Coast
be properly examined, gold might be found in the composition of the
earth?
In the foregoing we have seen that the Egboe nationality is
divided into numerous independent tribes, governed by their own
laws, but having one national sentiment; that they are still bar-
barous, unlettered, unchristian, and imbued with a vast idolatrous
superstition. The question arises how is it possible to form an inde-
pendent, united, Christian, and civilized nation, having the same
laws and governed by one imperial head. This at once presents a
question of vast importance and great dif?culty. In the ?rst place,
the seat of the ab initio Government should not only be near to, or
on, the sea-coast, but also be a place of commercial importance.
Bonny, having all the advantages above described, is most adapted
for the commencement of such an important undertaking; but there
are serious prejudices among the neighbouring tribes, which would
present great obstacles to their union under the leadership of its
king. The chiefs composing the di?erent sections in that country
are very jealous of one another, and particularly of the reigning
dynasty, and to effect an agreement on this point an individual
from without should be elected by the universal vote of not only the
kings and chiefs of Bonny, but also the kings and chiefs of all the
neighbouring towns.* The elected individual must of necessity be well
acquainted with the different departments of a political government,
and capable of introducing such institutions, with such modi?ca-
tions as would suit the conditions of the governed. A treaty of
unity, or of alliance o?ensive and defensive, should, in the ?rst
place, be entered into by all the various kings and chiefs in the
neighbouring provinces.
The next, and most important, consideration would be the
raising of a suf?cient revenue to carry out the various improve-
ments which it will be found absolutely necessary to make, and this

he must do by giving the greatest encouragement to trade, by
facilitating through every means in his power an increase of the trade
of the country, and a trade in new articles of commercial value;
thus pouring into the country an increased amount of capital.
Education on a large and comprehensive scale should be made
the base of the future progress of the Government. Whilst the
alphabetical system of Professor Leptius, of Berlin, adopted by the
Foreign Missionary Society for the translation of African and other
unlettered languages, is both comprehensive and useful, I think it
answers more for philological researches than for an easily-written
language. The numerous accents with which it abounds for conveying
different sounds, is a great barrier against its general adoption, and
for a system which will be applicable for correspondence, the French
Alphabetical Standard, with slight modi?cation, and suf?cient prac-
tice to familiarize one's self with the peculiar gradation of sounds,
will be the easiest and most advantageous. In the meantime, how-
ever, the labours of the Revds. Schon and Taylor should receive due
consideration and attention. Education should be made compulsory,
by a convention, signed by all the chiefs, that every child between
the ages of seven and fourteen should attend school. This would
materially improve, not only the present, but particularly the future
generation. From the very commencement, great attention should be
paid to the education and civilization of the female population.
Their position in society should be well de?ned, and no arbitrary in-
fringement on their rights should be tolerated; for it is they who, in
their respective spheres, would become the best expounders of civi-
lization to the subsequent generation, and by their immense in?uence
on the growing population, would greatly assist in advancing educa-
tion and in breaking down the barrier of ignorance between the
di?'erent masses of the population. In every town there should
be one or more schools, according to its extent and amount of
population, and every facility should be given both to teachers
and scholars.
The education of the people should not be limited to those
small schools thus established, but advantage should be taken of the
civilization of the age, and arrangements be made with the various

civilized governments to bring up intelligent natives of the country
in mechanics and manufacturing arts. The elementary, but useful,
mechanical arts should ?rst be patronized. A number of young men
should be sent to Sierra Leone, under the protection of the Local Go-
vernment, to be brought up as carpenters, painters, shoemakers,
tailors, masons, coopers, and sawyers; to Senegal, as wheelwrights
and shipbuilders. The king elect should communicate with the
Secretary of the Church Missionary Society, through the Bishop of
the Niger, respecting the best means of enlarging and making their
establishment more e?icient; and also invite that most indefati'
gable body—the Basle German missionaries, whose admirable works
on the Gold Coast have been chronicled in another place—t0 form
establishments in the country, with this understanding, that although
at the present the parent committee of each society will be required
to bear the expenses of their respective establishments, yet still the
greatest endeavour of the State would be to unite the two (which
differ only in slight forms) into one Church, and make them entirely
independent and self supporting. Every encouragement should be
given to the Basle missionaries to form ef?cient mechanical and in-
dustrial institutions.
Agriculture should be encouraged in every particular, a ?xed
plan laid down by the Government, and in every large town a
model garden of plants established, where the art of cultivating
scienti?cally should be taught by proper agriculturalists. Facili-
ties should be offered to the population at such a rate as to
remunerate them for their labour, and, at the same time, create
a demand for the articles- Consequently, it will not only be
necessary to introduce new commercial plants, but also of great
value to improve and extend those either indigenous to the
country or already naturalized. For effectually carrying out
this plan, good roads must be made throughout the country, and
mechanical contrivances must be resorted to for communicating
with and carrying away the produce from the interior to the point
of export.
But to ensure the establishment of a ?rm central Government in
such a primitive state of existence, it will be found necessary that

FORMATION or A NATIONAL ARMY. 195
the responsible power should in a great measure be vested in the
king elect for at least a time, although a representation of all the
chiefs in the bond should take place at certain ?xed periods to dis-
course on State matters. This Government should be the starting-
point for the regeneration of the interior of the Egboe tribe. The
more ?rm, strong, and conciliatory are its measures, the greater
in?uence would it exercise over surrounding tribes, and the more
easily would they rally around it. Let the civilization of those tribes
near the seaboard be well secured, and those small divided states in
the interior would of themselves seek protection from the stronger
Government. If we see this accomplished in bloody Ashantee and
Dahomy, both of whom rose from a tri?ing state, how much more
shall we see it in a kingdom based on religious principle and on the
civilization of the nineteenth century!
When once established, the king's authority should not be easily
gainsayed by any turbulent and refractory chief. He must make
himself powerful enough to be feared, whilst at the same time
respected—in fact, he must be supported by a small, but strong,
standing army, composed of every grade in the country, and
armed with the latest improved weapon. This body would be the
nucleus for the formation of an ef?cient army. The necessity
of such an establishment is su?iciently evident, because without
it he will ?nd it impossible to govern the several wild and
lawless tribes, to curb down the turbulent spirit which the natural
tendency of their minds seems always to point to, and to keep
in union the different heterogeneous but dissimilar elements which
enter into the composition of his kingdom. But the military
should not be of such a number as to embarrass the ?nancial
condition of the country, nor of the type which the poet thus de-
picted:—
Mouth without hands, maintained at vast expense;
In peace a charge, in war a weak defence ;
Stout once a month they march, a blustering band,
And ever, but in time of need, at hand.
By the assistance of the energetic Basle missionaries and discharged
soldiers, a form of drill would easily be drawn up in the native

language, and the men taught accordingly, who might ultimately
prove of great service in the organization of local militia through-
out the country.
Another very important consideration should not be overlooked
-—viz., the encouragement, as much as possible, of emigration from
without. Nothing tends more to the civilization of a barbarous
country than the immigration of civilized individuals into it; they
give greater impulse to the industry of the country, and offer
examples to the mass of' the population ; and among so imitative and
emulative a people the result would no doubt be very good. Every
means should therefore be encouraged to ensure their proper loca-
tion. It is impossible for a nation to civilize itself ; civilization must
come from abroad. As was the case with the civilized continents of
Europe and America, so it must be with Africa ; which cannot be an
exception to the rule. Lately, when the argument has been raised to
leave Africa to itself, it was surmised, even by men who took great
interest in its welfare, ' that possibly mercantile intercourse would
be suf?cient to civilize the savage races of Africa '—a doctrine
which has been disproved in every part of the world where the
merchant's sole purpose is to acquire a fortune, and where he is
not restrained in his actions by a civilized Government. And so
we ?nd them adopt the habits—whether good or bad—of the
inhabitants with whom they commingle and trade, or, as Captain
Burton has it, 'the white man, after a certain length of resi-
dence, grew black, not in complexion, but in disposition, and be—
coming a perfect dupe to charms, necromancers, &c., put more
trust in such things than the wiser sort of natives.' And where
trade is carried on in the mere exchange of goods for produce,
as in these parts, the intercourse, although it may continue for
several centuries, will not have any material eifect in the civilization
of the people.
But to prove more conclusively the statement that civilized mer—
chants in a savage country, without the in?uence of a civilized Go-
vernment to correct their action, rather retard than encourage
civilization, I will quote an example from the work of Dr. Baikie,
the particulars of an ordinary occurrence in the Brass River, leaving
unnoticed any such cases as have been brought before the

Bench at Liverpool, and publishedin public journals: 'As an ex-
ample of the conduct at times of these civilized people, I will relate
what had occurred in Brass River very shortly before this period.
A white trader, then agent for an English house, had, out of a mere
freak, ordered a native who came on board his ship one day to be
seized and ?ogged. This lad's father, however, was a man of con-
sequence on shore, and, on hearing of this outrage, be summoned
his friends, and in two large canoes attacked and boarded the ship
The white captain armed his Kruboys with muskets, but they, un-
willing to quarrel with the natives, or to ?ght in a bad cause, gave
way. The captain then retreated towards his cabin, but just as he
was entering it, violent hands were laid on him, and in the scuf?e he had
one of his thumbs nearly cutoff, was put into a canoe, taken on shore,
and fastened to a tree, where he was left for twelve hours, and the
natives said openly they would have killed him, but that they feared
a visit from an English man-of-war. This same individual trained
his Krumen to ?ght with the Krumen of the other trading ships in
the River, and, in short, endeavoured to carry on his trading by
brute force. Such transactions as these were formerly of daily
occurrence, but now, fortunately, they occur but rarely; but what
can be expected of native tribes who see before them deeds which would
disgrace a very savage, committed by so-called civilized men .9 ' It must
be remembered that the English are considered the mildest of all
civilized nations in their dealings with savage nations; but if among
them we ?nd men capable of such barbarity, what civilization must
they expect from other nations, and how many centuries will it re—
quire for their civilization by merchants ".1
One of the things to be established as early as possible is a ?xed
currency for the kingdom. Nothing binds the different commercial
elements of a country so much as a common national currency, so
that the erection of a mint, by which the inhabitants could have a
determined and regular copper, silver, or gold coinage, would certainly
lead to paramount results.
In the foregoing pages I have endeavoured to point out the best
and only means of bringing a savage, barbarous race into the em-
ployments of civilized Christian life, and, in particular, the best mode
of eifecting the unity and civilization of the tribes within the boun-

dary of the Egboe empire ; but to form a permanent union, accom-
modated to the opinions and wishes of the inhabitants of the various
states, differing provincially in habits, manners, and internal govern-
ment, would be found a work of such magnitude that nothing but
time and re?ection, together with a disposition to conciliate, could
mature and accomplish it.

PART III.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE VARIOUS
COLONIES AND SETTLEMENTS.

CHAPTER XIV.
REQUIREMENTS OF SIERRA LEONE.
1.—The ?rst Improvement which is loudly called for, is the extension
of the Franchise of the Colony.
The Government of Sierra Leone is de facto a self-supporting
Government, and the amount of improvement exhibited by the
inhabitants entitles them to have a voice in their administrative esta-
blishment. 'Nothing in defence could be urged that this or that
measure is in advance of the Colony; the Colony was quite ripe for
such improvements, the revenue was large, and the intelligence of
the people advancing. The time had arrived for an extension of
immunities; other Colonies of later years and with a much less
revenue and intelligence were politically in advance of this; they
had their representatives in the legislative halls of a suf?cient
number to represent their interests. . . . With respect to an ex-
tended franchise, it is most desirable that the Legislative Council of
the Colony should be opened to three or four members from the
people, made eligible for their seats by being elected and sent there
by the people as their representatives. It should be remembered
that the people were ready and willing to keep up taxation in order
to support the institutions of the Colony, and I do not see why they
do not have a voice in the administration of affairs. In short, it

was the very principle of the British Constitution that those who
were liable to be assessed should have a voice in the administration.'*
At present almost the whole of the members of the Legislative
Council are Government of?cials ; there are only two who may be
regarded as independent members, one alone of whom represents
the people. His single vote would not upset any obnoxious ordin-
ance introduced into the Council, which might affect the well-being
of the Colony. In his position he is almost a cipher; he might
give his vote, but it would prove ineffectual for the purpose. There
ought to be more representatives, nominated by public votes of
the citizens, to represent their (the tax-paying inhabitants) in-
terests in the Council, who should endeavour to turn the expenditure
of the revenue to the material advancement of the Colony. The whole
Colony should be divided into districts, and each should be repre-
sented by one or two members.
There are, at present, insurmountable dif?culties in the formation
of a General Legislative Assembly for the whole Coast at Sierra
Leone. It has been argued that it will defeat the general plan of
the head of the Coast Government; that the administrators were
merely lieutenants of the Governor-General, and were strictly
to follow the instructions, whether they be good for or detrimental'
to the interests of the several Colonies; that the Colonies were
poor, and consequently whatever bills might pass the Assembly
would be dif?cult to carry out, simply on account of the want of
suf?cient revenue; that, in fact, it would be removing the power
from the Governor-General and transferring it to a number of mer-
chants. Again, the time of the opening of the Assembly would
more or less interfere with business, as it is well known that those
who would be nominated would be connected personally with busi-
ness. If the appointed time be during the rains, it would be found
that the merchants in the palm-oil districts would be too much oc-
cupied to be called away, and that at that season Freetown is too
unhealthy to encourage visitors. If, on the other hand, it is
opened during the healthy or dry season, from December to March,

EDUCATIONAL AND ECCLESIASTIC IMPROVEMENTS. 201
it will be found to interfere with the trade in ground-nuts, and no
one in that region would think of sacri?cing his business to at-
tend it, as competition in that trade is very great. Thus, therefore,
a general Legislative Assembly for the whole Coast is, for the pre-
sent, not feasible; but the time will come, if every opportunity is
taken to improve the country, when it will be more acceptable.
It stands to reason, however, that the inhabitants of Sierra
Leone who are heavily taxed should have a voice in the delibe-
ration of the Legislative Council, and the regulation of the revenue.
II.—General Improvement in the Educational and Ecclesiastical
Department of the Colony.
It cannot be denied that the greatest regenerative in?uence in this
department is the Church Missionary Society. They support at pre-
sent a college at Fourah Bay, a grammar-school in Freetown, and
a large female educational institution, besides several village
schools. They have, in?nitely more than the Government and
than any other religious body, laboured earnestly for the diffusion
of useful knowledge in the Colony, and to their untiring exertion is
due that degree of improvement which is now to be observed in the
Colony of Sierra Leone. It is evident from their yearly report that
they could not continue this support for a much longer period, whilst
the Colony has grown to be self-supporting, and a large ?eld is open
to them elsewhere to do good; and therefore it is necessary that the
people and the Local Government should take up the work they have
so admirably done.
We want a University for Western Africa, and the Church Mis-
sionary Society has long ago taken the initiative and built an ex-
pensive college, which should now be made the focus of learning for
all Western Africa. The yearly expenses of that Society for educa-
tion are now 4,700l.,* which falls short of their former expenditure,
whilst the total sum expended by the Local Government for this pur-
pose is not far above 400l. The result is that the educational de-
partment of the Colony is greatly on the decline every year, and
more support is consequently required; but the local authorites re-
* Col. Ord's Re ort on the Condition of the British Settlements, West-
Coast of Africa— ierra Leone.

fuse to give this, although they liberally spend 14,0001. yearly
merely for police.
A super?cial consideration of the theory of the Local Govern-
ment for the limitation of its efforts in this important direction—
viz., that extensive funds have long been, and still are being, ap-
propriated for that object from other sources, and, consequently,
it could not be so until the aid is withdrawn, as reported by Colonel
Ord—is so alluring and attractive that it requires a long residence
in the Colony to prove that it is most unsound; and should the
recommendation of the Chamber of Commerce, that a portion of the
revenue be yearly voted for general education, not be adopted, it
will be one of the greatest barriers to the general improvement con-
templated by the Imperial Government.
Fourah Bay College should henceforth be made the University
of Western Africa, and endowed by the Local Government, which
should guarantee its privileges, and cherish the interests of literature
and science in the Colony. A systematic course of instruction
should be given to the students, and regius professors appointed;
for it is high time to abolish that system of Lancastrian school-
boy teaching, and a professor should be appointed to one or two sub-
jects, and should give lectures on the results of extensive reading
and research. The subjects will be better mastered by the teachers
themselves, and the students would reap largely the bene?t.
Lectures should be given in the theory and practice of education,
classics, mathematics, natural philosophy, mensuration, and book-
keeping; English language and literature; French, German,
Hebrew, history in general, mineralogy, physiology, zoology,
botany, chemistry, moral and political philosophy, civil and com-
mercial law, drawing and music, besides the various subjects which
might be included under the term of theology.
But the study of the physical sciences, which are closely con-
nected with our daily wants and conveniences, should form an essen-
tial part of the curriculum, as they cultivate the reasoning faculties
Algebra, arithmetic, differential calculus, trigonometry, and geo-
metry, besides being useful in every day life, remedy and cure
many defects in the wit and intellectual faculties; 'for if the wit,'
as remarked by Lord Bacon, ' be too dull, they sharpen it; if too

FORMATION OF FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. 203
wandering, they ?x it; if too inherent in the sense, they abstract it.
So that, as tennis is a game of no use of itself, but of great use in
respect it maketh a quick eye, and a body ready to put itself into
all positions, so with mathematics, that use which is collateral and in-
tervenient is no less worthy than that which is principal and in-
tended.' The Commissioners of Public Schools in England, referring
to the study of physical science, justly remarked in their report that
'it quickens and cultivates directly the faculty of observation, which
in very many persons lies almost dormant through life, the power
of accurate and rapid generalization, and the mental habit of method
and arrangement; it familiarises them with a kind of reasoning which
interests them, and which they can promptly comprehend; and it is,
perhaps, the best corrective for that indolence which is the vice of
half-awakened minds, and which shrinks from any exertion that is
not like an effort of memory, merely mechanical.'
In fact, the whole Colony should be divided into educational dis-
tricts. In each there should be a free grammar-school, where
scholars should be prepared either for a foundation school, to be esta-
blished in the city, or for the University. Each district should
tax itself according to its capabilities for the support of these
free schools; and boys who have shown a good degree of intel-
lectual progress in a parochial school should be sent there.
In every village there should be a parochial establishment, assisted
by the Government, and not dependent entirely on the paltry sums
collected at the school. The schoolmasters should be better paid,
so that a better class of men might be obtained as teachers, and the
schools visited yearly by Government agents, to see that the rules
and regulations are properly carried out.
The Government should also establish a preparatory school at
Freetown for the express purpose of training up teachers, or forming
a corps of well-trained teachers, who should give instruction both
in the theory and in the practical application of the sciences; if very
pro?cient in studies some might be transferred to the University.
But before admittance as Government or gratuitous pupils, they must
bind themselves to remain in the preparatory school for a stated time
and pass a rigid examination. This school could be made to receive
paying pupils also, the Government only supporting those who are

intended for teachers in the public schools, and who should under-
take to devote themselves for ten years at least to public instruc-
tion; and thus a set of well-trained and educated teachers would be
obtained, which would supply the schools of the whole of Western
Africa. It will not be out of place if a minister or o?icer of public
instruction be created, with suitable councils, to regulate and im-
prove the educational branch, not only of the Colony of Sierra
Leone, but also of the other Colonies in Western Africa; he should
form one system of education for all the public schools, and should
see that the instructions for the guidance of teachers are properly
carried out. In these schools prizes and certi?cates of honour
should be offered to the most meritorious and deserving students.
The neglect of the West African Colonies as regards the educa-
tion of the natives by the Government, as the Rev. Henry Venn re-
marks, 'contrasts unfavourably with many of the British Colonies,
which have established grammar-schools and colleges for the pur-
pose of securing a high standard of education. The Colony of the
Mauritius, in addition to such establishments, has annually granted
an exhibition of one thousand pounds, open to competition by all
races, to enable the successful candidate to proceed to England, and
graduate at one of the Universities. Had this principle been
adopted at Sierra Leone, and natives of promising abilities been
sent over to complete their education in England, it would only
have given the native race their fair chance of achieving a high
position in the service of the Crown.'
The native pastorate* constitutes the Established Church, at least
* The native pastorate has unfortunately been laced in a most dif?-
cult condition by its parental head, and it excites t e wonder and admira-
tion of every one who studies its working how it has been able to exist.
It is most likely that the parent committee had the idea that the pastorate
would begin under hard and trying dif?culties, so that when a greater
laxity of privileges should be granted, the whole working of the system would
go on with ease and success. At present, with the exception of Kissy and
Regent parishes, all the most ?ourishing churches are under the supervision
of the parent committee, and are not included in the pastorate ; it has no
representative church in Freetown under the immediate control of the
bishop of the diocese ; and as the whole of the wealth of Sierra Leone is at
Freetown, it is a cat drawback to its ?nancial success. Having no imme-
diate interest in t at body, we ?nd that the wealthy merchants are luke-
warm and sparing in their donations; Kissy-road, Pademba-road, Wilber-
force, and Waterloo are still under the parent committee. But we hope

of Sierra Leone, and the Local Government should now bring it
into the same pale, and allow it those grants and privileges which
are necessary to keep up the Church of the State.
They should divide the Colony into parishes, recognized by the
Government, and should appoint vestrymen, who would guard the
interests of the Church, and there should be a yearly assemblage or
convocation of all the ministers for the purpose of discussing
measures for the bene?t of the Church)"
The sum of 4,000l. votedyearly would even scarcely be su?icient
to supply the wants and requirements of the ecclesiastical and educa-
tional department of the Colony, but it could be made to answer for
the present—vim, 1,000l. for the native pastorate, and 3,0001. for
educational establishments. Of the latter, 1,000l. would be ample for
the part payment of principals and regius professors, who should
be selected by the Church Missionary Society, and should also
derive a fractional amount from their lectures. Two sections
should be formed, and the lectures delivered during each of them,
and the students pay a certain sum for their tickets to each lecture,
as is done in other universities.
III.—-The Formation of a Municipal Council.
The time is perfectly ripe when Sierra Leone should have a town
corporation, since the existence of such a body in a country is a
true sign of advance in political matters, and we hope that no
narrow-minded prejudice will prevent its immediate establishment.
The Gold Coast once formed themselves into a corporate body,
through the recommendation of Sir Benjamin Pine, which did a
that ere many months have elapsed the committee will adopt the wise and
all-important step of handing over one or other of the two parishes at Free-
town to the native pastorate. At present that venerable society has voted
250l. for the erection of a native pastorate church in the city, but it will
re uire about 1,500l. at least for its completion ; we have, therefore, to
100 to the liberality of the merchants and the inhabitants generally for
its speedy erection.
' Since writing the above a local ordinance of great importance has been
assed in the Legislative Council, hearing date July 3, 1867, by which a
ard of Education has been formed. The Colonial Government granted
towards education, at least for the time, 800l., which is a decided advance
on the precedin years ; but how has it been applied ? 3001. went towards
the payment of nspector of Schools, 150l. towards the clerk, and most likely
50L towards stationeries, of?ce-boy, &c., leaving a balance only of 3001.
towards the subject matter of the ordinance.

great deal of good amongst the population, but which was made
null and void by Mr. Andrews, during his short career as Governor
of that place. Sierra Leone, from its rate of mortality and the
necessity for a vigilant sanitary police, requires a town council and
a medical registrar. These would root out the pernicious causes
of the diseases in the Colony, relieve the police-court of a
great many of its cases and of?cers, and, consequently, save the
Colony a fair sum of money. The bene?t derived from the sum-
monses, ?nes, &c., after paying all expenses, should be used entirely
for renovating the town, clearing it of ?lth and dirt, &c. We
hope that this will be among the ?rst measures taken by the
executive authorities.
It is almost impossible to understand why each successive Governor
shuts his eyes against the formation of a municipal council; it is
the very ?rst step by which a people can be made accustomed to
manage their own- affairs. The charter of the Colony has always
provided for it, although, virtually, the local Government has never
acted on it. (See Sir Benjamin Pine's Evidence in Parliamentary Com-
mittee, 1865. Quest. 3,052.)
IV.—The Transfer of the Registrar of Births, Marriages, and
Deaths from the Legal to the Medical Profession, and the Establish-
ment of a Health O?icer.
The bene?cial result which will arise from this transfer cannot be
overrated. Ever since the formation of this of?ce, the population
have been kept perfectly ignorant of the rationale of the registration
-—viz., the rate of mortality, the different causes of death, the pro-
portion of births to deaths, the amount of legitimate or illegitimate
births, the causes of periodic endemic diseases; in fact, there has
never been a generalized summary published, weekly, monthly, half-
yearly, or yearly, for the bene?t of those for whose interest the
of?ce is established. At present the of?ce is in the hands of a legal
gentleman, and it is certainly impossible for the legal mind to classify
diseases, to trace their causes, and to point out their remedy. This
truth is acknowledged in England, where none but medical men
have the appointment. The books in the of?ce, as it now stands,
are almost a dead letter to the population, but which might here-
after be used for reference, and may serve as a means for drawing

PROTECTION or THE MERCHANTS IN THE RIVERS. 207
up a comparative statement of the health of the Colony at various
periods.
Lately a Board of Health has been formed, composed of the
leading merchants and of?cials in the Colony, presided over by the
colonial surgeons. A non-medical gentleman (1) is appointed In-
spector of Nuisances, to report to the board the necessary improve-
ments that ought to be made in the sanitary condition of Freetown.
But the city is so large that it is impossible for only one man, or
one board so constituted, to bring a sufficient pressure on different
localities so as properly to clean it of ?lth and dirt. The city ought
to be divided into parishes, and each parish appoint its own board,
which should receive full authority from the Government to act,
and each board should appoint its own inspector of nuisances, who
should report to it the state of the parish, and recommend various
improvements, which, being sanctioned by the Government, would
certainly be carried into effect. According to the present arrange-
ments there is very little hope that an effectual sanitary reform
would be the result; and the present ordinance, so far as the general
good is concerned, is a stepping-stone to a more enlightened
ordinance.
V.—-The Extension of Colonial (British) Protection to the Mer-
chants in the Rivers in the Neighbourhood of Sierra Leone, and con-
sequently the Extension of the Custom-o?ce to those Places.
It must be very provoking to think that nearly within gunshot of
the barracks at Freetown, British merchants could receive no pro-
tection from the Government; that they could be tried and ?ogged
by the natives, and their goods con?scated, without receiving any
redress from the local authority, as is exempli?ed in the late out-
break iu Mellicourie River. Proper steps should now be taken to
prevent such disturbances, and the merchants, I think, are perfectly
ready to pay into the Colonial coifer duties on goods landed in those
Rivers, should they be guaranteed protection.
Most of the chiefs of those places have broken faith with the
Government, have maltreated British merchants, have been con-
quered by our arms in different engagements, and have asked
protection from us. Will it not be right that we should give them
that which will be a boon to the Colony? 1 think it is time that

these trading ports should be made an integral part of Sierra
Leone, since the merchants do more extensive business there than
in the Colonies.
But we ?nd that after all the letters and petitions of the mer-
chants at Mellicourie, the Local Government would have nothing to
say in the matter, although, as we have observed in page 98, this
country has made a most rapid advance in improvement and civili-
zation since Sierra Leone traders have made it a port. Many of
the French merchants residing in the Colony have large interests in
Mellicourie, and ?nding that they receive no redress from the natives
for the losses they sustained, and that no representation to the local
authorities in the Colony would move them to make a pressure on
the marauders, they, after waiting for nearly two years, were com-
pelled to apply to their Government for the desired assistance,
which immediately took the matter in hand. It is certain that
Mellicourie will ultimately become a French station. Unless the
Foreign Of?ce assumes its rights, the merchants of the Colony will
gradually be turned away from it, and, being in close proximity to
the Colony, we shall thus, through excessive inertia, allow a Euro-
pean Power to be established so near to our doors as to enact those
inconveniences which we are now crying against and endeavouring
to remedy in our settlements on the Gold Coast with the Dutch
Government. This very occupation of the French is against all
treaty, as in the archives of the Colony of Sierra Leone, vol. 2, p.
305, Ordinances, Royal Charters, Treaties, &c., we have the full
text of a treaty signed by the Acting-Governor of Sierra Leone,
and the kings and chiefs of the Moriah Land, and entered into on
the 18th day of April, 1826, by which the latter ceded over 'the
full, entire, free, and unlimited sovereignty, right, title, and posses-
sion, in and over all the seas, rivers, harbours, &c., of their respec-
tive territories, from Conta in the South to Ferighna in the North;'
and yet in the face of this the Government of Sierra Leone could
rest quietly, unheeding all remonstrances from the chiefs of the dis-
trict, and allow the French to come and quietly seat themselves, and
afterwards, through their protective system of trade, turn away the
British merchants who have laboured to improve the trade. The
following is the full text of the treaty :—

all such may carry onv their trade in such manner as they think
proper.
' Provides and guarantees to- the Acting-Governor of Sierra

roads to all British subjects, strangers, merchants, &c., through
their respective countries, and for them to pass and repass "with
their retinue, goods, wares, and merchandise, &c., between the
Colony of Sierra Leone and the interior countries of Africa," and
that they " shall not be called upon or made to pay any duties,

It is necessary that the Gallinas, the Searcies, and Mellicourie,
should be united to the Colony, whose territorial boundary would then
be considered properly remodelled, and the administration of the
Government would be more e?icient and economical; the colony could
guarantee the merchants there suf?cient protection if a plan like the
following be adopted :—
Let a constabulary force of 100 men be enrolled, and paid by the
Colonial Government at the rate of ll. 10s. per month, for the ex-
press purpose, which should include all necessaries; let them be
preperly o?icered, and distributed at the rate of thirty to each

station; let the o?icer who would be the commandant be properly
paid, and be made also the Custom-house o?'icer in those Rivers,
with strict orders not to interfere in the native quarrels, but to pro-
tect British property. Each vessel as it proceeds up the River should
hand over its manifest to the safe care and keeping of the com-
mandant—should give him also an inventory of the goods in the
vessel, with their true value, and a written declaration attesting their
truth, and a bond signed that, should it prove false,-they were to be
liable to a heavy ?ne. They should be required to pay an ad
valorem duty on'all goods, withaspeci?c' duties on tobacco and
rum; it should be made optional to those who are well known in
the Colony to pay to the commandant-in cash- the amount of the
duty, or give an order to their principal at Freetown, and all
vessels coming within the'territorial boundary to trade should be
made to pay the ad valorem duty.
The communication with these different places would be very
easy ; a beat or a schooner could be sent from one place to the other;
and, as-there is always a-colonial steamer at: anchor, periodical
visits to- these places can be ensured.
Granting that the GovernorAGeneral has at his disposal an inter-
colonial steamer, according to the resolution of the House of Com-
mons. Committee on Western Africa, the steamer should be sent
monthly to these stations for the conveyance. of letters and orders,
and for the collection of the revenue from customs. The very fact
of this monthly visitation would-check any outbreak amongst the
natives.
What would be the result of these measures ".3—
1'. rllhat the revenue of 'the Colony would be greatly increased
and probably doubled.
2. That the British merchants would have proper protection.
3. That- the in?uence of the Colony would be greatly ex-
tended.

the River trade would at once undertake it.
5. That the resources of the country would be better developed.

advanced.

LIBERATED AFRICAN-S TO BE KEPT IN AFRICA. 213
VI.—The Abolition of the System of Sending the Liberated Africans
to the West Indies, and the Re-introduction of the Apprenticeship
System.
According to the present system of the Mixed Commission De-
partment, the recruits, as soon as they are landed from the slave-
ships, are sent to the Government yard at Kissy, where they are
kept for two, three, or even four years, until they have escaped three
chances of being sent to the West Indies. In the Government yard
they are kept in total ignorance and idleness, although they are fed
and clothed. They are not permitted to go to any school, nor are
they taught any useful mechanical works in the establishment; the
consequence is that when they leave they are seldom of any use to
themselves or anyone else. This system requires a radical change,
and the Colony requires their recruits more within the Colony than
out of it.
There should be formed an industrial establishment at- the menu-
tain village of Gloster, under the supervision of the Church Mission-
ary Society, paid from the imperial chest, where paid carpenters,
shoemakers, masons, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, 820., should be con-
tinually kept at work. The superintendent should be a practical
German mechanic, a type of those- of the Basle Missionaries at
Accra. The recruits should ?rst be sent to the Normal School at
Kissy, where, after learning to read and write for one year and
a-half, they should be sent to the Industrial School at Gloster to be
put to a trade, and be kept there for four or ?ve yearsymany of
these useful arts would thus be taught with great- advantage to the
Colony.
The establishment might be made partially self-supporting by
each department of trade being made to receive work from without,
through the superintendent; the tailors should be made to sew the
gaol clothes ; the carpenters could be put to Government building and
repairs, &c. The female recruits should be placed at Charlotte
School, and, after a year and a-half of training in needlework, read-
ing, and writing, be distributed amongst different families.
The Rev. Henry Venn, in his pamphlet on the West African
Colonies, whilst questioning the policy of removing liberated
Africans from the African Coast, as materially checking the civiliza-

tion of Africa, and retarding the grand scheme of extinguishing the
slave-trade by substituting native industry, justly remarks: ' The
present advancement of Sierra Leone is wholly due to the liberated
Africans located there upon their release from slave-ships. Separated
from all their old heathen associations. and brought under civilizing
and Christian in?uences, they have proved, as a body, tractable and
industrious. The testimony of Governor Ferguson, and of others,
establishes the truth of this. Bishop Crowther, and many of the
most wealthy native merchants, were liberated Africans. Many
hundreds of this class, after acquiring the Christian and civilized
habits of a British colony, have migrated to different parts of the
Coast as traders. The European traders, their rivals, are too often
accustomed to speak of them with bitter contempt and vituperation.
But the evidence of the naval o?icers, and of the better class of
European traders, gives a very different account of their character,
and of their in?uence with their countrymen; and represents them
as a hopeful element in the civilization of Africa.' With all these
evidences before them, the authorities have stopped the supply of
liberated Africans ; and vessels with captured slaves, after being
condemned by the Mixed Commission Court, are sent to the West
Indies. ' This policy is more to be regretted as the Colony of Sierra
Leone has lately obtained a large accession of territory in the Quiah
and Sherbo Countries,' to which immigration is very much wanted for
agricultural purposes.
VIL—The Formation of a Dry Dock in Freetown.
The material for forming a dry dock is abundant in Freetown,
and as there are no docks in the whole of Western Africa, I think
that if a proper one were formed it would be well patronised, and
bring a good revenue to the Government. This would of course re-
quire a large outlay, which would, however, be returned to the Local
Government in kind in the course of a few years.
Krew Bay would be the most ?tting place that could be selected,
and a yearly grant of 3,0001. or more would soon erect an extensive
dock which would be serviceable to men-of-war and merchant vessels,
and which would increase the knowledge of shipbuilding in the Colony.
But it is not only on account of position and ?tness that I should
urge the necessity of forming a dry dock there, but particularly

as it is the hotbed of malaria—the Golgotha and Gehenna of the
Western portion of the city. Consequently its formation would
lessen the high rate of mortality and destroy the miasma which has
devastated the population of the Colony. A Government dockyard
would be a most advantageous undertaking for the city and the
Coast. The French Government is building a similar dockyard at
Dakar, on the mainland of Goree.
VIII.——An Improvement of Buildings at the Sea Front of the City.
There is no town on the Coast in which the sea frontage gives so
dull and unhappy an appearance as Freetown, especially during the
rainy season. We ?nd here a tumble-down building, there a half—
?nished store; here broken rocks and upheavals of the earth, there
an inroad of the sea into the town. We ?nd nothing in a regular
form, but everything pell-mell.
In a former edition I proposed that an agreeable promenade
should be erected along the sea frontage of the city of Freetown,
but this would be a most eXpensive undertaking; an improvement,
however, can be made in the buildings. The Legislature should
step in and compel all holders of lands bordering on the River and
facing it to make proper repairs, or build according to a regular
plan furnished by the Government.
IX.—A System of General Supply of Water to Freetown should
be Adopted.
This must either be done by Government, or by a private com-
pany, but as the former is better able to do it, we hope that it will
not be long before it will make a beginning. In dealing with the
subject of the water supply in the Chamber of Commerce, Mr.
Walker remarked that it would not only be ornamental, but ex-
tremely useful in a sanitary point of view; it would supply the wants
of the thousands who weekly attend the market, and would more ef-
fectually clear the cesspools of their ?lth and dirt, and conse-
quently improve the general health of the Colony. It is a project
that could be most easily accomplished, as Freetown is on a gradual
slope from the hills, and several beautiful streams run down through
the town from the mountains. With very small outlay, reservoirs,
with pipes, could be easily laid down, and the water conducted into
the different parts where it might be required.

216 wss'r AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
-It is inconceivable that so large and ?ourishing a city as Freetown,
with apopulation of nearly 20,000 inhabitants, should still suffer
from the want of the supply of one of the most material ele-
ments of existence ; the outlay would be comparatively small,
and within a very short time it would produce a standing revenue to
the Government. The numerous prisoners which infest the gaol
could be advantageously employed for laying down the pipes
or building masonry reservoirs, which would immensely lessen the
expense. The authorities it is said have had for some time in con-
templation the carrying out of this most useful suggestion, which
we hope will soon become a fact.
X.---The Introduction of New Plants in the Mountain and other
Districts, which might become Sources of Pro?table Commerce to the
Colony.
In the description of the inhabitants of the Mountain and Sea
Districts of the Colony, I have shown that they are the poorest
and most contented in the Colony; that their means of making
money is most limited; that they are principally agricultural in
their habits—cultivating the common necessaries of life and supply-
ing the markets of Freetown with vegetables, &c.; that at one time
arrowroot was extensively cultivated by them, but on account of the
low prices offered for it in the market, it became unremunera-
tive. The aged population. is fast dying away, and the young
generation, ?nding nothing pro?table to occupy their time in the
district, either change their residence to the capital or emigrate
to other parts, and thus a yearly depopulation to a fearful extent
is going on. The country on the mountains, which once was cleared
and dotted with plantations of various sizes, is now covered with
thick jungles, and those places which twenty years ago were
covered with low trees, form now thick forest, so that gradually the
open plain ?elds of Sierra Leone are being converted into forest
lands. The only means by which this can be arrested will be the
introduction of new plants into the Colony (by the local authorities,)
which will be remunerative tothe planters. Not only should the best
specimens of native plants be ascertained and cultivated, but specimens
of plants growing in other tropical regions should be introduced. The
Curator of the Kew Gardens, the late Sir W. Hooker, had always


## p. 217 (#241) ############################################

ruaounorvra cacao, NOPAL PLANT, TOBACCO. 217
urged the necessity of' introducing new plants in Africa, and was
ready, and so his son also now is, to supply the specimens;
but 'there is no record of any such attempts on the part of the
Government to develop the natural resources of Africa, although
the native races are in that stage of civilization in which helps are
most needed, and they have proved themselves apt to take im-
mediate advantage of new sources of pro?t.' The Government
should therefore introduce such new plants, and encourage the cul-
tivation of the best specimens of such native plants, as would, in
course of time, be remunerative to the planters. '
The 'following plants might be amongst those which, if intro-
duced, would be bene?cial to the country and inhabitants :—
Theobroma Cacao, or the chocolate plant, which grows spon-
taneously in the West Indies and in the central regions of Ame-
rica, and which has been introduced and cultivated in the Mauritius
and the French Island of Bourbon, as well as lately in the Aquapim
Mountains of the Eastern District of the Gold Coast by the Basic
Missionaries, should certainly be one of the ?rst plants introduced
by the Government, as the climate and soil of the Mountain District
is well adapted for its cultivation. This will at once bring into the
market of Sierra Leone an article of high commercial value, and
also the richest and most nutritive kind of vegetable food for the
inhabitants of the Colony.
The Nepal Plant, or Opuntia Cochinellifera, which affords
nourishment to the cochineal insect, will be highly pro?table. It
grows within the same latitude of the colonies in Western Africa—
viz., in Peru and Mexico—and has been successfully introduced in
Teneriffe. Such is the value of the cochineal that at present more
than 500,0001. worth of the insect is annually exported from South
America. The introduction would be easily accomplished, as the
Governor of Teneriffe, if applied to, would certainly supply the
Governor-General with specimens.
Virginian Tobacco.—-The fact of tobacco growing wild in the
Mountain District is a certain proof that it will be very easy to
cultivate it, but the people should be taught the mode of properly
preparing it. An improvement should be made in the mode of cul-
tivating, and in the preparation of the numerous ?bre plants and

the indigo plant, which grow spontaneously in the forests of the
country. Full description and the mode of preparation should be
supplied to the people.
The above are only a few examples of new plants which might
be advantageously introduced into the Colony; but there are
others which grow in the East and West Indies, part of Mexico,
and South America, which might also be made the subject of
inquiry, and the action of a paternal Government might thus be
pro?tably used in encouraging an infant trade.
XI. Proper ZlIeasures for the Encouragement of Agriculture should
be Introduced in the Colony.
It is true, as remarks Mr. Venn, that although the Parlia-
mentary Committee of 1842 pointed out the neglect of the
Colonial Government in not promoting agriculture and esta-
blishing model farms, yet up to this day it has never been
attempted. ' The neglect of agriculture in these Colonies,' he says,
'is the great drawback upon their prosperity, and is often alleged
against them as a ?agrant reproach. One fact may be stated in
proof. Sierra Leone is supplied with rice, the staple article of
food, from the surrounding countries. When war breaks out, the
supply fails. For the last two or three years, in consequence of
internal wars, rice, which had been imported into England from
India, has been again sent out from England to supply the market
in Sierra Leone, though any quantity might have been grown in
the Colony itself! This neglect of agriculture arises chie?y from
the taint of African slavery. Agriculture in other parts of Africa
is carried on by slave labour. The free men of the British Colonies,
therefore, prefer any kind of trade or barter to agricultural labour.
Here, then, the Colonial Governments should have supplied the
remedy by establishing model farms, by prizes to successful pro-
ducers of agricultural produce, by public warehouses, where small
farmers might store their goods for shipment, and by various other
modes of instruction and encouragement.'
Mr. Rosenbush, in a letter to F. Fitzgerald, Esq., remarked that
the greatest requirement of the Colony is agriculture, and he re-
commends the establishment of a model farm by convict labour;
but, for this to be of service, botanical gardens should be attached to

it. ' At present,' he said, ' the characteristic feature of the inmates
of the gaol is to make the institution a kind of refuge.' Availing
themselves of the 'temporary leave of absence,' they go out, but
invariably soon return, on account of being worthless for honest
employment. In a model farm they would ?rst work to maintain
themselves, and, secondly, become acquainted with agriculture,
which might induce many to remove to parts where they were not
known, and endeavour to regain an honest position in life. The
expense of one farm could scarcely be more than the amount which
the establishment of the Colonial Government now costs, and it
would very soon become self-supporting. It should be open for
the inspection of everybody, in order to stimulate othersto follow
the useful employment of agriculturef"
I have stated above that this neglect of agriculture has been
alleged against the African peasant as a ?agrant reproach by many
Europeans who visit this Coast. These very calumniators of the
African peasantry, who have closely observed how laboriously the
peasantry of their country are obliged to work for their livelihood,
always forget that the position, wants, and requirements of the two
classes are extremely different. Their general saying runs thus:
'At home a peasant would labour for a whole day and would do
ten times the work these lazy fellows do. Your people are too
lazy; they have lands in abundance, which would. soon make them
rich if properly cultivated.' It is a fact which cannot be
doubted by anyone, that European peasants do by far more work
than the African peasant, but the conditions of the two people are
vastly di?erent. In England, for example, the lands are most un-
equally divided; the aristocrats are masters, and the peasants more
like mitigated serfs; in Africa the peasants are masters of the
lands, and can cultivate any extent for their own private purpose
without restriction. In England the number of the labouring class
exceeds the number of workmen required to occupy the various
necessary callings, and, consequently, those who have secured an
employment are obliged to work hard to keep their place and credit;
in Africa the contrary is just the case, the population is insuf?cient
" African Tames, August, 1865, p. 14.

220 wns'r AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
to cultivate the vast extent of lands by which they are surrounded,
and they have no credit to keep up nor-place to lose. In Eng-
land the labouring class is compelled to workhard before they can
be supplied with the necessaries of life, if not they must starve; in
Africa if a labouring man is unable to work, his neighbours supply
him with food, or go out and work the ?eld gratuitously for him,
or if well, he goes for a few weeks to his plantation, and without
much labour obtains in a few months from the fertile soil his year's
stock of provision. In fact, in England the/labouring class has
always great external pressure to bear upon them, demanding both
their moral and their physical strength; whilst the same class in
Africa has little or no external pressure to bear on them. In Eng-
land the food of the peasant is compound, expensive, and very
scarce; in Africa the food is simple, cheap, and plentiful. In
England the peasant is compelled by the state of civilization and
the necessity of the climate to procure clothing, which entails a
greater outlay and a necessity for increased labour; but in Africa
the climate is so hot and uniform that the peasants go about half-
naked, and therefore have little- or no expense for clothing.
' Now with all these local advantages on the side of the African
peasantry, can it be a matterof surprise that they con?ne them-
selves almost entirely to the cultivation vof produce suf?cient for
their yearly consumption? Can it be a matter of surprise, I say,
that the English peasant labours in?nitely more than the African
peasant? In the one case, the land supplies the peasant abundantly,
whether he works hard or not ; in the other, starvation awaits him
if he does not work hard, and should he not pay dearly with his
strength and skill, he is sure to fall to utter destitution. To the
English peasant the words of Mr. Thomas Carlyle, in his inaugural
address as Lord Rector of Edinburgh University, echo loudly.
'If a man,' says he, 'gets meat and clothes, what matters it
whether he have ten thousand pounds, or ten million pounds, or
seventy pounds a-year? He can get meat and clothes for that,
and he will ?nd very little real difference intrinsically, if he is a wise
man.'
There is a plant now growing abundantly in all the villages in
the otherwise barren Mountain District, and, in fact, in every part

of the Colony of- Sierra Leone, which, if properly cultivated and
worked, would lead to a mine of wealth to the destitute inhabitants.
The Local Government should take it in hand, offer prizes for the
best manufactured articles from it, and should depute representa-
tives in the villages to teach the inhabitants the mode of cultivating
it. This plant has been noticed in a letter in the Cavalla Messenger,
printed at Cape Palmas, which gives the mode of planting, pre-
paring the fruit, and preparing the ?bre. The following is the letter
in extenso :—
' I take the liberty, in, the following communication, to call the
attention of your readers to the growth of the plantain for its ?bre.
' In the ?rst place I would remark that it is easily cultivated. In
preparing the ground for the crop in this country, we meet with
one grand dif?culty—the-want of the plough and team. Yet this
is less felt than in many parts of. the world. The constant fall of
rain in the growing seas'ons softens the ground, and conveys to the
root of plants the soluble parts of the decaying vegetable and mineral
matter composing the soil as perfectly andthoroughly as if'theland were
ploughed and otherwise cultivated by a team. But in the growth
of the plaintain we are less dependent on the plough and oxen for
success than in the management of most other crops. This is a
fact very strongly recommending it to the attention of the farmer.
' To put out a ?eld of plaintains, the ground should be prepared
much as it is for cassada roots. The ground then should be laid
out in rows about twelve or- eighteen feet apart each way. At the
point crossed by these rows the soil should be thoroughly dug up,
and a healthy root set in the centre. The plant usually does best
when laid down so as to sprout from the side. This will give from
three to four hundred plants to the acre.
' For the ?rst year or two cassada, cotton, pepper, ginger, corn,
arrowroot, sugar-cane, or some other crop, should be grown with it.
The third year will give seven suckers to each plant, which will
make 2,400 to 2,800 stalks, with as many bunches of delicious,
healthy, nutritious, fruit. This gathered when fully ripe may be
easily preserved for food or export. In England it takes the place
of dried apple, and commands a price that will richly repay the
farmer for all the labour of cultivation and curing for market.


## p. 222 (#246) ############################################

222 wasr AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
'The process of drying is simple. The ripe fruit is laid in the
hot sun on mats elevated from the ground. After it becomes
wetted, it is taken from the skin and replaced upon the mats till
dry, when it is found coated with sugar, like ?gs. This process might
be shortened by kiln-drying.
' The fruit when full grown, before the process of ripening com-
mences, is very rich in starch, and when dried and ground makes an
excellent meal. To make plantain meal the plantain must be re-
moved with a bamboo knife, so as not to discolour the fruit. Then
cut in thin slices and dry in the sun, or on a kiln, which is better;
when brittle, grind into a meal.
' The fact that the fruit for home consumption or the foreign
market will richly pay for cultivation is an item of importance. For
this purpose is plantain chie?y raised. The stalk is by many re-
garded as valueless. Yet it is, by the addition of a little labour,
worth 3d. a stalk.
'An acre of well-matured, thrifty plantains will produce 6,000
lbs. of ?bre, at a cost in labour of 31. per ton; and with an
additional cost of W. per ton it may be placed in an English market.
Plantain ?bre, after patient, varied, and repeated experiments, has
been proved to be equal to hemp for all the purposes of cordage,
and now commands the same price as good hemp, say from 30!. to
35L per ton, giving a clear pro?t to the grower of more than 20L
the ton.
'To convert the stalk into ?bre it is cut into lengths of three
feet long and quartered. This should be done as quickly as may
be, so as not to blacken the ?bre with the iron instrument used in
cutting.
' Furnished with a mill like a horizontal sugar-mill, having wooden
rollers, four feet long and one foot in diameter, turned by horse
power, the quartered stalks are passed between the rollers longi-
tudinally, so as not to strain the ?bre. Then the crushed stalks are
washed thoroughly (which process separates the ?bre from the
pnlpy matter of the stalks), and the ?bre is hung on poles under a
shade to dry The sun discolours it. When dry, it is combed or
hackled, as ?ax or hemp, when it is ?t for the market. The tow, '
or waste from the combing, is beaten and prepared as half-stuff for

paper, at a cost of SI. per ton, and is worth as much as linen rage
for paper, say from 16l. t0 20l. per ton.'
Miss Waldren, of Cape Coast, forwarded to England some years
ago a large quantity of Cape Coast-made plantain ?bres, the
market value of which did not pay a tenth part of what she laid
out. This at once put a stop to the people of Cape Coast attempt-
ing its exportation; but in this case the mode of preparation was
at fault, which makes it perfectly valueless, and which should act
as a caution to those who again attempt to prepare it for the
English market. It was cut carelessly with an iron knife, which of
course blackens the ?bres; it was crushed in the sun by pounding,
which discolours the ?bres, destroys their texture, and weakens their
strength. It was exposed to dry in- the sun, the ?bres were not
placed in layers, but were entangled into a meshwork, so that the
ends could not be easily traced, and consequently they were never
combed. These facts will at once explain the cause of the failure.
A proper experiment should now be instituted by the Hon. George
Blankson, in his largeplantation at Acherobuanda and Framangue.
XII.—The Erection of Substantial Batteries on Signal Hill and on
one or more of the Elevations in its Neighbourhood.
The greatness of a country is not merely calculated from its
riches, its extent, and its commerce, but intrinsically from its power
of defence. No part of Sierra Leone would be of any material use
to an invader but Freetown, the capital, which could be made
completely impregnable by a comparatively small outlay. The
entrance into the harbour of Sierra Leone is by a very small chan-
nel, situated near Cape Sierra Leone, and overlooked by Signal
Hill and a few eminences, with plateaus on their summits, in its
neighbourhood. From the experience of byegone years it is
certain that the Colony is by no means safe should war be declared
against France or America; and now that the political horizon
seems peaceful, it will be the better part of valour if suitable forti?-
cations be erected in these elevated positions which completely over-
look the harbour, by which every foreign vessel would be debarred
from entering the port and bombarding the town. The French are
strongly fortifying their settlement at Senegal, without the least
regard to expense; but so open and defenceless is our principal

Colony on the Coast, where there is scarcely one gun ?t for use
against the heavy armament of men-of-war now-a-days, that, within
a few hours, a French or an American sloop-of-war could level the
town to the ground. Let us, therefore, begin in time to prepare
ourselves, and not wait until our enemies are on our heels. Three
good earth batteries, made tenacious in their slopes by the planting
of the Bahama grass, so common in the streets of Freetown, and
supplied with heavy Armstrong guns, would be all that would be
required.
XIII.—The Raising of a Su?cient Amount of Money for Rapidly
Carrying out those Improvements which are Essential to the Health and
Industrial Development of the Colony. _
It will be observed, from the reading of the above pages, that the
Colony will require a large amount of money at once to carry out
these useful improvements, over and above the present revenue. A
loan has been suggested by many, but the Colony will be obliged to
pay a large interest until the'capital is paid; and this will necessitate
an increase in the taxes. In my opinion this can at present be dis-
pensed with if the amount required be not far over 100,000l., and
let the Colony be her own debtor. '
Let a colonial paper currency to that amounthe issued, and made
equal in value to the specie in circulation, and redeemable in ten or
more years; let the Legislature be stringent in preventing any de-
preciation of its value; let the large mercantile establishments take
it up and have it circulated, and let the Government redeem every
year from two to four thousand pounds ; and in a few years those
large improvements indicated will be made, which, in the course of
a short time, will pay their own expenses without any outlay from
the colonial chest. A similar plan was, some years ago, adopted in
the building of a large wharf (if my memory be correct) in Jersey
with great success. .
It might be remarked that whilst I condemn the practice in
Liberia of a wholesale issue of paper currency)" I recommend the
same thing at Sierra Leone. But there is a great difference

between the two countries. The former, having a very small
revenue, issued an amount of this medium far above her capacity for
redemption; and this not for the building of any public works which
would pay their own cost, but to avert a crisis. The latter, on the
contrary, has a large revenue, which is above her expenses, and a
few years ago she had in her chest about 15,0001. over and above
her expenditure. The paper currency, if adopted, will be for build-
ing public works, which will be made to pay their own expenses,
without costing a farthing to the Government. Thus, if water be
conveyed to the town and supplied to the different houses, the
people will be taxed for it, and the money derived from it will go
towards reclaiming the paper currency, until it becomes an .inde—
pendent source of revenue. I shall, therefore, recommend the
adoption of this measure as the most practical that could be found
suited for the Colony of Sierra Leone, and not to venture at present
on a loan for these improvements. I shall, however, in another place
point out where a loan might with the best advantage be contracted?!i
XIV.—The Enrolment of the Militia Force.
An act was passed at Sierra Leone, not very long ago, by which
all the male inhabitants of the Colony, within. a certain age and not
suffering from any physical disabilities, were enrolled as a Militia;
they were drilled at stated intervals, and reviewed yearly by the
Governor. The Militia Forcehad an expensive band, and there was
really a militaryair and gait observed among the rising generation
of the Colony.- It was a most useful establishment, as they were
employed in many~cases as sentries in the different guards when the
soldiers were engaged inactive service" As auxiliaries, they were
employed without pay on active service, as in the late Quiah war
near Sierra Leone. But when it was decided that the Coast was to
be garrisoned by a whole West India Regiment, with its head-
quarters and band stationed atSierra Leone, the local authorities
began to ?nd fault with the Militia Force ; they were not considered
suf?ciently disciplined and subordinate, and ultimately they were
disbanded, and the national band was superseded by that of the
West India Regiment. But if the truth be told, the fault of the

want of discipline and subordination must lie at the door of the
local authorities. By some false ideas at the formation of the force,
they appointed merchants between the ages of ?fty and sixty years
as captains and lieutenants, who could only just read and write,
whilst the young men of education and buoyancy, who would give
their time and interest to it, were placed in inferior grades, unless
they purchased their commissions. It was supposed that these old
men would buy out their freedom by paying the sum of ten pounds
to the Government, but they held fast to the commission, which was
given them, although incapable of learning the drill. The autho-
rities there outdid themselves. Inef?ciency was the consequence,
which ultimately led to the disbandment of the whole force. It is
necessary that the Militia Force be re-established on a better footing,
as a time will certainly come when they will be found of the greatest
service to the Local Government of the country.
XV.—T he Formation of a National Ban/c at Freetown.
The growing wealth of the city of Freetown necessitates the
formation of a Government, and consequently a responsible, bank in
it. A bank at Sierra Leone, formed and supported by the Local
Government, and placed in connexion with a safe bank in England,
will furnish a most important lever to the merchants and small
traders in the Colony; which bene?t would ultimately extend to
the other Colonies on the Coast. In cdmmercial circles the im-
portance of a good, reliable banking establishment is well known and
appreciated. Even in this Colony, where _there are only small
private banks, so greatly are they appreciated that, at the approach
of the mail steamers, the banks have sometimes to close their doors
against business men. '
It would be a very important savings bank for the poor, who
now bury their small savings in the ground ; they would thus obtain
good security and a premium. It would supply the merchants and
traders with money during the trading season, when ready cash is
much required; and, by some arrangement, it might be made to
supply the military and naval department on the Coast at a certain
rate of premium. So that whilst it will be advantageous to the
commercial and other inhabitants of the Colony, it would also be
serviceable to the local authorities and the Imperial Government.

INTERCOLONIAL' POST—VACCINATION nor. 227
XVI.—The Formation of an Intercolonial Post throughout the
Colony in Connexion with the Present Post-ojice.
This is one of the growing wants of the Colony; and its non--
existence is so inconvenient that it is a wonder that the subject has
never yet entered into the consideration of the authorities, as its
establishment would greatly increase the revenue. It will require,
in the ?rst place, that the houses should be preperly and legibly
numbered, as at present the streets are all named, excepting those
in the villages. The payment for letters should not be more than
one penny for each half-ounce; the delivery at Freetown should
be twice a-day at the commencement—via, at 8 A.M. and 6 P.M.-—-
and in the villages twice or three times a-week. The expenses, .
after the stamp machine is obtained, would be to increase the pay
of the present Postmaster of Sierra Leone, which should be
graduated yearly according to the probable increase of the under-
taking, and the appointment of additional post-of?ce clerks; the
formation of various sub-of?ces in the town, and the erection of
waterproof post-boxes in conspicuous places; the appointment of
village postmasters, and, last, the post carriers. In the villages the
various ill-paid schoolmasters would be the most eligible persons to ?ll
the appointment of postmaster; their pay of course would be com-
mensurate with the importance of the village. If properly arranged
and centres formed in districts—via, at Regent, Waterloo, and
Kissy—there is no doubt that the undertaking would, whilst of
great convenience to the Colony, add a great deal. to the revenue of
the Colony.
X,VII.——The Necessity of Introducing by the Legislature a Strict
Vaccination Act, for the Purpose of Protecting the Community against
the Yearly Ravages of Small-pox.
The prevalence of small-pox every year in Sierra Leone, and in
the other Colonies in Western Africa, should be an immediate in-
centive for the Government to interfere and introduce a remedy to
an evil which vitally affects the public health. The prevalence of
the disease is most discreditable to those who can prevent it, since
it is well known that the remedy—viz, vaccination—is ' speci?c and
infallible.' The protection is only temporary and limited, it is true,
but during the time it lasts it completely protects the system. On
Q 2

the subject of vaccination these two points should always be borne
in mind—viz., ?rst, that when performed it should be thoroughly
done, presenting three or four permanent deep scars on the arms.
This should be done a few weeks after birth. Second, that the
vaccination should be repeated after the age of puberty, or the
twenty-?rst year.
In places like the Colonies of Western Africa this can only be
established by the Government, who should make it compulsory on
everyone to.have the operation performed. I should, therefore,
urge upon the authorities the appointment of properly paid vacci-
nators, both for vaccination and re-vaccination, as well as the ap-
pointment of inspectors of vaccination, who .should make periodical
inspections of the various districts, and report on the degree to
which .the operation has been performed, not only in districts, but
also in individual cases. Every individual, parent, or guardian, who
refuses to .be or to have their child or ward vaccinated should be
prosecuted by law.
XYIII.-—The Supply of Medical Men or District Dispensers to the
various Villages of the Colony.
That it is the duty of a paternal Government to look after the
health of the poor inhabitants of the country is undoubted; but
we ?nd that whilst there are two colonial surgeons in the capital,
the districts are left unsupplied. The poor inhabitants get sick and
die without the chance for life being given them; there are now on
poor-law boards and no poor-law medical of?cers attached to each vil-
lage or district; in fact, no public organization for succour of the af-
?icted poor. The consequence isthat the death rate is still constantly
high, and the authorities take no means for effectually diminishing it.
On this account a medical school attached to the University of
Western Africa will be fraught with the best advantage, and then
the Government would have at their disposal able dispensers, who
would understand, to some degree, medicine and surgery, and great
relief would be given .to the poor, who. are dying away uncared for
and unattended.
XIX.—The Laying Out of Certain Lands as Pleasure Grounds for
the People and Ornaments to the Town.
[t has been admitted as a just maxim that appearances exercise a

vast in?uence in producing effects whether pleasurable or otherwise.
The valuable effect which the laying out-of lands in the tropics pro-
duces on the inhabitants, especially the European population, can-
not be overrated; for we ?nd that where every piece of ground
around a dwelling is properly cultivated with'beds of ?owers of
various descriptions there is afforded a healthy exercise to the mind,
a pleasurable enjoyment to the senses, auseful employment of the
body, and a destruction to rank vegetation which makes the abode
unhealthy—all which bene?ts would be derived if such an undertaking
were carried out on a grander scale. In Freetown it cannot be said
that?'there are no spots which can be usefully converted into pleasure-
grounds and parks; for, surrounding the Governor's residence and
Fort Thornton, and at the base of the table-land forming the
military barracks, are open lands, in the very centre of the town,
where now nothing but rank vegetation grows; and where, in the
two unhealthy periods of the year, in the beginning and ending of
the rains, the decayed vegetation emits deadly e?luvia in every direc-
tion to greet the highest-of?cial on the Coast, imperilling his life,
and inducing him to escape those two epochs by leaving the seat of
his Government. Yet it cannot be accounted for that the
Governor himself, whose life is in danger, can look down every
day on these waste spots, without putting into execution ameasures
for averting the evil.
The question arises, what remedy should be recommended to put
a stop to the danger? I answer, make that spot into a park, and
well-arranged pleasure ground. To do this will cost the Local Govern-
ment scarcely a farthing, as it possesses numerous prisoners who
can be employed for this express purpose, and, consequently, the
hackneyed excuse, 'want of money,' cannot be advanced. 'Plant
trees in regular lines, supplant the rank vegetation by the green
healthy Bahama grass, place seats in proper positions, and make
proper walks. Government House will thus be freed from its
poisoned atmosphere, and the inhabitants greatly bene?ted. At
the race-course, and at Kingtom, there are places where, by a.
little ingenuity and expenditure, parks or pleasure-grounds can be
made.

CHAPTER XV.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE GAMBIA. '
IN the Committee of 1842, of which Viscount Sandon was chair-
man, Mathcw Forster, Esq, in his evidence on the importance of
the trade of Western Africa to England, which he considered sus-
ceptible of very great augmentation as soon as internal anarchy
ceased, and a habit of industry and civilization was introduced and
extended, remarked that 'the rapid success of the Colony on the
Gambia, on which so little money has been spent, and that little not
at all in the most advantageous way, proves how much more may
be done, even in Africa, by judicious selection and prudent conduct
of a settlement. Patience; the determination to await the slow,
but certain, development of the resources of the neighbouring
population, which will follow a demand for their produce, is the
?rst requisite. And from the want of this so many zealous and ap-
parently well-planned attempts at civilization, but which all bore
the fatal error of a desire for immoderate, and therefore impos-
sible, success, have failed.' He considered the Gambia the most
important of the three Colonies (Sierra Leone and the Gold
Coast), from the great length of its river communication, the vast
resources of the country, and the commercial character of the
people in its neighbourhood. Three years after this statement was
made—viz., in 1845, the ground-nut trade was introduced ; in that
year the value of its export was only 19%, but the inhabitants went
zealously to work at it, and so greatly did they employ their time
and energy to the trade, that thirteen years after its introduction—
viz., in 1858—the value of the export was 188,000!.
But the great drawback to all improvement in the Gambia and
its neighbourhood is the ascendancy which the Marabout bigots

LARGE TOWNS or course. 231
have now gained over their former masters, the Souinkies; whilst
they were under this rule trade and agriculture prospered, but now
that they have gained the upper hand, anarchy, slave-hunting ex-
peditions, insecurity of life and property, are the inevitable results.
These Marabouts are ambitious, overbearing, and very covetous.
Since their ascendancy they have destroyed the most flourishing
towns along the River, which supplied the merchants of Bathurst
with large quantities of wax and ground-nuts. 'Where are the
towns of Sanding, in Vintung Creek? of Yauernaroo? of Tenda-
bah? and a hundred other large towns? Have they not all been
pillaged and burnt down? and have not the men, women, and children,
who were not able to escape, been captured and sold as slaves?"
Now that the Marabouts' supremacy is an accomplished fact,
to ensure the prosperity of the Gambia, it is our place to look
to our own interest and employ those means which may be con-
ducive to the strengthening of British authority throughout the
River. To this end, therefore, all our policy must tend, and the fol-
lowing suggestions will aid a great deal in accomplishing this most
desirable result.
I. The Reduction of Most of the Small Hamlets in British Combo
into One or llfore Large T owns.
The old maxim, union is strength, is nowhere more evident than in
the towns on the banks of the River Gambia, where the people are
constantly exposed to the brutal inroads of petty chieftains. I have,
(on the consideration of the self-government of the Gambia), entered
into some details relative to the exposure of Upper Combo to the
descent of their treacherous Marabout neighbours whenever a favour-
able opportunity o?ers itself. The towns or hamlets in this district
consist of the congregation of a few ill-constructed cane huts, very
thinly populated and exposed in every direction. Separately they
are incapable of withholding for a few seconds the impetuous at-
tacks of the Marabouts, who would destroy village after village,
killing the male population and carrying the females and children
into captivity. Collectively they could withstand, and perhaps
force the Marabout army to retreat, and gain a complete victory
over them. Grants of land should be given to each man, and they
should be made to build in concentrated centres, and the people should

be restrained from putting down here and there one or two huts and
calling it a town. They might have farms at any distance they
liked, but they should be compelled to congregate in large towns at
convenient distances from each other for residence.
II. The Building of Block Ifouses or Defensible Walls with Port—
holes on the Frontiers of British Combo and in Albreda, and other
British Territories opposite to the Hostile Marabout Neighbours.
The appearance of good physical force is the only means of check-
ing the warlike tendency of a savage race. From the accounts
which I have given in another place, it is evident that the neigh-
bouring tribes in the Gambia are a restless, mischievous, and
cunning people, who look lustily after the British possessions, and
would seize the ?rst opportunity of making themselves tem-
porarily masters of a portion of them? Our chief object should be
to defend our frontiers as best we can ; and one of the best
means would be to form blockhouses on the frontiers, to make
one or more stockades consisting of well-planned brick walls, with
portholes and outside ditches, so placed as to defend any part of
these large towns, and to teach the inhabitants properly to defend
these stockades, which would give strength and support to the other-
wise timid inhabitants; be a safe rendezvous for military opera-
tions on the frontiers whenever required, and would more particularly
serve as a moral check to the Marabouts, who would not on the face
of it attempt to make an open raid on the country.
These enclosures, if built of stones or bricks, will require only
the ?rst outlay; and as these Marabouts ?ght only with small
* Referring to the late disturbed state of the River Gambia, by the
neighbouring tribes in the River Gambia, and the warlike and menacing at-
titude of Mabba, the late formidable King of Badihoo, a writer in the
African Times made this sensible and homely remark : ' The real cause, to
all those who have studied the character of these Marabout inhabitants of
the River Gambia, is to be found in that ambitious, overbearing, and
covetous disposition of the Mussulmans, who view with discontent the rich
prize they would obtain, could they have an opportunity of making one
midnight raid on the rich Babboo Christian merchants at Bathurst. The
toleration of this overbearing disposition of the Marabout chieftains in the
River Gambia will always lead to serious complications. They must be
made to understand that the British Government, although desirous of
peace, yet still will never tolerate any nonsense from them.'——4frican
Times, V01. vi., p. 134.

srmnaan OF BUILDINGS. 233
?rearms, these simple walls would withstand any of their attacks.
One or two such walls would be a su?icient defence for Albreda
against any attacks of the Marabout neighbours at Neomy or Barre.
The wooden stockade, which was lately commenced by Governor
d'Arcy, is almost worthless, as, within a few years, it will fall to
the ground, and in fact the power of the Marabouts in over-
coming dif?cult wooden stockades, surrounded with thorns and
ditches and protected by equally ?erce Mandingoes, should lead us
to adopt a better means of defence; consequently it will be
necessary for the authorities to give this suggestion a- serious con-
sideration.
III. A Standard of Building, 1nexpensive in its Construction,
should be insisted upon in Combo by the Executive Authority, and
the Poorer Inhabitants should be compelled within a certain time to
to imitate it in the Construction of all their Buildings.
In no place on the whole Western Shores of Africa do the huts of
the poorer class of natives present such a low, squalid, miserable,
?lthy, unhealthy, dark, and disagreeable appearance as the Mandingo
huts on the River Gambia. They are so low that one has almost
to go on all fours, or stoop to a very inconvenient degree, before
he can enter the huts, where he is in most cases surrounded with
?lth of every description.
We will take for example the town of Baccow, in the immediate
vicinity of the invalid station of Cape St. Mary. The Mandingo
huts are small circular buildings, without ventilation; and the in-
habitants, who crawl in, sleep with their sheep in almost the same room.
Filthy in the extreme, these huts in the British possession remain a
standing disgrace to the Gambia Government. It is about the ?rst
object that strikes the observation of a new visitor of the Cape.
This kind of building had existed without improvement ere Baccow
was ceded in 1840 to the British throne, and it will still remain so
for centuries to come if the Government does not interfere in the
matter. It is the duty of a civilized government to endeavour as
much as in it lies to civiliZe the natives under its rule; and the local
authorities in the Gambia will be remiss in their duty should they
allow this state of squalor to continue in the Mandingo towns in
British Gambia.

IV. Improvement in the Educational Branch of the Colony.
I have dealt so much on the subject of the education in Sierra
Leone, and of its non-existence in the Gambia, that I have only'to
impress on the local authorities the necessity of taking in hand
the education of the young generation of the Colony. The Gambia.
is in?nitely worse than Sierra Leone in this most important branch
of civilization; the inhabitants, being Mohammedans, heathens. and
Christians, and the schools being under the direction of the Wes-
leyan Missionary society, and the Roman Catholics, most of the
children, from the exclusiveness of the teaching, do not attend the
schools.
There should be established all over the country, Government
schools with a uniform system of discipline and instruction regu-
lated by schemes planned by the Government. They should have
'the same books, the same rotation of lessons, the same method of
communicating instruction, the same hours.' Besides the ordi-
nary course of instruction, Arabic should be made a part of the
studies of the pupil; and Arabic teachers from Senegal should be
engaged for that express purpose. The necessity for this is
obvious, since the Governor frequently gets letters in Arabic from
the Marabout chieftains in the neighbourhood, and he has to go about
the town to get them interpreted; whilst in Senegal, the French
Governor receives from the independent kings letters in Arabic, and
communicates with them in the same language. The Government
should make it compulsory for every child above and under certain
ages, to attend in one or other of the schools in the Colony. An
inspector of schools should be appointed, whose duty would be to
see that strict uniformity is observed in all the schools, and that the
masters and teachers attend properly to their work. The parents
should be made to pay a certain amount, however small, as 'edu-
cation, like other objects of attainment, is not to be duly valued,
especially by those who are unable to comprehend its ultimate uses,
until it has the price of money put upon it; until some sacri?ce is
made to obtain it; and the party making this sacri?ce thereby ac-
quires, as it were, a property in it. Given for nothing, it is regarded
as little more than nothing, and as what may be had at any time;
but so soon as a payment is made, the regular attendance of the

children becomes a question of pro?t and loss, and the parent takes
care to enforce it.' The children in the Gambia are most back-
ward in their schooling. The computation will be probably correct
if we say that in the British Territory in the Gambia, only one in
every ?fty children attends school, and yet still the local autho-
rities take no stringent steps for ensuring more general educa-
tional advantages to the people. True it is that both the Wesleyans
and the Roman Catholics receive 100]. each for schools, but what
is that amount for such a large extent of country and population.
We leave it for the consideration of the Council whether a more
uniform system of Government schools should not be established
throughout the country, and the children be regularly taught.
V. Proper Means used for the Development of the Natural Agricul-
tural Resources of the Country.
The rapid growth of the ground-nut trade on the River
Gambia should lead the Government to endeavour to improve the
other natural agricultural resources of the Gambia. There are
several plants which grow in their natural strength and luxuriance
in the Gambia, and which, with little labour and attention, can be
made useful exportable commodities. The cotton-plant, which is
indigenous to the country, is extensively cultivated, and since the
American war is largely exported from the Gambia. To encourage
the growth, Mr. Thomas Brown, one of the leading merchants of the
Colony, has got out a steam cleaning machine for the cotton busi-
ness, and his establishment has always had enough to do. The
cotton crop of the Gambia, unlike that of other parts of Africa,
from the peculiar nature of the climate, is annual.
The indigo plant is also indigenous in the Gambia and grows in
great luxuriance during the rainy season; the natives cultivate and
manufacture it for home consumption, and they produce dyes not
surpassed by the best Indian or Manchester baft. The trade, if
opened, will be a paying one. It will commence in the latter part
of the rainy season, after the ground-nut is planted, and would give
the people remunerative occupation for the time and the merchant a
good exportable commodity during the rainy season. It will not be
out of place here to call upon the leading merchants of the Gambia-—
to Mr. Brown especially, whose praiseworthy zeal in offering any

new articles of trade is well known—to give a little more of their time
and attention to the introduction of this trade, which in a few years
would be a commercial blessing to the Gambia.
Fibres—There are a great many ?brous plants in the Gambia;
some are specially cultivated by the \natives for making ropes. In
the African Times" a ' Constant Reader' has given a few but import-
ant instructions on the cultivation and preparation of certain use-
ful ?bres for the English market. The ?bres of Africa, if opened
to native exertion and commercial enterprise, will be found to
be a great 'mine of productive and commercial wealth.' The plant
which is cultivated by the natives in the Gambia yields ?bres
almost equal in value and texture to that produced from the
China grass, and it only requires to be pr0perly cultivated,
cropped, retted and prepared for exportation in order that it
might take its place in the European market with ?bres of other
countries.
Indeed, for the agricultural resources of the Gambia to be de-
veloped, the Government must have shows at intervals of three or
four years, and good prizes offered to the exhibitors of the best
native manufacture.
Colonel D'Arcy, the late Administrator of the Gambia, in his
Blue-book reports, writes, under date of November, 1866, respect-
ing agriculture in the settlement :—
' My successors will be wise if they support agriculture in every
way; it is the sheet-anchor of this settlement. Unfortunately, re-
monstrances alone are not su?icient to detain the natives from
baneful war, so tempting to the savages, who risk death and famine
for the chance of abducting human beings, whereby they are suddenly
enriched. The old leaven of slavery is the curse of Africa. . .
Much of the cotton crop, grown from the Egyptian seed the G0-
vernment imported in 1862, was spoilt from the simple fact that the
natives planted it in June instead of August. It is a sun plant,
which, even at birth, requires two month's rain, not four. The
printed monthly report of the discussions in reference to the best
time and most approved mode of planting rice, indigo, ground-nut,

cassava, beniseed, &c., would, I am convinced, be read by the people
of the West Coast with as much eagerness as the Parliamentary
debates are in England.'
VI.—-The Formationof a Savings Bank for the Mechanics and
Labouring Classes of the Colony.
From the description I have given of the spendthrift nature of
the young generation of the Gambia population, it will be obvious
that such an establishment would produce universal good, not only
to the mechanics, sailors, and labourers, but also to the small
traders, whose small savings are squandered in tri?es before the
commencement of another season. On the importance of this subject
the late Mr. T. Ingram remarked that at St. Mary's, ' the labouring
natives, such as mechanics, sailors, &c., suffer great inconvenience,
and not unfrequently heavy losses, for want of an establishment
wherein to deposit their savings with a certainty of having them at
command when needed.' If a savings bank be formed, all the sur-
plus money of the Colony can be deposited in it, ' which would
save the temptation and risk of keeping it in huts, where it is so
frequently stolen, and could always be made available when re-
quired; and once the sum of four or ?ve thousand dollars was
deposited, guaranteed bills of short dates might be discounted,
which would be an accommodation to strangers and persons de-
sirous of making payments in a useful convertible medium, and a
bene?t to the inhabitants, as affording a small return in interest for
capital not otherwise required;' the small traders would imme-
diater take advantage of it, and would gladly transfer from the
hands of their employers to the bank, any surplus money that might
be due to them after the season is over.
But to give it the fullest con?dence it must be under the super-
vision of the Government, though immediately conducted by a
Board of Directors, yearly elected, composed of o?icers and mer-
chants, with a paid secretary, whose salary should be a commission
on the business done.
VIL—The Establishment __of a Good British Station at Fatta
Tendah, about Four Hundred Miles in the Interior, on the Banks of
the River.
M'Carthy's Island was bought from the King of Calabar for the

express purpose of protecting and encouraging the trade in the
upper portion of the River. It is about 175 miles from Bathurst.
But it is well known that most of the trade in the River Gambia
comes from the Upper River, where the nuts are superior in quality
> and in marketable value to those in the Lower River. Around
M'Carthy's Island but avery small quantity of nuts is obtained ; the
largest quantity comes from a distance of about 175 to 200 miles
further up the River, of which Fatta Tendah is the centre. If at
all, a colonial station must be formed up the Rivers, to be of service
to trade and commerce, it must be where the most business is
performed; and had Fatta Tendah been a British station, Baccary
Sardah, the King of Boondoo, would not have destroyed the pro-
perty of British merchants in 1866 to the amount of 50,0001.
Against the native force M'Carthy's Island is a natural forti?-
cation; its impassable barrier, the River, will always be acheck to
the proud Marabouts. With two or three constables, and a few
special constables when needed, and a sub-manager to administrate
justice, it can be left to take care of itself. But our main force up
the River should be concentrated at Fatta Tendah, a place superior
in every respect to M'Carthy's Island. It is dry, healthy, and high
above the swamps, having in its neighbourhood elevated grounds
and high lands. It is situated on the banks of the River, and
about thirty to forty feet above its level. Being in the centre of
the trade in the upper Rivers, its occupation will give con?dence to
the traders and native chiefs in the kingdom of WVoolie, whose king
has always regarded the British Government, who are masters of
the waters, as his ally.
The establishment need not be expensive ; a good wall, built by
prisoners, assisted by a few masons, enclosing on three sides a large
piece of ground forming the town, and protected by the River on

From twenty to thirty Militia, with a. civil manager, who should

tioned there; they should receive the same pay and be treated ex-
actly the same as constables ; they should be properly drilled, and

every man who takes his abode in the town, be he Mandingo,
Jollof, Sarawoolie, European, or Colony born, should enrol himself
as a volunteer, and should be ready to ?ght against any intruder.
A system of this kind would materially improve the trade in the
Upper River, would give con?dence to the traders, and prevent the
natives from committing those acts of base treachery to the traders
which have led to their ruin.
VIII.—The Support of a Colonial Sailing Schooner, Equipped to a
small extent as a Vessel of qur, and Properly and Inexpensively
Manned.
Now that the Government of the Gambia has been deprived of
the small steamer, which was most essential but too expensive for
the River trade, the local authority, with its improved revenue,
should step in and itself assist in maintaining a small, fast-
sailing vessel (schooner), which would completely answer all the
purposes required, for giving support and assistance to the trade in
the River. The schooner can be made to pay its own expenses, as
when not immediately required by the authorities, it could be
freighted by the merchants. When sent with despatches to
M'Carthy's Island or Fatta Tendah, or wherever occasion may
require, it might take freight to and from these places; so that
whilst serving the purpose of the Local Government, it would pay
its own expenses and ultimately its cost. From 4002. to 800l. will
purchase in England or America a strong, well-built schooner,
which can carry three or four light guns. To make it inexpensive,
it should be commanded and manned entirely by a native captain and
crew, which would reduce the expenses to nearly one-half. All
the small, and many of the large vessels belonging to the merchants
in the Gambia, which sail up and down the River, and down the
Coast to Bulama and Rio Pongas are supplied with native captains
and crews, which, so long as the vessel remains on the River, would
answer in?nitely better than having a European captain, who would
occupy a nominal position in the vessel, always requiring a native
captain to pilot the ship.
I do not see why a measure of this kind should not be undertaken
by the Local Government, independent of the Home Government,
and even the Central Government at Sierra Leone. It will, I am

certain, meet with the hearty support of all the merchants in the
Gambia, and would, within a very short time, repay the outlay.
IX.-—The Formation of a Municipal Council at St. Mary's.
This would have a most satisfactory effect on the general popula-
tion, and would tend to improve the general health of the Colony ;
a town mayor is very much needed at Bathurst.
The appointment of a Municipal Council would be useful in clearing
out the rubbish from the town; in completing the different drains;
and in making proper roads to the different villages.
A Sanitary Board has been formed by Colonel D'Arcy, the late
Governor of the Gambia, but its operation has been most limited;
it has scarcely effected any good. The improvement of such a
small place should be left to the working of a Municipal Council and
its town inspector, who should receive every support and assistance
from the local authorities. The Governor could put a pressure on
a respectable body thus constituted, while prisoners should be em-
ployed principally for drainage and other sanitary purposes. It
would take years and a large sum of money to drain Bathurst
suf?ciently ; but by small and repeated outlay, according to the
capabilities of the country, we-might be able in years to come to
effect some tangible improvement which would diminish the frightful
mortality of the Colony.
X.—The Building of Winter or Rainy Season Residences at Cape
St. Mary's, in Combo, or in other parts of British Combo.
The most unhealthy period in the Gambia is in the rainy season,
when the breeze is from the south, south-west, and south-east, blow-
ing over a tract of mangrove swamp, several miles in extent, into
the town, carrying with it the deadly miasma which is generated
from it. On the east and south-east point of Bathurst there is an
immense swamp, ' extending even to the outskirts of the town, over
which the high tides ?ow, depositing a compound of mud and
animal and vegetable remains carried down by the river. When
this ?lthy mass, impregnated with diseases, is acted upon by the
tropical sun a most offensive e?luvium is brought forth, so destructive
to human health and life' that it is deadly even to the natives.
With such a topographical sketch of the insalubrious state of the
neighbourhood of Bathurst, it is no wonder that the merchants, on


## p. 241 (#265) ############################################

SALUBRITY or CAPE sr. mum's. ' 241
the approach of the rainy season, escape for their lives to Europe,
leaving their clerks to feed on the deadly miasma.
But much of this mortality might be avoided if the merchants
were to spend a little amount in building villas at Cape St. Mary's,
which is the most healthy spot in the whole of the Gambia, and the
superior sanitary condition of which is unquestionable. Whilst the
principal merchants make their escape from the pestilential hole to
England, is it not just for them to think of the best means of pre-
serving the health of the European clerks whom they brought out,
especially when the means are so simple and so much within their
reach ".I
So early as 1840, Dr. Robertson, then Colonial Surgeon of the
Gambia, gave the most ?attering account of the salubrious state of
Cape St. Mary's and the country in its neighbourhood, which all
subsequent writers have, and which I, from personal observation,
must con?rm in toto. ' Cape St. Mary's,' said he, 'is situated on the
lee-shore at the mouth of the River Gambia. The land in the
immediate vicinity of the coast is ?fty feet above the level of the
sea. The soil is a dry loam, superincumbent on a bed of granite.
' The country for several miles along the coast is clean, and al-
most clear from wood; it descends in a gentle slope from the sea
towards the interior, consequently, the great quantity of water that
falls during the rainy season is rapidly carried away from the
vicinity of the Cape, and ?ows into the creek situated some distance
in the interior, and through this channel ?nds its way into the sea.
' The Cape, being so near the sea-shore, enjoys at all times the
full advantage of the sea-breeze, which, combined with its elevated
situation, gives it a continual atmospherical temperature several
degrees cooler than the Island of St. Mary's.
' The Cape has been for some years resorted to by invalids, and
the great improvement in health, universally experienced after a short
residence there, is a su?icieut proof in itself that the atmosphere
possesses a degree of salubrity not often to be found on the West
Coast of Africa.
'There being no swamp in the neighbourhood, the land breeze
brings with it a cool air, devoid of that pestilential ef?uvium which
poisons the atmosphere of St. Mary's.'
R

The natives enjoy excellent health here, and live to a stage of
longevity seldom, if ever, witnessed at Bathurst; and when it is
remembered that the Cape is only seven and a-half miles from
Bathurst, and that there is a good road to it, it is paradoxical to
believe that such liberal ?rms as Forster and Smith, Thos. Brown
and C0., Murrell et Cie., and T. F. Quin, which employ a large
staff of European clerks, should not long ago have adopted this
most desirable and inexpensive step.
XI.—lee Erection of a Bridge over Oyster Creek.
Situated between the Island of St. Mary's and the mainland, or
British Combo, is a small muddy stream, the banks of which are
thickly studded by mangroves, called Oyster Creek. This stream is
ferried by a huge boat, moved by paddle-wheels, which is continually
out of repair. The ferrycosts the Government nearly 50!.a-year. With
an outlay of from 3001. to 400l. a good substantial bridge could be
built over this stream, which would at once relieve the Government
of the yearly outlay, and the population from the great inconvenience
which they now experience. It should be done by contract, as the
Government will ?nd this to be the least expensive and more certain
mode of effectually erecting it.
I have often heard some of the merchants remark that had there
been a bridge over Oyster Creek, so that they could drive with ease
and at any hour over to Cape St. Mary's, they would at once remove
from the pestitential air of Bathurst. It is a. plan that would re-
lieve both the merchants and the labouring class of the population
from the very great inconvenience which is caused by the ferry. It
would improve trade, and encourage the well-to-do merchants to
erect country residences in British Combo.

CHAPTER XVI.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOLD COAST.
THE Government of the Gold Coast has always been regarded as
the most dif?cult and intricate of all the Governments on the Coast;
but if it be closely and quietly investigated it will be found that
most of the ado which has from time to time been the cause of these
misunderstandings between the natives and the Government, has
been occasioned by the executive authority exceeding the charter of
the settlement.
The British Gold Coast is merely a Protectorate, the natives hav-
ing their own kings, using their own laws, and performing their
time-honoured customs; beyond the Fort-gate we have not a foot
of ground in the country. After the turbulent period previous to
1830 and the peace proclaimed between Ashantee and the natives
through British in?uence, the inhabitants submitted themselves to
the British Government, not as subjects, but as independent nations,
in alliance with, and protected by, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, without any stated laws respecting their
Government; and the chiefs have always looked upon our Sovereign
as a kind of feudal superior, against whose enemies they were bound
to ?ght when called upon, and who was in turn bound to aid them
in case of trouble from within or without. The treaty between the
British Government and the native chiefs distinctly stipulates that
the natives are to be governed by their own laws, except in certain
cases plainly speci?ed.
But according to the decision of Lord Carnarvon (1866), the late
Secretary of State for the Colonies under Lord Derby's administra-
tion, all the towns on the sea-coast in the vicinity of the Forts are
to be regarded as British Colonies, entirely independent of native
in?uence and power—via, Cape Coast, Anamaboe, and Accra.
R 2

The present condition of the Gold Coast is worse than ever it
was since the days of Doodoowah. Formerly there was a close,
compact union between all the kings of the Protectorate under the
English authority; the very name of the Governor of Cape Coast
was a spell to bring any refractory king to bay. His power in the
Protectorate was only limited by the boundary of the territory of
the King of Ashantee. No one dared gainsay his orders, as severe
retribution was certain to follow. British authority was respected
and loved, and commanded implicit obedience; but now the people
have been plainly made to understand that the Government will not
stir a foot beyond the towns in the neighbourhood of the Forts
were their country to be overrun and conquered by the enemy;
that the Governor will not interfere in any of their palavers; that
beyond ?fteen miles of the sea-shore the inhabitants were to attend
to their own domestic affairs and settle their own palavers; that
anarchy and disorder may run riot in the interior without the
Governor having the least power to interfere or of compelling them
by force to desist. Tantalized by the orders continually received,
and by the heterogeneous elements under his rule, we ?nd that in
some cases the action of one governor entirely contradicts his pro-
clamations; whilst he informs the tribes that, beyond ?fteen miles, he
would give them no protection, he ?nes them heavily, and compels
them with threats to pay the amount for crimes not to be regarded
beyond a misdemeanour. Again, each governor has his own par-
ticular policy to follow. One prides himself for having undone the
policy of his predecessor, whether it tends to destroy the proper
development of the country or not. Another carries on the Govern-
ment with such vigour that the very name of the British rule is
regarded as tyrannical and hateful; and a third, on assuming the
reins of Government, endeavours by ?rm, yet paci?c measures, to
regain the lost name of authority, using well-considered and well-
planued measures for the develOpment and extension of the com-
merce of the country, and thus gains a general celebrity for ?rm-
ness and conciliation.
In truth our relations with the native chiefs in the vicinity of the
settlement have been unstable; the rapid and successive changes of
governors leave no room for any ?xed plan to be entered into for

FORMATION OF A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. 245
the general good of the place. The Gold Coast Government is
considered as a trying ordeal for the ability of individuals. The
man who governs there must either rise to eminence or fall to a
nonentity, and thus we ?nd that within the short period of ?ve
years no less than seven different governors have exercised the
supreme power over the Gold Coast—viz., from March, 1862, to
March, 1867 *—how, then, can we wonder at the disgraceful state of
the Protectorate, and that our relations with the natives in the interior
and with the powerful kingdom of Ashantee are so unsatisfactory?
It is on this ground that we must impress on those who are
opposed to the formation of a Central Government, the in?nite bene?t
that the whole Coast must derive from the introduction of such wise
changes in the Coast Government. The administrators are now no
more than the lieutenants of the Governor-General, whose ?xed
views on the policy to be pursued by each successive administrator
will necessitate the adoption of one line of policy for a period suf?-
ciently long to manifest its advantages or disadvantages. His
Excellency the present Governor-General, Sir A. Kennedy, C.B.,
loves Sierra Leone, the seat of his Government, where he formerly
served, and was much esteemed by the inhabitants. He is a
thorough statesman; and his policy, if we may judge by his ante-
cedents, will most probably be advantageous to the Coast, which
has been allowed to fall into an almost unparallelled disorder
through the most ?agrant maladministration. It is to be hoped
that he will not feel himself bound to follow the late policy, which
has unsettled all the previous relations of the natives with the
Government; and as he is thoroughly conversant with the nature
of the Government on the Coast, having acted previously in the
capacity of governor in the oldest of the West African Colonies,
—-and his antecedents are such as to insure con?dence in the inten-
tions of the ruling power—there seems just reason for believing that
in his hands the concentration of the Coast Government under one
head may prove less injurious. Sir Benjamin Pine, now Governor
of St. Kits, in the West Indies, was one of the most e?icient
*Viz., Messrs. Andrews, Ross, Pine, Jones, Mockler, Conran, and. the
present Administrator, Mr. Ussher.

of the local Governors on the Gold Coast.* He was a man most
competent to elevate the condition of the Coast Government under
his charge. He ?rst proposed and enlarged on the desirability of
forming a Central Government in West Africa. For years he held
various appointments on the Coast—as Chief Justice and Queen's
Advocate at Sierra Leone, and afterwards administered the Govern-
ment for nearly two years. After acting as Governor of Natal for
nearly six years, he, at the end of 1856, was appointed Governor
of the Gold Coast. At Sierra Leone his measures were found to
be most salutary. He took a lively interest in the education of the
rising population; visited and examined the schools and colleges,
which had a most bene?cial effect amongst the general public. On
the Gold Coast his measures were still more deserving of great
praise. He established municipal councils in the centres of the
Protectorate Territory, encouraged and trained up the people to
self-government, took up the claims of the educated natives, whom
he supported with all his in?uence, and advocated measures for the
general bene?t of the country. I must be excused for thus record-
ing here the merits of Sir Benjamin Pine, because I feel that every
native of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast is deeply indebted to him.
Hitherto the greatest drawback towards the e?icient Government
of the Protected Territory of the Gold Coast was the mixing up of
the Dutch and English possessions ; the Dutch having small towns
dovetailed in the English Territory. They declined to levy any
duty on import or any direct or indirect taxation, so that our Go-
vernment was compelled to limit its import duties, because if much
increased the whole trade would have gone to the Dutch. A purchase
of the Dutch possessions out and out would have been the most
* It is necessary that I should saya few words more relative to Sir Arthur
Edward Kennedy, who has been appointed Governor-General of the West,
African Colonies. He had been in 1852 Governor of Sierra Leone, andthe lively
interest which he took in the education of the young and in the advance~
ment of the Coast augurs well for the present unsettled state of the West
African Colonies. His ?rmness and decision in dealing with refractory
chiefs in the neighbourhood of the Colony of Sierra Leone will prove, we
hope, a. suf?cient guarantee that decisive measures will be taken, as occa-
sions require, to bring the British rule under proper respect in the various
Colonies. From our experience of him we may safely say that he under-
stands aucwitcr in modo, as well as fortiter in re.

TREATY BETWEEN THE DUTCH AND ENGLISH. 247
pro?table thing that could have been done, as it wouldhave insured the
material advancement and Christian civilization of the country ; but
all negotiations on the subject have hitherto failed, from the incom-
petency, it is said, of the Dutch Government to alienate any Dutch
land except for an equivalent in land. More recently negotiation had
been resumed for the exchange of territories, and the consolidation
of the Coast Government by the two Powers by establishing a uni-
form ?xed rate of Import Duties; and by a line to be drawn from the
Sweet River, near Elmina, into the interior to as far as the Praah,
making Dixcove, Appolonia, Wassaw, Commendah, British Se-
cundee, and Awoowen, Dutch; whilst Cormatine, Assam, Mouree,
Barracoe, and Dutch Accra become English. This treaty was to
come into force on the 1st January, 1868.
The following is a verbatim extract of the treaty, which was
signed in London, March 5, 1867; and the rati?cations exchanged
in the same place July 6, 1867:—
' Article 1.—Her Britannic Majesty codes to his Majesty the
King of the Netherlands all British forts, possessions, and rights
of sovereignity or jurisdiction, which she possesses on the Gold Coast
to the westward 0f the mouth of the Sweet River, where their respec-
tive territories are conterminous; and his Majesty the King of the
Netherlands' forts, possessions, and rights of sovereignty or juris-
diction, which he possesses on the Gold Coast to the eastward of
the mouth of the Sweet River, where their respective territories are
conterminous. The boundary between the possessions of Her
Britannic Majesty and those of his Majesty the King of the Nether-
lands will be a line drawn true north from the centre of the mouth
of the Sweet River as far as the boundary of the present Ashantee
Kingdom, but with such deviations within three English miles of
the Coast as shall be necessary to retain within British Territory
any villages which have been in habitual dependence on the British
Government at Cape Coast, and within Netherlands Territory any
villages which have been in habitual dependence on the Netherlands
Government at St. George d'Elmina.
' Article 2.—The two high contracting parties agree that the
following tariff of duties of Customs shall be enforced in their re-
spective possessions upon the Gold Coast :—


## p. 248 (#272) ############################################

248 WEST AFRICAN oomv'rmns.
'In the British Possessions.—Ale, beer, wine, and all spirits or
spirituous liquours, per old wine gallon, sixpence; cigars, snuff, or
tobacco in any shape, per pound, one penny ; gunpowder per pound,
one penny; ?rearms of every description, each one shilling; on all
other goods of every kind, an ad valorem duty of three per cent. on
the invoice price.
' In the Netherlands Possessions.—Ale, beer, wine, and all spirits
or spirituous liquors, per litre, eight cents; cigars, snuffs, or tobacco
in any shape, per kilogramme, ten cents; gunpowder, per kilo-
gramme, ten cents; ?rearms of every description, each sixty cents ;
on all other goods of every kind, an ad valorem duty of three per
cent. on the invoice price.
' Article 3.-—In order to prevent frauds in the importation of
goods, the high contracting parties engage to empower the of?cers
of the respective customs on the Gold Coast to require the masters
of vessels to make declaration of the nature, quantity, and value of
any goods which may be allowed to land. If the of?cers of customs
shall be of opinion that the value, so to be declared, is insuf?cient,
they shall be at liberty to take the goods on public account, on
paying to the importer the amount of his valuation, with the ad-
dition of ten per cent. thereon, and returning any duty which may
have been already paid.
'Article 4.-—The tariff of Customs Duties, speci?ed in Article 2,
shall be put into operation from and after a day to be agreed upon
between the two Governments, and shall remain in force for a period
of ten years ; and, further, until the expiration of twelve months
after either of the two contracting parties shall have given notice. to
the other of its desire for a revision or termination thereof.
'Article 5.—The tariff of Customs Duties may be enforced or re-
laxed by the local authorities at their own discretion, or according
to the orders of their respective Governments, in respect to articles
imported for the use of those authorities or for the personal use and
consumption of o?icers in the actual service of the Government.
' Article 6.—The mutual transfer of forts, possessions, and
rights of sovereignty or jurisdiction, stipulated in Article 1 of the
the present Convention, is dependent upon and subject to the esta-
blishment of the proposed tariff, and shall not take effect until the

Government of each country shall have procured the enactment of
any laws or regulations necessary in order to establish that tariff
for the term and under the conditions hereinbefore described, and
shall have actually put the same into operation.
' Article 7.—After the transfer alluded to in the foregoing
article shall have been made, a map shall be drawn of the new
boundary division according to the terms of Article 1. Two cepies
of the said map, duly attested by the Governments on either side,
shall then be appended to this Convention, for the purpose of show-
ing the boundary, which shall undergo no alteration, even should
any of the villages mentioned at the end of Article 1 be subse-
quently abandoned, or the tari? be modi?ed or withdrawn.
'Article 8.—The present Convention, after receiving, so far as
may be necessary, the approval of the legislative authority, shall be
rati?ed, and the rati?cations shall be exchanged at London within a
period of four months, or sooner if possible.
'In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed
the same, and have af?xed thereto the seals of their arms.

In this treaty the Dutch are decidedly the gainers, as the British au-
thorities were pressed to make it ,' but it ought to be an advantage to
the natives of those parts, especially those under British rule. In the
?rst place the Dutch ceded a few old, dilapidated, uninhabitable,
stone piles, misnamed forts, containing some worthless, honey-
combed, unserviceable iron guns, which have been over 100 years on
the seaboard of \Vestern Africa, for the lately repaired fort at Dix-
cove, which, in 1863, was manned with new heavy ordnance, at
enormous expense, from Woolwich.
Secondly, a few sea-coast towns, not ten miles distant in the in-
terior, hemmed in on all sides by British Territory, the area of
which put together does not measure, at its maximum, ?ve hundred
square miles form the ceded territory of the Dutch; whilst we gave
them in exchange countries extending into the interior to the utmost
boundary of the Coast Government, and occupying, at the least cal-

culation, one hundred thousand square miles (Apollonia, Wnssaw,
Awoowen, &c.).
Thirdly, the population in the ceded territory of the Dutch is less
than 10,000 souls, whilst that in the English, whose destiny we
have handed over to the Dutch, and who would rather be any-
thing but Dutchmen, numbers over 150,000 souls.
Fourthly, the Dutch ceded barren, recky lands, containing neither
mineral resources nor anything of commercial importance; whilst
we ceded the vast gold-mines of Wassaw and Apollonia, which,
if the Dutch should undertake to develop them, would repay them
a hundredfold.
The Convention, therefore, was in every respect advantageous to
the Dutch, but it was imperative that it should be concluded—-
Firstly, because the two Governments are now distinctly separated
from one another; each having its line of territory distinctly marked.
And, secondly, because a uniform tariff is now enforced by both
Governments on articles imported into the country, while
Thirdly, a good and substantial revenue will be insured, and con-
sequently there will be no excuse for the neglect of the local au~
thorities for not making adequate improvement in the social well-
being of the people.
But it has always been remarked, with great truth and justice,
that of all the Governments on the Coast of Africa none is more
inimical to the moral and intellectual improvement of their sub-
jects than the Dutch Government; and whilst valid improve-
ments might be traced in the even neglected English and late
Danish possessions, the Dutch subjects are in total ignorance, and
are left entirely to follow their own superstitious ideas. N 0 mis-
sionary is permitted to live amongst them, nor are there any schools
worth noticing for the benefit of the rising generation.
It is to be hoped that this new arrangement, which will free the
Dutch Home Government from the annual expenditure of 12,0001.
for its maintenance, would lead them to open new institutions for
the improvement of the people, or allow the assistance of those
select bodies who have made it their earthly mission to propagate
Christianity and educate the otherwise untutored heathen.
The British portion of the Gold Coast may now congratulate

itself that from the Sweet River to the Volta, at least, it is one
compact whole, no longer intersected by Dutch Settlements, the
European in?uence exercised in which was uniformly hostile to all
improvements; and only served to impede the march of Christian
civilization, by preserving in immediate contact with it centres of
demoralizing barbarism in which the worst excesses of heathenism
were not only tolerated but encouraged. If a good understanding
be established between the chiefs and the ruling power, if cautious
and well-studied plans are carried out, and no precipitate measures
employed, the future of the Gold Coast may be a satisfactory one. As
it is there are a great many measures required to be enacted before
the settlement can run a well-organized race with the other colonies
on the Coast, which I must here brie?y consider.
I.—An Assemblage or a Congress of Kings should be held at Cape
Coast, and one at Accra, for the Consideration of Matters relative to
the Good of the Protectorate.
The great difficulty found in the Gold Coast is caused by the
Executive ignoring the authority of the kings; thus, during the
Government of Mr. Andrews, a king of an important district was
heavily ?ned, and almost imprisoned, through the misrepresentation
of one of his subjects; a petty commandant had power to summon
a distant king from any part of his imperial rule, have him brought
to his petty police-court, and ?ned heavily for some charge his
subjects might bring against him. Mr. Pine acted better in this
respect; and such treatment to the kings everyone must ac—
knowledge as most injudicious, unreasonable, and impolitic, as well
as most damaging to the British in?uence on the Coast. The effect
is that the Administrator, instead of being loved, is hated and
abused, and his proclamations are trampled under foot.
But his Excellency Sir Benjamin Pine, during his wise and able
rule, made distinct regulations for the guidance of all magistrates
in the district courts, providing for proper treatment of the kings,
and the mode in which complaints were to be brought against them.
These rules were promulgated in an ordinance dated Cape Coast
Castle, March 15, 1858, and were to the following effect :—
1. Before any subject of an important king or chief in the in-
terior makes any complaint against him to our courts, he is to


## p. 252 (#276) ############################################

252 wssr AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
inform the king or chief of his intention to do so; the king or chief
is immediately to send a proper messenger with him to the Court,
in order that both sides may be heard at once. This rule is to be
enforced as far as practicable.
2. No summonses are to be issued against any such king or chief
at the instance of their subjects; but in important cases, where
there is'reasonable grounds for not enforcing the preceding rule, a
letter is to be sent to the king or chief, stating the cause of com-
plaint, and desiring his attendance, or that of one of his headmen
or messengers, as may be most convenient to him.
3. Petty and frivolous complaints against any such king or chief
are to be discouraged. In most of such cases it will be suf?cient
to send a letter to him informing him of the cause of complaint, and
desiring him to do justice, and also if necessary desiring him to
report how he has settled his case.
4. In cases between the subjects of such king or chief, it will
frequently be desirable to remand them for his decision in the ?rst
instance, cautioning him against making large and exorbitant
charges for doing so, and desiring him to report how he has de-
cided the case, and the amount of fees he has charged. All parties
must be clearly informed that an appeal will lie to the Court.
5. In cases of a decidedly political nature, such as disputes as to
the succession to the stools, and differences between great chiefs,
the Judicial Assessor and the commandants are, in general, not to
interfere, further than by taking evidences and referring the matter
to the Governor for his instructions. In cases of emergency, how-
ever, the commandants are to act according to the best of their
judgment, taking care to report their proceedings to the Governor
by the earliest opportunity.
The 6th and 7th rules refer to cases to be heard by com-
mandants, and the reports necessary to be forwarded to head-
quarters for the Governor's information.
A congress of kings in the Protectorate is more necessary now
than ever, seeing that, according to the decision of the Home Go-
vernment, they are to be left to ?ght their own battles; and
nothing would tend to keep them in amity and union, as well as in ,
good faith in the Local Government, so much as such yearly meeting,

CONGRESS or KINGS. 253
with a friendly discussion on topics that would be essentially bene?cial
to the Protectorate. One should be held at Cape Coast, the head-
quarters of the Western District, and the other at Accra, the head-
quarters of the Eastern District.
At Cape Coast should assemble the Kings of Denkera, Assin,
Mansoo, Anamaboe, Abrah or Abacrampa, Mankasin, Agimacoo,
Western Akim, lssicoomah and Akiunfudie, presided over by the
Administrator; at Accra, the Kings of Crobboe, Aquapim,
Aquamboe, Adda, Eastern Akim, Goomon, and VVinucbah, presided
over by the Administrator.
I shall here only detail the subjects for consideration, without
attempting to enlarge on their necessity :—
1. That one of the kings be nominated head of all the kings of
the Western District.
The advantage of this is that in cases where there is an obstre-
perous king of the Western District the Administrator has only to
apply to the nominated head King, who could more easily see his
instructions carried out with less expense than the Administrator
of Her Majesty's Forts and Settlements.
2. That a similar selection be made in the Eastern District.
3. That the kings should bind themselves to defend one another
against a common enemy.
4. That should any quarrel arise amongst themselves, the
aggrieved party should inform the king-in-chief, who should, if
necessary, call together the other kings, and the guilty party should
suffer the penalty in?icted by their decision, subject, however, to the
approval of the Administrator of HerMajesty'sForts and Settlements.
5. That the extradition of all political offenders and political
refugees of the King of Ashantee be strictly enforced.
6. That there should be made a broad road from one town to
the other by the male subjects of each town, in default of which a
?ne should be in?icted.
7. That the kings should be prevented from executing capital
punishment; but when anyone has shed innocent blood, he should
be forwarded to the British authority, to undergo his trial, and, if
found guilty, to be forwarded to the place where the crime was
perpetrated, and there hanged.

8. That the commandants be prevented from sending a summary
summons against a king to appear in their courts, such being deroga-
tory to the regal authority. That in any case of complaint they
should report the same to the Governor, who should give it his
early attention.
9. That the king's person should be regarded as sacred, and that
he should on no account be arrested by any warrant, either from a
commandant or from the Supreme Court, except he rebels against
existing authority.
10. That immediate obedience should be required of every king
to the Administrator's summons, or that of the king-in-chief, in
default of which a heavy ?ne be in?icted.
11. That the inhabitants should have a right of appeal from the
Kings Court to the Commandant or Stipendiary Magistrate Court,
but no judgment of the King's Court to be set aside unless the case
is thoroughly sifted, and a report ?led in the King's Court.
In such a case the appellant should be required to deposit a cer-
tain amount' for costs, unless he pleads informd pauperz's.
12. That the kings should forward to the Administrator the
names of their magistrates or other of?cers of their court, as well as
whatever changes they might make from time to time, as circum-
stances may rcnder necessary.
13. That proper means should be adopted to keep intact a friendly
relationship with their powerful enemy, the King of Ashantee.
I[.-—T/1at there should he Placed a Resident Consul ?-om the
Gold Coast Government at Coomassie.
The frequent disputes which have arisen between the Ashantee
potentate and the Administrator of Cape Coast have shown clearly that
the best means for keeping the two powers in peace and amity is to
have a consular agent at Coomassie; and none but a native of good
education who could speak the language ?uently should be ap-
pointed. Hitherto the policy of the Governors with the king is
generally carried by the former sending a letter by an interpreter,
who understands very little English, and in many cases could
scarcely understand the language made use of in the letter; he
, therefore interprets it according to his own idea of the sentence,
and in a great many cases puts an entirely wrong meaning to it.

These mistakes of interpreters are of everyday occurrence in the
court, and great palavers 0n the Coast when the interpreters are
unlettered, and are generally corrected by the educated natives.
The consul should be allowed a clerk; should be handsomely paid;
should have four months' leave of absence at the end of every three
years, with his expenses paid to the Coast. He should be paid out
of the revenue of the Colony, and his actions be under the imme-
diate control of the Administrator of the settlement.
At such a time as at present it is of high importance that
our Government on the Gold Coast should keep on the most
friendly terms with the Kingdom of Ashantee, and that no bellieose
attitude should injure the relationship between the two Govern-
ments. The present unfriendly state is mischievous to the trade of
the British Gold Coast, since the treaty of cession came into
operation. Previous to this treaty, we commanded all the countries
to the boundary of Ashantee—the Dutch, who have always been
the ally of Ashantee, were limited to the sea-board-—and, conse-
quently, the Ashantees could never show themselves on the sea-
coast towns when there was a misunderstanding between them
and ourselves. The case is now di?erent; the Ashantees will have
an open pathway from Coomassie to Elmina through Wassaw (with-
out passing through English territory) where they could trade freely
and independently of Cape Coast and Anamaboe.
The British merchants in British territory and the local revenue
will suffer the disadvantage if our line of policy with Ashantee is
not changed; the former will certainly transfer their business into
the Dutch territories, which are always opened to them. It was
on this point of territorial limit that the negotiation for an exchange
'of territories in 1858 met with a hitch, when we showed a determi-
nation to retain Wassaw. The negotiation went on smoothly up to
the time when Captain Coulon, an experienced Dutch of?cer, arrived
from the Coast of Africa at the Hague. He raised the objection
that if Wassaw were retained by the British Government the Dutch
would be con?ned only to the sea-board, would be prevented from
-c0mmunicating with their allies, and that the Ashantees would stop
their opening trade with interior tribes. This at once broke up the
negotiation. But that point being now conceded, we have given up

256 wns'r AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
our power of moderating and governing the trade between
Ashantee and the Coast, as the Ashantees will now be able to show
themselves on the sea-board, trading freely between Elmina and
Apollonia, independently of Cape Coast and Anamaboe. It is a
great triumph to Ashantee, and proves most conclusively the force
of my recommendation in the ?rst edition of this work, that we
should purchase out and out the Dutch Territories, which they were
ready at that time to sell, were we willing to pay down ready
cash for them. Hitherto, we have always boasted that we can shut
out the Ashantees from the Coast; can prevent them from being
supplied with guns, powder, and salt; can limit their trade, and
can force them to submit to our terms by eifecting a complete land
blockade of their Territory. By the treaty which came into opera—
tion on the 1st of January, 1868, we have lost all these advan-
tages, as no one would believe that if we choose to go to war with
Ashantee, the Dutch would blockade their forts against them, to the
ruin of their merchants and subjects, for our bene?t. At present
their intention is to make a good, durable road from Elmina, through
Wassaw to the borders of Ashantee.
III. That the King of Coomassie be induced to Send a Resident
Consul to Cape Coast.
His chief business will be to seek after the interest of the Ashantee
traders on the Coast ; to attend immediately to any complaint they
may bring to him of being maltreated by any of the kings or
their subjects. The result of these two acts will be that trade will
be greatly increased ; that there will be greater faith and cordiality
between the two Governments, and that the social and political ad-
vancement 0f the Colony will be greatly enhanced.
The governors should always hear in mind this Latin maxim:
Cessante ca'usd, cessat e?ectus, 0r, Sublata causd, tollitur efectus
(withdraw the cause and the e?ect is destroyed).
IV. That an Improvement should be Made in the Educational De-
partment of the Government.
At present the Colonial Government only supports a small school
at Cape Coast, where the boys learn scarcely anything more than to
read and write. In former years they gave the children a very good
education, having efficient masters, but those now-a-days employed

do not even know the rudiments of grammar ; the pay is so tri?ing
that the educated would not think of offering themselves for the post.
So degenerate has become the head Colonial School, supported and
overlooked by the Local Government, that the following account of
it (which I have taken every pains to verify) cannot but be read
with pain at the neglect of the local authorities in such an import-
ant matter as that of education : 'For some few years Cape Coast
was much commended as to the education given in the Government
School. But things are sadly changed. This same Government
School, which is the only school except'the Wesleyan Missionary's
on the Gold Coast, is now a play-house] The teachers are unde-
niably ignorant of the ?rst rudiments of the English, language,
although the pupils, who had previously a fair master, are very
smart. ' These boys are now su?'ering under the hand of an un-
quali?ed master ; a man of dull apprehension, who, fearing his
scholars would shame him if they continued in the school,
threatens their expulsion. His assistants were once astounded to
?nd him arguing with a boy as regards the word e?'ace. When
the boy used the word he told him he never heard it before, and
that it was not an English word, and continued arguing till the boy
proved the existence of the word by an English dictionary."'E Such,
then, is the educational element of the only school supported by the
Cape Coast Government; it is super?uous for me to say another'
word as to the necessity of a radical reform; except, perhaps, re-
commending that Government schools should be established at
various districts, with properly-paid educated teachers from Sierra
Leone or elsewhere, and a central Government Academy established
at Cape Coast.
The Wesleyans should extend and improve their educational esta-
blishments, and teach mechanics and agriculture, so that the boys
after leaving school would not become loafers, but of real use to
themselves and their friends. I have, in the chapter of the Self-
government of the Gold Coast, considered at length the labours of
the Basle missionaries, but I think it will lead to greater industry
and laudable emulation if the local authorities would pass an act, by
* The African Times.

the assistance of the Legislative Council, making it binding, to a
certain degree, on future governors that the most advanced pupils
in these schools should be employed to ?ll up vacant posts.
V. That there shouch be F armed an Industrial School at Cape Coast.
The Gold Coast is greatly wanting in good mechanics. There are
no good carpenters or masons to be found; nor are there any shoe-
makers, grainers, painters, tailors, joiners, coopers, or wheelwrights,
in the proper acceptation of the term. The Basle missionaries have
endeavoured to supply the de?ciency and teach some of these
branches, but they are wanting in funds; and therefore it should be
taken up by the Government, and a large establishment formed at
Cape Coast, with one of these German mechanics at the head.
A number of young persons should be sent to the French
settlement in Senegal to learn shipbuilding, as it will sup-
ply a great desideratum to the working portion of the Gold
Coast. At present whilst a costly boat (from 30]. to 601.)
is serviceable on the Gold Coast for only three, and the
utmost ?ve years, in the Gambia one of inferior quality, from
the superior workmen which the merchants keep, who have been
taught in French Goree, or Senegal, would last from ten to ?fteen
years ; whilst on the Gambia workmen are able to build small craft
from forty to eighty tons burden, on the Gold Coast the people
are unable to repair properly a leaky boat, and their rivers are con-
sequently unsupplied with those small craft which are of such import-
ance to the Gambia trade. I have seen several good and expensive
English-made boats, unserviceable from being slightly out of repair,
lying in the court-yard of many of the merchants on the Gold
Coast, and allowed to rot, which in the Gambia and Senegal would
very easily be put in proper working order, and made useful for many
more years. But the Gold Coast is not in close proximity to
Senegal.
VL—The Abolition of Slavery in the Towns on the Sea-coast in the
Vicinity 0f the Forts which, according to the late Secretary of State
for the Colonies, are British Colonies.
By Geo. IV., cap. 113, sec. 2, all dealings in slaves are pronounced
unlawful, and the tenth section makes all such dealings a felony
punishable with transportation for life. By 3 and 4 William IV.,



## p. 259 (#283) ############################################

DOMESTIC SLAVERY. 259
cap. 73, sec. 2, it is further enacted that, from and after the 1st of
August, 1834, slavery shall and is hereby utterly and for ever
abolished and declared unlawful throughout the British colonies,
plantations, and possessions abroad.'
From the above it is clearly proved that if the despatch of Her
Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies be worth its weight,
slavery, in the form of domestic slaves, should on no account be
tolerated on this Coast; especially when it is considered that within
twenty yards of the Governor's residence slaves can be and have
been (1866) bought and sold. I have, in the Self-government,
endeavoured to point out the position of the slaves as regards
their masters; that it is an institution which engenders the most
indolent habits; that it deteriorates the vitality of the male inhabi-
tants; that it is in every way the most destructive element in the
Gold Coast politics. It is probable that the slaves may prefer to
remain with their masters, who are generally kind and indulgent
to them, and on whom they depend for support; but this should
not be permitted.
Hitherto the British authority had peculiar rules in dealing with
domestic slaves on the Gold Coast. It was enjoined by Order of
Council, dated 4th April, 1856, see. 3, to the judicial functionary
0f the settlement that, in the administration of justice to the natives,
he should pay equitable regard to the local customs, so far as the
same shall not be repugnant to Christianity or to natural justice,
and that in a country where slavery pervades society from the heir
to the throne to the meanest servant, and where every man has been
accustomed from time immemorial to look upon his children and
servants as the most valuable property he possesses, it is impossible
to abstain from entertaining questions between masters and slaves
and disputed rights to slaves, inasmuch as claims are frequently set
up by individuals to whole families without any just foundation;
and if these were not examined and determined, the subject of such
claimants would be inevitably reduced to slavery wherever the
claimant had suf?cient power to enforce his claim. ' Therefore,' re-
marked Judge Corner, 'rigidly abstaining from interfering to
enforce slavery, as I conceive is the duty of every British magistrate,
my endeavour is always in dealing with such cases to mitigate as
s2

far as possible the evils necessarily incident to the system, at the
same time that care is taken not to violate unnecessarily the long-
established laws and usages of the country.'
With regard to cases of ill-treatment of slaves, this high authority,
who had ample opportunity of forming a just opinion on the subject,
said: 'I am proud to say that I have them very much less than,
previous to my residence in this country (Gold Coast), I could
have imagined to be the case; and I consider it a remarkable cir-
cumstance that, in upwards of two years that I have now exercised
my of?ce, no case has come before me in which, upon exami-
nation, I have found such a degree of cruelty or severity as to
justify me in exercising the power of emancipation.' The com-
plaints of ill-treatment, he- avers, were mostly of a frivolous
nature; in those cases where the masters had punished the slaves,
the punishment was merited by gross misconduct on the part of the
slaves. '
In those cases where he had to decide'against claims to slaves, the
slaves received from him certi?cates of their freedom; thus prevent-
ing a renewal of the claim in some future period. 'In accounting
for this state of things, the fact of the total cessation of the foreign
slave-trade on this part of the Coast, consequent upon British occu-
pation of it, must not be forgotten; but independently of that I
must say that the conduct of masters towards their servants gene-
rally is such as I could earnestly recommend as an example to be
followed (sub modo) by some of our friends at home, for they are
commonly looked upon and considered as members of the family,
more particularly in the rural or bush districts, working side by
side with their masters, eating from the same dish, and constantly
addressing each other by the titles of father and son. The master
usually provides a wife or a husband for his slaves, and frequently, if
it be a female, takes her to wife for himself or his son ;' which forms
the utopia of savage bliss, but ought not longer to be permitted in
British colonies, the British Constitution forbidding its existence. Its
continuance now on the Gold Coast, where a portion of the British
Army serves, gives a false idea that England supports and protects
that unlawful traffic ; whilst beyond mere toleration this is not the
case. If, in the newly-acquired Colony of Lagos, Governor Glover

is able to abolish domestic slavery, I do not see why it should not
be attempted on the Gold Coast.
Let it be proclaimed that Cape Coast, Anamaboe, Accra, in-
cluding Christiansborg, are for ever to be regarded as free towns.
That slavery, under whatever shape or form, should no more exist
there ; and everyone residing within ?ve miles of them shall be freemen.
That none of their inhabitants should hold or sell slaves; and that
anyone violating the law should be rigidly prosecuted by law, and,
if found guilty, severely punished. That any slave coming within
these free towns from the interior, or whatever place, should repair
to the Forts, and there receive his manumition, and become thence-
forth a free man. In these free towns the lands should be divided
into lots amongst the people. All lands should be registered, and
proper grants issued out to landowners. No claim of land here-
after should be recognized without such a grant, all unregistered
lands being made Government property. Each slave on being
freed should have a portion of land given him for building and
cultivation, and the authorities should take steps to encourage loca-
tion, and thus by degrees concentrate the interest of the whole of
the Protectorate on these free points. Liberal institutions should
be granted to the people, and every means adopted to elevate them.
There are, of course, many objections that would be raised to the
abolition of a custom which time and habit has honoured. Thus
the slaves, not being accustomed to live independently, might make
their escape to the interior tribes, and then resell themselves, so
that, after being freed from one master, they might become enslaved
to another. This is a dif?culty which must occur, and will be hard to
obviate; but if the Local Government, with its improved revenue,
makes itself strong and respected by the interior tribes, if there is
union and friendship between the interior kings and the Local
Government, this practice will soon be put down by the Government
making it distinctly known and generally proclaimed that any case
of traf?c in man between themselves and any of the inhabitants of
the free towns would be met by the authorities with severe punish-
ment. At the commencement there will be a few cases, which will
rapidly decrease according to the measures of the Government.
The question of compensation may appear to present some diffi-

culty. The ?nancial dif?culties of the country cannot allow this to
be entertained; and should we have to wait until this is accomplished
the Coast will never get rid of this social evil. In fact Earl'
Russell, in a despatch to the Governor of Cape Coast, dated July
14, 1844, suf?ciently silenced this question; he stated that it could
not be entertained—?rst, 'because in no case has compensation.
been given ' in a British Colony, ' except for the enfranchisement of
slaves duly registered; and, secondly, because Her Majesty's-
Government do not admit that it was even lawful to hold any
person in slavery in Her Majesty's dominions on the West Coast of'
Africa, although the existence of slavery there at a former period.
may, as a mere matter of fact, not be capable of contradiction.'
VI.—T he Establishment of a Permanent Commandancy at Accra,
It cannot be doubted that the Eastern District of the Gold Coast
is the most important on this whole Coast both as regards revenue,
resources, capabilities, and I must also say extent, although it
occupies a secondary post.
The commandancy of this district has within the last few years
been ?lled by o?ieers commanding the detachment in the station,
but in the last appointment a change has been made in this routine
line by an o?icer being appointed from the Central Government at
Sierra Leone. He acts ea: o?cio as presiding magistrate; and the-
Accra district being at some distance from Cape Coast, cases of
importance and great intricacy are of frequent occurrence; it is
therefore absolutely necessary that the Commandant should know
something of law; mere common sense has proved entirely insuf?cient,
and in many cases ridiculous, especially when he has to withstand
the criticism of acute and clever attorneys. Again, it is necessary
that the commandant should be acquainted to a certain degree with.
the native customs and laws, since frequently cases arise among
the natives in which the laws of England are inapplicable,.
and he has to arrive at his decision entirely by the guidance of
native laws. Especially of late years the necessity for a permanent
commandancy has been most keenly felt. Within the short space of'
two years it was calculated that there were no less than seven.
different of?cers appointed as Commandants; the result was that,
not one of them had time to become well acquainted with his-


## p. 263 (#287) ############################################

COMMANDANTS AND CLERKS. 263
duties, and everything went " wrong," and the Accras were the
sufferers.
Alive to the bene?t of such an establishment, Sir Benjamin Pine
appointed a permanent civilian commandant to succeed the venerable
James Bannerman, but he was soon deprived of the office after Pine
left. For the bene?t of this part of the coast it should again be
established, the post should be made remunerative, a solicitor be
obtained to ?ll it, or an independent person who is subject to no
orders but that of the governor, and who understands something of
the law.
VII.—There should be established Itinerant Commandants styled
District Commandants, one for the Eastern and the other for the
Western District. Each District should be divided into Sub-Districts,
and Clerks, styled Clerks of Districts, appointed, who should receive
their orders from the Itinerant Commandants.
This will be a very important step in the government of the
whole territory; it will keep the supreme authority well informed of
all that is going on in every part of the country, and enable the
executive to employ stringent and quick measures in stopping at the
bud any outbreak or disturbance that may disturb the peace and
commerce of the country. Secondly, it will enable summonses to
receive immediate attention. Thirdly, it will prevent intestine wars
between neighbouring chiefs. Fourthly, it will make the inhabitants
feel that the Government takes some interest in them. Fifthly, it will
make them pay a greater respect to their kings, giving them power
over their subjects, and at the same checking any barbarous custom
they might be inclined to practise.
The District Commandants should be made Justices of the Peace,
and should make a tour of inspection through each sub-district, settle
all disputes, issue summonses, hear cases, see that the roads are
properly kept in repair and make annual of?cial reports on the-
state of the district, and their progress. Each Clerk of District should
have two constables attached to his post, and he should have all cases
in readiness prior to the arrival of the District Commandant; the
whole establishment should be made self-supporting by the sum-
monses and ?nes.

VIII.——G'ood, open, and properly laid Streets should be made in at
least the principal Sea-port Towns.
There is no town or village in all the Colonies of Western Africa
in which there is such a great want of good streets as on the Gold
Coast. Whilst all the British towns in the Gambia, Sierra Leone, and
more recently Lagos, have been properly laid out with open streets,
the Gold Coast, as in many other things, has never received
the slightest attention in this particular. Here, where Europeans
have resided for more than a hundred years, where we have a good
military force and a large colonial staff, the native huts are placed in
such confusion as to be equalled only by towns in the far interior
where civilization has never reached. Even in the newly-built towns
on the sea-coast such as the new Christiansborg, there is no control
whatever exercised by the local Government to prevent this helter-
skelter mode of building. The huts are all huddled together, leaving
irregular narrow lanes, interrupted here and there by piles of
fermented mud or deep excavations containing stagnant water. In
some places these lanes are kept in the most revoltingly ?lthy state.
It is said to have been lately in contemplation to pass an
ordinance to rectify this evil, and form open streets in the various
parts of the town. This would necessitate a revision of the tenure of
lands already referred to. It is the wish of all those who have the
interest of the Gold Coast at heart that some such plan as this should
be carried into effect.
IX.—To Encourage every JIIeans tending to Work the Gold Mines of
the District properly.
This is a subject of intrinsic importance to the wealth, prosperity,
and good government of the Gold Coast. In the chapter on
the self-government of this part of the Coast I have endea-
voured to point out the numerous rich mines which abound in
various districts, and the imperfect manner in which they are worked.
Something should be done to remedy this, a company should be
formed for the express purpose of digging these mines; and the
Government should guarantee its protection against any molestation
from the native tribes. If Clerks of Districts as well as District
Commandants be established, this can be very easily done, and a-

well-organized company with a tri?ing capital would within a very
short time so open these vast resources of the country, that before
long we should ?nd men from every part of the world ' ploughing the
ocean and digging the mountain sides ' after it, and then the Govern-
ment of Cape Coast would be of some importance to the British
throne. Dr. Robert Clark, late Colonial Surgeon of this Coast, in
a paper read before the Ethnological Society, has given amost lucid
account of the gold-digging by the natives in the extensive gold-
?elds of Wassaw, which we have lately transferred to the Dutch
Government.
The natives in the gold districts are very much prejudiced against
having any one who wears European clothes, or who can speak a
European language, in the gold districts. They are afraid of the gold
being worked by civilized men, and consequently make religion the
scapegoat for their resistance. They maintain that the inexorable
Fetish forbids any white man—or ' black man in white man's
clothes,' to use Captain Burton's phraseology—to go near the
mines, and consequently veto every effort in that direction. Mr
Thomas Hughes, an intelligent native of Cape Coast, commenced
mining operations some years ago in the rich ?eld of Western
Wassaw. He was promised support by the Local (Andrew's) Go-
vernment, so that he imported expensive machinery for that express
purpose, and had it transported by labourers to the locality
selected, and commenced digging. Within a short distance his
diggers came to a thin stratum, and by continued digging they met
with a ?ne, rich vein. During this time, although residing within a
few yards from the diggings, the king of the district strictly pro-
hibited him from going near it, as being against the demands of
Fetish. Mr. Hughes was compelled to obey, 0n the alternative of
instant expulsion. This, however, came in due course of time; no
sooner was it known that he had met a ?ne vein, and that he was
likely to succeed, than he and his people were ignominiously turned
out of the country and his machinery destroyed. He proceeded to
Cape Coast (this was in September, 1861) and reported the circum-
stance to the local authorities, and requested the promised assist-
ance. His importunities met with a deaf ear; no effort was ever
_ made to recompense him for the loss he had sustained, and he was

interdicted to enter the country. From that time he became a
ruined man.
No good will be obtained from the gold-mines of the Gold Coast
except—
1. Civilized agency with proper machinery be employedto workthem.
2. The Local Government take proper effective means for support-
ing their efforts and protecting them.
At present the British Gold Coasteans depend entirely for their
gold trade on their inveterate enemies the Ashantees, whilst their
country is replete with mines. Having ceded those of Wassaw and
Apollonia to the Dutch, we have those in Denkera and Akim. A
good road to these districts will be the ?rst thing to be attempted ;
and I must here leave the subject for the attention and consideration
of the local authorities and the well-to-do inhabitants.
X.—The Placing of a Small Steamer in the River Volta.
Unquestionably, at present, the Eastern District is the most im-
portant in the British Gold Coast; rich in the most exportable
commercial articles, palm-oil, palm kernel, and cotton, it is un-
fortunately surrounded by tribes who know how to make them-
selves disagrecably felt by panyarring loaded canoes and carriers
passing through their country, and quietly retreating into their
mountain fastnesses. It is, therefore, of great importance to the
merchants of Accra, to the development of the country, and for the
increase of the (all-important) revenue, that the Volta should be
properly protected by a small steamboat. For the last three years
the commercial condition of this district through the River has been
interrupted by the causes above enumerated, the merchants almost
reduced to bankruptcy, and the Local Government cannot raise a
revenue. A small steamer placed on the Volta to protect the
trade, to cost from 200]. to 5001., will be of paramount value to
this part of the Coast, and might be employed for towing rafts 0i
palm-oil puncheons down the River. The oil from the district of
Crobboe can be brought down in small puncheons to Amedica, as
the River between those places is shallow, rocky, and unsafe. Here
the merchants can transfer them to large butts, then to be towed
down the River. By these means the little steamer would pay its
own expenses.

cowm' CURRENCY, am) CONSTABULARY. 267
XI.—Alteration in the Currency of the Country.
The cowry currency is as cumbrous and inconvenient as the
Spartan iron bars of Lycurgus; it is full time to change the system.
It has been successfully changed in some parts of the world where
it was once prevalent, and if on the authority of Captain Burton,*
the late Sayyid Said of Zanzibar and Muskat found no dif?culty in
changing the system, I do not see why we should not attempt the
experiment. Substitute a copper currency for cowry, and I am
certain that it will very soon take amongst the people. At present
even the oil-men in the interior, who demanded, in years gone by, a
large quantity of cowry, are now too happy to receive silver, for
which they are ready to give a very heavy discount. They have
discovered that the cowry shell was too bulky to keep, and conse-
quently prefer silver, several thousand pounds of which yearly pass
through Accra, and yet still silver coin is always scarce. The bush
people, as the interior tribes are called, receive them in exchange for
produce, take them in the interior, and then bury them, and they
are therefore lost sight of. Many of my readers who have never
seen nor know the value of the cowry shell will be astonished to
hear that its possession is really inconvenient to the rich. The
weight of 2,000 of the blue shells is computed at from 80 to 90 lbs.,
which is scarcely equal to four shillings and sixpence. Lieutenant
Forbes complains that to carry ?fty dollars he had to employ ?ve
women. Copper coin should be effectually and compulsorily intro-
duced, as it would save time and expense to the merchants, and
would lead to a great improvement in the trade.
XII.—The Formation of a Good Constabulary Force.
The present constabulary force of the Gold Coast is very poor,
whilst the police at Sierra Leone cost the Local Government about
14,0001. a-year. On the Gold Coast it scarcely costs 1,000l., al-
though the latter has an area of territory more than ?fty times that
of the former. From the turbulent and ru?ian-like state of the
interior tribes, it is necessary that there should be a good and
efficient police force in the Gold Coast. Sir Benjamin Pine,
through this, recommended the formation of a good constabulary
* ' Abeokuta and the Cameroon Mountains,' pp. 320, vol. 1.

force, placed under the immediate control of the Administrator,
which would enable him to carry out a ?rm administration of the
law. It would be more serviceable to keep order than the soldiers
of the West Indian Regiments, wh0_have no stamina for bush opera-
tions, and who cannot be easily moved by the Administrator. The
Administrator of the Gold Coast should be a man with a mind
capable of exercising an in?exible adherence to resolutions once
formed for the vindication of the law, as such a course would
always command support, and 'involves less danger than a weak
submission to clamour.'
The recruits for the constabulary should not be entirely from the
Gold Coast, as their connexion by relationship would never permit
them to carry out any important orders effectually. The majority
should therefore come from without—e. 9., the Hausa of Lagos, or
men from the other Colonies. They should be well cared for, pro—
perly drilled, and placed under the immediate control of the Ad-
ministrator. Two hundred men so enrolled would be of more use
to him than three hundred West Indian soldiers within the Castle
of Cape Coast, and then, like Nelson, although in a diiferent manner,
he could a?ord to leave his despatches unopened when about to
enforce any measure for the good of the country.

CHAPTER 'XVII.
REQUIREMENTS OF LAGOS—SOME REMARKS ON THE
REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA.
WE have in Chapter XII. considered at some length the physical
geography of the interior countries of the Colony of Lagos, their
capabilities, the manners and customs of the people, and now we have
to remark on its requirements; but not having had suf?cient oppor-
tunity during my brief stay there to make a full investigation of the
subject, my remarks will be but few and of a general nature.
1. Every improvement should be made in the drainage of the
town.
a 2. The various rivers already detailed should be properly, care-
fully, and systematically surveyed.
3. Every facility should be given to the inhabitants for the
transport of their produce from the interior into the port of Lagos.
4. A good tram-road should be made in various directions to the
interior, commencing from Lagos and other British towns—one
from Ikorodo to Makun, to be pushed forward to Ipara. Another
from the mainland of Lagos to Munsho, to be carried to Otta,
a third from Worro to Igbessa, and a fourth from Badagry to
Addo.
With these few observations, I must dismiss the subject of Lagos,
with the hope that I may hereafter get suf?cient opportunities
to make it a subject of close examination and report, and shall now
pass on to a few remarks on the Republic of Liberia.
My friend Professor Blyden, of this republic, in an oration
delivered in Syria not long ago, made the following remarks respect-
ing the neighbouring British Colony, Sierra Leone, the seat of the
British Government in Western Africa. 'Sierra Leone,' said he,
'strikingly exempli?es the inef?ciency of European legislation as a

civilizer of the black race. Under British rule, crippled by monarch-
ical restraint, the African element, so essential to African civilization
in Sierra Leone, is rendered subdued and silent, and hence that
province has been, and under like circumstances will continue to be, of
no marked avail as a pioneer of intelligent progress. Even if
it should not be possible for the Republic of Liberia to acquire them
in the course of time in an honourable and quiet manner, still they
will never rise to su?icient importance to cause us internal uneasiness.'
Whilst we cannot endorse this quali?ed statement of Professor
Blyden, as it is not our intention here to discourse on the subject,
Liberia will no doubt allow Sierra Leone to point out certain defects
in the government of that Republic, which, if remedied. would greatly
enhance social advancement and material progress. In Chapter II.
I have considered certain defects in the constitution and government
of the Republic which are of fundamental importance. Here I intend
to remark on some social defects which should engage the immediate
attention of the Legislature.
First, appearance aids considerably in our diagnOsis of the
character of a person, place, or thing. The entrance to Monrovia,
the capital of the Liberian Republic, reminds one of the entrance to a
purely native town, where the light of civilization has never reached,
and it gives to the causual observer the idea of a want of a
?rm government, a want of revenue, a want of developmental
powers, and the existence of great inertia in the municipal authority
of Monrovia. At the very entrance of the town, as one jumps out
of his boat, he ?rst meets with a number of miserable cane ?shing
huts, occupied by an almost naked crowd of kroomen and women;
the children, wretchedly tattooed, squatting about in perfect nudity,
and answering the calls of nature in every direction. Behind these
about twenty feet in diameter, is a thick bush, in which is a narrow
footpath leading to a pile of stones put together helter-skelter,
without any idea of masonry, and forming the commencement of
a bridge, which is so rickety as to require a passer-by to keep
Newton always in memory, as the least loss in the centre of gravity
would lead to a fearful catastrophe. All around this bridge is an
extent of land consisting of mangrove swamp, which is entirely
exposed twice in the course of the twenty-four hours, and which

AMERICAN mrrcnaxrs AND THE ABORIGINES. 271
gives out most deadly miasmata. Such was the condition of the
entrance of Monrovia, the capital of the Liberian Republic, when I
landed there in January, 1866.
The miserable ?shing huts should on no account be permitted to
remain where they are ; the bush should be cut down, and the land
reclaimed from the river, and sold for the bene?t of the town
corporation, which can be easily done by the building of a river wall _
along its edge at low-water mark; the rescued land can then be ?lled
up and hardened with materials from without, so that in course of
time, instead of being the source of pernicious poison, it might be of
gain to the municipality of thetown. On the whole, Monrovia was
a very unfortunate selection for the capital of the Republic; and the
large and open streets are covered with huge basaltic rocks, which
entirely preclude a carriage drive.
Whilst we rejoice with the Liberians on their yearly accession of
emigrants from America, it behoves us to remind them that unless
certain improvements are made among the aboriginal inhabitants
whom they meet in the country, in order that they may be brought to
the scale of equality with themselves, there will be a poor chance for
the prosperous futurity of the Government. These original inhabitants
are a ?rm, able-bodied race, who, unlike the American Indians, would
withstand ' wave after wave of destructive and malignant tempest,'
were it ever to be brought against them. They are a perpetual race,
and the climate is more likely to devastate the emigrants than them
——z'.e., if the former continue to remain pure and unmixed with the
aboriginal inhabitants. The improvement in the position of the
coloured population of America would lead a priori to the belief that
ere long there would be but very few emigrations from that country
and consequently a general diminution of the civilized population.
It must always be borne in mind that purely mulatto population
cannot exist for any lengthened period; they must either merge
into one or other races (black or white), or gradually die out.
Among mulattoes propagation is less proli?c, and the offspring
is delicate and short lived. When, however, propagation has
been maintained in purity, within a few generations the whole race
dies out. The duty of the Liberian Government should there-
.fore be :—


## p. 272 (#296) ############################################

272 wasr AFRICAN courrrmas.
1st. To interdiet all tattooing of children in all the towns and
villages where the Government has suf?cient in?uence to do so.
2nd. To make education of the children up to a certain age
a compulsory act.
3rd. To pay special attention to the education of young kroo
females.
Within a few years, if adopted, this would lead to great improve-
ment in the general population, and then there would be a possibility
of intermarriages taking place between the emigrants and the abori-
gines, and a powerful element in the future government of the
Republic be ensured.
Liberia is now recognized by the great Republic of America as
an independent nationality, and this happy event has been crowned
by that State appointing a consular agent to reside in Monrovia.
At the birth of the young Republic, England stretched forth her
helping hand to her, and assisted in every way to raise the standard
of the population, and to develop the resources of the country; there
was perfect harmony between the two Governments; a British con-
sulate was established in Monrovia, which carefully watched over the
interests of British merchants. This, unfortunately, has been abolished,
although the trading establishments of British merchants in this
territory have lately been very much increased. The Liberian
Government, through many difficult questions which havelately arisen
respecting territorial boundary. have represented to the British
Government the necessity of re-establishing the consulate, and we
think that it will be a great boon, not only to Liberia, but also to
British capitalists, should this be acceded to.

CHAPTER XVIII.
CONCLUDING REMARKS—ADVICE TO THE RISING GENERA-
TION. IN WEST AFRICA.
IN 1846, Mr. Hilary Teage, a Liberian, delivered a most graphic,
eloquent, and touching speech in Monrovia to the citizens of Liberia,
in which we ?nd the following passage: ' Upon you [fellow-citizens],
rely upon it, depends, in a measure you can hardly conceive, the
future destiny of your race. You are to give the answer whether
the African race is doomed to interminable degradation—a hideous
blot on the fair face of creation, a libel upon the dignity of human
nature; or whether they are capable to take an honourable rank
amongst the great family of nations.' This is a most valuable admo-
nition, which should be treasured up by every one in Western Africa,
but especially the rising generation, bearing in mind that they have
a special mission to ful?l on earth; that they are not exclusively
their own property, but that by industry and perseverance they
might so better their circumstances and position as to give material
aid to those less favoured than themselves. It must also be remem—
bered by them that Western Africa in literature and science is
among the least of nations. It has been so destined that, with the
exception of the aboriginals, no other nation has been able to plant
a sure footing in her, and consequently that from her sons, and her
sons alone, must her complete regeneration be looked for. The
initiative cannot be expected to come from within—it must come
from without; and it is certain that ' genius, talent, and virtue will
be honoured, whether clad in rags or in broadcloth, and the no-
bility of a manly nature will not always continue to be estimated ac-
cording to the colour of the skin.'
Let the younger portion of the population, who are so susceptible
and ready to take offence and retort at the least occasion, remember
:r

that all Europeans who enter their country, by the higher degree of
intellectual and moral cultivation which they, as a race, have re-
ceived, are entitled to a certain degree of respect as the harbingers
'of civilization, imitating the good and virtuous, whilst shunning
those whose actions are a disgrace to civilization—waiting patiently
whilst maintaining an upright and digni?ed course, for the time
when they will see the necessity of modifying their opinions and
acting up to them with ideas of loftier and holier order. In the mean—
time, however, let them be uniformly courteous, cultivate their
minds, and strive zealously for substantial worth. Let them seekl/
independence without bravado, manliness without subserviency; and
let them put their shoulders to the work, and 'prove by the effort
they themselves make that they, too, desire, and are striving, and
will strive for the Christian and industrial regeneration of Africa;
and do this with the modesty not at all incompatible with manly
self-reliance, and a due sense of the innate dignity which should
characterize men who have been helped out of their degradation,
and brought at once into the ranks of a Christian civilization which
has taken eighteen centuries to be developed.'
It must be remembered that there is no royal road to greatness—
that it cannot be said that this or that man possesses a heaven-
born reputation, greatness, or talent. It must be bought by severe
perseverance, by an undaunted courage and industry, by real hard
work and application, with a love for the undertaking we have in
hand, by an uncompromising, disinterested adhesion to the truth.
These, and these alone, will be the keystone for every one to ascend
to the altitude of material and honourable success—success that
will produce in us primarily real improvement, for real and exten-
sive usefulness to our country hereafter, when the time is ripe.
What, may be asked, are the passports to this honourable success '?
Dr. Rivington, in an admirable address delivered at the opening of
one of the London Medical Schools, stated them to be ability, labour,
and character—these three are the passports to an honourable fame.
'Ability,' says he, 'is the capacity for acquiring and using know-
ledge and skill; labour, the means of acquirement and use; cha-
racter, the direction and control of acquirement and usefulness.
Ability without labour is the talent wrapped up in a napkin; ability

ADVICE TO THE memo GENERATION. 275
without virtue will work not for the true end of all talents, all know-
ledge, and all effort—the use and advantage of men—but for the
grati?cation of a sel?sh vanity, which would tarnish its laurel
wreaths.' That the African race possesses undoubtedly this ability
may be further proved by the result of competitive examination in
Europe between those who are educated there and their more
favoured schoolmates, by the progress they make in different un-
dertakings in their native climate; and it behoves them, therefore,
to labour steadfastly for the regeneration of their country, and to
dissipate from the minds of those indisposed to the advancement of
their race, the false theory always advanced, that they are in-
capable of advancement.
They should make it their ruling principle to concentrate their
mental powers, their powers of observation, reasoning, and memory,
on the primary objects of their engagement. 'Never to observe
without thought; never reason to con?dent conclusions without a.
suf?ciency of certainly veri?ed facts ; never to acquire facts without
submitting them to the test of reasoning and, when occasion offers,
to the test of experience,' as it has been conclusively remarked that
observation without thought is a hasty observation, and the experi-
ence derived from it is wasted; and if we reason without a su?iciency
or veri?cation of facts we shall reason into error; and if we re-
member without comparison the result will be that we shall be a vast
storehouse of inconsequential knowledge.
The Right Hon. Mr. Gladstone, in an able speech delivered at
St. Martin's Hall, Hanover Street, Long Acre, in July, 1867,
most truthfully said 'that each man in his situation should labour
for the improvement of his mind earnestly and yet humbly, never
thinking that the knowledge which he may acquire is even as a grain
of sand in comparison with the knowledge which he cannot acquire,
but still con?dently labouring that the knowledge within his reach
has, ?rst of all, a great value in itself; and, secondly, that it
has a great. value beyond itself—viz., its value as an instru-
ment of culture reacting upon the mind, strengthening it, enlarging
it, enlightening it, giving it ?rmness of tissue, suppleness and
elasticity of movement, a capacity applicable to all the purposes of
life, of raising the human being not in outer circumstance alone—

although it no doubt exercises a most powerful in?uence in that
direction—but in himself, in his character, in those faculties with
which he is endowed, and in consequence of his possession of which,
that high and noble privilege has been ascribed to him that he alone
of all other creatures was made in the iinage of God.' These
remarks should be treasured up in the minds of the rising generation;
but it will be my place here to caution those who, having received
good and proper education, systematically neglect the powerful
means at their command, become idle and vicious—who, forming
themselves the supporters of late hours and the patrons of cloths,
petticoats, and paylmes, virtually constitute themselves the Goths
and Vandals of the colony they reside in—to whom
Thinking is but an idle waste of thought,
And nought is everything, and everything is nought—
men who look upon their lives not as the public property of their
country, and therefore requiring those improvements necessary for its
advancement, but as a superlative cope for the whist table, écarté,
unlimited 100, and unlimited lewdness—not as the time for extend-
ing the benign in?uences of their education to their less favoured
brethren, but as a '?ne, though, ah! sad fate! a fugitive oppor-
tunity,' for drinking brandy and water, whisky punch, and an un-
limited quantity of beer (Rivington). Such men, happily, are few
in number, who instead of deprecating in the most unmeasured
terms the vices of a class of inhabitants who seize every opportunity
of allying them to the anthropoid apes, imitate them in their de-
grading habits. Let them consider that their own interest is
intimately bound up in the interest of their country's rise; and that
by developing the principle of public interest they will bring the
Government to take an interest in themselves, and thus their
interest and that of their Government will not clash, but become
identical; and then would it more fully appear that there is no such
thing as the real interest of a government 'contra-distinguished
from the real interest of a community; no such thing as the interest
of a community contra-distinguished from the real interest' of the
country. And it will also be found that it is not the interest of all
men to be attracted by power, by wealth, by fame, by great place,

and by mere book-knowledge, but that, on the contrary, it is the
interest of all men to be attracted by virtue, by honesty, by charity,
by wisdom, by truth, by happiness, and by peace.
Let the rising generation, therefore, study to exert themselves to
obtain the combined attractive in?uence of knowledge and wisdom,
wealth and honesty, great place and charity, fame and happiness,
book-learning and virtue, so that they may be made to bring their
happy in?uences to bear on the regeneration of their country; and
then there will be the real exercise of those qualities which will
gradually lead to the attainment of the power of self-government,
and the contemplated improvement of the House of Commons Com-
