<p class="p "><span class="seg smallcaps ">My Kind Friends</span>,—For a long time I
have wished to thank you for what you have
done for me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beloved friends, to-day I thank
you for what you have done for my son and
for myself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I thank you for what he was
taught, and for what he was prepared for, by
your means.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From the beginning you acted
with great wisdom towards him, and thereby
conferred privileges and marvellous blessings
upon us all.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You opened up every path for
him by which he was directed in the way of
salvation, and which you also showed unto
his people as well as to himself and to his
family.</p>
<p class="p ">Beloved, your work to my son I represent
with the words which were said respecting
man :<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Creator first prepared a place for
man before He created him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When He had
finished all that was right for man, He created
him, and placed him in the midst of every
advantage.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His commandment instructed
him, like him who has departed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus it
was so.</p>
<p class="p ">What can I speak to you ?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dearly beloved,
that which you began did you not finish ?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
You gave the blood of your blood<span>*</span> to my son.
I have seen it with my own eyes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That event
taught us to know your habits, your disposition,
and your speech.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That great event
united us very closely together.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In effect it
seemed to say to my son :<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tiyo Soga</span>, go,
take this great enlightener amongst your
countrymen.'<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My friends, what can I say to
you ?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He is gone to the place prepared for
him :<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>look there for him !<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pardon me in
referring to this matter.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beloved, what gift
can be more highly esteemed than this ?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Rejoice, beloved !<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>we also rejoice with the
churches in <span class="country" title="A country.">Scotland</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rejoice ye !<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Canzibe,
the bright, the morning star of spring, has
already risen upon <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first teacher
belonging to our countrymen was sent forth
by you.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Be glad, ye people of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Caffraria</span> !<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Amaxosa</span>, the first home of my son, now lying
desolate and forlorn, speaks of your laborious
toil.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rejoice ye !<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These five gum trees still
standing remind me that, while the desolate
and deserted homes of our countrymen are
covered with the couch grass, it is not so with
respect to that in which my son abides this
day.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His home is now far distant from these
gum trees.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Vain, then, is it for you to care
so much, and to be so anxious for the things
of this world.</p>
<p class="p ">But now there is a thing present to-day by
which I see him,<span>*</span> and yet do not see him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By
the kindness of one whom I do not know,
there is the stone that preserves the name of
my son, in order that the generation present,
and generations yet to come, may be told of
him whom we so greatly loved.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That stone
is the first, so far as I know, that has been
erected by you (the churches in <span class="country" title="A country.">Scotland</span>),
and on that account my heart is exceeding
glad.</p>
<p class="p ">My friends, I thank that kind friend for the
words which he wrote for that stone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I continue
still to hear them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is written that a
prophet said to a certain man, 'Go, wash
seven times in <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Jordan</span>, and thou shalt be
made whole.'<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He went.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But the prophet did
not personally appear :<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>he merely spoke the
word, although unseen.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My thanks I give to
that unseen friend who wrote ; and true it is
that the works of a good man will follow
him.</p>
<p class="p ">There is one also who long ago began to
break up the new ground in my son, and who,
although not now in this world, is entitled to
my thanks.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I thank our old missionary, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
Chalmers</span>.</p>
<p class="p ">It is proper also that I should thank <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
Govan</span>, who so greatly benefited my son by
his instructions while he was under his hand.
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Niven</span> I also thank for all his labours in
behalf of my son.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Messrs. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Cumming</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chalmers</span>,
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sclater</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">R. Ross</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">J. Davidson</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Longdon</span>,
and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">R. Irvine</span>—I thank them all for their
labour in connection with the burial of my
son.</p>
<p class="p ">My beloved friends, what more can I say ?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
I conclude with respectful salutations.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Oh,
pray for me to the Lord, my friends, that
when I reach that day which has neither a
yesterday nor a to-morrow—a day which has
no end—I may receive strength to sustain me
in my unutterable weakness.—May you live
happy !</p>
