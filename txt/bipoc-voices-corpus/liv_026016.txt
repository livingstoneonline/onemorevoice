  ADULT SUNDAY-SCHOOLS AMONG THE NESTORIANS.
  [...]
  
    I thought I had better teach the old women, because they are very
      ignorant, and very little esteemed in this country. I desired from all my
      heart to take pains with them. Miss Fisk gave me "Line upon Line,"
      and I have taught them in this to the time of the Israelites' leaving
      Egypt. I also teach them more than this book contains; and there are
      women who can commence at the beginning of the Old Testament and
      recite as far as this perfectly.
    When I commenced this class there were only six or seven women;
      but now I have thirty-seven, sometimes forty; for those women who
      come see how good it is to learn, and, like the Samaritan woman, go and
      proclaim it to others, and from this the number continually increases.
      The Nestorian women, especially the aged women, have a habit, when
      two meet together, to engage earnestly in relating old wives' fables, in
      slandering, and idle conversation. These women were such; and whenever
      they came to church, whether on the way or during the preaching,
      we could find no way in which to stop their injurious, lying conversation.
      Awakening sermons and fearful words were to them as seeds cast by the
      wayside. Though they have heard preaching for fifteen years, still we
      find them very ignorant; and they themselves are becoming sensible of
      their ignorance. They often say to me, "If you had taught us in this
      way during these years that are passed, we should now have been well
      acquainted with the Scriptures."
    And, friends, it is true that we find this kind of teaching, these
      Sunday-schools, the best net we have spread for these women, as well
      as for others. What I teach on one Sabbath I require them to be
      ready to repeat on the next; and to do this they are obliged to almost
      entirely forsake their gossip. As soon as they come out of the church
      they lay hold of the readers on the way, and those in their houses, to ask
      them about what they have heard, that they may not forget it. If you
      were to see their diligence and great effort in this work, and the great
      change in their habits, you would wonder and rejoice. When we teach
      them about Adam and Eve, and their fall, or about the deliverance of
      Noah and the destruction of others, or about Abraham offering his son,
      or about the journey of father Jacob, or about Joseph in Egypt, and we
      ask them if they are like these persons&#8212;if they love God as they did&#8212;then
      the tears roll down their cheeks, and it is evident they are deeply
      affected.
    There is one woman in the class who was a Nestorian by birth, and
      became a Mussulman for as many as thirty years. She followed the
      religion of the false prophet, but she is now again with us, studying the
      Scriptures. When we commenced the class there were several young
      women in it; but I gave them spelling-books, and told them it was not
      proper for them to sit with the aged women: they were not too old to
      learn to read.
    Another class is taught by John. At its commencement there were
      only ten in it, and sometimes there were less; but now there are thirty or
      forty white-bearded men in this class. John takes a great deal of pains
      to teach them, and they have learned from the beginning of the Old
      Testament to the building of the tabernacle. He asks them questions,
      and they answered very well indeed. He was once asking them questions
      in regard to what he had previously taught them, when an old man
      cried out, "I know nothing; but this I know, that the Missionaries, and
      this kind of instruction, are right." Though that man is very ignorant,
      still he rejoices in this work.
    Before we had the school in the church we could not keep these men
      from going to the market on the Lord's-day, nor from idle conversation
      about this and that. They used to assemble in the streets, sit in
      the sun, and spend the Sabbath in idleness. About half the time they
      would appear in the preaching exercises, and then we lost sight of
      them. They would never spend an entire Sunday without bringing
      into it some worldly business. I blame them not, because they are not
      readers; and weak human nature grew weary under six sermons. But
      they are delighted with the school, and when we wish to close the
      exercises they are not willing. They do not wish to sit in the streets
      now on the Sabbath, but to sit in the church and learn; and when they
      see other men in the streets they bring them with them to school.
      If one of these men is absent for a Sabbath he is very sorry the next
      time, because his companions have gone before him; so all try to be
      present every week. There were at first some young men in this class who
      thought they could not learn to read, but we gave them books last Sabbath,
      and charged them to read.
    Now I will tell you about the women and girls who have learned to
      read in these two years. One girl, who has never been to school, has
      read her New Testament twice through, and has begun to read the Old
      Testament, translating from the ancient Syriac. There are sixteen
      women who have learned to read well in the New Testament. These
      women have never been to school, nor have they time to go, for they are
      labourers, and have a great deal of work. But they love to read; and
      when they go out in the summer to their vineyards or fields, to weed, they
      carry their books with them, and when they sit down to eat and rest a
      little, while their companions sleep, they read. Others, who have not oil
      to light their houses, read by moonlight. Others, when they are spinning,
      put their books on a little shelf, and spin and read. All these women love
      the Sabbath-school dearly, because it helps them in their reading.
    Of the men who have these years learned to read, one has finished his
      Testament, and fourteen others read well. It is a very difficult thing for
      them to read, for they have a great deal of work in winter and summer.
      They are very poor, and cannot leave their work to go to school. This
      they do that they may learn. When they go out to plough, or dig, or
      harvest, they put their books in their pockets, and at the time for rest,
      when their companions lie down, they read. Though they may be very
      tired when they come from their work at night, they always read, however
      late it may be. One of these men of whom I have spoken is so
      earnest to read, that when he gets up in the night, to take care of the
      cattle, he never sleeps afterwards, but reads till morning. When his
      family knew this, they waked him no more to work in the night, because
      he burned so much oil. There are some of these men who give a little
      child a cent, to give at the monthly meeting, for teaching them, and so
      they gather up knowledge. When they come to evening prayers they
      bring their books with them, and read till the people assemble. Besides
      these, we have men and women who read in the spelling-book. They
      read so well, that they are almost ready to go into the gospels. These,
      also, are very zealous in their work.
