<p class="p ">Two letters, addressed to an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> merchant, by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Selim Aga</span>, a native of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Darfur</span>, in <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span>, who is engaged in the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span> expedition</span>, have been forwarded for publication to the <span class="italic "><em>Carlisle Journal</em></span>. When the writer was ten years of age, he was purchased in <span class="country" title="A country.">Egypt</span> by the gentleman to whom the letters are addressed, and he subsequently received
an excellent <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> education. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Selim</span> is now upwards of 30 years of age, and is able to render important aid to the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span> expedition</span>. The following are extracts from the letters :—</p>
<p class="p "><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lagos</span>, <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">West Africa</span>, June 24, 1858.—I am now with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lieutenant Glover</span>, getting provisions and other necessaries for our expedition into the interior of
<span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>. We intend to proceed up the river in the <span class="italic "><em>Spero Meliora</em></span>, and to commence our land journey from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Rabbah</span> to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kanoo</span> in <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Hausa">Housa</u></span>, thence to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kirka</span> in <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Bornou</span>, and thence to <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Begharmi</span>, <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Wadai</span>, the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Mountains of the Moon</span>, to the source of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>, thence through <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Darfur</span>, <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Kordofan</span>, <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Senaar</span>, <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Nubia</span>, and <span class="country" title="A country.">Egypt</span>, to <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>. I think we may be about 18 months before reaching <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>. l am glad to hear that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Laird</span> intends to send many more steamboats to the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span>, and have not the least doubt that the outlay will be covered in about a couple of
years; and under the management of sensible men the trade of the country will increase
annually nearly a hundred fold, till every patch of useless ground is under cultivation.
To prove this, let us look at the cotton trade at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Abeokuta</span>. It has been established under the auspices of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Manchester</span> Chamber of Commerce</span>, and is immediately patronised by the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Church Missionary Society</span>, because that society is now anxious that it should encourage free labour produce,
and give up consuming <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">American</span> slave-grown cotton. A lay agent has been sent to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Abeokuta</span> with all the necessaries for cleaning and pressing cotton. The first twelve months
he managed to send about 300 bales, but the second year, which ended in last May,
realised something like 1,000, nearly an increase of 250 per cent.; and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Robin</span>, the agent, a native of the country, is now obliged to commence business at four
or five o'clock in the morning in order to get rid of his customers by six o'clock
in the evening. Encouraged by this fact, merchants are about to establish themselves
at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Abeokuta</span>, thus giving every encouragement to the natives of this populous town and surrounding
country. <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Rabbah</span>, although at present a complete ruin, will be one of the greatest commercial emporiums
on the banks of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span>; for, independent of its position as a marine port, it possesses great interest from
the fact of <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: it's">its</u> being the great medium of communication to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kuka</span>, <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kanoo</span>, and the lake <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Tchad</span>. The last caravan we met from those localities numbered about 2,000 travellers, with
upwards of 600 or 700 horses and donkeys. They bring ivory, guns, and hides from the
interior to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ilorin</span>, and receive in return <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span> goods and clothing, with which they return back to their own country. Therefore,
a clever merchant established at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Rabbah</span> would intercept all the trade of the interior, besides the goods which will be supplied
by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Tappah</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Nufeh</span> people</span>. There is, however, one great want at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Rabbah</span>, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, a judicial officer in the capacity of consul or magistrate. If such an authority
could be sent out from <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> (and he must be a white man), it would induce many emigrants from <span class="country" title="A country.">Sierra <span class="supplied" title="Text supplied because the original text is illegible, not visible, or missing.">[Leone]</span></span> to settle on the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span>, thus facilitating the labours of the missionary and the merchant; for, once perfectly
satisfied that the general laws of <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> are extending their benign influence into this part of <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>, every educated <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">African</span> who is a native of the river <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span> will venture, with his life and property, to settle on that river. With regard to
the trade of the country, I think there is every facility for a very extensive business
as far as the natives are concerned, but the question of sending the produce to the
mouth of the river or any other part for shipment is rather a difficult matter, for
the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span> is not always sufficiently full to allow for communication by means of steamboats.
A question therefore arises as to whether it would be more profitable for the merchant
to store up his goods for the space of six months (the dry season), or to start a
quadruped communication from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Rabbah</span> to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lagos</span>. The latter is practicable, only it would entail an immense expense at the onset.
The distance is about 400 miles, and I have now travelled the road three times, twice
with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person."><abbr>Lieut.</abbr> Glover</span> and once a part of the way by myself, in charge of government stores for the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Niger</span> camp. The stores consisted of 15 loads; a load weighs from 45 to 60 pounds on an
average, and is carried on the head of the bearer; each bearer is paid at the rate
of 1,000 cowries per day, or 1s. 3d. sterling , thus making in 15 days (the period
occupied in travelling with loads from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Rabbah</span> to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lagos</span>) the sum of 18s. 9d. per load. Now, will it pay to employ a bearer to bring a tusk
weighing 50lbs., and which costs from £5 to £6 at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Rabbah</span>, for shipment at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lagos</span>? I think it will. Besides this, a number of horses or donkeys might be stationed
in the different chief towns on the road, and thus reduce the period of transmit from
fifteen to eight or nine days. The price of a donkey in the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Hausa">Housa</u> country</span> would not be more than 15 shillings, and if a number of young men were redeemed from
slavery and put under the superintendence of a partially educated person at the different
stations, they could be employed partly in taking charge of the produce whilst on
its way to the next station, partly in cultivating a sufficient amount of ground for
the growth of yams, corn, and other necessaries for the support of themselves and
the beasts of burden under their charge. Land can be had for nothing, and negotiations
can be entered into with different kings and chiefs along the road for perfect freedom
to pass with the goods. They (the chiefs) are a great nuisance, for they stopped me
at one place (<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Obomishaw</span>) demanding 40 cowries for every one of the 15 loads under my charge. I protested
against this piece of insolence, threatening the chiefs, with the white man's guns,
and succeeded in getting away scot free. The next time I came through the same town
with six loads, the chiefs and their men retreated into the town, leaving the gate
entirely at my disposal. Not to abandon the subject of trade, however, it may be as
well to mention that the price of a slave in the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Yariba country</span> is from £7 to £11. The free natives will not work for us, and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kroo</span> boys</span> are too lazy, although to be had at a very low price, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, from 10s. to 17s. a month; but they scarcely pay for their keep, so that the choice
of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Hobson</span> is left to the man of enterprise—that is, to purchase slaves for domestic and other
purposes till a better remedy is found out.</p>
