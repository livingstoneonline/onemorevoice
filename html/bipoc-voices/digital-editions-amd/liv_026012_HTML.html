  <h5 style="text-align:center;">INDIAN SNAKE-CATCHER.</h5>
  <p>A British-Guiana Missionary writes&#8212;</p>
  <p>It has been my lot to witness, on more than one occasion, the effects of
    the bite of the labaria; and there is perhaps no person who has lived for
    years in the interior who has not been in imminent danger at times from
    the proximity of some of these creatures. I have, however, only heard
    of one instance in which a full-grown man has been seized by one of the
    boa species. This occurred in the swamps of the Akawini. The reptile,
    a large camudi, sprang upon him, and coiled round his body, confining
    one of his arms. Providentially, before it could master the other,
    his wife, who was near, handed him a knife, with which he inflicted a
    deep cut, causing the snake to quit him, and make its retreat. The
    Indians, also, once told me of a large camudi having been killed in a
    state of torpidity, which had just swallowed a boy of the Caribi nation.</p>
  <p>To any one who knows what destructive creatures abound in these
    forests, it is surprising that accidents of this kind do not more frequently
    occur. But the great characteristic of the Indian is caution, and his
    keen eye and acute hearing are constantly exercised by the nature of his
    situation. He displays a subtilty of artifice in capturing these reptiles
    equal to that which is usually assigned to the serpent himself. I have
    seen an Indian creep under a low bush on his hands and knees, and
    capture a kolokonaro by means of a noose, which he dropped over its
    head with a forked stick as it raised it to look at the intruder: the stick
    being then quickly placed on its neck, and the noose drawn tight, the
    reptile was hauled forth, and its capture completed. In this manner the
    Indians catch such snakes as they wish to preserve alive for sale. If the
    snake be not too large or venomous, the man grasps it tightly by the
    neck, and allows it to coil itself round his arm [see the engraving], until
    he is able to place it in secure confinement. The kolokonaro was only
    about five feet in length, but so thick and strong that the Indian who
    carried it was soon obliged to call for assistance, to remove the snake,
    and release his arm from its pressure. This species is beautifully marked
    with brown, orange, white, and other colours. It is sometimes called the
    <em>land</em>-camudi or boa, to distinguish it from the other camudi, which takes
    to the water, and is found in damp places. They both attain to a great size.</p>
  <p>Some of the larger snakes are said to attain to upwards of thirty feet
    in length. I never saw any near that size. The largest that I knew of
    was about twenty feet, and was captured by some of our Indians in a
    similar manner to that related above, while gorged with food. They
    then tied it to the stern of a canoe, and towed it through the water to
    the residence of a settler, to whom they disposed of it alive.</p>
  <p>The following remarkable circumstance is related of Daehne, the
    Moravian Missionary, who laboured amongst these Indians about
    a hundred years ago&#8212;</p>
  <p>The Indians have forsaken him, he was left alone in the Mission
    Settlement, and was often in no small danger from wild beasts and other
    venomous creatures. Thus a tiger for a long time kept watch near his
    hut, seeking an opportunity, no doubt, to seize the poor solitary inhabitant.
    Every night it roared most dreadfully; and though he regularly
    kindled a large fire in the neighbourhood before he went to bed, yet, as
    it often went out by the morning, it would have proved but a miserable
    defence, hand not the Lord preserved him. The following circumstance
    is still more remarkable, and illustrates, in a singular manner, the care of
    God over His servants. Being one evening attacked with a paroxysm of
    fever, he resolved to go into his hut and lie down in his hammock.
    Just, however, as he entered the door, he beheld a serpent descending
    him in three different places; and, pursuing him closely, twined itself
    several times round his head and neck as tightly as possible. Expecting
    now to be bitten, or strangled to death, and being afraid lest his brethren
    should suspect the Indians and murdered him, he, with singular presence
    of mind, wote with chalk on the table&#8212;"A serpent has killed me."
    Suddenly, however, that promise of the Saviour darted into his mind,
    "They shall take up serpents, and shall not be hurt." Encouraged by
    this declaration, he seized the creature with great force, tore it loose from
    his body, and flung it out of the hut. He then lay down in his hammock
    in tranquillity and peace. This was most probably a boa-constrictor,
    whose bite, though painful, is not venomous, and which destroys
    his prey by crushing it to death and gorging it whole.</p>
