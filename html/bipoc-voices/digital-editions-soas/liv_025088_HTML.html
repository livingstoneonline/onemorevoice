  <h4 style="text-align:center">"LETTER OF ANOTHER BASTARD HOTTENTOT.</h4>
  <h5 style="text-align:center">[Translated from the Dutch.] </h5>
  <p> "Dear Sirs,</p>
  <p> "Who have let the dear Mr. Kicherer come to us, I thank you a thousand times. He teaches us
    the whole day, and tells us of nothing else, than about the dear Lord Jesus and his blood. O!
    how happy is a man who knows the doctrine of Jesus in his heart, who has shed his blood for such
    great sinners; and how good is that Lord Jesus, who calls such great sinners, and will shew them
    such mercy, as that his blood will purify their unclean souls, if they will turn to him; O I am
    so ashamed and sorry, that I never have known that dear Lord Jesus before; and that I cannot
    stand before him, if his blood does not wash away my sins. I say, thanks to you again, dear
    Sirs! That you have sent such a dear man to us. I came to him about a year ago. He told us, that
    we were great sinners, and gave us the book of our dear Lord Jesus, which he would teach us. I
    would scarce believe it. But now I feel, that my sins are more than the hairs of my head. O!
    they are too great. Yea, they are more in number than all the grains of sand; but our dear
    teacher tells us, that, if we seek the Lord Jesus, we shall find, that his blood is so powerful
    in our hearts, as to prevail over the inclination to sin; and that, I feel, is the truth, for I
    find it nowhere else better, than with him. I cannot be longer without that dear Lord Jesus;
    therefore, I run all the day to beg of him to teach me, not only in my head, but in my heart. It
    is so lovely when he teaches me, how poor I was, and how rich the blood of Jesus makes, me poor
    sinner that I am! I leave not off begging the dear Lord Jesus, who becomes daily more the master
    of my heart, that those ugly, sins may not vex me so much, and take me from the dear Lord Jesus;
    and, if he does not,! apply the more earnestly to him. He must help me; I love him too much, now
    to commit sins. O! could I throw all my sins away at once, how happy should I be! but this I
    cannot, unless the Lord Jesus shall be pleased to change me. I shall not, however, leave him,
    until he does it. I never thought, that a man who loves the Lord Jesus, would at the same time
    love the children of the Lord Jesus; but now I also feel different love to them, than what I had
    for my father and mother. Wherever our dear teacher goes, I shall go with him. At whatever place
    he comes, he teaches the people and tells them, " If men, like you, do not seek for Jesus, it
    never will be good with you; but if you seek him; you will be happy in the blood of the Lord
    Jesus, and feel, how he works in your heart, and know that it is the Lord Jesus." He is afraid
    of nothing. Here are wicked Boschemen,they say, our teacher is a Devil to them, because of the
    things he will learn them, therefore they will shoot him with the arrow. Some Hottentots told
    us, that they are who are at present in the mountains, will come at a time that my good teacher
    gives us instruction, that they will plunder the house and steal the sheep. I was afraid they
    should come, but my good teacher slept without a door, there being no wood to make one. He tells
    me not to be afraid, for that the Lord Jesus will preserve us. Now, dear Sirs, I wish you a
    thousand times farewell.</p>
  <p> (Signed) KAROLUS. Bastard Hottentot."</p>
  <p>"P.S.</p>
  <p>"P.S.&#8212;I let you know, that I am interpreter of the Boschemen, the language of which I
    understand better than the Hottentot.</p>
  <p> "I forgot to say, that I, who am interpreter of the people, tell them how they can be helped.
    O! how afraid I am, lest I should not be helped myself."</p>
