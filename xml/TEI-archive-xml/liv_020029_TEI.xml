<lb/><space extent="2" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>My Friend,
<lb/><space extent="3" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I wish to tell you of our affairs
<lb/>in this country, since the <term type="collective">Boers</term> have set it on
<lb/>fire, having received it from the <term type="collective">English.</term></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I have despaired of this land since the
<lb/>three missionaries, <persName>Edwards</persName>, <persName>Inglis</persName> and <persName>Livingstone</persName>
<lb/>failed to receive justice. I had thought to have asked
<lb/>the chiefs of the people who made war upon us at that
<lb/>time, what these things meant; but I was without
<lb/>an interpreter who could commend me to them, and I
<lb/>was grieved; for I saw that there was no one to give me
<lb/>an answer, and that therefore it was intended that
<lb/>my country should be destroyed. I asked my teachers
<lb/>how it was that I was disregarded, and they said,
<lb/>It is because the rulers of the land on the other side
<lb/>of the River have agreed with the <term type="collective">Boers</term> to give them this
    
	<pb facs="liv_020029_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/>country. It is this which has caused the teachers
<lb/>to forsake this country, because the Rulers have made
<lb/>a covenant with the <term type="collective">Boers</term> to give them this land.
<lb/>And now the affliction of this country continues
<lb/>after this manner. <space extent="1" unit="words"/>The <term type="collective">Boers</term>, though the
<lb/>colored people be not to blame, wish to take them
<lb/>captive like cattle or game. I ask you this, the
<lb/>Rulers of the Teachers, why have you done this, because
<lb/>it is not only the work of the Teachers, but of those who
<lb/>have sent them. <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>It were well if there could be a
<lb/>judge who is to blame and who is innocent in
<lb/>this matter.</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>How will it be with you, rulers of the teachers,
<lb/>that you disregard the shedding of innocent blood, and
<lb/>the destruction of men's souls? How <del>it</del> will it be
<lb/>with you before God?</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The souls of our people are wept for by
<lb/>the teachers, but they cannot do anything to save
<lb/>them, because the heads of your people neglect
<lb/>this land. Therefore I ask the heads of the
            
	<pb facs="liv_020029_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/><term type="collective">English</term>, Is this work good? <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The teachers say,
<lb/>we cannot teach you in this land because our
<lb/>rulers have given you over into the power of
<lb/>the <term type="collective">Boers</term>, and the <term type="collective">Boers</term> will drive us away as
<lb/>they have driven away the others. I speak
<lb/>for my people as I am known of them as
<lb/>one seeking the Kingdom of Christ, and this
<lb/>is my letter to you. <space extent="1" unit="words"/>We see that we are
<lb/>lost, because the teachers pass by us to go to the
<lb/>people of <persName>Sebituane</persName> and the people of
<lb/><persName>Mosilikatse</persName>.</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="1" unit="words"/>Again a teacher called <persName>Mackenzie</persName>
<lb/>has commanded that certain people in my
<lb/>land shall be taught by the teachers from the
<lb/><term type="collective">Boers</term>, and for this I am grieved, because this is the
<lb/>land in which my blood has been shed by the <term type="collective">Boers</term>.</p>
<lb/><p>My soul is grieved that the <term type="collective">German</term> missionaries
<lb/>who come from the <term type="collective">Boers</term> should be the teachers
<lb/>of my people; why men do you <term type="collective">English</term> refuse to
<lb/>give me teachers? As to them (the <term type="collective">Germans</term>) some

	<pb facs="liv_020029_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>died at my place, the rest I told to depart;
<lb/>for I said, I shall ask the <term type="collective">English</term> for missionaries
<lb/>because you do not teach. <space extent="1" unit="words"/>Let it not be so
<lb/>Sirs, but let our land, even <persName>Gassitsioe</persName>'s, <persName>Montsioe</persName>'s,
<lb/><persName>Mosielele</persName>'s, <persName>Mangope</persName>'s and <persName>Mokhosi</persName>'s and
<lb/>my<del>self</del> <add place="above">own</add> be taught by <term type="collective">English</term> teachers. Let us be
<lb/>preached to like <persName>Sekhomi</persName>, <persName>Mosilikatse</persName> and the other
<lb/>nations who are preached to by the <term type="collective">English</term>. And let
<lb/>my prayer and my sorrowing with which I have besought
<lb/>you for missionaries reach onto God.</p>
<lb/><p>And I have written to my teacher who is known as a
<lb/>teacher by all my people, by the hand of his son who has
<lb/>come from the <term type="collective"><choice><orig>Matabele</orig><reg>Ndebele</reg></choice></term>, that he should <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">send</add> these words for me
<lb/>to the <settlement>Cape</settlement> since that is the gate to the rulers of the <term type="collective">English</term>, to
<lb/>say that one of the chiefs of these people laments and prays for
<lb/>his tribe according to these words. May God hear me and turn your
<lb/>hearts! that you may send me teachers who may come to teach me
<lb/>Let our land be taught by the <term type="collective">English</term>, but let the land of the <term type="collective">Boers</term>
<lb/>be taught by the <term type="collective">Germans</term>. I wish the Rulers would <seg rend="brown black"><add place="below">^</add></seg> <add place="above">attend</add> to this land, for
<lb/>this is why I cannot obtain teachers. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>My lamentations I
<lb/>conclude with my salutations, and may God hear me!
