  <p>The Rev. D. Williams, Native Pastor at Abeokuta, writes:—</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%"><em>April</em> 7<em>th</em>, 1874.—I visited a
    convert of mine, an old woman and a
    steady communicant, on a dangerous sick-bed, from which she never
    afterwards rose up. She also possessed not the least fear of death, which she
    frankly confessed to me during my conversation with her in these few
    following words:—"I have no fear of death at all. I depend on Christ,
    who sacrificed Himself for me. I am ready to go with Him." On being
    asked whether she was a sinner, she replied in the affirmative. Then I
    directed her to enter into the Ark, that is, Christ, and she will be safe.
    I prayed for her, and left her to God.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%"><em>April</em> 11<em>th</em>.—Visited Sarah Coker
    again. I began my subject of conversation
    with the following question:—"I hope you do not entertain
    any doubt in your faith in Christ, and your hope of heaven." She replied,
    "Doubt! never. One who doubts cannot go straight to God. Since I
    left Sierra Leone I have never once worshipped idols, but I only hope for
    forgiveness." In my reply I assured her that Jesus is ready to forgive
    any penitent sinner. I prayed with her.</p>
