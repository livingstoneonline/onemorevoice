<p class="p "><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"No doubt you will hear from several interested in <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr.
Livingstone</span>; but, as I do not feel sure that any one has thoroughly
examined the men who came down with his remains, I briefly
summarize what I have been able to glean from a careful <span class="word">cross-examination</span>
of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majwara</span>, who was always at his side during his
last days, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Susi</span>, as well as the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nassik</span> boys</span>, have, generally,
confirmed what he says. I enclose a small sketch map, merely
giving my idea of the locality, and have added a dotted line to
show his route during this last journey of his life.
</p>
<p class="p ">"The party sent by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Stanley</span> left <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Unyanyembe</span> with the Doctor
about the end of August, 1872, and marched straight to the south
of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lake Tanganyika</span>, through <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Ufipa</span>, crossing the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Rungwa River</span>,
where they met with natural springs of boiling water, bubbling up
high above the ground. On reaching the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Chambezi</span>, or <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kambezi
River</span>, they crossed it about a week's journey from <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lake Bemba</span>,
also crossing a large feeder; but, by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Susi</span>'s advice, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Livingstone</span>
again turned northward, and recrossed the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kambezi</span>, or <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Luapula</span>, as
he then called it, just before it entered the lake.
</p>
<p class="p ">"He could not, however, keep close to the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">north shore of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lake
Bemba</span></span>, owing to the numerous creeks and streams, which were
hidden in forests of high grass and rushes. After making a détour,
he again struck the lake at a village, where he got canoes across to
an island in the centre, called <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Matipa</span>. Here the shores on either
hand were not visible, and the Doctor was put to great straits by
the natives declining to let him use their canoes to cross to the
opposite shore. He therefore seized seven canoes by force, and
when the natives made a show of resistance, he fired his pistol
over their heads, after which they ceased to obstruct him. Crossing
the lake diagonally, he arrived in a long valley, and the rains
having now set in fully, the caravan had to wade, rather than <br>
<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg left "><span class="smallcaps ">April</span> 13, 1874.]</span> <span class="seg center caps ">And Death of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Livingstone</span></span> <span class="seg right ">245</span></span>
<br>walk, constantly crossing blind streams, and, in fact, owing to the
high rushes and grass, hardly being able to distinguish at times the
land, or rather what was generally dry land, from the lake.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Livingstone</span> had been weak and ailing since leaving <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Unyanyembe</span>,
and when passing through the country of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Ukabende</span>, at
the south-west of the lake, he told <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majwara</span> (the boy given him by
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Stanley</span>, who is now in my service) that he felt unable to go on
with his work, but should try and cross the hills to <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Katanga</span>
[<span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Katanda</span>?], and there rest, endeavouring to buy ivory, which in all
this country is very cheap (three yards of merikani buying a slave or
a tusk), and returning to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ujiji</span> through <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Manyuema</span> to recruit and
reorganise.
</p>
<p class="p ">"But as he approached the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">northern part of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Bisa</span></span> (a very large
country), arriving in the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Province of Ulala</span>, he first had to take to
riding a donkey, and then suffer himself to be carried on a kitanda
(native bedstead), which at first went much against the grain.
</p>
<p class="p ">"During this time he never allowed the boy <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majwara</span> to leave
him, and he then told that faithful and honest fellow that he should
never cross the high hills to <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Katanda</span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">"He called for <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Susi</span>, and asked how far it was to the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Luapula</span>,
and, on his answering 'three days,' remarked, 'he should never see
<span class="italic "><em>his</em></span> river again.'
</p>
<p class="p ">"On arriving at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ilala</span>, the capital of the district, where <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Kitambo</span>
the sultan lived, the party were refused permission to stay, and
they carried <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Livingstone</span> three hours' march back towards <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Kabende</span>.
Here they erected for him a rude hut and fence, and he would not
allow any to approach him for the remaining days of his life except
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majwara</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Susi</span>, except that every morning they were all desired
to come to the door and say 'good morning.'
</p>
<p class="p ">"During these few days he was in great pain, and could keep
nothing, even for a moment, on his stomach. He lost his sight so
far as hardly to be able to distinguish when a light was kindled,
and gradually sank during the night of the 4th May, 1873.
</p>
<p class="p ">"Only <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majwara</span> was present when he died, and he is unable to
say when he ceased to breathe.
</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Susi</span>, hearing that he was dead, told <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jacob Wainwright</span> to make
a note in the Doctor's diary of the things found by him. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Wainwright</span>
was not quite certain as to the day of the month, and as
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Susi</span> told him the Doctor had last written the day before, and he
found this entry to be dated 27th April, he wrote 28th April, but
on comparing his own diary on arrival at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Unyanyembe</span> he found it
to be the 4th of May; and this is confirmed by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Majwara</span>, who says
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Livingstone</span> was unable to write for the last four or five days of his <br>

27º<span class="smallcaps ">E</span>; but, of course, the whole of this is subject to correction, and,
although I have spent many hours in finding it all out, the Doctor's
diary may show it to be very imperfect.
</p>
<p class="p ">"I fear you will find this a very unconnected narration, but my
apology must be that the Consul-General is not well, and the other
Assistant absent on duty, and there is much work for me to do. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
Arthur Laing</span> has been entrusted with the charge of the remains
