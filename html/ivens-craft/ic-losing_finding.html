						<p>Never quiescent, the Craft family continued to fight for the lives and livelihoods of Black southerners. William Ivens Craft may or may not have joined his family, as we find only traces of his life throughout the turbulent years he spent in the former slave states. By the start of the 1880s, William Ivens decided to set out on his own, as his parents and siblings faced a new set of challenges in the world of Reconstruction-era politics.</p>

						<p>By 1875, although it had put the family into debt, Woodville seemed to be blossoming. The Crafts built a large schoolhouse attended by upwards of 75 students. At least sixteen families lived on the property, farming cotton, rice, and corn (Craft 1875). Ellen and Brougham taught in the school, seldom receiving compensation. Brougham had earned certificates for teaching from school committees in Georgia and Florida. Though some of the scholars had promised to pay, recalled Brougham, he “never got anything from them, except four red birds” (Anonymous 1878d).</p>

						<p>The Craft family also became involved in Reconstruction politics, joining the Republican Party in Georgia. William Craft, in 1873, applied for the office of Minister to Liberia, “with good prospects” the <em>Augusta Chronicle</em> reported (Anonymous 1873). The next year, he ran for state Senate in Georgia as a Republican (Anonymous 1874a). Both campaigns proved unsuccessful. However, in 1876, William represented Bryan County at the Georgia Republican State Convention. There, he was elected as an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention (Blackett 1986, 129; Anonymous 1876a). Politics was a family affair. In Savannah, William Ivens’ older brother, Charles, was president of the Union Coterie club (Craft 1876).</p>

						<p>A lack of paper trail makes it difficult to determine whether William Ivens ever joined his family at their home in Georgia. However, one piece of evidence hints that he spent some time in Savannah in 1876. In a letter written later in his life, William Ivens mentions that he was “suffering from my old complaint, rheumatism, superinduced by an attack of Yellow Fever I contracted in 1876 in America” (Craft 1882d). It is likely that William Ivens caught the disease when it erupted viciously in Savannah in August of 1876, killing upwards of one thousand people, infecting thousands more, and forcing even more to flee the city (Georgia Historical Society n.d.).</p>

						<h3 id="railroad">The Craft Brothers as Route Agents</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>By 1877, William Ivens had made his way to Florida, where he was reunited with his brother, Charles. The Post Office Rail Services employed William Ivens and Charles in 1877, 1878, and 1879, and they worked as Route Agents between Savannah, Georgia, and Live Oak, Florida, and then later between Savannah and Jacksonville. The brothers made a salary between $900 and $1,000 each year (US Department of the Interior 1877, 422; 1879, 33).</p>

						<p>Working for the Post Office railways required both skill and nerve. William Ivens and his brother were expected to sort mail on the moving trains and found themselves at risk of train robberies as well as dangerous accidents.</p>

						<p>Working the line from Georgia to Florida, the brothers spent time in the sunshine state. In 1880, they appeared in the US census living in Jacksonville. They boarded with a man named Thomas Baxter. Baxter, whom the US census noted was a mixed-race man, was born in North Carolina around 1850. He worked as a merchant and ran a boarding house at 167 Bay Street. Staying with Baxter and the Craft brothers were three Cuban-born men, and a mixed-race woman named Susan Cranshaw (“1880 US Federal Census” 1880).</p>

						<p>The Craft brothers rubbed shoulders with a uniquely American experience in their boarding house in Jacksonville. They lived with Thomas Baxter, who helped organize the Athletic Base Ball Club in Jacksonville, a team that participated in the segregated Negro League. Baxter, along with a man named M. J. Christopher, started the club in the 1870s and by 1886 it had joined the League of Southern Colored Base Ballists (Brunson 2019, 50).</p>

						<p>Although William Ivens became chummy with baseballers and seems to have had a stable income, he nonetheless decided to return to his home – London. What immediately prompted William Ivens to leave both America and his family to return to England remains one of the biggest questions of this story.</p>

						<p>It is not difficult to imagine, however, that William Ivens Craft was deeply jarred by the racism and difficulties his politically and economically prominent family faced. The Crafts were not merely trying to get by in the war-torn South. Rather, they aimed to uplift those around them and dared to dream a future of freedom, autonomy, and education for Black Americans – while white supremacists violently attempted to reclaim the American South. As William Ivens later expressed in a letter, “there is still an undercurrent of feeling pervading throughout the U.S. against a ‘man of colour’” (Craft 1881c).</p>

						<p>Despite – or perhaps because of – the Craft family’s political visibility and hard work among rural African American communities in Georgia, the Crafts became targets of scrutiny. In 1876, a Boston newspaper alleged that instead of investing the funds he had raised into the school, William Craft lived “on the money he collects… applying it to his own use.” The article asked “Where is his school? Who attends it?” and elicited a response from the Crafts. “Come now, Crafts, and tell us all about it” (Anonymous 1876c). William responded by bringing a libel suit against the Boston firm Naylor and Co., which proved unsuccessful.</p>

						<p>During the trial, scholar Barbara McCaskill (2015, 84) points out, “the Crafts’ former sponsors… helped derail William and Ellen’s southern scheme and muddy William’s character.” They smeared William Ivens’ character as well. It was during these trials – which drew much public attention – that Wendell Phillips recounted his alleged run-in with William Ivens in D.C. William Ivens did not appear as a witness and was thus unable to defend himself from such slander. Forced to pay court costs and half of the referees’ charges, which amounted to $1,000 in 1878 (some $30,000 in 2023), the expense of the lawsuit forced the Crafts to close Woodville school around 1880 (Anonymous 1878h; Fradin and Fradin 2006, 92).</p>
