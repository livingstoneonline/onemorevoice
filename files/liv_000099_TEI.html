In 1857, he was deposed by Macheng but was restored the following year. Sekgoma was removed in favour of his brother again in 1866, briefly resuming rule in 1872 before his son Khama III secured the leadership three years later.

They established themselves in the Zambezi Floodplain in the seventeenth century where they developed an expansionist state. The Lozi were conquered by the Makololo in the 1830s, but re-established their independence through an uprising in 1864. The Lozi traditionally called themselves the Luyi or Luyana, which accounts for Livingstone's alternative names: Baloiana and little Baloi (Nave 2010b:87).">Barotse</span>

Also called Leeba/Loiba and Leeambye/Liambai by Livingstone at parts of its course. Major river in south-central Africa that rises in present-day Zambia, then flows east across the continent to the Indian Ocean. During his transcontinental expedition (1852-56), Livingstone was hopeful that the Zambezi could provide a highway into central Africa, but during his later Zambezi Expedition (1858-64) he realised that he had overestimated the river's navigability. Livingstone provides various other local names for stretches of the river including Luambéji, Luambési, Ambézi, Ojimbési, Luabo, and Cuama.">Zambezi</span>] </span> is flooded

During his transcontinental expedition (1852-56), Livingstone was hopeful that the Zambezi could provide a highway into central Africa, but during his later Zambezi Expedition (1858-64) he realised that he had overestimated the river's navigability. Livingstone provides various other local names for stretches of the river including Luambéji, Luambési, Ambézi, Ojimbési, Luabo, and Cuama.">Leeambye</span><span class="metamark   " title="Editorial symbol used to transpose a portion of text from one place to another">⎱</span> and
