<h4 style="text-align:center">"LETTER OF ANOTHER BASTARD HOTTENTOT.</h4>
<h5 style="text-align:center">[Translated from the Dutch.] </h5>
<p>		"Dear Sirs, </p>
<p>	"Who have let the dear Mr. Kicherer come to us, I thank you a thousand times. He teaches us the whole day, and tells us of nothing else, than about the dear Lord Jesus and his blood. O! how happy is a man who knows the doctrine of Jesus in his heart, who has shed his blood for such great sinners; and how good is that Lord Jesus, who calls such great sinners, and will shew them such mercy, as that his blood will purify their unclean souls, if they will turn to him; O I am so ashamed and sorry, that I never have known that dear Lord Jesus before; and that I cannot stand before him, if his blood does not wash away my sins. I say, thanks to you again, dear Sirs! That you have sent such a dear man to us. I came to him about a year ago. He told us, that we were great sinners, and gave us the book of our dear Lord Jesus, which he would teach us. I would scarce believe it. But now I feel, that my sins are more than the hairs of my head. O! they are too great. Yea, they are more in number than all the grains of sand; but our dear teacher tells us, that, if we seek the Lord Jesus, we shall find, that his blood is so powerful in our hearts, as to prevail over the inclination to sin; and that, I feel, is the truth, for I find it nowhere else better, than with him. I cannot be longer without that dear Lord Jesus; therefore, I run all the day to beg of him to teach me, not only in my head, but in my heart. It is so lovely when he teaches me, how poor I was, and how rich the blood of Jesus makes, me poor sinner that I am! I leave not off begging the dear Lord Jesus, who becomes daily more the master of my heart, that those ugly, sins may not vex me so much, and take me from the dear Lord Jesus; and, if he does not,! apply the more earnestly to him. He must help me; I love him too much, now to commit sins. O! could I throw all my sins away at once, how happy should I be! but this I cannot, unless the Lord Jesus shall be pleased to change me. I shall not, however, leave him, until he does it. I never thought, that a man who loves the Lord Jesus, would at the same time love the children of the Lord Jesus; but now I also feel different love to them, than what I had for my father and mother. Wherever our dear teacher goes, I shall go with him. At whatever place he comes, he teaches the people and tells them, " If men, like you, do not seek for Jesus, it never will be good with you; but if you seek him; you will be happy in the blood of the Lord Jesus, and feel, how he works in your heart, and know that it is the Lord Jesus." He is afraid of nothing. Here are wicked Boschemen,they say, our teacher is a Devil to them, because of the things he will learn them, therefore they will shoot him with the arrow. Some Hottentots told us, that they are who are at present in the mountains, will come at a time that my good teacher gives us instruction, that they will plunder the house and steal the sheep. I was afraid they should come, but my good teacher slept without a door, there being no wood to make one. He tells me not to be afraid, for that the Lord Jesus will preserve us. Now, dear Sirs, I wish you a thousand times farewell. </p>
<p>	(Signed) KAROLUS. Bastard Hottentot." </p>
<p>"P.S. </p>
<p>"P.S.ï¿½I let you know, that I am interpreter of the Boschemen, the language of which I understand better than the Hottentot. </p>
<p>	"I forgot to say, that I, who am interpreter of the people, tell them how they can be helped. O! how afraid I am, lest I should not be helped myself."</p></div>
