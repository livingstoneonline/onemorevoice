A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS,
PR O L O G U E.
MR FRANCIS CAREY has been long a familiar
name to the world—to some people as the most
patriotic of millionaires, to others as the richest
of patriots. Exiled in early youth to the Colonies
for his health's sake, he made a profession of a
necessity, and secured in a short space of time
bodily well-being and an immense fortune. Few
could trace in the square muscular figure of forty-
five the pallid and consumptive boy of twenty.
By a singular turn of fate he had stood by the
cradle of great industries. He was the pioneer
of the richest gold-mining area in the world, and
scarcely less famous were his shipping lines, his
railways, his newspapers, his teak-forests, and his
vast tobacco-farms. Money made by enterprise
was invested with wisdom, and his fortune was

already almost out of bounds when it was doubled
by the success of a copper venture which bade fair
to rival Montana. And yet in the prime of life,
in spite of the wiles of many women, he remained
a bachelor. Some attributed the fact to an early
and melancholy love affair; others, with better
judgment, ascribed it to his preoccupation with
the fortunes of his country. In Bacon's phrase
he had "espoused the State," and found in her a
mistress fairer and more exacting than any mortal
Amaryllis.
In London he had modest chambers on a second
floor in Half-Moon Street, but no man owned
more lordly country-houses. The feudal manors
of impoverished English squires, the castles of
impecunious Highland chiefs held for him no
charms. It was his business, he said, to show
the world a more excellent way. At the head
of a long glen in the Selkirks, where snow-peaks
rose out of pine-forests, he built himself a hunting-
box. In a scented Kashmir valley, among
thickets of rhododendron, he had another, where
lamas and Turcoman merchants, passing on their
way from Leh to Srinagur, brought all the news
of Central Asia. A bungalow in a Pacific isle, a
fishing-lodge in New Zealand, and a superb farm
of the old Dutch style in the Blaauwberg, were
other of his dwellings. But his true home, if a

nomad can be said to have one, was his house of
Musuru, on the scarp of the Mau plateau, looking
over the great trough of Equatoria. Here, in the
midst of a park of many thousand acres, he lived
as Prester John may have lived in his Abyssinian
palace. He might lounge through the world of
fashion in an old tweed coat, but his heart was
on the side of magnificence. He sought for
romance in life, and found it by the device of
importing the fine flower of civilisation into the
stronghold of savagery. It pleased him to shuffle
unregarded in a London crowd, knowing that
over seas half a continent waited upon his will.
His amazing energy annihilated space, and he
found time in a crowded life to live in his many
houses more regularly than the modest citizen
who owns a mansion in Bayswater and a villa
at Cannes.
To the world Carey remained a mystery.
Every halfpenny paper placarded his achieve-
ments, his arrivals and departures were chronicled
like those of Royalty, his speeches in the City and
his rare appearances on public platforms drew
crowds which were denied to eminent statesmen.
But the man himself was obscure. He was rarely
seen in society, and country-houses knew him not.
Nevertheless he contrived in some way to obtain
the friendship of most men and women who were

worth knowing. His influence was so well recog-
nised, and yet so inexplicable, that many good
people were heard to call it sinister. And yet
few had any complaint to make of his doings.
He spent his great income generously and
prudently on public needs. A vast scheme of
education, inaugurated by him, tied the schools
of the Colonies to the older institutions of
England. One ancient university owed the
renewal of her fortunes to his gifts. In the
slums his dwellings for workmen had made his
name a household word, and at his own cost he
yearly relieved the congestion of great cities by
planting settlements in new lands. His activity,
indeed, was so boundless that, had he figured
more in the public eye, enemies would have
sprung up out of sheer dulness of understanding.
Knowing this, he kept wisely to his humble re-
tirement, that his usefulness might be marred by
no private grudges. He was accepted as a kind
of national providence, scarcely more to be criti-
cised than the Monarchy. If some called his
faith Imperialism, others pointed out how little
resemblance it bore to the article cried in the
market-place. It was a creed beyond parties,
a consuming and passionate interest in the
destiny of his people.
On one point alone he found critics. It was

his habit to take every year a party of his friends
to some one or other of his remote homes. Now
it would be a band of sportsmen whom he would
carry off to the Selkirks or Kashmir for some
weeks of unforgettable hunting. Now he would
take a group of his less active acquaintances to
his house at the Cape, where in the midst of vine-
yards and heathy mountains they could find
good talk and a complete seclusion from the
world. Once in a while he would have a gather-
ing at his East African dwelling, and these were
the choicest of his entertainments. The guests
who were fortunate enough to share his hospit-
ality came to form a set by themselves, bound
together by the tie of delectable memories.
Their enemies christened them "Careyites," and
said hard things about the power of the purse;
but the coterie was too large, too distinguished,
and too representative to be sneered at with
impunity. The Radical journalist found nothing
to cavil at in the man who, so far as he saw,
lived simply and wrought effectively for the poor.
The Tory member could not speak ill of one who
was so noted a sportsman and so generous a host.
The plain man could only admire a figure of such
vitality, who was original even in his pleasures.
It will be remembered that some little while
ago the creed which is commonly called Imperial-

ism was tossed down into the arena of politics
to be wrangled over by parties and grossly
mauled in the quarrel. With the fall of the
Government which had sanctioned such tactics
there came one of those waves of reaction which
now and then break in upon our national stead-
fastness. The name of "Empire" stank in the
nostrils of the electorate. Those who used it
fell like ninepins; in the huge majority which
the new Ministry acquired there were many
who openly blasphemed it; and the few who
still cherished the faith thought it wise to don
temporarily the garb of indifference. Carey
viewed the change with philosophic calm. He
trusted the instincts of his race, and was not
sorry that the dross should be purged and the
spirit purified by misfortune. It occurred to
him, however, that a little quiet conversation
among some friends of his own way of thinking
might be useful by way of clarifying their minds.
It is well after defeat to make a short sojourn
in the wilderness. That year, accordingly, he
selected his party with especial care, and fixed
Musuru as the place of entertainment. The
months of August, September, and October were
chosen as the best time, partly because it was
the cool season in East Africa, partly because
it was the Bar and Parliamentary vacation—

though, indeed, as he reflected, none of his
guests had for the present much to do with
Parliament. His old friend the Duchess of
Maxton, and Mr Hugh Somerville, a young
man of thirty, who, after some years of foreign
travel, was now endeavouring to make a fortune,
were called in to assist in his selection. One
rule only he laid down as inviolable—"I will
have no husbands and wives, remember, Susan.
If a man is married he must come without his
wife, and the same for the women. We must
all be unattached, for domesticity, as I have
often told you, is the foe of friendship."
With this guidance, and after long consider-
ation, a list was prepared. Lord Appin, the
Duchess's brother, was the first to be selected.
Once the leader of the Conservatives, he had
found the trammels of politics too hard to
be borne, and had given up to mankind what
the virtuous declared was due to his party. In
German metaphysics, French furniture, and the
Turf he found his nominal interests; but his
friends, of whom Carey was the most intimate,
were well aware that beneath his insouciance
he cherished political dreams which, though
unacceptable to the hustings, were none the less
broad-based on prescience and understanding.
Lord Launceston, Hugh's former chief, came

next ; and Mr Eric Lowenstein, a Jewish
financier, who had been Carey's partner in
many schemes. Mr Ebenezer Wakefield, that
eminent Colonial publicist, was added by Carey;
and Hugh stipulated for Lewis Astbury, a young
journalist who had won fame first as a war
correspondent and then as a military critic.
With Sir Edward Considine, the traveller, and
Colonel Alastair Graham, of the Intelligence
Department, the masculine side of the party
was complete. The women were more difficult,
and the Duchess spent many anxious hours. It
was easy enough, she said, to get men without
their wives, but it looked so odd for women to
go travelling without their husbands; and
Hugh's suggestion of a party of girls was
refused on the ground of the appalling duties
of chaperonage. In the end Lady Lucy
Gardner, the wife of a Colonial governor, and
Mrs Wilbraham and Lady Warcliff, whose
respective husbands were on duty in Africa
and India, were selected as the nucleus. Hugh
begged for Mrs Yorke, the American wife
of an English statesman, the Duchess insisted
on Mrs Deloraine, and Carey added Lady
Amysfort, the Egeria of her party, who, like
her votaries, was out of power since the elec-
tions. "I will bring two charming girls," the

Duchess said, "Marjory - Haystoun and my
niece Flora—it will do them all the good in
the world. And Marjory is as serious as you,
Francis, and nearly as clever. There ! I think
our list is complete. We have the sexes in
equal numbers, which is more than you will find
in any English country-house."
These details being settled, it only remained
to arrange for the voyage. Following a rule
of his own invention, Carey always decreed
that his guests should come within the pale
of his hospitality at Southampton or Marseilles,
or wherever the real journey could be said to
begin. Their route was as rigidly mapped out
as a Cook's Tour, for he felt that it was desir-
able to avoid that premature boredom which
may fall on ill-assorted fellow - travellers. It
was arranged that the Duchess should travel
with one of the girls and Lord Launceston.
The other girl should go with Lord Appin,
Lady Lucy, and Mr Astbury. Lady Amysfort
and Mrs Wilbraham should accompany Mr
Lowenstein, while Hugh was given the escort
of Mrs Yorke and Lady Warcliff. Considine
and Graham, it appeared, were at that moment
hunting near Lake Rudolf, and would be sum-
moned by messenger so as to arrive with the
rest of the party. The various detachments

should start at different times, one lingering
for a few days at Cairo, another at Mombasa,
but all should meet at Musuru in time for
dinner on the Twelfth of August.
"Last Twelfth," said the Duchess medita-
tively, "I was entertaining for Bob at Glenum-
quhill. Fourteen men and not a woman besides
myself. And this year I am to try to keep the
peace among seventeen maniacs, eight of them
female, on a mountain in the Tropics. After
this who shall say that I have not the courage
to make any sacrifice for the cause !"

CHAPTER I.
THE present writer is ill-equipped for the task
of describing great houses, but Musuru demands
that he should dedicate his slender talents to
the attempt. From a wayside station on the
railway between Mombasa and Port Florence a
well-made highway runs north along the edge
of the plateau through forests of giant cypress
and juniper. To the east lies the great Rift
valley, with the silver of its lakes gleaming
eerily through the mountain haze. After a
dozen miles the woodland ceases and the road
emerges on a land of far-stretching downs,
broken up into shallow glens where streams of
clear water ripple through coverts of bracken
and lilies. Native villages with bee-hive huts
appear, and the smoke from their wood fires
scents the thin upland air. Now the road
turns west, and the indefinable something
creeps into the atmosphere which tells the
traveller that he is approaching the rim of the

world. Suddenly he comes upon a gate, with
a thatched lodge, which might be in Scotland.
Entering, he finds himself in a park dotted
with shapely copses and full of the same end-
less singing streams. Orchards, vineyards, olive-
groves, and tobacco-fields appear, and then the
drive sweeps into a garden, with a lake in the
centre and a blaze of flower - beds. The air
blows free to westward, and he knows that he
is almost on the edge, when another turn re-
veals the house against the sky-line. It is
long and low, something in the Cape Dutch
style, with wide verandahs and cool stone
pillars. The sun-shutters and the beams are of
cedar, the roof is of warm red tiles, and the
walls are washed with a delicate pure white.
Standing, as I have seen it, against a flaming
sunset, with the glow of lamplight from the
windows, it is as true a fairy palace as ever
haunted a poet's dream. Beyond it the hill
falls steeply to the Tropics, and the gardens
run down into the rich glens. Its height is
some nine thousand feet above the sea, and its
climate is always temperate; but three thousand
feet beneath it is Equatoria, and on clear days
a gleam can be caught of the great lakes. So
the gardens, which begin with English flowers,
fall in tiers through a dozen climates, till azalea

gives place to hibiscus, and hibiscus to poin-
settia, and below in the moist valley you end
with orchids and palms.
Entering the house through the heavy brass-
studded doors, you come first into a great
panelled hall, floored with a mosaic of marble
on which lie many skins and karosses, and lit
by a huge silver chandelier. In a corner is a
stone fireplace like a cavern, where day and
night in winter burns a great fire of logs.
Round it are a number of low chairs and little
tables, but otherwise the place is empty of
furniture, save for the forest of horns and the
grinning heads of lion and leopard on the walls.
The second hall is more of a summer chamber,
for it is panelled in lighter wood and hung with
many old prints and pictures concerned with the
great age of African adventure. There you will
find quaint Dutch and Portuguese charts, and
altar-pieces gifted by a de Silveira or a de Barros
to some Mozambique church long since in ruins.
Brass-bound sea-chests, tall copper vases of
Arab workmanship, rare porcelain of the Indies,
and rich lacquer cabinets line the walls, and
the carpet is an exquisite old Persian fabric.
Beyond, through the folding windows, lie the
verandahs, whence one looks over a sea of mist
to the trough of the lakes. To the right

stretch more panelled chambers—dining-room,
smoking-rooms, a library of many thousand
volumes, and as fine a private museum as you
will find in the world. To the left are the
drawing-rooms, hung with flowered silks and
curious Eastern brocades, opening on a cool
verandah, and lit in the evening by the same
wild fires of sunset. Upstairs the bedrooms
are masterpieces of arrangement, all fresh and
spacious, and yet all unmistakably of Africa
and the Tropics. From any window there is a
vision of a landscape which has the strange
glamour of a dream. The place is embosomed
in flowers, whether growing in brass-hooped
mahogany tubs or cut and placed daily in the
many silver bowls; but no heavy odours ever
impair the virginal freshness of the house.
Luxury has been carried to that extreme of
art where it becomes a delicate simplicity. It
is a place to work, to talk, to think, but not
to idle in—a strenuous and stimulating habita-
tion. For on every side seems to stretch an
unknown world, calling upon the adventurous
mind to take possession.
Hugh dressed early, and, finding the hall
empty, penetrated into the Green drawing-
room, where he came upon Lady Flora Brune

examining critically some Zanzibari ivories.
They had met many times in London, and
were on a footing of easy friendship.
"Well, Mr Somerville, I must ask the usual
question. Had you a pleasant journey?"
"Fair," said Hugh, warming his hands at the
fire. "We found Cairo a little too hot—at least
Mrs Yorke and Lady Warcliff did, for I am a
salamander. You were luckier, and stopped at
Marseilles."
"Yes, and Aunt Susan behaved so badly.
Poor Lord Launceston wanted to stay at home
and write, and she dragged him about the
whole Riviera, trying to find a house for next
winter. He took it like an angel, but I am
sure he thought a good deal. He provided me
with a lot of books to read on the voyage, and
I have muddled my brains so terribly that I
haven't a clear idea left. I shall disgrace my-
self in this party, for it is to be very serious,
isn't it?"
"Very serious, Lady Flora. But you and I
are young, and the loss of our contributions
won't matter. I am very stupid, too, since the
elections."
"You were beaten, weren't you?" said the
girl, with wide sympathetic eyes.
"Handsomely. Four thousand of a minority

instead of Seymour's majority of fifteen hundred.
I hadn't a chance from the start. My work
with Launceston was flung in my face, they
shouted 'Indian labour' when I tried to speak
about anything, and Nonconformist ministers
went about the place in motor-cars telling the
people that every vote given to me was a vote
given against the Lord. They even accused me
of being a Jew," said Hugh, stroking a very un-
Jewish nose. "Besides, I was that strange wild-
fowl, a Tory free-trader, and another Unionist
was run against me, who claimed the credit of
such little Imperialism as was going. But on
the whole I enjoyed the sport. I never once
lost my temper, and I got a tremendous ovation
after the poll. The men who had voted against
me carried me shoulder-high to my hotel, and
they all but killed the successful candidate.
Englishmen at heart love a failure 1"
"Are there any other victims here?" Lady
Flora asked.
"Astbury lost by ten in a place which was
considered hopeless, so he did well. Also Con-
sidine was turned out, but as he never went
near the place, and left his wife to do his
electioneering, perhaps we need not wonder.
But all that is dead and buried. I hear people
talking. Let's go and find the others."

The rest of the party had gathered in the
inner hall. The young men—Hugh, Astbury,
Considine, and Graham—wore ordinary smart
London clothes. Carey, as was his custom,
had a soft silk shirt and a low collar, above
which his magnificent throat and head rose
like a bust of some Roman emperor. Mr
Wakefield had arrayed himself in that garb
which seems inseparable from Colonial states-
men—a short dinner-jacket and a black tie.
The tall figure of Lord Launceston stood by
the fire, deep in conversation with Lord Appin,
whose robust form and silver head contrasted
strangely with the bent figure and worn, old-
young face of his companion. Mr Lowenstein,
a very small man, with untidy hair and bright
eager eyes, wandered restlessly between Mrs
Wilbraham, who was absorbed in the contem-
plation of Lord Launceston, and the Duchess,
who was considering a plan of the dinner-table.
It was the rule at Musuru to disregard the
claims of precedence. Hugh was sent in with
Mrs Yorke, and found on his other side Lady
Lucy. An English butler was the one concession
to the familiar, for the meal was served by Masai
boys, far defter and more noiseless than any foot-
man, dressed in tunics of white linen with a thin
border of blue. Hugh had scarcely time to look

round the great half-lit room and admire the
exquisite harmony of silver lamps and crimson
roses, when he found his attention claimed by
his right-hand neighbour.
"Please tell me who the people are and all
about them," she begged in her pretty exotic
voice. "I know you and Margaret Warcliff
and the Duchess and Lord Appin and Mr
Carey. That is Lord Launceston, isn't it, over
there? I do think his deep eyes and haggard
face just the most wonderful thing in life. How
happy Charlotte Wilbraham looks talking to
him I know they are devoted friends. Who
is sitting by his other side 2"
"Mrs Deloraine. Don't you know her? She
has many claims to be considered the most beau-
tiful woman in England, but she is rarely seen
in London. She lives in a wonderful old house
in Shropshire, and writes what many people
think the only good religious poetry of our
day. What a contrast her Madonna face is
to Lady Amysfort's 1" Hugh looked across
the table to where that great lady, with her
small head and bright eyes, like some handsome
bird of prey, was entertaining Lord Appin.
"Of course that is Lady Amysfort. I have
seen her often, but you know one never can
recall her face—only a vague impression of some-

thing delightful. I suppose that is the secret of
her power, for no woman remembers to be jealous
of her. Now tell me the others. Who is the
pretty fair-haired girl sitting next Lord Appin' "
"Lady Flora Brune, the Duchess's niece.
And then comes Sir Edward Considine, the
man who has gone from the Cape to Cairo,
and from Senegal to Somaliland, and has killed
more lions than I have partridges. He and
Graham have just come off a hunting - trip,
and that explains why they are so gorgeously
browned. That is Graham on your right, sitting
next Lady Warcliff—the little man with blue
eyes and a fair moustache. He went to Klon-
dyke before it was fashionable, and has been in
half-a-dozen wars, and is a Lieutenant-Colonel,
though he is only thirty-five. He is the main-
stay of that precarious institution, our Intelli-
gence Department."
"Speak low," said Mrs Yorke, "and tell me
who the people are on our side. Who is the big
man next me? He looks like a lawyer."
"I expect you have heard his name in the
States. He is Wakefield, the man who was
Premier of Canada, and now devotes his life
to preaching imperial unity. He is a scholar
as well as a publicist, which is rare enough in
these days. Do you know his neighbour?"

"The pretty dark child with the earnest
eyes? No. Yes, isn't she Laura Haystoun's
"Quite right. And now," said Hugh in a
whisper, "you know everybody, except the
people on my left. The first is Lady Lucy
Gardner. Extraordinarily handsome, I think,
though she is no longer young, and has been
through all the worst climates in the world. Her
husband is the Governor of East Africa, and is
now taking his leave salmon-fishing in Norway,
while his wife lends official countenance to this
gathering. On the whole she is the bravest
woman I know, and one of the cleverest. The
man between her and the Duchess is Mr Lowen-
stein, whose name you must have seen in the
papers. He is the whipping-boy of our op-
ponents—why, I cannot guess, for a more modest,
gentle soul I never met. You may have heard
his story. He made a great fortune when quite
young, and married a very beautiful girl, the
daughter of a Scotch peer. People said she sold
herself for his wealth, for he is, as you may
observe, a Jew, and not very good to look upon.
I believe, however, that it was a real love match,
and certainly they made a devoted couple. Then
she died suddenly, two years ago, and he got rid
of all his houses and pictures, and tried to bury

himself abroad. Carey saw his chance, hunted
him out, and managed to put a new interest in
life into him. Now, as you know, he is hand and
glove with him in all his schemes. He is said to
be one of the first financial geniuses alive, but he
has no courage or nerve, and these Carey supplies
in the partnership."
"I like his face," said Mrs Yorke thoughtfully;
"there is a fire somewhere behind his eyes. But
then I differ from most of my countrymen in
liking Jews. You can do something with them—
stir them up to follow some mad ideal, and they
are never vulgar at heart. If we must have
magnates, I would rather Jews had the money.
It doesn't degrade them, and they have the in-
fallible good taste of the East at the back of their
heads. No Northerner should be rich, unless he
happens to be also a genius."
"Genius, I suppose, means some consuming
passion which burns up the vulgarity. We are
talking about wealth, Lady Lucy," Hugh said,
turning to his other neighbour. "Mrs Yorke
will only permit it in the case of the elect.
Otherwise it offends her sense of fitness."
The lady cast a glance over the room. "This
house, for instance. It is so flawless and there-
fore so refreshing. And yet, when I think how
much it must cost to have such a palace in the

wilderness, I grow giddy. I am not sure if we
have any right to be so comfortable."
Lord Appin caught the last words, and leaned
over the table. "Surely that is an exploded
heresy," he said, in the rich and exquisite voice
which had made him par excellence the Public
Orator of England. "I thought we had long ago
given up the idea that austerity of mind depended
upon discomfort of body. The Simple Life is the
last refuge of complicated and restless souls.
For myself I know no such stimulus to action
as a good dinner, and to thought as a beautiful
room."
"I am not certain," said Hugh. "It may be
some tincture of Calvinism in my blood, but I
confess I never feel quite happy unless I am a
little miserable. When I am doing work I detest
there is a glow of satisfaction about me which
I miss when I am swimming along in some-
thing which is quite congenial. You remember
Bagehot's account of Lord Althorp, who gave up
hunting after his wife's death, not because he
thought it wrong, but because he felt he had
no business to be so happy as hunting made him.
I am sure that we are happiest when doing some-
thing difficult and unpleasant. The cup wants a
dash of bitters to make it palatable, for if taken
neat it is sickly."

"How true that is," sighed Mrs Yorke. "Hap-
piness lies only in a divine unrest; and if you are
lapped in comfort you stagnate and miss it."
"That is the worst piece of fallacious Stoicism
I have ever heard," Lord Appin said firmly. "It
means nothing but a low vitality. If you are so
morbid as to be dominated by your surroundings,
then what you say is true enough. But to the
philosophic soul environment matters nothing.
He is happy alike in camp, court, and cottage.
He will even preserve a modest gaiety in the
House of Lords."
"That is not my nature," said Lady Amysfort
with conviction. "You may be right—as a
counsel of perfection. But which of us attains to
that austere height?"
"I frankly confess I don't," Lord Appin replied.
"I have just been saying how much I owe to a
good dinner and a pretty room. But some of us
do. Carey does, I think—and of Launceston I
am certain. What is your view, Teddy ?"
Sir Edward Considine had been explaining to
the appreciative Lady Flora the plan of his recent
shooting-trip; but both had been drawn by Lord
Appin's proximity to listen to him. His soft
voice when he spoke was a strange contrast to
his hard, weather-worn face.
"It is all a question of that romance which

most of us spend our lives looking for. Luxury
is nothing in itself, but in its proper setting it
can be an inspiration. A week ago I was perfectly
happy. Graham and I were living in the most
beastly discomfort, but then we were on the
move and we had the excitement of sport, and
we never thought about it. To-night, also, I
am perfectly happy; but if all this had been in
London, and I had been having months of it, I
should probably have been miserable. You may
imagine what it is to jog on all day through the
hot bush with the dust of weeks on you, and
your clothes in rags, and no food but tinned
stuff. And then suddenly this afternoon we
came to the gates of this place, and paid off our
caravan-boys, from a hundred miles north—and
in five minutes exchanged barbarism for civilisa-
tion. I wallowed in a bath, and my man was
waiting with clean English things, and here I
am, like the prodigal son after the husks, clothed
and in my right mind. I call that romance, and
there is no keener pleasure. But you must
have the contrast."
Lady Flora nodded approval, recalling appar-
ently kindred experiences in her short life. But
the discussion was put an end to by Carey's voice
from the head of the table. He began a little
nervously, as if he were proposing a toast and

had doubts how it would be honoured. For so
massive a figure his voice was singularly high-
pitched and small, so that he was the predestined
victim of mimics. But there was a force behind
it which arrested the ear.
"I think," he began, "that this is the time
when I ought to say something about why we
are all here. You don't need to be told that
your company is in itself a sufficient delight to me.
But this is not meant to be an ordinary party.
Things have moved very fast lately in politics,
and most of us have got our eyes a little dazzled.
We want time to collect our wits, and think
things out, — not only politics, but our whole
scheme of life, our ambitions, the things which
at the bottom of our hearts we care most for.
We are all agreed, more or less, and we represent
different sides of experience, so that we can
supplement one another's deficiencies. For the
moment the fates are against us, and I thought
that, like the Apostle Paul, we should come out
into the wilderness and reflect a little. We are
only spectators at present, and it is an excellent
chance to get our minds clear about what we
want while we are looking on at the comedy
which others are going to play for us."
Carey paused to sip his wine, and Mr Wake-
field, who had a talent for trite quotation,

declaimed with gusto the well-known lines of
Lucretius:–
"Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis,
E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem;
Non quia vexari quemquamst jucunda voluptas,
Sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est.
Suave etiam belli certamina magna tueri
Per campos instructa tua sine parte pericli." "
"Translate, please," Mrs Yorke whispered to
Hugh.
"It means that it is great fun to have a good
seat in the stalls and watch other people making
idiots of themselves on the stage."
"We have seen many strange things in the
last months," Carey went on. "Our creed has
been dragged in the mire, and by those who
professed to reverence it. Every decaying in-
terest which wanted help has been told that in
it could be found its peculiar salvation. Every
vulgar feeling in the whole treasury of our
national vulgarity has been enlisted in its sup-
port. Small wonder that England is a little sick
of the very name of Empire. The result, of
* De Rerum Natura, ii. 1-6. "Pleasant it is, when the winds
are tossing the waters of the mighty sea, to behold from the land
another's mighty toil—not that there is sweet delight in another's
affliction, but that it is pleasant to see griefs from which thou
thyself art free. Pleasant also is it to witness the great conflicts of
war joined through the plains, thyself with no share in the peril."

course, is a return to tradition. The lack-lustre
creeds of fifty years ago have acquired a kind of
splendour in contrast with the dulness of our
faith. The old armoury has been ransacked, and
the rusty flintlocks have all been burnished up.
They make an imposing show on parade, and
people have not yet begun to think what will
happen in the day of battle. For the moment
England is insular again, and the past three
centuries have been forgotten."
Lord Appin was in the throes of a quotation.
"'Little England, which was our reproach, has
become our glory,'" he interrupted,—"'the little
England of Shakespeare and Milton and Cromwell
has conquered the Greater Britain of Baron Stein-
berg and Mr Bernstein.' The words, I need
scarcely say, are not my own, but those of a
bright young Liberal journalist, whose contribu-
tions to the daily press afford me much innocent
pleasure."
"So be it," said Carey cheerfully. "The phase
will pass, that we well know. As a philosopher
you realise that, to use your barbarous jargon,
Being can only develop through non-Being and
the Infinite through the negations of the Finite.
We have a living creative faith, and we are not
disheartened because the people for the moment
blaspheme their deities. But, as I have said, it

is the occasion to examine ourselves and find the
reason of that faith which is in us."
"We need a definition," said Hugh, who had
been studying attentively the sphinx-like face of
his host. "I call myself an Imperialist, and so
does the noisy fellow at the street corner; but if
I am pressed to explain I can give no summary
statement of my creed."
"Is not the reason because it is not a creed
but a faith?" Lady Lucy's clear voice had a
peculiar power of compelling attention. "You
cannot carve an epic on a nutshell or expound
Christianity in an aphorism. If I could define
Imperialism satisfactorily in a sentence I should
be very suspicious of its truth."
"No," said Carey, "we don't want a definition.
By its fruits ye shall know it. It is a spirit, an
attitude of mind, an unconquerable hope. You
can phrase it in a thousand ways without ex-
hausting its content. It is a sense of the destiny
of England. It is the wider patriotism which
conceives our people as a race and not as a
chance community. But we might take opinions.
Let us each give his or her own description,
beginning with Mrs Deloraine."
The lady looked a little confused. "I call it
an enlarged sense of the beauty and mystery of
the world."


## p. 29 (#49) ##############################################

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS. 29
"How true!" said Mrs Yorke. "May I have
that for my definition too, Mr Carey !" There
seemed a general agreement on this among the
WOmen.
Lord Launceston smiled a little sadly. "I
don't yet see my way to any summary. It is a
spirit moving upon the waters, a dumb faith in
the hearts of many simple men up and down the
world, who are building better than they know—
"Not till the hours of light return,
All we have built do we discern.'"
Lord Appin, who was eating grape-fruit,
looked up quizzically. "I call it, in the language
of my hobby, the realisation of the need of a
quantitative basis for all qualitative develop-
ment. It is a hard saying, which I shall ex-
pound later."
"For Heaven's sake let us keep out of mystic-
ism," broke in Mr Wakefield, who detested Lord
Appin's metaphysics. "I define Imperialism as
the closer organic connection under one Crown of
a number of autonomous nations of the same
blood, who can spare something of their vitality
for the administration of vast tracts inhabited by
lower races, a racial aristocracy considered in
their relation to the subject peoples, a democracy
in their relation to each other."


## p. 30 (#50) ##############################################

30 A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS.
Mr Astbury nodded. "I take Mr Wakefield's
definition for mine."
"And I," said Considine, "call it romance. I
have no head for political theories, but I have an
eye for a fact. It is the impulse to deeds rather
than talk, the ardour of a race which is renewing
its youth. It is what made the Elizabethans,
and all ages of adventure."
"For my part," said Lady Amysfort, "I think
it simply Toryism under a new name—the Tory-
ism of our great men, Bolingbroke, Pitt, Canning,
Disraeli. Toryism was never Conservatism, re-
member. It was a positive creed, both destruc-
tive and constructive. Liberalism is a doctrine
of abstractions, right or wrong, which bear no
true relation to national life. Toryism has al-
ways held by the instincts and traditions of the
people, and when our island became an empire it
became naturally Imperialism."
"As a Liberal Imperialist, Caroline," said the
Duchess with some asperity, "I profoundly dis-
agree. I wish George were here to say what I
think of your history."
Mr Lowenstein's restless eyes had been wan-
dering from one speaker to the other, and he had
several times opened his mouth as if to say some-
thing. Now he was about to begin when Miss
Haystoun forestalled him.

*
"I should like to define it in very old words,"
she said shyly, in her low intense voice. "It is
the spirit which giveth life as against the letter
which killeth. It means a renunciation of old
forms and conventions, and the clear-eyed facing
of a new world in the knowledge that when the
half-gods go the true gods must come."
"That is beautifully said," murmured Mr
Lowenstein.
"Indeed, Marjory, I think it is almost blas-
phemous." The Duchess, who had been fretting
for some time under the turn the conversation
had taken, had at last succeeded in catching
Lady Amysfort's eye, and the ladies rose to
leave. Immediately the men reassorted them-
selves according to their preference. Astbury
took his port round to the vacant chair next
Mr Wakefield; Carey, Lord Appin, and Lord
Launceston formed a coterie by themselves;
Graham and Considine revelled silently in the
novel luxury of good cigars, and Hugh joined
Lowenstein, by whom he was cross-examined
concerning the names of his fellow-guests.
It was not Carey's habit to linger at table, and
the sound of a beautiful voice singing a song of
Schubert drew the men soon to the inner hall,
where Mrs Deloraine sat at the piano. At each
end of the apartment log-fires burned brightly;

outside the white verandah gleamed chill in the
frosty moonlight; and the place was lit only by
the hearths and two tall silver lamps beside the
piano. A soft aromatic scent—the mingling of
flowers and wood-smoke—filled the air.
Lord Appin took his place beside Mrs Delor-
aine. Carey stood in the centre of a great fire-
place, and the others resorted to chairs and
couches. Hugh, finding a very soft rug, settled
himself at Lady Flora's feet.
The lady at the piano finished "Der Wan-
derer" and began the song from La Princesse
Lointaine. It was a melody of her own making,
very wild and tender, and in the dim light her
wonderful voice held the listeners like a spell.
"Car c'est chose suprême
D'aimer sans qu'on vous aime,
D'aimer toujours, quand même,
Sans cesse,
D'une amour incertaine,
Plus noble d'être vaine,
Et j'aime la lointaine
Princesse !"
When she ceased there was silence for a little.
The place and time were so strange — there
among delicate furniture and all the trappings
of a high civilisation, looking out over the
primeval wilds. Savage beasts roamed a mile
off in that untamed heart of the continent. The

most sophisticated members of the company felt
the glamour of the unknown around them. Lord
Launceston rose quietly and walked to the win-
dow, where he gazed abstractedly at the starry
sky; Lady Lucy was looking into the red glow
of the fire; Marjory Haystoun and Lady Flora
sat, chin on hand, in a kind of dream. Only
Graham and Considine were unconscious of the
spell. Months of hunting and going to bed at
sundown had spoiled them for civilised hours,
and they had dropped off peacefully to sleep
in their chairs.
Carey broke the silence. "Here we are in
Prester John's country," he said. "He may
have had a daughter called Melissinde, and
she may have been the Far-away Princess to
some Portuguese adventurer who left his ship
at Mombasa and wandered up into the hills.
Do you realise how strange it is to be sitting
here? Thirty years ago this was bush, with
lions roaring in it, and the pioneers who may
have camped here were three hundred miles
from a white man, with hostile tribes around
them, and the Lord knows what in front. I
remember when I first came it was from the west.
I had been trekking for months in Uganda, right
across from Albert Edward and the Semliki to
what is now Port Florence. I had had a bad

dose of fever, and when we crawled up into the
foothills I was as weak as a cat. We stayed
here for a bit to recruit our strength, and, when
I could stand, I went one evening, just about
sunset, and looked down into the Tropics. That
hour is as clear to me as if it had been yesterday.
There was a fresh, clean wind blowing, which put
life into my bones, and I stood on the edge and
looked down thousands of feet over the little
hill-tops to the great forest and on to the horizon,
which was all red and gold. I knew that there
was fever and heat and misery down below, but
in the twilight it was transfigured, and seemed
only a kind of fairyland designed for happiness.
I was a poor man then, poor and ambitious,
hungering for something, I did not know what.
It was not wealth, for I never wanted wealth
for its own sake. It was a purpose in life I
sought, and in that moment I found it. For
I realised that the great thing in the world is
to reach the proper vantage-ground. I learned
that things are not what they seem to the fighter
in the midst of them; that the truth can only be
known to the man on the hill-top. I realised
that the heavenly landscape below me was far
more the real Africa than the place of dust and
fever I had left. And in that hour I saw my
work, and, I think, too, the ideal of our race. If

we cannot create a new heaven, we can create a
new earth. 'The wilderness and the solitary
place shall be glad for us; the desert shall rejoice
and blossom as the rose.'"
The Duchess got up. "Marjory," she said,
"you are nodding, and as for Alastair and Sir
Edward, they have been asleep for the last half-
hour. I think we are all ready for bed after our
long journey."
As Hugh lit her candle at the foot of the stair-
case, she whispered to him confidentially, "When
Francis begins to talk in blank verse, I always
feel a little nervous. I think it is quite time for
the women to say good-night."

CHAPTER II.
MoRNING at Musuru came as a surprise to those
who remembered the hot noontide of the previous
day. For the air was as bitter as an English
winter, and, looking from the windows, they
saw the valleys filled with cold mist and the
lawns whitened with hoar - frost. The result
was that all the women breakfasted in their
rooms. And of the men, only Hugh, Astbury,
and Mr Wakefield appeared in the dining-room,
where a roaring wood-fire gave the early risers
a sense of comfort to temper their consciousness
of virtue. That consciousness, however, was
rudely disturbed by the discovery that Graham
and Considine had breakfasted at least two
hours before and had gone out heroically into
the chilly morning.
Mr Wakefield stood warming his back at the
fire, in the attitude of a Master of Hounds before
a hunt breakfast. He had arrayed himself in
Harris tweeds, and his legs were clothed with

new buckskin gaiters. Hugh and Astbury, who
knew something of the Musuru climate, had put
on thinner shooting suits.
The elder man helped himself to mealie-meal
porridge and cream. "We had an interesting
talk last night, and I hope during our visit
we may reach some valuable conclusions. But
I foresee trouble ahead unless we can keep Lord
Appin away from Hegel and put a stop to
Carey's infernal mysticism. In my opinion,
also, there are too many women for a really
helpful discussion. We must, above all things,
be practical. Now, I have here a kind of
syllabus which Carey gave me last night—a
list of the subjects we are to consider, and the
order we are to take them in. To-night we
are to begin with contemporary English politics
and the present position of parties. Well, at
any rate, that is relevant, if dull. Then we go
on to the constitutional apparatus of Empire, the
question of our tropical possessions, the economic
and administrative problems. All these are very
much to the point. But I notice at the end
the sinister announcement that the concluding
days are to be spent in talking about the ethical
basis of Empire, and its relation to intellectual
and aesthetic progress. That means, I fear,
more of the unpromising mysticism of which we

had a taste last night. We must keep Imperi-
alism out of the clouds, or how on earth is it to
commend itself to business men 2 I speak from
a wide knowledge of the Colonies, and I assure
you that what they want is a business proposi-
tion. We have, of course, our own ideals, but
they are framed in a different language from
yours, and I need hardly tell you that a common
ideal, held with a difference, has proved in the
past the most potent of disruptive forces. Let
every man add his own poetry to the facts, but
for Heaven's sake let us get the facts agreed
upon first."
Mr Wakefield's eloquence was checked by his
appetite, and by Hugh's warning that the word
"Empire" was tabooed in the daytime. "Carey
and I agreed," said he, "that we should degener-
ate into a debating society and get bored to
death with each other unless we placed strict
limits to our enthusiasm. So our discussions
will not begin till dinner-time. Before that we
are at liberty to think as much as we please,
but we must not talk about it. The resources
of this place are limitless. We can shoot and
fish and ride and walk; there is an excellent
library; the finest scenery in the world is at our
door. In the daytime we are flâneurs, without
a thought except how to amuse ourselves. In

the evening we can devote ourselves to your
"business proposition.'"
Mr Wakefield acquiesced a little reluctantly,
and, having finished breakfast, ensconced himself
in the library with a box of cigars and a French
novel. Astbury went off to do some writing,
and Hugh devoted an hour to his neglected cor-
respondence. Meanwhile the mist was clearing,
the sun had come out and burned up the rime,
and, as he looked from the window, he saw a
pale blue sky, which promised heat, and all the
mystery of bright colour which a tropical morn-
ing displays. So, after going to his room for
a book, he found a long wicker-chair on the
verandah, and, lighting a pipe, settled himself
for a peaceful forenoon.
He found it hard to read, however. The wide
landscape shimmering below him, the calling of
strange birds, the wafts of strange scents from
the garden distracted his thoughts. By-and-by
a trim white figure in a large sun-hat came
along, and he said good-morning to Lady Flora.
The girl refused a chair, and seated herself on
the parapet of the verandah.
"I am all alone, so I must come and talk
to you, Mr Somerville. Aunt Susan and Lady
Amysfort and Mrs Yorke are not down yet.
Charlotte Wilbraham has taken Lord Launceston

for a walk, Lady Lucy and Mr Lowenstein are
talking business, Marjory and Mr Astbury are
talking politics, and Barbara Deloraine is looking
at a big botany book with pictures. I found
Colonel Alastair and Sir Edward in the stables
skinning beasts, and they were so covered with
blood and the place smelt so horribly that I
could not stay. Lady Warcliff is writing hun-
dreds of letters about some of her emigration
societies. I am sure she fusses far too much
about her work. She behaves always like a weary
Atlas holding up a world which doesn't in the
least want to be held up. Last of all, I found
Lord Appin deep in a big German book, but he
told me to be a good girl and run away. So
you are my only refuge. Tell me what you are
reading in that little book with so many pencil
markings in it."
"Plato," said Hugh. "I am taking advan-
tage of my idleness to renew my acquaintance
with the great masters. But it's very hard to
find the proper book for such a morning."
"Nearly as hard as to find the proper clothes.
When my maid called me she said it was
"freezin' 'ard, so I put on my thickest tweed
skirt. When I had finished dressing I saw the
sun coming out, so I put on a lighter one. And
when I came downstairs and went out on the

verandah and saw that it was quite summery,
I had to go back and change into summer things.
Two changes in a morning are really enough to
upset one. I feel as if I had been inconstant."
Hugh shut his book and began to refill his
pipe. "I think I'll talk to you instead of read-
ing Plato. What would you like to talk about !"
"This place, first of all," said the girl. "Did
you ever see anything to match it? I am so
glad Aunt Susan brought me. I fancied we
should be living in a log cabin with Kaffir ser-
vants, and I seriously thought of leaving my
maid at home, as I did last year in Norway.
Instead, I find the most beautiful and comfort-
able house I ever dreamed of And I like the
idea of our party so much. We are going to
talk high politics, and I am sure we have got
some very clever men to talk them. It is such
a refreshing change from the ordinary "cure.'
My first two seasons I went with Mother to
stupid German places, where one saw the same
people who had bored one in town and talked
the same foolish gossip. It is a blessing to be
in a place where one can talk about better
things than other people's love affairs."
Hugh laughed. "You are growing old, Lady
Flora, if that topic has ceased to amuse you.
Have you had a hard Season?"

42 A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS.
"Pretty hard, and I suppose I am growing
old, for people are beginning to pall on me.
Three years ago, when I first came out, I was
tolerant of everything and anybody. But now
I seem to have too much of it all. I want a
little peace to get my mind clear and to know
what I like and who are my friends. Didn't
some one say that the art of life was to make
up your mind what you really and truly wanted ?
I am afraid I shall soon be that deplorable young
woman, "her name was Dull.'"
"You have been reading the 'Pilgrim's Pro-
gress,' and you are afraid that you are one of
the citizens of Vanity Fair?"
"I am horribly afraid. At the bottom of my
heart I would really live almost anywhere else—
even with the tiresome old Interpreter or the
spinsters of the House Beautiful. Where do
Ayou live, Mr Somerville 7"
Hugh shook his head doubtfully. "Various
places up and down the Way. A good deal in
the Valley of Humiliation. Now and then in
Doubting Castle. But not much, I think, in
Vanity Fair."
"No," said the girl, "I don't seem to have
seen you about so much lately. Have you
grown tired of the world?"
"I have so many things to think about nowa-

days. As you were saying, the secret of life is
to find out what one really wants, and I have
discovered that a little of Society goes a long
way with me. I only liked it because of the
romance which it has for us all at first. When
I grew up properly and the gilt was rubbed off
I found it hard and stupid : so like a wise man
I seek my romance elsewhere. You are growing
up, too, and finding the same thing."
Lady Flora climbed off her perch and leant
over the balustrade, looking down into the in-
finite blue distances.
"At any rate we are both in the Delectable
Mountains now," she said, "and we have the
Shepherds, too, and they may teach us something.
But I wish we were going to talk about a more
helpful subject. Of course I believe in Imperial-
ism, and I canvassed a great deal for cousin
Charlie at the election. He was beaten, poor
boy, and he said it was largely my fault, for I
always agreed with anything anybody said to me.
And I am much more interested in the Empire
than in England, for all the nicest people I know
are in Tibet, or Nigeria, or some remote place.
But at the same time I can't help feeling that
any politics are rather a far-away thing to me."
"And yet I don't see why they should be,"
said Hugh, rising and looking over the balustrade

beside the girl. "We are all citizens,—I am
giving you the kind of answer an elderly paternal
person would give, and we have long got over
the old foolish idea that politics were only a
game for men, and for a few men at that. What
we are going to talk about is the whole scheme
of life which a new horizon and a new civic ideal
bring with them. It affects the graces as closely
as the business of life, art and literature as well
as economics and administration. Suppose a small
tribe lived in a cave and never saw the daylight.
One day the barriers at the door fall down, and
they look out on a blue sky and meadows and a
river, and are free to go out to them. It wouldn't
be only the modes of tribal government that
would be altered by the illumination."
"No, I suppose not. But the whole thing is
still very unfamiliar to me, and I cannot under-
stand the language you all talk in. I've never
been able to follow even Lord Appin's jokes, though
he's a relation, and Mr Carey speaks like a very
impressive but very obscure bishop. Perhaps
Lord Launceston may be simpler. He is so kind
and wearied and sad, and his face is so like
a Burne-Jones knight, that some day I shall cer-
tainly kiss him, if I am not too afraid of Char-
lotte Wilbraham."

lady of twenty or thereabouts, who is a little
tired of being frivolous, to attain satisfaction in
life? Upon my soul, I think that is a much
more difficult question than the other."
"You are very tiresome, Mr Somerville," said
the girl. "You think I am only a butterfly. I
may be, but I can at least look beyond my cab-
bage-leaf, and I am very very discontented."
"Why not try good works?" Hugh asked.
"'Journeys end in mothers' meetings l' No!
I've tried them in an amateur way, and the works
aren't really good. You make yourself miserable,
and only fuss and patronise the poor, so nobody
is a penny the better."
"Well, then, there is the intellectual life 2"
"I haven't the brains. It is all very well for
Marjory, who has read everything, and finds life
far too short for the things she burns to do. I
don't live at white-heat like her. More by token,"
said Lady Flora, peering into the garden, "she
is at this moment discoursing with Mr Astbury
among the oleanders. Bareheaded too! I wonder
if she knows that this is mid-day in the Tropics.
She'll be cut off in the pride of her youth and
beauty."
"There only remains falling in love and marry-
ing," said Hugh solemnly.

"Oh, Mr Somerville, I never expected to hear
you say anything so banal. As if any short cut
to happiness lay that way ! If you can't find
a philosophy of life before marriage, you won't
find it after. It is shirking the question, not
solving it."
The girl swung round and revealed a laughing
face and dancing eyes. "I am a better actress
than I thought, and you were quite taken in. I
am really blissfully happy, happier than I think
I've ever been before. But I want to make the
most of this place, so I have a scheme to offer.
Why should we not have a special conference on
our own account 2 The discussions in the even-
ings will be the voice of age. Let us have the
voice of youth—you and me—in the mornings.
I shall want to ask so many questions and have
so many things explained to me. Besides, I
may contribute really valuable suggestions in
our téte-à-téte, which I should be much too shy
to launch at the dinner-table. Shall we make it
a bargain?"
As they shook hands on the compact the gong
—aforetime the war-drum of a neighbouring tribe
—sounded for luncheon.
Conversation at dinner was begun by a speech
of some length from the Duchess of Maxton. In

the afternoon she had been driven by Carey in
an American buggy round a settlement of some
fifty families from England. Enthusiasm was
not commonly her rôle, but as a practical woman
and a practical farmer she had been carried out
of herself in admiration of the success of his
experiment. She had tried the same thing on
her husband's Suffolk estate, where it maintained
a precarious life, fed by frequent doles from her
own purse. Her first impression, therefore, had
been that this was but another of Carey's ex-
travagant hobbies, and she had been greatly
astonished to learn that it paid him six per
cent on his outlay. The vast fields of tobacco
and maize, the strips of lucerne, the orchards,
the plain substantial houses, the well-made roads,
the schoolhouse, the buxom contentment of the
women, the healthy colour of the children, and
the hard well-being of the men—she did not
know what the most to admire. "How do you
do it?" she had inquired, and had been told
simply, "Management."
"Where did you get the people from ?" she
asked at dinner.
"Some from my old home in Devonshire—
small farmers who could not make a living in
England, young shepherds who wanted to be on
their own, and a younger son or two who were

not above labouring with their hands. But I
wanted all sorts; so you will find South Africans
and New Zealanders and Canadians in the settle-
ment. I made a point of having none but men
who had got the love of the soil in them. I don't
think of the place as an emigration experiment.
I wanted my estate farmed to the best purposes,
and I hunted about for the best tenants. It is
true that in time all will own their own farms,
but even as freeholders they will still be in a real
sense my own people."
"The danger I foresee in all such work," said
Mr Wakefield, who found Lady Flora and Lady
Amysfort, his two neighbours, a little inattentive
to his conversation,-''the danger is that too much
depends upon the will of a single man. One man
like you, Carey, is a godsend; a hundred would
be a calamity. For, when all is said and done,
you are feudalists and aristocrats at heart. Now
I maintain that the basis of empire is a demo-
cratic one—that is to say, empire as understood
in the free Colonies, which are its real support.
Africa, if I may say so, has been too much
monopolised by "men of destiny'—Rhodes, for
example, and yourself. In Canada, in New
Zealand, in Australia, you are inconceivable. I
appreciate your work as much as any man, but
I feel that it creates a false precedent. It is a

precedent, I admit, which has small chance of
being followed," he added, smiling.
Carey nodded and looked across the table to
Lord Appin. "Mr Wakefield has brought us to
the subject which we had arranged to discuss
to-night. I think you will all agree that it is
our first business to look at the condition of
political thought in England, and incidentally
at the position of political parties. England,
even Mr Wakefield will admit, is still the im-
perial centre of gravity. Our creed is, of course,
not identified with any party formula, but we
Imperialists must work through existing agencies.
It is most important, therefore, to know what
materials we have to deal with."
"May I make a suggestion before we begin 7"
Mr Wakefield interrupted. "I agree with you,
Carey, about the importance of the subject. But
it is one which lends itself most readily to a
barren speculative treatment. As ours is a prac-
tical inquiry, I suggest that we keep very close
to facts and disregard what I believe is called
the metaphysical basis of politics. I mean that
in discussing Liberalism we should not ask our-
selves what Liberalism may imply in its ultimate
analysis, but merely what it means to the several
millions who have voted Liberal at the polls.
Otherwise we shall talk in a language which few

of us can pretend to understand. We are not all
philosophers like Lord Appin."
Lord Appin mildly dissented. "If I may say
so, we are all philosophers, even Lady Flora,
though we don't all of us know it. To be a phil-
osopher it is not necessary that you should have
formulated your creed in a system; it is sufficient
if it governs your thought and conduct. I could
label you all with your appropriate badges. I
myself, for example, with certain private reserv-
ations, am a follower of Hegel. You, Mr Wake-
field, I should class without hesitation as a
disciple of the much - esteemed and lately de-
ceased Mr Herbert Spencer. Lord Launceston,
if I recall his Oxford reputation rightly, agrees
with me. Our host is as fine an instance as I
know of the Transcendental Idealist, though I
don't suppose he has ever read a page of Fichte.
Hugh, I think, is one of those peculiar people
who go back to Kant and misunderstand that
great man's meaning. Mrs Deloraine is a
Platonist, and my sister is in her methods a
crude Baconian. Even Sir Edward has a creed,
and worships, with Nietzsche, the Superman.
Did you ever hear his name, Teddy?"
"Yes," said that gentleman pensively; "and
I once read a book of his —something about
'Zarathustra'—which my wife gave me for a

birthday present. I liked it so much that I
called a horse of mine after the author—won
the Oaks in '99, you may remember. There was
rather a muddle about it, for it was ridden by a
jockey called Neish, and the sporting papers
confused the two, and made him the horse and
the other fellow the jockey." -
"To return to what I was saying," continued
Mr Wakefield with some slight asperity of tone,
"I do earnestly beg of you all to keep on the
hard highroad of facts. We have enough poli-
tical metaphysicians in the world, and their
works are to be found in the leading articles of
the halfpenny Radical press. Our raison d'être
is that we look more squarely at the realities of
life. We have ample knowledge in our party
to reconstruct the policies of the globe. For
Heaven's sake let us keep off windy general-
ities."
Carey smiled benevolently during the inter-
ruption. "I am not a practical man. If I
were, I should still be managing a little mine
on the Rand. But I agree with Mr Wakefield
up to a point—we must take full account of the
data we have to work upon. That is why I
propose that we should begin with the state of
politics in England to-day. On this I have one
remark to make, with which I think all will

agree. The old creeds which still appear in the
text-books are as dead as Julius Caesar."
The Duchess looked uneasy. Born of high
Tory stock, she had married the head of a
great Whig house and had zealously adopted its
politics. "I do not admit that Liberalism is
dead," she said. "On the contrary, it was never
more alive than to-day. It has won a victory
unprecedented since the date of the great Reform
Bill."
"Nevertheless, Susan, I maintain that it is as
dead as a door-nail. And to appease you I will
add that Conservatism — for Lady Amysfort's
sake I will not say Toryism—is in the same
position. I propose to ask Lord Appin, who
still reads the newspapers, to quote to us defin-
itions of Liberalism, prepared both by friend and
foe, and then I will ask you if the thing has
not long been decently buried, though its wraith
still walks the earth. Lady Amysfort will be
kind enough to provide us with some account
of that peculiar faith which she calls Tory-
ism and proposes to identify with Imperialism.
When we know what are the avowed creeds
of the parties, we can fairly consider how much
or how little of the vital spark is left in them.
Then we can talk of Imperialism and those new
doctrines which are its real rivals. Our country

is hungering and thirsting for a living faith.
We are all like sick folk by the Pool of Bethesda,
waiting for the angel to descend and trouble
the waters."
"I think, Francis, we might wait for the angel
in the outer hall," said the voice of the Duchess.
"It is very cold to-night, and that place is my
ideal of comfort. Let us all go and have our
coffee there and talk."

CHAPTER III.
THE great log-fire in the outer hall threw
strange shadows upon the walls, and made the
lion heads grin like outlandish ogres. Lamps
were lit on the small tables, and the company
settled in deep chairs, within the glow of the
fire but outside its disquieting warmth.
Lord Appin, who had seated himself near the
centre of the circle, produced a little volume in
which newspaper extracts were pasted.
"I am, as you know," he said, "a connoisseur
of public opinion. In my belief no statesman
can afford to neglect the ingenuous manifest-
ations of it which from time to time appear in
its popular organs. There you will find the will
of certain classes of the community stated, no
doubt with imperfect grammar and more im-
perfect taste, but still with all the frankness and
confusion of the original. So I subscribe to
several press-cutting agencies, and my secretary,
who knows my desires, keeps for me the more

characteristic extracts. I ought, however, first
of all to define what I mean by public opinion.
Properly understood, it is the bed-rock, the card-
inal fact of all democratic politics such as ours.
It is the sum total of the instincts, traditions,
and desires of our race, created not only by
reasoned beliefs, but by those impalpable forces
of persuasion which no contemporary can hope
to diagnose. I am no despiser of the average
man. What he thinks at the bottom of his
heart, when he thinks at all, is what is sooner
or later going to happen. Now creeds are not
necessarily public opinion. They are the attempts
to interpret it made by its official interpreters—
preachers, journalists, and politicians. When I
quote from the Press, therefore, I do not profess
to be quoting public opinion in its real meaning,
but an interpretation of it which has a vogue
among a certain section of the interpreting
class.
"Let me begin with a definition of the creed
which has just won so conspicuous a victory.
The bright flamboyant style betrays its source:-
"A sigh of thankfulness and hope is heard through-
out the land. England with no uncertain voice has
turned her face against Toryism, with all its moral
défaillance, its insincerity, its opportunism, its lack
of seriousness, its narrow and trifling sophistries, its
unabashed class interest. The white soul of our

people turns towards its true sun. Once more the
large and generous spirit of Liberalism is abroad.
We are on the threshold of a new era, and behind
us lies nothing but confusion. Foreign affairs have
been conducted from hand to mouth without any
perception of large issues; domestic affairs have been
dominated by an obscurantism which, under the in-
fluence of momentary panic, blossomed forth into
ill-considered experiments in reaction. The heart of
the nation needed a solemn purification, and by the
grace of God that purification has come. Men go
about in the streets to-day with a new light in their
eyes—poor men who see at last a hope for their
starving households, earnest men who have fretted in
secret at the long reign of apathy, young men who
have now before them a career of civic usefulness.
From warder to warder runs the challenge, "Brother,
is it well with the State 2' and the answer comes, 'It
is well !'"
Lord Appin paused. "It is a charming pic-
ture of a national renaissance. But let us look,"
he continued, "at what Liberalism has to give —
"The policy of Liberalism is clear. Men's minds
have been too long dazzled by the jingo generalities
of empire. Imperialism battens on the basest attri-
butes of humanity, the lust of conquest and power,
the greed of gold, the morbid unsettlement and dis-
content of a degenerate age. It is for Liberalism to
bring back the people to the paths of political wis-
dom, which are also those of peace and pleasantness.
Purity of character must be insisted upon in our
public men. The heresies of a decadence must be
expunged, and we must return to the sober and

rational orthodoxy of our fathers. The House of
Commons, the People's House, must be restored to
its old prestige. The overgrown burden of arma-
ments must be reduced, and England must appear
before the world as the herald of a truce between
nations. The cost of administration must be lessened
that the private comfort of the citizen may be in-
creased. Provision must be made for the old and
feeble of the land; the slums—that eyesore of our
civilisation—must be opened up to the wholesome
air and light; the workman must be placed on a
level with the master in the economic struggle, and
for that purpose raised above the caprice of juries;
in the exploitation of her neglected assets, the State
must find work for those who are squeezed out of the
capitalist mill. For each class of the community the
way must be made plain for that development which
is its due. Education must be freed from the blight-
ing influence of clericalism; the liquor traffic must
be curbed in the public interest; capitalism and the
servitude it entails must be checked with a strong
and earnest hand. In a word, Liberalism must lift
again its old banner, on which its great master in-
scribed its never-to-be-forgotten creed—"Peace, Re-
trenchment, and Reform l'"
"It is a spirited piece of prose," said Lord
Appin as he concluded, "though I am afraid it
is mostly made up of what logicians call "iden-
tical propositions." Notice, too, the refrain
throughout, 'Return,' 'our historic creed, poli-
tical orthodoxy." Somehow it does not strike me
as inspiring, but I think it is a not unfair state-
ment of what a great many of the interpreting

class wish the nation to believe. I propose to
read as a pendant some remarks of my friend,
the editor of the 'International Review.' With
him the English language is a spiked mace, and
perhaps some of the spikes are too long and
sharp for my liking —
"Triumphant Liberalism has promulgated its creed,
and we trust that the world is edified. For our-
selves, we can only see pathos in colossal travail with
a ridiculus mus as the fruit of it. We have waited
for a sign, and behold ! we are referred to an ancient,
vulgar, and half-effaced street-poster; we ask for
some new thing, and we are given the oldest of pot-
house cries. A contemporary, which claims to be
the exponent of the new gospel, has given us a long
and turgid exposition, in a style adorned by imper-
fectly remembered fragments of the Sermon on the
Mount and the culture of the Mechanics' Institute.
And the result 2. It is our old friend Gladstonianism
with a more pronounced Nonconformist accent. The
prophet of the future, it appears, is that poisonous
politician—we dare not misuse the word 'statesman'
— who, with the morbid conscience and purblind
eyes of the egotist, was ready to sacrifice his country's
honour to a fetich begotten of his own vanity. Eng-
land, it seems, is to put her pride in her pocket and
go whimpering among the nations as an apostle of
peace, bleating about the grievous cost of her army
and navy. The poor are to be elevated by tinkering
expedients of re-housing and pauperised by doles
from the Exchequer, while the law will be so
amended as to give carte-blanche to mob violence.
Education will once more be flung into the hands of

clerics, only the frock-coat will take the place of the
cassock, and the snuffle of Little Bethel will oust the
more scholarly tones of the Church. The prestige of
the Parliamentary "talking-shop," which all thinking
men have long ago come to disregard, is to be revived
and increased. An egregious economy will play
havoc with our revenue system, and the deficit will
be made up by the plunder, not of the rich parvenus,
but of the unfortunate owners of ancestral lands.
Our Empire, won by the blood and sweat of our
great progenitors, and maintained by that class which
alone is worthy of the name of Englishmen—our
Empire, which gives to generous youth its only hor-
izon, is to be lightly cast aside to satisfy the whim-
sies of a few dropsical pedants. Not one constructive
idea emerges from the chaos of absurdities. Not
once do the propagandists dare to look at the facts of
a living world. Let us re-shuffle the cards, they say;
let us pull down a little here and add a little there;
but for God's sake do not tell us that conditions can
change, for we know that our great leader has laid
down once and for all the principles of our English
policy. Let no man lay a finger upon that Ark of
the Covenant l"
Lord Appin looked up from his book. "There
is a great deal more, but that is the gist of my
friend's criticism; and though I deplore its in-
temperance, I am inclined to agree with it.
Liberalism, so far as I can judge, is correctly
described as a shuffling of the cards. One further
quotation I cannot resist. My friend goes on to
show that the Conservative party is equally

barren of ideas, and he gives far from flattering
portraits of some of those leaders—he calls them
'Mandarins'—who have just gone out of office,
and in many cases out of Parliament. "Oh for
one hour,' he exclaims, 'of Randolph Churchill !'
Then he turns to myself:-
"Lord Appin stands in a different position. He is,
at least, untouched by the administrative incompe-
tence of his former colleagues. He may choose to
play the grand seigneur out of office, but once in the
toils of a department he shows an industry as un-
wearied and a mind as acute as any statesman who
has risen by merit alone. But he is cursed with a
fatal temperamental weakness. He is intolerant of
mediocrity, impatient of the pedestrian and the dull,
and his shining gifts of intellect and character are
available only in emergencies. His metaphysical
habit of mind interposes a veil between him and the
will of the people. He will not condescend to join
in the dusty squabbles amid which the political life
must be lived. He will do brilliantly in the field if
he is permitted either to issue orders from a luxur-
ious tent in the rear or to charge some desperate
position at the head of the Maison du Roi. . . . But
he will neither fight in the ranks nor in their imme-
diate vicinity. The result is that he has fallen out
of the battle-line of public life. He might have
ruled England as Disraeli ruled her, but he has
chosen to make elegant speeches and write agreeable
books. He has, definitely and of set purpose, given
up to a coterie what was due to the Empire. He
might have been a second Pitt; he has succeeded in
becoming a second Lord Houghton."

The quotation was received with amusement
by the company, with the exception of Mr Wake-
field, who had listened to it with serious ap-
proval, glad of support for the views he had
aired at the dinner-table.
"I have given you the current interpretation
of Liberalism," Lord Appin continued, "and I
have here a long extract containing the creed
of the new Labour party. I do not propose to
read it to you, for it is very long, and the gist of
it can be put in a few words. It is written by
Ainsworth, and is an excellent piece of work."
The Duchess made a mouth of disgust. "I do
not see how one can attach much value to the
views of a man like Mr Ainsworth. He washes
so seldom and so imperfectly. Oh yes, Flora ! I
know that your mother was foolish enough to
take him up, and that she pretends to admire
and understand him. But I have no patience
with such a course. If the man hates us and
is going to destroy us and all our belongings,
then let us treat him as an enemy and not as a
tame cat."
"But, Aunt Susan," said Lady Flora, "he is
really quite a dear. When he came to stay at
Wirlesdon he wrote his letter of thanks on our
own notepaper, and left it on his dressing-
table."


## p. 62 (#82) ##############################################

62 A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS.
"The gist of Ainsworth's argument," Lord
Appin resumed, in a tone of mild expostulation,
"is more or less what Imperialists say them-
selves. He claims that none of our old creeds
are applicable, because the conditions have
changed, and he asks for a fresh analysis. We
shall, of course, differ from him profoundly as to
the nature of the new conditions and the prin-
ciples which govern their interpretation, but our
general attitude is the same. Provided the
whole Empire is taken as the battle-ground, I
am quite content to see Socialism and Indi-
vidualism fight out their quarrel unhampered.
So there remains for our present consideration
only the wide word 'Conservatism." The elder
Toryism, we shall all agree, is dead. Indeed, I
am far from certain if it ever existed to any large
extent in modern times. I am afraid that it was
in the main, like the doctrine of Innate Ideas, a
fiction of its opponents. It still makes an excel-
lent Aunt Sally to knock down on the hustings,
but a modern Lucian would have to go far afield
to find an honest exponent of it. In the depths
of the country, in vicarages and manor-houses,
one or two very old or very stupid men and a
few innocent women may still hold to it. There
is, however, a Conservatism—I beg Lady Amys-
fort's pardon, a Toryism—which is a more living

creed, or perhaps we had better call it an attitude
of mind. Lady Amysfort is going to be very
kind and read us her confession of faith."
The lady thus appealed to flung away her
cigarette and, lying back in her chair so that
the glow of the lamp was behind her head,
opened a small manuscript.
"I ought to say," she began, "that I wrote
this originally as an address to a meeting of
Primrose Dames. You know the kind of thing—
the local mayoress, the wives of rising trades-
people, and a sprinkling of the female clergy.
But Henry Parworth, who read it, said that it
would break up the Primrose League altogether,
so I had to give them a chapter of 'Sibyl'
instead." She adjusted her head and began to
read in slow, clear accents:–
"Where shall we discover the path of the States-
man?" asked the Stranger in the 'Politicus,' and the
question has often returned to pull up the hasty
politician. We hear much about administrative
reform, the clearing out of this office or that, but
our political charwomen give us no clue to the con-
structive principles of statecraft. We see both
our traditional parties seeking the will-o'-the-wisp
of the moment, making their bow to the Dagon of
to-day and the Baal of to-morrow, till it is hard for
the unprejudiced spectator to detect wherein lies the
difference in the articles of their faith. Yet the
difference exists, we are told by Liberal writers. The

Liberal party is conspicuously the possessor of a
creed, of principles; if they accept a new doctrine it
is because in some occult way it is part of their
historic policy, and if they reject it the reason is
the same. They are the party of a continuous intel-
lectual development, while Conservatives are hand-to-
mouth office-seekers, attendant upon the movements
of the traditional cat.
"It is this current and facile view of Conservatism
which I wish to combat. The old creed of the party
is by universal consent no longer binding. The
Tory country gentleman who believed as his fathers
taught him and held all reform the invention of the
devil is an extinct being, though he may maintain a
shadowy subjective existence in the minds of a few
Liberal journalists. But if this belief be gone, have
we anything to take its place 2 Are our principles
invented in the morning and discarded at the going
down of the sun ? Are our tenets bound up with no
rational philosophy of human society, but merely the
hasty maxims of clever adventurers? Mr Morley, in
his book "On Compromise,' has granted us some
shadow of a creed, but our gratitude is moderated by
the fact that it is not the creed of modern Con-
servatism. Those principles to which he bids us be
true, if we would call ourselves honest men and
women, are so archaic, so tenderly romantic, that not
even Disraeli in his youth could have wholly accepted
them. But unless we are to court the charge of
frivolity, it is necessary to provide some theory of
Conservative statesmanship and the Conservative
attitude. On us lies the burden of definition. The
fact of the Conservative temper in the nation is
beyond cavil: it is for its upholders to show that it
is not unreasonable. If we shrink from a noisy con-

fession of faith, there is all the more need for a
recognition of the meaning of our attitude. We
decline to dogmatise about politics, but we are com-
pelled to dogmatise about our attitude towards them.
We must define our critical standpoint, though we
hazard no further definitions, lest we fall into the old
silliness and erect in our market-places altars to an
Unknown God.
"My first remark concerns the vexed question of
the relation of ethics and politics. Liberalism may be
said to have devoted itself to the special cult of the
political moralist. Now, to my mind, there is a vast
distinction between conscience and conscientiousness,
and that distinction is based upon the calibre of the
accompanying intellect. If a man appeals to his
conscience, I am entitled to inquire if it be the
conscience of a man or the conscientiousness of a
fool. Moral earnestness, if accompanied by intel-
ligence, is worthy of all respect; but, if not so
attended, it is merely a pathological state, like
hysteria or delirium. I find, however, that the
moralist in politics is apt to put a value upon con-
science in itself. He pleads for a kind of finesse in
ethics, a terrible finicking consistency, an abstract
devotion to a very abstract creed. He refuses to
allow the conscience to be ruled and directed by
the mind: intellectual considerations, he says in
effect, have no relevance in this sphere. We main-
tain, on the other hand, that the primary condition
of statesmanship is what Hilda Wangel calls a
"robust conscience.' By this I do not mean an
obtuse mind, and still less a dishonest one. I mean
the temper which allows the sense of right and the
practical intelligence to go hand in hand, never
subserving the former to the latter, but interpreting

the one by the other. It is the temper which looks
at the essentials of virtue and not at its trappings.
"No great country, Horace Walpole wrote, "was
ever saved by its good men, because good men will
not go the lengths that are necessary.'
"Now mark what the word "good' means. This is
no plea for the unscrupulous man who sinks morality
in statecraft. But it is a plea for the statesman who
can sink himself in his people, who is less concerned
with trying to save his soul than with trying to save his
country, who can look at the great issues of life with
eyes undimmed by any metaphysic of morality. It
is a protest against the saint in politics, that worthy,
hypercritical, and useless type of mind which is in-
capable of single-hearted action. 'La petite morale,'
in Mirabeau's words, 'est l'ennemi de la grande.'
When the Emperor Charles the Fifth, as we are told
on good authority, appeared before the Throne of God,
the Devil's Advocate had a long list of burnings, sack-
ings, and slaughterings to bring against him. But
his Guardian Angel argued thus: "This man has
lived a hard life among men, and not in the cloister
or in the desert. He must be judged by fitting
standards, and if on the whole he followed righteous-
ness we must forget his stumblings.' And history
adds that this view was accepted and Charles per-
mitted to enter Paradise.
"The first point, then, in the Conservative attitude
is that it insists upon a robust and practical mind.
The second is that such a mind must think and feel
in accord with the traditions of the national character.
In this character there are certain clearly defined
features. It is a temper naturally conservative, prone
to keep up the form of things, though the spirit has
gone, till they crumble to pieces from sheer age;

slow to think; distrustful of novelties; intolerant of
brilliance—the temper which in the individual spells
mediocrity, but in the mass a kind of greatness.
Against this great rock of English conservatism the
spirits of a Bacon, a Cromwell, a Bolingbroke, a
Canning, a Disraeli, like so many ineffectual angels,
have beaten their wings in vain. But the majority of
them, being wise in their generation, recognised their
barriers and turned their prison-house into a wall of
defence. It is not like the conservatism of the Liberal,
an absorption in a barren dogma; it is the conserva-
tism of a national temperament, and therefore upon
it true statesmanship must build as upon its founda-
tion. Ultimately, as most political thinkers have
urged, the people in a blind, dumb way work out
their own ideas, and these ideas are always right.
There is a cant maxim among Liberal politicians that
the statesman is the servant of democracy. So be it.
But let a statesman serve the people by penetrating
to their real interests and their real desires, and not
by obeying any casual knot of agitators who clamour
that their unintelligible patois is the voice of God.
"The third item in our definition is that Conserva-
tive statesmanship must be positive. When the great
wave of reaction produced by the French Revolution
had subsided, the era of Industrialism set in. New
inventions lessened the cost of production. Manu-
facturers and mine-owners saw wealth, colossal
wealth, in the near future. But there was the
labouring class to be considered, a class to some
extent tainted with the French restlessness, demand-
ing better pay, shorter hours, happier conditions of
life. It was a unique chance for a constructive
statesman, but Canning died and the Manchester
school succeeded. With a creed made up of a few

tags from dissenting ethics and a few dubious
economic maxims, this school was in the main com-
posed of capitalists and employers of labour. To
secure a free development for the new industrialism
was their aim, but in the meantime sops must be
thrown to the Cerberus of the proletariat. So they
passed the Reform Bill of 1832, that harmless excur-
sion in academic reform, and they repealed the Corn
Laws, which put money in their pockets, silenced for
a moment the cries of labour, and effectually ruined
agricultural England. Against Chartism, which was
a crude but genuine scheme of reform, they fought
with tooth and nail! Reform for reform's sake, pro-
vided it be not radical, change for change's sake, pro-
vided it be unnecessary—such has been the lofty
tradition of this vicious and destructive theorising.
And thus the so-called Radicalism has advanced, pro-
fessing a high ethical purpose, pandering to every fad
of every clique of agitators, taking in vain the sacred
name of Progress. And Conservatism It, too, has
forgotten at times that doctrine of positiveness which
Canning taught, but throughout its moments of error
and forgetfulness it has never quite lost sight of its
ideal. As the party which professes no abstract
creed, but bases its duty upon a knowledge of
national character and a conception of practical
good, it has maintained that reform when it comes
must be real, and that a trifling with change for its
own sake is the last and fatalest heresy.
"In "positiveness' then the true raison d'étre of
Conservatism is to be found. But, indeed, I object
to the word Conservative. I should prefer to call
myself a Tory. The former word implies that the
centre of gravity lies in a dull conserving of institu-
tions and creeds which may have outgrown their

usefulness. "Tory," I am told, meant in the be-
ginning an Irish robber, and the attitude of the Irish
robber in life seems to me preferable to that of the
hide-bound formalist who worships a Church and
State which are no more than names to him. Toryism
is not the path of least resistance, but a living and
militant creed, offering tangible results and based
upon the vital needs of the nation. I have read
many 'Pleas for Unprincipled Toryism,' which were
attempts to defend our supposed lack of a theoretical
basis. But we have no need of such a defence. We
have our basis, we have our principles, and they
are none the less principles because we are not so
arrogant as to confuse them with the laws of Sinai.
"One word in conclusion. It seems to me that
there is another duty incumbent upon the Tory party,
which is perhaps of all its tasks the most arduous and
the most vital. In our modern world we have seen
inaugurated the reign of a dull bourgeois rational-
ism, which finds some inadequate reason for all
things in heaven and earth and makes a god of
its own infallibility. Old simple faiths have been
discredited, a spirit of minor criticism has gone
abroad, and the beliefs of centuries are now in a
state of solution. It is not a promising mood.
'Provincial arrogance and precipitate self-complac-
ency' are not the stuff of which a strong nation is
made. National prejudices, deep inborn convictions
for which no copy-book justifications can be found,
are after all the conquering forces of the world.
The French Revolution destroyed the cult of Church
and King; but it inspired an equally blind and
passionate worship of certain civic ideals, and with
these in their soul the raw levies of France conquered
Europe. To the Tory the instincts of the people

must always seem truer in the long-run than the
little-reasoned disquisitions of a few professors. To
the Liberal this is heresy; he demands a creed which
shall approve itself to his superb intellect, for
Liberalism is essentially the faith of the intellectuel.
Against such an attitude it is the duty and the
highest privilege of Tory statesmanship to wage im-
placable war. It may take many forms—attacks
upon institutions which still fulfil their purpose
though in a narrow way their basis may seem ir-
rational, dogmas in economics and theories of reform
which have only a speculative validity, a system of
ethics made in the study or the lecture-room. I
know of few finer words in literature than those in
which Burke swept away the sophistries which
sought to abolish patriotism and defend certain vague
cosmopolitan rights of man, or those in which
Disraeli in the theatre at Oxford in '64 scourged
the money-changers of popular science. And so in
our analysis of Conservatism we come back to some-
thing which is not unlike the beliefs of our grand-
fathers. Conservatism in their view was sworn to
defend Church and Throne, in our view it is
sworn to defend the things which lie at the back of
Church and Throne, the instincts of a people, the
character of a nation. It is conservative, this atti-
tude, but it is also reforming. A people develops
unconsciously, and this development is on far other
lines than the progress of Liberal illuminati. It is
its duty to foster this popular development as against
the vagaries of a clique or a caucus. It is its duty
to conserve, while there is reason, and to destroy
ruthlessly and finally when the justification has
passed. And it has a right to this attitude, for it
bases its conduct upon the 'instant need of things'

and upon no a priori creed. Its opponents, fixing
their eyes upon falling stars, have no leisure to study
the ground they walk on. Mistaking their own
clientèle for the nation and themselves for Omni-
potence, they wander like children in the dark, and
instead of the narrow path to the Celestial City
follow the primrose path to that sinister personage
who, as a great authority has told us, was the first
Whig."
Lady Amysfort's cool accents had scarcely
ceased before Mr Wakefield, who had listened
with some attention, said loudly, "My dear
lady, there is a great deal of sound sense in
that and a great deal of nonsense. I detest
your obscurantism, but on the main point I en-
tirely agree with you. We must be positive
and practical in our work, and the metaphysician
is every bit as bad as the Liberal doctrinaire."
The Duchess had had her temper considerably
ruffled by the matter, and still more by the
manner of Lady Amysfort's discourse. She had
an intense dislike of the Primrose League, and a
suspicion of Disraeli, who had once said of her
husband that his air suggested an "inspired
rabbit." Looking round the circle she saw no
one disposed to take up the cudgels for her
much-abused party, and Lady Amysfort's atti-
tude, as, slim and exquisite, she leaned over a
lamp to light a cigarette, annoyed her by its

suggestion of the supercilious. She therefore
fixed her opponent with an austere eye, and ad-
vanced to the attack.
"There is much that I could say, Caroline,"
she began, "but I will confine myself to one
point which is common to you and the writer
of Bob's second extract. You both maintain
that we Liberals are hag-ridden by formulas,
and declare that the Conservatives are the only
people who can look squarely at facts. To begin
with, I think that you very much overstate your
case. Heaven is my witness that I do not love
the style of the Radical press. I detest its loud-
mouthed generalities, and I think the way it
drags the most sacred words of Scripture into
its arguments simply blasphemous. It re-
sorts so consistently to immense appeals on
trivial occasions, that when the great occasion
arises it has nothing further to say. But in
spite of all this folly you cannot maintain that
you can do without dogma altogether, or that
the dogmatism of the two factions differs other-
wise than in degree. Take again this question
of facing facts. I think the Liberal point is a
perfectly good one. Things have gone hideously
wrong under a Conservative Government, simply
because it did not look at facts. We may
choose—foolishly, I think—to cloak our return

to common-sense in Nonconformist language, but
what we really mean is that our opponents did
not understand their data, and we are going to
try to understand them. We are not really
quarrelling about principles but about facts,
and it is only a bad debating trick to pretend
otherwise. I do not say that we shall read the
facts correctly, any more than you did, but our
sole justification is that we intend to try. When
you maintain that the Conservatives look at
facts, and the Liberal clings to principles, all
you mean is that the different sides have dif-
ferent arts for capturing the popular fancy. We
are apt to claim a monopoly of the purer virtues,
you of practical common-sense; but we both aim
at common-sense, though my side invests it with
the glamour of high principles, yours with the
charm of an historic past. I honestly think that
is the fairest way to look at our political records.
I quite agree with you that the difference at
bottom is one of temperament. I have heard
Bob's voice shake with emotion when he spoke
of Chatham, and I have seen tears in Mr Calder-
wood's eyes when he spoke of Eternal Justice.
I will confess that I would rather have politi-
cians pat a little history book familiarly than
the New Testament, but both are legitimate
forms of appeal. Our faiths spring from the

same source. You think us foolish; we think
you stupid ; while the truth is that we are both
rather foolish, rather stupid, and in the last
resort rather wise."
The Duchess's remarks met with the strong
approbation of Lord Launceston, who had been
crossing and uncrossing his long legs nervously
while Lady Amysfort read.
"I think what you say is most true," he said.
"All parties have a common basis now. They
preach the same faith though in different accents.
And all parties tend simply to shuffle the old
cards at any crisis, instead of making a new
analysis of the facts. It is the business of clear-
eyed people to prevent this natural inclination.
Our common basis I should call democracy—
English democracy, that is, with all its histori-
cal and racial colouring. It is not a dogma,
but a fact, or rather the recognition of a fact—
that under modern conditions Everyman governs.
Now democracy is the great destroyer of shams.
It clears out the rubbish and leaves the truth
tolerably plain to the single-minded inquirer.
Besides, it opens up the way for superiority. I
do not say that it means always an enlightened
rule, but it gives scope at any rate for the true
enlightener when he arrives. It is the best,
indeed the only, basis for building anew on.

And here, curiously enough, it reaches the same
result as Toryism. It used to be the old boast
of the Tory party that it was loyal, and would
always render faithful service to any leader
who could capture it. The Liberal party, it was
said, was too individualistic, too split up by the
differences which come from honest but incom-
plete thinking independently, ever to make a
good following. Democracy does the work of
Toryism on a wider basis. The people have no
intellectual arrogance. They think slowly, not
very clearly, and always on broad and simple
lines, but when they once grasp a conception
they are invincible."
"We are agreed, then, on one important
point," Carey took up the conversation. "Both
of our great parties purport to look at facts, but
both tend to get into conventional grooves and
neglect their duty. However, in the democracy
which lies behind them both, there is a per-
manent instinct under proper guidance to revise
the data of policy. And here I may anticipate
what I think Lord Appin intends to say. The
new Labour party, which claims to be specially
in touch with democracy, urges as its chief
raison d'être the duty of revision. We may
differ from them on what constitutes the data,
we may differ still more profoundly on the in-

terpretation, but our general attitude is exactly
theirs."
"I have always maintained," said Lord Appin,
"that they were our natural allies. I opened
a review the other day and found an article on
their programme by one of their leaders. He
advocated a mission of labour delegates to the
Colonies in order to confer with the Labour
parties there and arrange a common programme.
I confess that the proposal, crude as it was,
cheered me greatly, as showing some kind of
sense of imperial solidarity."
"So, if the hooligans of Mile End sent a
deputation to consult with the larrikins of
Sydney and the toughs of Montreal, you would
call that an effort in the cause of imperial
unity ?"
Mr Wakefield spoke with an asperity which
for the moment left the company silent. The
tension was relieved by Lady Flora, who, with
an innocence not destitute of tact, inquired if a
larrikin was the same as a bush parrot, since a
pair had just been sent her. Upon which, with
a paternal gravity and some humour, Mr Wake-
field proceeded to explain to her in an undertone
the exact distinction.
"My point is very simple," Lord Appin con-
tinued. "Even a class policy, which recognises

that success can only be won on the stage of the
whole Empire, has a certain statesmanship in it.
For it recognises one cardinal truth, the enlarged
basis of our problems."
"Now, Hugh," said Carey, "you shall have
that definition of Imperialism for which your
soul yearns. It is simply looking at all the
facts instead of at only a few of them. We
begin by realising that we are not an island
but an empire, and therefore, in considering
any great question, we take the whole data into
account. Imperialism, if we regard it properly,
is not a creed or a principle, but an attitude of
mind."
Lady Flora caught the last words in the midst
of her lecture on bush parrots. "That is exactly
what Cousin Charlie said when Uncle George
found him at Monte Carlo when he should have
been at his Embassy. Uncle George said it was
a disgrace that he should be seen in such a place,
and Charlie said it wasn't a place but an attitude
of mind."
"We are all Imperialists at heart nowadays,"
Carey went on, "except Lady Flora, who is a
wicked girl. Every party is more or less resigned
to the fact of empire. Some kick a little against
the pricks, some are half-hearted, others burn
with zeal; but all have the same conviction

that it is inevitable. We have not begun yet to
work out the details seriously, but we have won
the first position. And that is as it should be.
The Empire must be accepted, like the Monarchy,
as a presupposition in politics which is beyond
question. Any inclination to use it for party
ends should be as jealously condemned as the
occasional attempts to drag the King's name
into current controversies or to assume that
patriotism is the monopoly of one side. We
shall, of course, always differ on particular ques-
tions, but there should be no difference on the
ideal. Indeed, I honestly think that there is
little among ordinary sane-minded people. The
average man may be described as a confused
Imperialist. He wants to make the best of the
heritage bequeathed to him; his imagination fires
at its possibilities; but he is still very ignorant
and shy, and he has no idea how to set about the
work. The first of imperial duties is to instruct
him."
"And yet," said Mr Astbury, "I find many
people openly contemptuous of the ideal. I dare-
say this contempt is due to imperfect understand-
ing, but we have to face the fact that many
are not only apathetic about the things we care
most for, but actively hostile."

Lord Appin reopened his scrap-book. "True
enough. We have some honest opponents, and
a few indifferently so, and I have been at the
pains to collect their opinions. I think I can dis-
tinguish several types. There is, first of all, Mr
Luke Simeon, who surrendered his fellowship at
King's to "labour,' as he says, among the masses.
He is eminent at Browning halls and university
settlements, and has done much, I believe, to
civilise the East End by the distribution of
indistinct reproductions of Giotto and Botticelli.
He is a pale, earnest, well-meaning, and rather
silly young man, who should have remained in
the church of his clerical forefathers. He attacks
Imperialism as the 'worship of force.' It repre-
sents, he says, that tendency of a decadent age
which may be observed in the Roman ladies who
took their lovers from the prize-ring. Up to a
point I agree with him. The worship of brute
force, of mere conscienceless power, is the most
certain sign of degeneration. His fallacy is that
he really condemns force altogether, whether
exercised for a beneficent purpose or not, and
he hides his bias under the assumption that
Imperialism means power without ideals or con-
science. He has a temperamental shrinking
from certain of the hard realities of life, and

he flatters his weakness by investing it with a
moral halo. He lives in a little world of artistic
and literary trifling, and he has consequently no
perspective, so that he will quote you a bad
artist on some point of foreign policy and a minor
poet on some problem of economics. His shallow
aesthetic soul is revolted by three-fourths of life,
so he dubs it evil and rejects it. He is not a
young man whom it is worth taking pains to
convert, but his stuff has its vogue, and he has
disciples. We have but to expound the moral
purpose in our creed to take the logical ground
from beneath his feet, for, though he desires it
in his heart, he is not prepared for an absolute
condemnation of power. Then we have our
Benthamite friend, Mr Wrigley of Manchester,
who is one of the few remaining exponents of
the old Radicalism of the 'forties. War is his
special dislike, and commerce his idol. He is
averse to empire partly because his mind is full
of Rome and Carthage and he has not the imag-
ination to conceive a new model, partly because
it gives scope for energies which are only by
accident utilitarian. His ideal State would be
a community of Samuel Budgetts and Worldly
Wisemans. The answer to him and his kind is
that their doctrine is built on a false conception
of human nature, and that in tranquillising life

they would denude it of all that makes it worth
having.
'Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori,
Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas."
For good or for ill humanity has long since decided
against him. Next, there is the school of which
we may take Mr Chatterton as a represent-
ative. In theory they are full-blooded and
masculine enough, though their heroics smack of
Peckham. They love to rhapsodise about 'Old
England' and the Elizabethans, and beer and
cricket, and heaven knows what. Their com-
plaint is that a spacial extension means a weak-
ening in intensity of the national life, and they
also will throw Rome and Athens at your head.
They are all for the virility of England, they say,
as against the neurotic restlessness of the Im-
perialist. With them, again, I have a certain
sympathy, though the taunt of "neurotic' comes
ill from gentlemen whose style is so explosive
and delirious. The answer to their arguments
depends upon the question of the value of space
and of the whole material basis in any spiritual
development, and in deference to Mr Wakefield
we will leave that over till a later day. Lastly

comes an honest fellow for whom I have a great
regard. You all know Ambrose by name. He
lives on twopence a-day and slaves at his phil-
anthropy. He objects to empire because im-
perial questions distract the attention of the
nation from urgent matters of home reform.
And he is perfectly right. As long as we make
'national' and "imperial' water-tight compart-
ments, there must be this jealousy. What we
have to show him is that the whole is one great
problem, and that his own interests cannot be
realised save by the help of the other interests
which he despises. And then he will be on our
side, for at heart he is one of us."
"You have omitted," said Mrs Wilbraham,
"the greatest source of opposition—the folly of
some of our own people. Why is it that many
of us—myself for one—grow nervous when the
word 'Empire' is mentioned, and get hot all
over ? Human nature is so hopelessly silly. A
dear creature, whom most of us know, started a
league last year to ensure that women throughout
the Empire should be reading Shakespeare at the
same time every evening. 'How sweet," she said,
'to think that every night at half-past nine the
whole English-speaking world would be repeating
immortal words,' and she was very angry with
me for saying that the English-speaking world

would be much better employed dining. And
then, what is to be said about our poetry? I
had a collection of imperial songs from the works
of popular poets sent me this summer. One had
the chorus, "We can all do our little bit for Eng-
land.' Another was an invocation to empire—
'Empire, the very thought of thee!' And, worst
of all, there is Sir Herbert Jupp. You know how
ambitious he is to be a great orator, so he has
had many elocution lessons, and he speaks when-
ever he is invited. It is the most dreadful stuff,
and he winds up always with a tag from some
bad poet, which is enough to make one cry. One
could believe that he was hired by our opponents
to make our case ridiculous. I almost think that,
more than any other party, we suffer from a
defective sense of humour."
"Tut, tut," said Mr Wakefield, heaving himself
from his chair and straddling into the firelight.
"It will never do to be hypercritical. It is only
a dying cause which can attain to perfect taste.
A living creed is sure to have its extravagances
and its crudities, but it can afford to be absurd.
After all, we must have our subalterns as well
as our marshals, our Garibaldis as well as our
Cavours and Mazzinis. The more silliness in
Imperialism the better, say I? It shows that it
is getting on terms with human nature, which is

deplorably silly. Of course our poetry is bad, of
course our rhetoric is tawdry, of course we show
no sense of the ridiculous! And the reason is
simply that we are in earnest. If we once be-
come self-conscious, then we may as well shut up
shop and pull down the sign. . . . Carey, my

CHAPTER IV.
HUGH had found a comfortable chair in the lee of
an acacia thicket, whence he looked over a stretch
of low bracken to the lawn which swept from the
house along the edge of the escarpment to the
home woods. The sunshine lay warm around
him, but the clear air had none of the sultriness
of noon. Rather it burned like some dry ether,
with an aromatic freshness in its heat. In
accordance with his good resolutions he was re-
newing his acquaintance with the classics, and
was reading aloud to himself the exquisite
cadences of Theocritus's Seventh Idyll.
"I am the foul fiend, Flibbertigibbet !" said a
voice at his elbow, and Lady Flora, with an arm-
ful of books, sank upon the mossy turf beside
him. "No | Stay where you are. I want to
sit here. Poor Mr Somerville, I've come to dis-
turb you again. But it is our compact, you
know. What have you been reading 2"
"Greek," said Hugh, holding out his book.

"Poetry ! Well, so have I—all the morning.
We played such a good game, which Charlotte
Wilbraham invented—making comic imperial
poetry. It is quite easy. You simply get all the
names of places you can think of and string them
together, and then put at the end something
about the Flag or the Crown or the Old Land.
Mr Wakefield was rather cross at first, but he
was soon pacified, and he played very well. I
thought the first night he was a dreadful old thing,
but he is really very kind, and quite amusing."
"I want to hear your poem," said Hugh.
"Oh, I couldn't write any—at least nothing fit
to read aloud. I'm too stupid for clever games.
But I carried off Marjory's, in spite of her pro-
tests." The girl took a paper from between the
leaves of a book and read the following verses:–
"'Rests not the wild-deer in the park,
The wild-fowl in the pen,
Nor nests the heaven-aspiring lark
Where throng the prints of men.
He who the King's Path once hath trod
Stays not in slumbrous isle,
But seeks, where blow the winds of God,
His lordly domicile.
Where 'neath the red-rimmed Arctic sun
The ice-bound whaler frets,
Where in the morn the salmon run
Far-shining to the nets;

Where young republics pitch their tents
Beside the Western wave,
And set their transient Presidents
As targets for the brave;
Where through th' illimitable plains
Nigerian currents flow,
And many a wily savage brains
His unsuspecting foe;
Where gleam the lights of shrine and joss,
From some far isle of blue,
Where screams beneath the Southern Cross
The lonely cockatoo;
(The last word may be 'caribou.' Marjory
wasn't sure whether a caribou or a cockatoo
was likely to scream most.)
Where in the starlit Eastern night

There, o'er the broad and goodly earth,
Go seek th' imperial soul.
Broken the barriers of his birth,
Th' eternal heavens his goal.
In wind or wet, in drink or debt,
Steeled heart no fate can stir,
He is the Render of the Net,
Th' Immortal Wanderer.'"

"It is long," said Lady Flora, when she had
finished, "but, like the White Knight's poem, it
is very, very beautiful. Charlotte said it had
the true ring of colonial poetry. Do you know,
Mr Somerville, of all the discussion last night
I scarcely remember anything except that Im-
perialism has nothing to do with being a Liberal
or a Conservative, and that it means we must
begin all over again. Also I remember that it is
not a creed, but an attitude of mind. I thought
a good deal about that when I was having my
hair brushed this morning. Somebody once told
me that according to philosophers everything is
only an attitude of mind—you and I and the
sun and Musuru and the butterfly over there. Is
that true !"
"Of course," said Hugh. "We are all creatures
of the Red King's dream, but till he wakens up
we pretend we are real."
"I wish," said the girl pensively,–"I wish I
could believe that Aunt Susan was only an atti-
tude of mind. She has arranged a picnic for this
afternoon, and I did so want to go for a gallop
over the moor we passed through the first day.
Don't you think, Mr Somerville, we could slip
away by ourselves? You've been here before
and know the country, so we shouldn't lose
our way. I've been round the stables, and

there is a little white Arab I have set my
heart on."
It was impossible to refuse a request that so
chimed with his own wishes, and Hugh readily
consented. At luncheon their path was made
easy, for the Duchess had a headache and did
not appear. Accordingly about three o'clock
they found themselves cantering up a grassy
ride among the woods, scaring the small buck
and the bush pheasants, the white Arab buck-
ing furiously, and Hugh's sedate Africander pony
shying at every rustle in the trees.
At the end of the wood a great swell of down-
land lay before them. They gave the ponies their
heads against the slope, and settled down for a
long gallop. Soon the heat of the day had gone.
A wind of their own creation sang in their ears,
the scents of the moor, distilled by suns and
dews, rose in waves to greet them, the horizon
disappeared, and they saw only the misty fleeting
of the ground beneath them. The ponies knew
their country and never stumbled. Jumping
little streams, plunging through tufts of fern,
and scrambling cat-like among broken rocks,
they never lost the same easy delicate motion.
It was pure ecstasy, the very essence of physical
well-being, and when after some two miles they
stopped with lathered mounts and scarlet faces

on the top of a long ridge of hill, they looked
into each other's eyes in frank and cheerful
comradeship.
Hugh jumped from the saddle and helped
Lady Flora to dismount. "Let us sit down,"
he said, "and look at the view. We are on
the backbone of the plateau. Musuru is 200
feet below us; and look there is the lake quite
clear."
He pointed where far to the west and deep
down in the great trough shone a gleam of
water.
The girl, still panting, looked where she was
bidden and then closed her eyes.
"It is pure paradise," she said. "What have
we done to deserve it ! I have to pinch myself
to remember we are not galloping on some Sussex
down. What lies to the north 2"
"Some hundreds of miles of unknown bush and
then the foothills of Abyssinia."
"East I know. West there are the great lakes
and the Mountains of the Moon and the Congo
forest, I suppose. And south ?"
"The plateau runs down for some hundreds of
miles to German territory, and then you get into
Nyasaland and the Shiré Highlands, and in the
end you come to the Zambesi."
"My imagination faints. Please, don't tell

me any more. And we are here as pioneers,
except for the Musuru colony. Savagery is on
every side, and yet in half an hour's ride I can
get back to my maid and a French chef and the
latest English novel. It is too much, Mr Somer-
ville; I am not worthy of it all."
They were sitting near the edge of one of the
native tracks which intersect the moor. As Lady
Flora spoke a party of natives on trek came
along, blankets on shoulder, the men carrying
spears and shields, and the women with babies
slung on their backs. They saluted by raising
their hands high above their heads, and Hugh
acknowledged the greeting.
"They look like some of the northern tribes
who have been down at the railway selling cattle.
Their home is probably near Rudolf. There, if
you like, is the romance of Empire. Here is a
young lady in a blue habit riding after luncheon
and exchanging courtesies with aborigines from
the heart of Africa."
The girl rose to her feet and disentangled her
reins. "Let us go on, please," she said. "I feel
so full of life and adventure that I cannot sit
still. Where shall we go? Let us visit Prester
John and demand tea. I'm sure Melissinde must
be charming, and I'm dying to make her acquaint-
ance. Or shall we try Soria Moria Castle in the

this afternoon. The names of the places are like
tunes—Musuru, Ruwenzori !"
"What about the imperial poetry you parodied
this morning 2"
"I recant, please, at once and for ever. The
worst geographical verses are full of poetry, and
I shall spend the rest of my life writing them.
The ponies are rested, and we can have another
gallop along the ridge."
A couple of miles off was a small kopje crowned
with a few trees. To this they raced, and the
girl was an easy victor. For, coming suddenly
upon a narrow rocky watercourse, she took it
flying, while Hugh's more sober pony insisted
on scrambling down and up the banks. At the
kopje the plateau was cut into by a long glen
running up from the west, and they looked down
from their eminence on steep bush-clad sides end-
ing below in a dark evergreen forest. A soft
purple haze hung over the depths, and from far
down came the music of a waterfall.
For a little Lady Flora was silent with delight.
She made a charming picture as she reined up
her Arab on the edge of the slope, the sunlight
in her hair, while with one hand she shaded her
eyes and looked out to the horizon.
"I never realised before what space meant.

Of course I have been up mountains, and I once
camped in the desert for a week, and I've been
several times on the high seas, but I seemed
always to carry my own atmosphere with me.
But here everything indoors and commonplace

suppose I am the first woman who has ever been
here, and I feel as if the place had been created
for me and had been waiting for me since the
beginning of time. What an egoist I am "
On these uplands in mid-winter the dark comes
swiftly, and already the sun was going down
behind the far hills in a riot of crimson and
amethyst. The heat had gone, and a chilly
freshness was creeping into the air.
"We must be making for home," said Hugh.
"Let us canter back gently, for an East African
twilight is not a thing to hurry through. So
you are getting the sense of space into your
blood | Well, that is Imperialism, you know,
or at least the foundations of it. We all get
stuffy sitting tight in our old creeds. We live,
most of us, in gardens which are very pleasant
and well-watered, but sleepy and not over-
wholesome. And we grow old and stale before
our time—the old age of decay, not the honest
old age of being worn down with the friction of
life."

"But how hard it is for a woman to avoid it !
Men have such a wide world compared with ours.
Our business is only to adapt ourselves to things
as they are. Men can mould them as they please,
and if they find the shades of the prison-house
closing on them, they can put their packs on
their shoulders and shake the dust of civilisation
off their feet. How I envy you all!"
"That is one way, but not the best way. A
man can always run off, but the best of them
won't. Their business is to try and shape things
according to a better plan. Our lives are like a
lot of separate circles scattered about in space.
Sometimes they are cut by others and then we
have friends, and talk of this man or woman
'coming into our lives.' I have heard you use
that phrase at least a dozen times since I came
here. Now and then one circle largely overlaps
another, and then people are in love. Once in a
blue moon, perhaps, two circles almost coincide.
And then you have what is commonly known as a
happy marriage. But the circles always remain
the same size, so for restless souls love and mar-
riage and even friendship are no solution, as you
very wisely observed yesterday. And it is no
remedy to remove the circle from London to Poly-
nesia or the Klondyke, for you do not make it
any bigger by changing its site. The only thing

to do is to draw a larger circle with a wider
radius. Only," said Hugh sadly, "those who do
that often fail to complete it, and leave only a
broken arc to show how vast their design was."
"I like that metaphor," said the girl musingly.
"Of course it is quite true that you do not get
any nearer satisfaction by shifting your dwelling.
But how hard it is for us to stretch the com-
passes and describe a wider circle."
"It is getting easier every day. Our great-
aunts had a code of rules laid down for them
which nothing could break through. They left
the schoolroom for a year or two of sentiment
and gaiety, and then married and became good
housewives; or perhaps they didn't, and steered
a precarious course on the high seas of scandal.
Our grandfathers thought that the only choice
lay between Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp.
They had not discovered Diana Warwick."
The sun had gone down, and a soft mulberry
afterglow filled the western heavens. The ponies
stepped sedately over the rough veld, till the
woods rose black in the twilight, and they entered
the long ride which led to the house.
"I think," said Lady Flora, "that our circles
are being widened for us. I know that in the
last three days mine has expanded so far that
London is only a little patch in a corner. I

suppose you would say that we women are citizens
now and not shepherdesses in porcelain."
"Yes, that is a part of the truth. I was in
Paris at Whitsuntide, and went to see Père
Antoine. He is very old and blind, but he talks
wonderfully, and his mind gets clearer with age.
He said that the chief fact of the modern world
is that humanity is drawing closer together.
The State is taking the place of the old
Church, and politics are acquiring a new mean-
ing. Classes and ranks are being broken down,
and men are beginning to find not only their
duty but their happiness in community. They
feel and think corporately, and not as atoms.
It is something like this which the whole string
of 'isms from Comtism to Marxism has been trying
to expound. A political creed was once a list of
dogmas which meant nothing to the ordinary
man or woman. Now every creed—ours as well
as others—must spread its roots into all the in-
terests and affections and aspirations of our life.
Another saying of his impressed me a good deal.
He declared that the worst modern vice was
'spirituality,' and that the most crying need was
that the world should awake to the value of its
great temporal heritage—'nótre grand heritage
temporel !' That means much from a man who
all his life has preached a mystical religion."

The hall-door appeared before them with a glow
of firelight shining into the chilly night. A groom
led away the ponies, and soon the riders were
warming cold hands at the hearth.
Lady Flora called Heaven to witness her enjoy-
ment of the afternoon. "And how serious we
grew I suppose it was the twilight, which
always makes me sad and sentimental. After
tea let us go and find Colonel Alastair and Sir
Edward, and play games on the billiard-table. I
think we both want a bear-fight to bring us out
of the clouds."
The library at Musuru was a long room, panelled
in some dark sweet-smelling wood, with the book-
cases sunk in the walls. As with Gibbon's Em-
peror Gordian, so with Carey: sixty-two thousand
volumes attested the variety of his inclinations.
It was a working-room, as the maps and papers
piled on the desks bore witness, and its strenuous
air was increased by the absence of any ornaments
or pictures. But it was also a pleasant place for
talk, for the shaded light gleamed cheerfully on
vellum and morocco, and the low chairs round the
great fireplace invited to comfort and conversa-
tion. The Duchess's headache continued, and her
niece had gone to sit with her. The rest of the
party disposed themselves about the hearth in a

circle, while their host stood as usual planted
squarely on the hearthrug.
"Our conclusion last night," Lord Appin be-
gan, "was that Imperialism cut across parties
and demanded a revision of all traditional dogmas
in face of a new body of fact. This, of course,
does not mean any breach in our historical
continuity. We have a vast deal to learn from
all the traditional creeds; only they must be
re-thought, as it were, and presented in a new
system and a new language. This process, we
also agreed, involved a change in our attitude
of mind—indeed this change, if I remember
aright, we defined as the essence of Imperialism.
Instead of being negative, temporising, and un-
scientific, we must show ourselves positive and
constructive. We have now to work out some of
the details of our creed, so far as they are clear,
and like philosophers we begin with the widest
category. Our host commands us to-night
to consider the question of the constitutional
apparatus, the machinery of imperial union."
Lord Appin, as if aware of the gravity of the
undertaking, selected a large cigar from his case
and carefully lit it.
"First let us repeat all the platitudes," he
continued, "and get done with them. The
pivot of the Empire is the Crown. In the last

resort all our units, colonies and dependencies
alike, submit to the sovereign executive power.
We have also, roughly speaking, one law, for
though I believe — Mr Wakefield will correct
me if I am wrong—that at least five great
legal systems and many smaller codes exist
within the Empire, yet we have one ultimate
tribunal of appeal, and therefore some continuity
of interpretation. As I remember once hearing
Mr Wakefield say, 'To have the power of con-
struing colonial laws and customs is to have
the power to guide and restrain, to have, in
effect, control of development.' Now these two
common possessions are a stupendous machinery
of union, if properly directed. The trouble is
the modes in which the sovereign authority is
exercised. Its functions have been in practice
delegated to the British Cabinet, and there-
fore, indirectly, to the British Parliament. Now
clearly such Cabinet and Parliament must have
two aspects—a national one, for the British Isles,
and an imperial one, in which they control the
Empire. But with the grant of self-govern-
ment to so many colonies there can be no
direct control, and so the doctrine of trustee-
ship has been brought into being. I think it
historically correct, and it has the further merit
of exactly covering the existing practice. A

government rules England and the dependencies
directly, but as regards the autonomous colonies
it acts as a trustee for their welfare—that is
to say, it provides for their defence, and re-
serves the right in the last resort to veto any
of their legislative acts which it thinks danger-
ous to the Empire as a whole. This might be
a perfectly satisfactory arrangement if our
Cabinets or Parliaments were not human, and
the magnitude and number of imperial questions
were not beyond their power. A Parliament
confronted with a great quantity of local prob-
lems can only give a perfunctory attention to
most imperial matters, and in any case cannot
hope to make itself sufficiently well informed
on them to give its decisions much weight.
Hence we get dissatisfaction on both sides. A
Canadian who attends the debates in the House
of Commons may wait for days before one im-
perial consideration emerges, and may see the
Government which controls his destinies turned
out of office on some business of English edu-
cation. And the Englishman may justly com-
plain that his own affairs are scamped because
the men who were elected to look after them
have to give their time to some Indian frontier
question. The Home reformer and the Im-
perialist alike tend to grumble against a

doctrine which seems to impose upon certain
old-fashioned machinery a task too heavy for
its performance. Have I stated the difficulty
correctly, Mr Wakefield 7"
The gentleman appealed to nodded his ap-
proval, and Lord Appin continued—
"We have to try and find some way out of
the difficulty. I shall leave that to others who
have made the subject their own. But I have
one word of caution to give. Before dinner I
looked into Bismarck's Memoirs, and I was
much struck by certain sayings of his which
Busch reports. He had to face the problem of
finding some constitutional machinery for the
new German Empire. There were plenty of
legalists around him to prepare formally perfect
schemes. But Bismarck most wisely counselled
patience. 'Let us take, he said, 'what we can
get, what the States are freely willing to give
us. As long as we have the impulse to unity
in the soul of our people, almost any scheme
will work. But if we once begin to squabble
about details and impose a cast-iron constitu-
tion no scheme on earth will work. We can-
not coerce the national life into narrow channels,
but if we foster that life it will make in time
the proper channels for itself!' There, to my
mind, spoke the true creative statesman."

Lord Launceston, whom the company seemed
to expect to take up the tale, straightened
himself from the depths of a long chair, where
he had been studying the fire, and looked de-
precatingly towards the last speaker.
"Are we not rather putting the cart before
the horse?" he inquired mildly. "Yesterday we
agreed upon the meaning of our attitude—a
frank recognition of new conditions. But that
is merely a formal definition, and we want to
know the nature of the spiritual change and
the new principles which are born from it.
And now you suddenly ask me to consider a
piece of practical detail, and minute detail at
that—the kind of constitution we propose for
our State. Is not that a little premature?"
"There are two reasons for the arrangement,"
said Carey. "One is that it seems wise to
sketch the ground-plan of our new republic
tentatively, since that is only another way of
looking at the data which must be our basis.
When we see what we have to work with, we
can go on to deal with principles. The second
is that Wakefield is so notoriously intolerant of
metaphysics, or anything approaching them, that
we thought it wise to go gently with him and
burn a little incense before his shrine in the
shape of practical details."

Lord Launceston acquiesced, and continued—
"I have had the ideal of federation before me
ever since I began to be interested in politics,
and I suppose I have read of or discussed almost
every scheme that has been propounded. I own
I am not very enthusiastic about any. They all
begin with what Bismarck reprobated, asking
too much. The chief—the scheme of legislative
federation—need not detain us. Its principle is
home rule for each unit and a central imperial
legislature to govern and make laws for the
Empire. It is an ideal fit enough for a small
and compact empire, but to one so immense and
scattered as ours, it is for the present, at any
rate, wholly inapplicable. I do not dogmatise
on what the future may bring forth. Distances
have shrunk since our great-grandfathers' time,
and we are nearer to Toronto and Cape Town
than they were to Rome, but the difficulties of
space and time are as yet insurmountable. I
have other objections to legislative federation
besides its impracticability. I question if it is
the most suitable ideal for an empire which
contains on the one hand self-governing colonies,
and on the other dependencies where autonomy
is eternally impossible. The Tropics will always
be a bar to a type of union which belongs
essentially to white men and the Temperate

zones. Again, it means the creation of a new
representative body, and in face of the growing
impotence of representative assemblies constructed
on the old lines, I doubt if it would be wise to
experiment with another. Besides, in all the
units of a federation there must be a fairly
uniform development. All must have attained
to a certain height of self-conscious national life,
so that they can enter the federation on equal
terms. But can we maintain that such uniformity
exists with Britain at one end of the scale and,
shall we say, South Africa at the other? Lastly,
unity must precede union. There must be im-
perial solidarity in fact before it receives formal
recognition. The Empire is a living growth, and
any forms we impose upon it must correspond to
its living movement; otherwise, instead of chain-
mail we shall have a strait - waistcoat. Any
rigid scheme of federation applied prematurely
will either be inoperative, and so bring the ideal
into discredit, or it will curb and choke the life
and produce monstrosity instead of growth."
"For the time being," continued Lord Launces-
ton, "I do not see either the feasibility or the
merits of federation in the common sense. Our
conditions are not the conditions on which the
ordinary federation is constructed. But," he
added cheerfully, "there is no reason why we

should not develop a type of our own to meet
our special requirements. There is no need to
cumber ourselves with the irrelevant precedents
of other empires. Let us make the most of the
elements of consolidation we possess. Our
primary merit is our elasticity. Our ideal is
that of Virgil:—
'Non ego, nec Teucris Italos parere jubebo,
Nec mihi regna peto: paribus se legibus ambae
Invictae gentes aeterna in foedera mittant."
We have our free nations and our protected
states, and in them all the one bond of union is
the ultimate executive power. Any attempt at
federation must proceed, therefore, on the ex-
ecutive side. The legislative side may be left
cheerfully to the care of the "trustee' doctrine,
as Lord Appin has called it. But since we have
services common to the whole Empire, expert
knowledge is demanded, and we must have
some machinery for calling to our assistance the
practical wisdom of all our component States.
We want, that is, a Council, and if you must
have an epithet, I should prefer Imperial to
Federal. I have considered in my day many
proposals for such a Council, and I cannot say

that I have yet made up my mind on any one
of them. That, however, is not important. We
are not now drafting the Act to establish such a
body. If we are agreed upon the principle, it
does not pass the wit of man to devise the details.
I have no doubt that Mr Wakefield is ready
with some admirable device."
Mr Wakefield was about to speak when he
was forestalled by Lord Appin, who murmured
dreamily — "What a conception An Imperial
Round Table to which colonial statesmen should
flit like halcyons over the waters!"
These words did not please Mr Wakefield. "I
fail to see the suggestion of comedy," he said
warmly.
"Comedy?" said Lord Appin soothingly. "I
should not dare to hint at it. But you will have
a considerable intellectual admixture. Our own
Parliaments contain a confusion of types, but
we have never before ransacked the globe for
variety."
Mr Wakefield was only half appeased, and
began in a slightly aggrieved voice—
"The chief fact we have to reckon with," he
said, "is colonial nationalism. All the self-
governing colonies look upon themselves as
nations— new national types with a specific
national future. They began life under different

conditions from England, and brought to their
new lands only a light baggage of English tradi-
tions. Those new lands are themselves a great
moulding force as regards national character.
The boy who grows up in the backwoods and
the boy who goes the conventional round of
Eton and Oxford will become different men,
though they may be the sons of the same father.
A colony begins with a struggle for bare life,
scarcely conscious of her own existence, only of
her needs. And then success comes, and more
success, and one morning she wakes to find that
she has become a nation and can call the older
people cousins. She has no standard of com-
parison, and begins by being extremely self-
confident and bumptious. Take a young man
and plant him with a wife in the wilds and tell
him to make a home. So soon as he has done
it he will begin to brag, and the harder the
struggle the finer the fellow he will think him-
self. For, mind you, it is all his own—he owes
little or nothing to borrowed capital, - so he
writes 'Alone I did it' above his shanty, and
looks down his nose at Creation. We call him
a braggart, but we are wrong, for he is some-
thing subtler than that. He is a child, supremely
ignorant, supremely courageous, crowing over his
first triumph. And as it is with the individual,

so with the people. As soon as they can straighten
their backs and look around, and see a very good
and entirely new earth, they pronounce the bene-
diction of the Almighty in Eden, and swagger
outrageously. Everything they have is the finest
in the world, and they themselves are the last
word in human perfection.
"Well, that is all natural and proper, for it is
only a stage, and does not last. The man finds
himself prosperous, but fragments of his early
recollections come back to him, and he begins
to want to know something about his forebears.
He used to plume himself on his isolation: now
he wants to be related to somebody. He sus-
pects that he is badly educated, and he tries
to correct his deficiencies. By-and-by a tre-
mendous fit of humility seizes him. He has
made an estate for himself and his children,
but he wants some of the graces of life. He
sends his boys to European schools, or he
hunts up his kin in the old country, or he
imports old furniture and pictures for the deco-
ration of his new house. It is the second stage
—when he begins to recognise that he cannot
isolate himself, that he is bound by ties of
kinship and race and inherited culture to a
larger world. Once again what happens with
the individual happens with the colony. She

has attained to a fuller self-consciousness, and
is aware not only of her merits but of her
defects. On one side, therefore, she is con-
spicuously humble. She wants to learn all the
wisdom of the ages that the old world can teach,
but when she has learned a little she will brag
once more, and say that she discovered it for
herself, and then she will be humble again and
want to learn further. On the whole she will
show, if considerately treated, a real intellectual
docility. But remember, she will never abate
one jot of her national pride. The colonist, who
is eager to get the best that England can give
him, and will sit at the feet of teachers, is yet
perfectly certain at the back of his head that
he is a monstrously fine fellow, in no way inferior
to any man whose advice he asks and takes.
This pride rubs off a little with experience, but
at first it is raw and nervous, and terribly quick
to take offence. It is in her early stages that
a colony is most difficult. When she becomes
perfectly sure of her foundations and looks
around the world with calmer eyes, she is no
longer so intolerant of criticism and eager to
scent out insult.
"Colonial nationalism is built up on the basis
of this temperament. The chief element in it
is pride of achievement and a readiness to fight

the world to compel acknowledgment. It may
be a little irritating at times, but the statesman
will view it approvingly, for it is the spirit which
makes a strong people. It will accept advice,
but never dictation. At all costs it demands
the right to work out salvation on its own
lines."
Mr Wakefield paused to relight his cigar,
which had gone out in the process of his
argument.
"If there were no other elements," he re-
sumed, "then we might say good-bye to any
thought of a United Empire. But, joined with
this local pride, is the feeling I have already
described, a sentimental attachment to the
parent race, an eager desire to acquire those
other elements of civilisation which their new
land cannot give them. In a sense, therefore,
this national pride becomes the chief incentive
to union. They admit themselves second to
no other people, but, when they look round,
their practical good sense tells them that, as
isolated nations, they are separated by centuries
of development from the greater Powers of the
world. They can only realise their ambition
by the assistance of the other branches of their
race. They wish for union, because it involves
no sacrifice of pride. They believe, rightly or

wrongly, that they can give as well as receive.
If they have less wealth, they can show a high
level of sterling manhood. If they have a
smaller weight of political thought behind them,
they are free from the less worthy accretions of
tradition. The contact with mother earth, the
struggle with nature in her wilder moods in a
land of sunshine and winds and great spaces
where man can breathe-surely it all must
enable them to think freshly and clearly, and
to recognise some of the simple and eternal
truths which are clouded over in a more so-
phisticated life."
"That," said Lord Launceston, "I am very
ready to admit."
"Good. Well, then, any scheme of union
must reckon with this nationalism. It is on
the constitutional side that it is most jealous,
for to a free colony her constitution is a kind
of visible sign of her independence, the very
Ark of her Covenant. You must, therefore,
devise some scheme which leaves their autonomy
for the moment intact, for any change must come
as a concession from them and not as a mandate
from England. I look forward to the day when
the Colonies of their own accord will surrender
to the central executive many matters which
are now in their complete discretion. But that

executive must contain their own members, and
the reform must be mooted by some body rep-
resentative of the whole Empire.
"And now I come to the practical question of
methods. We want a Council, which shall in-
volve no harsh break with our present policy,
and shall also do no violence to colonial national-
ism. Remember what our aim is. We have an
alliance—for that is the real relationship—and
we want to make this alliance closer and more
organic, and to devise bonds which shall be
enduring and yet elastic, expanding with the
growth of our corporate life. Now a mere ad-
visory council is good, but it is not enough. It
is the form suitable to an alliance, but we want
something more. Our Council should therefore
be given certain executive functions. Faithful
to our principle of making use of existing
machinery, we might begin with the Cabinet.
Why should not the King on the executive side
sit in imperial as well as in national session ?
The Cabinet at its normal meetings might deal
with the affairs of the British Islands; but in
imperial session it would deal with questions
common to the Empire—the army and navy,
foreign affairs, commercial treaties, the conflict
of laws, currency, postage, shipping, natural-
isation,-there is no end to the list. At present

the British Defence Committee has power to
summon Colonial representatives to its deliber-
ations. Carry the practice one step further.
Give the Cabinet the same power, and let Col-
onial privy councillors sit in its special session,
not merely as advisers but as members of the
executive, and you have the nucleus of a true
Imperial Council."
"It is a nucleus, certainly," said Hugh, "but
if the point about our nucleus is its indefinite
capacity for expansion, you have omitted one
vital provision. How are your Colonial repre-
sentatives to be chosen ' If, as at present, they
are only summoned by the King on the advice
of the British Cabinet, that Cabinet will remain
the sole real executive."
Mr Wakefield smiled indulgently. "You have
raised the very point I was coming to. The
Colonial members must be representative, other-
wise they can claim no mandate from their
people. I propose to extend the principle of
the triennial conferences of Premiers. Why
should not they take place more often,_say
every second year, without any great incon-
venience. The Premiers would be Cabinet Min-
isters ad hoc, and would attend the Cabinet in
its imperial session. Few of the greater im-
perial questions are so urgent as not to be able
H

to wait for such sessions, certainly not the great
questions of policy. The Imperial Cabinet would
have power to vote money, the Colonial repre-
sentatives voting according to the proportion of
Colonial contributions. As the Colonies grow
to their full stature and assume more of the
imperial burdens, these contributions will be-
come larger, and their power of control propor-
tionately greater. The Premiers would have a
mandate in a true sense from their colonies, for
the subjects discussed in the Cabinet would
already have been discussed in their own parlia-
ments, and might even have been at issue in the
previous elections. In time Colonial officials
would be appointed to the great executive posts
in the Empire, and we should attain to the only
practical form of imperial federation—one central
and representative imperial executive. I would
also suggest, as a supplement, a permanent com-
mittee of the Privy Council, with advisory func-
tions, to discuss imperial questions between the
sittings of the executive, and a permanent Im-
perial Intelligence Department to keep in touch
with any new developments. Such is a rough
outline of a scheme which seems to me both
possible and desirable. It may be amended in
detail, but I think it is right in its main lines."
"I would like to ask one question," said Mr

Astbury. "To what representative body would
your Imperial Cabinet be accountable?"
"In the first instance to the British Parlia-
ment, though the Colonial representatives would
of course be accountable to their own parliaments
also. If at some future time there should come
any form of imperial legislature, then the Cabinet
would naturally account to it."
Lady Warcliff had hitherto borne small share
in the discussions. Her extreme mental energy
was accustomed to take the form of restless
organisation rather than the speculations of
debate. Since her arrival at Musuru she had
been busy investigating every detail of the
management of that immense household, and
had all but driven the Scotch major-domo into
lunacy. She had mastered, too, the principles
of the agricultural settlement, and was engaged
in the somewhat hopeless task of convicting Mr
Lowenstein of error in certain financial methods
he had employed in his philanthropy. She had
sat through the previous discussions with half-
closed eyes and an air of elegant isolation. Now
her preoccupation with other things seemed at
an end, for she took up Mr Wakefield's parable
with a surprising vivacity.
"I quite see the merits of your scheme, but
you will permit me one criticism. An imperial

executive, such as you propose, would no doubt
do admirably all the work of the Empire which
concerned the mother-country and the free Col-
onies. But what about the dependencies—India,
Africa, and the Far East ! I have always re-
garded them as in a special sense the domain of
England, in which the Colonies had no manner
of interest. Would they not, with their fetich
of independence, resent the very existence of
protectorates, or in any case give them a very
perfunctory attention?"
"Your objection, my lady," said Mr Wake-
field, "springs from a misunderstanding of de-
mocracy, and especially colonial democracy. If
the people are ever to rule they must learn to
trust their servants. At present, I grant you,
they are apt to be childishly suspicious of the
proconsul. But that suspicion is no true demo-
cratic product. The only justification of de-
mocracy, as Lord Launceston said yesterday, is
that it clears the way for superiority. Until
it is realised that its mandate, once given, carries
with it complete confidence it will never be a
governing creed. And this is beginning to be
realised. It is the labour leader who is the best
disciplinarian, and the demagogue who is given
the most rope. Besides, our democracy in the
Colonies is a very curious thing, and I look to

it to counteract the vices of the home-grown
variety. It advocates conscription and colonial
navies, and it is inspired throughout with
national pride. If it had its own people shar-
ing in the government of India or Egypt, do
you suppose it would talk about 'satraps' and
"prancing proconsuls'? It would think of the
protectorates as God-given trusts and fields for
the vitality of our race to exercise itself in.
Remember, our democracy is a white man's de-
mocracy, and we are not moved by any foolish
Rousseauism about the rights of man. It is
otherwise, I know, in England. When I was
there this summer I made it my business to see
people of all shades of opinion. At a meeting
in the Queen's Hall I heard Mr Corley-Pratt
declare that India was an incubus, a wen, a
lifeless weight, a stain upon the conscience of
the British people, and everything else that
could be metaphorically mixed. I read a pro-
test by some University professors against the
annexation of Situnga, on the ground that to
keep a people in political tutelage was to be
guilty of slavery. I found many good men who
still clung to the Gladstonian view that any
rising of fanatics was an effort of a people
'rightly struggling to be free.' These gentlemen
would have all the possessions of England re-

distributed by some International Labour Con-
gress. I tell you that such infernal nonsense
would not be tolerated in the Colonies for one
instant, and the man who talked it would be
lynched. No, madame; we have our race pride,
and any insult to it by professor or politician
is hotly resented. Our democracy is the creed
of men and not of sentimentalists."
Lord Launceston had listened a little anxiously
to Mr Wakefield's closing words.
"I grant its merits, but it has its dangers
too. A high-handed Bismarckianism is as much
a risk to the well-being of our dependencies as
any academic cult of the rights of man. But
I agree with you that democracy will find in
itself a cure for its weaknesses, and that it will
not endanger those great realms we hold in
trust for races who are unfit to struggle single-
handed in the arena of the world. In these
questions I am what you call a 'mugwump.'
I lay down no canon, and only ask that our
grave responsibility be recognised, and that each
problem as it arises be determined on the facts,
illumined by reason and conscience. But to
return to your Council, with which I am wholly
in sympathy. I think that on the whole your
account of Colonial feeling is just. There is no
doubt about the reality of the impulse towards

union. At present our machinery is adequate,
but it will not always remain so, and what is
right in an alliance will be futile in a more in-
timate relation. We must recognise this tend-
ency and prepare for change; very cautiously
at first, for we are dealing with life, remember,
and no dead matter which can be coerced into
any mould we please. The reform, we are
agreed, must begin on the executive side. We
have our Empire, and it is right that its common
services should be administered as efficiently as
possible. There we are on solid ground. As I
have said, on the question of legislative federa-
tion I am very doubtful. I am not at all certain
whether the world is not passing away from the
doctrine that legislation should proceed only from
a representative body. So certain German legal-
ists think, and there is a good deal to be said
for the view. But at any rate we can neglect
that question for the moment, and trust to time
to bring its own solution. But the other is a
question for the present. There is no need for
haste, but a beginning must be made, and the
ground prepared for development. It is well
to begin early to lay down the lines of the vessel
into which we are to change, for if we wait till
our present ship goes to pieces we may find our-
selves in the water. You cannot improvise an

army in the hour of need, and it is no easier
to improvise a constitution."
Mr Wakefield had lit another large cigar, and,
pleased with the ready acceptance of his views,
turned a cheerful face to the company.
"There must be no undue haste, but we should
not waste time. As you know, I strongly be-
lieve that the moment has come for a reform of
imperial tariffs so as to create a system of pre-
ference within the Empire. If we delay, the
Colonies will make separate treaties with other
countries, and where the treasure is there will
the heart be also. Further, certain industries
which might yet be preserved to us will pass
to other hands, killed in British hands by pro-
tected rivals abroad. I will not argue the
matter, for our host, who does not agree with
me, has vetoed the subject as foreign to the
purpose of our conference. But my point is that
the thing can only be settled by some represent-
ative Imperial Council—not a mere conference of
Premiers, but a Council with a mandate from the
whole Empire to consider and decide the ques-
tion, and with all the material for decision at
its call. Moreover, it could only be worked
in practice by an imperial executive. I agree
with our opponents to this extent, that without
some such machinery it would be madness to

elaborate any preferential system. Take again
the business of defence, on which Colonel Graham
may have something to say."
Graham, who was still suffering from the
drowsiness begotten of hours unwontedly late,
hastily collected his wits, and asked for the
question to be repeated.
"It is a matter I have thought a good deal
about, and I have bombarded the War Office
with my schemes. Generally speaking, I want
to affiliate colonial levies to the regular army for
training purposes, and also for mobilisation in
time of war. The last war showed that we
fought as an Empire, but the difficulty is to
organise all our splendid fighting strength so as
to give it the maximum of force in a crisis. I
will not trouble you with any of my schemes,
which are long and intricate. But the rock we
shipwreck on is the question of colonial contri-
butions, and this obstacle will remain until we
get some kind of joint executive. We cannot
get the Colonies to put their men under our
control unless they have a share in that control,
and no one blames them for the feeling. They
want to run their own show themselves, but they
would be perfectly content to be affiliated with
us if they had a say in the management. The
same thing appears in the contributions to the

navy. No colony likes to vote a sum and have
no voice in expending it. It is the old question
of taxation without representation. A common
executive would get us over the difficulty, for
then it would be the whole Empire which asked
for men and money and directed the use of both."
Lady Flora had slipped silently into the room
and perched herself upon an arm of Marjory
Haystoun's chair. She looked a little bored with
the discussion, and was preparing to depart again
when the stern eye of Mr Wakefield arrested
her. Apparently addressing his words to her,
though in reality unconscious of her presence, he
declared that Colonel Graham had spoken ex-
cellent good sense.
"Our main obstacle after all is the insularity
of England. The Colonies are insular too, but
that does not matter, for it is with England that
the motive power still lies, and from her must
come the chief impetus. At this moment London
is the centre of gravity for the Empire, perhaps
for the world. But how long will that continue !
England owes her predominance mainly to two
facts. First, she has been outside the arena of
European strife, and has not been for centuries
the cockpit of wars. Her development, political
and economic, has been allowed to proceed un-
checked. Again, by the gift of Heaven, she was

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS. 123
the fortunate possessor of certain means of pro-
duction, such as coal and iron, and was able to
get a long lead in the industrial movement. But
how long will all this continue ! Already her
lead is shortening. In time her coal and iron
supplies will decline. She owes her large popu-
lation mainly to her industrial pre-eminence, and
the loss of it will mean starvation and bank-
ruptcy. She cannot hope to compete with coun-
tries which feed themselves and are self-contained
towards the world. But where she fails as an
island, she may succeed as an empire, for the
Empire has within its bounds every ingredient of
national wealth which other peoples can show.
In time to come the centre of gravity will change
according to natural economic laws. If electricity
should replace coal as the motive force of the
future, a country such as Canada, with her im-
mense water-power, will be far better endowed
by nature than England. Or some undreamed-
of force may be discovered by science which will
make some other colony the predominant indus-
trial partner. Further, manufacturers will in the
long-run migrate to the site of the raw material,
and Birmingham and Lancashire will not always
keep their prerogative. At present, again, Lon-
don, from her position and her vast accumulated
wealth, is the financial centre of the globe. But

every European nation is turning her eyes to the
development of her outlying possessions; and,
moreover, we have Japan and the United States,
and in the near future China, to carry that
centre out of Europe. I can foresee the day when
Sydney or Vancouver will be far more eligibly
situated than London for transacting the business
of the world. Well, if all this will happen some
time or other, surely it is wise to make early
provision that it shall happen smoothly and com-
fortably. If you can arrange that industries
shall have the chance of transference on natural
lines throughout the Empire, and that popu-
lation shall follow them, you have no need
to fear any economic débâcle. At present you
have forty millions of people to our ten, but what
will be the proportion in a hundred years' time?
We must provide for some elasticity in our
interests, and this can only be secured by think-
ing of the Empire not as England plus a number
of poor relations, but as one organic whole, whose
centre is to be determined by the evidence of
time. This is no new doctrine. Adam Smith,
who will not be suspected of wild-cat dogmas,
preached it as the logical corollary to any policy
of colonisation. In the early centuries of the
Christian era the great Councils of the Church
were held, now in Spain, now on the shores of

the Bosphorus; and such mobility, which is the
fruit of true cohesion, must be the ideal of our
Empire if it is to survive. We are connected at
present, but it is to the interest of us all, and
especially of England, to be more closely related
if we are to be secure against the future. In-
sularism must cease to dominate British policy,
and be left only to the obscurantists and re-
actionaries. Such constitutional union as I pro-
pose is only a small and formal beginning, but it
will make broad the path for the true spiritual
change."
"Imperialism, then," said Lord Appin, "is to
be defined from the English point of view as a
kind of national old age pensions scheme?"
But Mr Wakefield, having had his say, and
having secured, as he believed, the assent of his
audience, was not to be disturbed by any
epigram.
"I accept the definition gladly," he said.
"That is Imperialism on the business side. The
other sides—and I grant you they are many—I
leave to people more competent to deal with
them."
Carey walked to one of the shelves and took
down a book.
"Do you remember," he said, "a passage in
which John Davis, the Elizabethan seaman, held

out a prospect for his countrymen? I fear he
was actually talking of the North Pole, where
his dreams have not been realised; but we can
apply his words to the ideal of a united
empire:–
"'How blessed may we think this nation to be, for
they are in perpetual light, and never know what
darkness meaneth, by the benefit of twilight and full
moons, as the learned in astronomy do very well
know; which people, if they have the notice of their
eternity by the comfortable light of the Gospels, then
are they blessed, and of all nations most blessed.
Why then do we neglect the search of this excellent
discovery, against which there can be nothing said to
hinder the same * Why do we refuse to see the
dignity of God's creation, since it hath pleased the
Divine Majesty to place us the nearest neighbour
thereunto ? I know there is no true Englishman
that can in conscience refuse to be a contributor to
procure this so great a happiness to his country,
whereby not only the prince and mighty men of the
land shall be highly renowned, but also the mer-
chants, tradesmen, and artificers mightily enriched.'
You see what an old creed ours is, and how
catholic in its application. You will find cover
under these words, Wakefield, for your practi-
cality, and Marjory for her transcendentalism,
and Teddy for his romance. I think we may
close our discussion for the evening with John
Davis, who makes a good tail-piece. For the
next two days we shall let the matter rest, for

some of us are going hunting. On the evening
of the day after to-morrow I propose that we
take up another question of detail, and a very
practical one—our tropical possessions."
Considine rose and marched resolutely from
the room. "If you and Alastair," he said to
Hugh, "expect to be ready at four to-morrow
morning, you had better get to bed."
Lady Flora looked at him with stern dis-
approval. "Am I to be allowed to come 7" she
asked.
"My dear child " said Mrs Yorke. "They
are going after lions ! Besides, what about the
conventions?"
The girl shook an impatient head. "You
have broken our compact at the very be-
ginning," she whispered to Hugh. "If I were
not such a Christian and such a lady, I should
be seriously annoyed. But you are quite wrong
if you think that you'll have any adventures as
good as I shall have here. I am going straight
off into the wilds on the white pony to make
friends with Prester John."

CHAPTER W.
THE stars, which had been shining with a frosty
brilliance, were paling towards dawn before Hugh
was sufficiently awake to see where he was
going. He had been routed out by Alastair
Graham in the small hours, and had somehow
found himself on a horse, in a great blanket-
coat, with half-a-dozen dusky figures trotting
alongside. He had been jogging on for half an
hour before he finally rubbed sleep out of his
eyes, and, drinking long draughts of the electric
air, roused himself to some interest in life. The
sky was changing from black to some ineffable
shade of purple, and the track among the
mimosa thorns was beginning to glimmer ahead
in a fantastic grey. Soon remoter objects dis-
tinguished themselves—a kopje, a big tree, a
jag of rock. And then over the crest of the
far downs came a red arc of fire, and the
heavens changed to amethyst and saffron, and,
last of all, to a delicate pale blue, where wisps

of rosy cloud hung like the veils of the morning.
They were near the western edge of the escarp-
ment, and, looking down into the trough, Hugh
saw over the great sea of mist the blue fingers
of far mountains rising clear and thin into the
sky. The air was bitter cold, and the cheeks
tingled with the light wind which attends the
dawn. Lines of Theocritus — the d\éktop
kokkácov v?ipkatoru dvicpatort of the Seventh
Idyll—ran in Hugh's mind from his reading
of yesterday. He realised that his senses had
become phenomenally acute. His eyes seemed
to see farther, his ears to mark the least sound
in the bush, while the scents of the morning
came to his nostrils with a startling fresh-
ness. Pungent, clean, yet with an indescrib-
able tropic softness in it, was the air of the
desert, which he sniffed like the Scriptural
wild ass. He looked round at his companions.
Graham, a burly figure in a sheepskin coat,
rode somewhat in the manner in which Napoleon
is painted as retreating from Moscow, sitting
squarely in the saddle with a meditative chin
on his breast. Considine's long lean figure on
a blue roan seemed wholly in keeping with the
landscape. He wore an old khaki suit and a
broad-brimmed felt hat, and sat his horse as
loosely as a Boer. He leaned forward, peering
I

keenly about him, whistling some catch of song.
In civilised places he looked the ordinary far-
travelled sportsman, a little browner and
tougher, perhaps, than most. But the Con-
sidine of the Turf Club and the Considine of
the veld were different beings. The bright
eyes, set deep in the dark face, and the sinewy
strength of his pose gave him the air of some
Elizabethan who had sailed strange seas to a
far country. To Hugh at the moment he seemed
the primal type of the adventurer.
Soon the travellers were greeted by the most
comforting of all the scents of the wilds—the
smell of a wood fire, and the faint odour of
roasting coffee. Their boys had made their
breakfast-camp in the crook of a little stream,
where the forest ended and the long downs of
the northern plateau began. In a few minutes
Hugh was sitting luxuriously on a pile of rugs,
drinking excellent coffee out of a tin mug. The
Trappist silence of the early ride was over.
"You'll get none of the luxury of Musuru
here, my boy," Considine said. "We are going
to have the same fare as Alastair and I enjoyed
a week ago—tinned stuff and what we kill.
You've hunted yourself, and know that to eat
potted meat with your fingers out of a tin
after a hard day is better than a dinner at the

Ritz. Akhub," he cried, "what about the
beats?"
The chief shikari—Zanzibari Arab, ex-slave-
trader, and heaven knows what besides—bowed
gravely, and informed his master that he had
arranged for Graham to go due east into the
down country, where buck and rhino were
plentiful; Considine should keep on to the
north, where he had a better chance of a good
eland head; while Hugh was to remain on the
edge of the escarpment, where lay the best
chance of lion.
Considine nodded. "You'll want your Männ-
licher for buck," he said to Hugh, "and your
'400 cordite express. For pity's sake don't go
into the bush after lion without the express.
Akhub is going with you and will look after
you. I want you to get a lion, but remember
he is worth taking pains about, or he may get
you. I've twice been clawed by them, and it's
no sort of fun."
Breakfast over, the parties separated, and Hugh
with the shikari and five boys set out along
the rim of the plateau. A pleasurable excite-
ment, with just a shade of trepidation in it,
flavoured his morning pipe. He yearned to get
a lion, but he had some nervousness lest he
might show up badly in a tight place, having

never before faced anything more dangerous
than a sleepy Norwegian bear. He was a good
shot enough in a Scotch deer-forest, but a situ-
ation where a miss meant not annoyance but
mortal peril was new to his experience.
The cold morning changed to a hot noonday,
and at two in the afternoon Hugh sat down to
lunch, in a better frame of mind. He had got
two hartebeests with fair heads, and in a marshy
place a really fine waterbuck. His anxiety, he
found, had not impaired his steadiness, and he was
recovering his composure. He was still soft from
civilised life and tormented by a thirst which
several cups of hot tea barely assuaged. Lunch
was perforce a short meal since he had to meet
the others at a certain point which Akhub de-
clared was three hours' riding ahead, and if he
wished for more hunting there was no time to
be lost.
The afternoon's trek was hot and dusty, and
he had little sport. Green doves and a white-
tailed hawk were the only signs of life in the
bush, which seemed to lie torpid in a universal
drowsiness. By-and-by they entered a timber
tract, where large acacias and junipers made
glades like an English park. It was drawing
towards evening, and according to Akhub's cal-
culations another half-hour would bring them

into touch with the rest of the party. Hugh
had almost abandoned the thought of sport,
when a sudden cry of 'ngatun-yo from the boys
made him look down a tributary glade. He
saw a great yellow beast, like an overgrown
dog, go lolloping across into a thicket of trees,
and with a beating heart he recognised that
he was at last in the presence of a veritable
lion.
Earlier in the day he had carefully planned out
his conduct. He would quickly yet calmly take
the express from the bearer, and circumspectly
yet swiftly reconnoitre the ground for a shot.
Alas for good resolutions ! At the first sight of
that tawny back Hugh was off in pursuit down
the glade at full gallop, while an agitated boy
waved the neglected weapon in his rear. He
had his Männlicher on his saddle-bow, and almost
unconsciously he slipped in cartridges while his
eyes searched the environs for a sign of his
quarry.
Suddenly he saw him a hundred yards ahead
trotting along a narrow native path. He was
going slowly, unconscious apparently of the
proximity of man. Hugh dismounted, hitched
his well-broken horse to a tree, and sent a flying
shot at the beast, which had the effect of making
him halt for a second, look round, and then turn

into the shade of the trees on the right. Hugh
ran up to where he had entered, and a little
nervously looked into the sparse bush. There
was the lion well in range, so, kneeling down
and aiming carefully, he fired. A shot from
behind is never easy, and as it chanced the
bullet went low and shattered the left hind
leg. The beast stopped with a growl of pain,
turned slowly round and looked at the intruder,
lashing the low bushes with his tail.
The moment had come for a second shot, and
Hugh got it in full on the chest, but a little too
high for the heart. An express bullet would have
stretched him out, but the little Männlicher had
no such power. The great beast roared in fury,
caught sight of his enemy behind a tree-trunk,
advanced a pace, and then gathered himself for a
charge.
With a nervous hand Hugh had managed to
slip in fresh cartridges, and as the lion moved
he fired. It was a clean miss, and Hugh had
a confused sense of something yellow and evil-
smelling flying through the air as he leaped
aside. Whether consciously or unconsciously, he
had fired his second barrel, and the next he knew
he was picking himself up, unhurt but shaken
and blood-stained, from beneath a branch which
the lion had broken, while the creature himself

lay stone-dead a yard off. The last shot had by
a miracle found the heart.
Hugh's first impulse was to make assurance
sure by firing into the body, but a moment's
inspection convinced him that there was no life
left. Then his mood became one of insane jubila-
tion. Alone and with the wrong rifle he had
killed his lion. He felt three inches taller; he
longed for Akhub, for Considine, for any one to
come and see. And then a growl behind him
made him turn his head, and he forgot his pride
in abject terror. For there, about twelve yards
off, was a second lion, bigger and darker in the
mane, glaring at him wrathfully with his ugly
jaws half-open.
His hand went to his cartridge-belt, only to
find it empty. He felt his pockets, but not a
cartridge remained. They had dropped out in
the fall and lay some yards off beyond the dead
beast.
Hugh did the only thing possible, and sprang
for the nearest tree. He was not a moment too
soon, for as his quaking body was swung up to
the second branch something tore at his leg, and
the next moment he was contemplating boot and
gaiter ripped off at the back and a long scratch
in the flesh. In the same second he seemed to
hear a shot ring out—no ping of a Männlicher,

but the honest thunder of an express— and
the long dark face of Akhub appeared in the
glade.
It was a very chastened hunter who descended
the tree to receive the congratulations and re-
proaches of the chief shikari. It was abundantly
clear to him that he had done an unpardonable
thing, and, but for the activity of his boys and
the near neighbourhood of the tree, might have
been stretched torn and dying beside his quarry.
But the mood could not last. The exhilaration
of a successful adventure came back to him.
After all, he had walked up his lion with a
small-bore and killed him unaided. With huge
pleasure he now saw that his own animal was the
finer and bigger of the two.
He lit a pipe and jogged on in the deepening
twilight, his whole soul filled with the joy of
conquest. This was life indeed, for, say what
we may, there is no satisfaction so intense as
victory over some one of the savage forces of
nature. Better for the moment than viceroyal-
ties or Garters or millions is the joy of making
the first ascent of some hard peak, or sailing a
boat home through a tempest, or seeing some
wild animal fall before your own courage and
skill. In that hour Hugh would not have
changed places with Launceston or Carey.

Soon he came into the glow of a big fire.
Lanterns were hanging from the boughs of a
huge juniper, and beds were being got ready
underneath. At little fires close by the boys
were cooking supper.
The others welcomed him with a great shout.
"Well, what luck?"
"Two lions," said Hugh, with studied modesty.
"One mine and one Akhub's—and a few buck."
"Gad you've had the cream of the day," said
Considine. "I got nothing but a hartebeest.
And Alastair never had a shot. How did you
get your lion ?"
Hugh told his story to a disapproving audience.
"You foolhardy young devil Though, after
all, I suppose I've done the same thing in my
time. How's your leg"
"A scratch. Only wants a simple dressing.
I've learned my lesson all right, for I never was
in such a blue funk in my life. You don't find
me stalking lion with a Männlicher again. For
heaven's sake, old man, give me a drink."
Considine, following the bushveld ritual, doled
out to each a small whisky-and-soda. "Keep
that in mind, Hugh, when you next go on trek.
After a long day you want a pick-me-up before
you dine, or you can't eat; and if you can't eat
you can't sleep, and if you can't sleep you get

fever as sure as fate. Never touch the stuff in
the daytime, and I'm against it at dinner, but as
a pick-me-up there's nothing like it."
They sat down with tremendous appetites to
that best of meals, a hunter's supper. There
was tinned soup, which they drank out of mugs,
curried guinea-fowl which Alastair had shot,
venison-steaks stewed with onions, and a species
of tinned plum-pudding which was the joy of
Considine's heart. Coffee and peach brandy
completed the courses, and then the three got
into sleeping-bags, had more logs put on the fire,
lit their pipes, and prepared for the slow talk
which merges gradually in slumber.
Hugh snuggled into his kaross with a profound
sense of comfort. He felt warm, satisfied, and
indomitably cheerful. Never had his pipe seemed
sweeter; never had he felt his mind more serene
or his body more instinct with life. The wide
glade was lit up by the fire, and the high
branches made a kind of emerald canopy picked
out with the golden points of stars. The boys
were singing monotonous native songs around
their bivouac, and through the wood came the
eerie rustling of night winds. A zareba of thorns
had been built round the camp, close to which
the horses and mules stood patiently champing
their fodder. The camp was a miniature city,

with its fortifications and its watchmen, and
Hugh felt himself in a new world—the hunter's
civilisation, the oasis which he makes anew for
himself each night in wilds which are careless
of human life. For a moment his mind travelled
back to Musuru, where at that hour delicately
clad women would be sitting down to rich food
amid flowers and silver and white linen. The
contrast was so piquant that in the catholic mind
it awoke the spirit of comedy.
"What are you cackling at, Hugh 2" Considine
asked. "Fling me your tobacco - pouch like a
good chap, for mine's empty. Lord! how often
I've lain like this and smoked and looked up at
the sky. And how many good fellows have done
the same and are at it still It's all very well
for Wakefield and the rest to theorise about
Empire. I daresay it is logical and scientific
enough. But you can't get the feeling of all
it means till you've got very close to the bones
of the old Earth, and heard her muttering to
herself, and realised what a tough old fiend she
is and what a job it is to get even with her."
"Sijeunesse savait !" said Hugh. "That's the
tragedy of life—that the men who do the things
can never tell about them or quite understand
them. They only feel dimly that they are in
the grip of some gigantic destiny. I don't sup-

pose the Three Hundred when they combed their
long hair for death before Thermopylae ever
thought what a gorgeous game they were play-
ing. If they had, they would have gone into
battle drunk with pride and walked through
Xerxes' army. It seems a law of mortality that
the instinct for deeds and the guiding and under-
standing brain cannot be equally matched, except
once in a thousand years in a Caesar. The world
is full of dumb, blind people, doing admirable
work and faced with wonderful sights, and all
the time without a glimmering of an idea of
the magnificence of it."
Sir Edward Considine was in ordinary life a
gentleman of cultivated manners, who spoke the
English tongue with reasonable purity. But in
the bush he developed a style of his own, and
talked a slang culled from four continents, which
the present writer cannot hope to reproduce. He
tossed Hugh's tobacco-pouch back to him, raised
himself on one elbow from his couch, and shook
his head emphatically.
"They understand," he said, "better than you
or I can tell. I've made a special study of the
scallywag, and what I don't know about him
ain't worth knowing. Most people make the
mistake of thinking that he is always of the
same type. There are a hundred types of him,

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS. 141
and only one thing common to each—they are
all dreamers."
"But for your infernal noise I should be one
now," said Graham sleepily from the far bed.
Considine picked up a boot, landed it neatly in
the midst of the heap of rugs, and continued—
"I've been stuck up in half a dozen parts of
the world with fellows who hadn't been home for
years. Most of them used to talk Johnsonian
English simply because they had forgotten when
they last spoke to a white man, and thought of
English only as a book language. None of them
talked much, and it was the devil's own job to
get them to speak of themselves. But they were
the salt of the earth for all that, living hard,
working hard, and ready to sell their lives any
day in the way of business. Do you think that
kind of man is only a mill-horse, jogging on in his
round because there is nothing else for him to
do? I tell you every man-jack of them has got
his own private dream. He knows he has got
his race behind him, and that he is the advance-
guard, and the thought bucks him up to rot away
in swamps and shiver with fever, and in all
probability be cleaned out in some obscure row.
Nobody knows another man's life, but we get
glimpses now and then of his inner soul and
take off our hats to it. You remember Lacey,

who was at Eton with Alastair and me? Ask
Alastair about him."
"What? the fellow who was killed somewhere
up Chitral way ?"
Considine's boot had brought Graham to atten-
tion. "Yes; he held a border fort with a dozen
men for five days against several hundred ruffians.
He fought so well that they wanted to spare him
at the end and made him all kinds of offers. But
he stuck it out, and they only got in over his
body. When we found him he had about fifty
wounds on him."
"I remember the story," said Hugh.
"Well, I was a pal of his, and he had made me
his executor. I got his diary that he had written
up till the day he died. If I hadn't seen that
book I would have sworn that Lacey was the
ordinary stupid fellow who fought because he
liked it, and that he had stuck it out more from
obstinacy than from policy. But the diary
changed my mind. I found that he had care-
fully considered the whole question of surrender.
Overtures had been made to him, and apparently
they were such as he could have trusted. But
he concluded it was a case for the white man's
pride. He reasoned it all out. If he kept his
head up to the last, he thought that the moral
effect on that particular part of the border

would be so great that there would be little
more trouble. He deliberately chose death be-
cause he fancied it was his duty. And of course
he was happy. The last pages of that little book,
all grimy and blotted with blood, were one long
paean of triumph. He couldn't spell, and he had
very little idea of writing, yet the end of that
book was the purest lyric of joy. The sacrifice
was not in vain either, for, as you know, it ended
the war, and now the blackguards who killed him
burn offerings to his shade at hillside shrines."
"I don't for one moment deny that the great
spirits—the leaders—have a clear ideal before
them. But surely the same thing doesn't apply
to the ordinary rolling-stone who wanders into
adventures because he cannot keep out of them,
and hasn't an idea in his head except that he
likes to knock about the world."
"I never yet met the man without an idea in
his head," said Considine; "but I give you up the
ne'er-do-well, who has something rotten about
him in heart or brain. I mean the wanderer who
likes the wilds better than civilisation, and there-
fore is what civilised people call an idler, simply
because the only things they recognise as work
cannot be done in the kind of places he frequents.
I know the breed, for he belongs to my own
totem, and in defending him I am more or less

justifying myself. My game is exploration, and
I work at it pretty hard, though it's what you
might call an intermittent profession. Another
fellow's is natural history or mapping or pro-
specting or something else. We're devilish un-
satisfactory people to our wives and families, I
know, but, still, we don't rust. We keep our
minds keen and our bodies active, and I scarcely
call that idling. We're the least frivolous kind
of man on the planet, and the least vulgar. Look
at the ordinary industrious citizen. He wants to
"get on 'in his beastly trade, and to have a house
in Mayfair and a place in the country, and marry
his daughters well, and get into Parliament and
have a title to clap on to his squalid name. Or
perhaps he wants to be applauded in the papers
and be treated as a personage wherever he goes.
I ask you if these are ambitions for a white
man 2 "
Considine filled his pipe again from Hugh's
pouch, and lit a match with difficulty. A light
wind had got up which flickered among the high
branches.
"Last time I was at home I went with
Blanche to a ball at the Templetons. It was
a big affair—royalty and ambassadors and a
brace of foreign grand dukes, one of whom once
hunted with me in the Selkirks. I stood for

about half an hour beside a pillar and watched
and meditated. The noise round about me was
just like the jabbering of monkeys in a Malayan
forest. None of the people looked you squarely
in the eyes, and the women had all faces like
marionettes. I saw my aunt's head bobbing and
grinning, and her talk was some scandal about
her oldest friend. Two fellows were standing
near me—one was in the Cabinet and the other
was a tremendous legal swell—and they were
laughing at some of Manton's last sayings.
Hanged if I could see any humour in 'em! One
of the two came and spoke to me afterwards, and
said he supposed the scene must be a pleasant
change to me after the Congo. I told him it
wasn't much of a change, only the monkeys were
caged instead of running wild on the tree-tops.
He laughed as if I had said something funny.
After a bit I got very sad and sober. Young
girls passed me with romance still in their eyes,
and others, a little older, with the romance dead.
I seemed to be looking on at a vast puppet-show,
and I began to wonder if anybody was alive ex-
cept myself. And then the comedy of it struck
me, and I laughed to myself till people turned
round to look at me, and Blanche came and asked
me if I was ill. Of course, it was a game, and a
good enough game, but yet to most of the people

it was a tremendous reality, all they knew of life,
and they would have shrieked in holy horror if I
had told them that they represented not the last
word in civilisation but a return to a very early
stage of barbarism. The rough fellow clearing
trees with an axe for his home was miles farther
up the scale of being than they. . . . And then
old Thirlstone drifted towards me. I daresay
you know him, Hugh 2"
"The man who was made an Under-Secretary
the other day ?"
"Same fellow. I used to know him long ago
in the Service, and he was the hardest-bitten
devil I have ever struck. He was in Tibet with
Alastair, and he and I once had a try at getting
into Kafiristan. Then his uncle died, and he
became an enormously rich peer and had to come
home and attend to his affairs. When he first
came back he dined with us, and Blanche had a
lot of people to meet him. He hadn't much to
say for himself, and everybody thought him a
bore, except me and a few of his own kind. Well,
he settled down and married, and got into the
ordinary rut, and there he was, still brown in the
face but rather tired about the eyes. Blanche
had told me he was much improved, so I knew
what to look out for. All his roughness and
shyness were gone, and he had the same kind of

manner as the other monkeys, only he looked
more wholesome. I wanted to speak to him, so
we found a quiet corner in the supper-room. And
then I put it straight to him, if he liked his new
life. He said he did, talked a lot of rot about
doing his duty in the sphere into which it had
pleased God to call him, and about the fun of
being at the centre of things; but there was not
much conviction in his tone. So I began to tell
him what had been happening to me, mentioned
some places we had been together in and friends
we had known. Soon I got him as keen as
mustard. He dropped all his long words and
fell into the honest slang of the backwoods. We
had half an hour's talk of old times, and then his
wife came in with the big boss of his party.
You know Lady Thirlstone, I daresay. A pretty
American with a figure and fine eyes, but neither
complexion nor heart. Thirlstone got up to join
them and looked at me rather sickly. "I've got
my wings clipped, old man,' he said. "Wish me
joy of my gilt cage, for if I weren't a gentleman
I'd kick it to splinters to-morrow.'"
Somewhere in the forest a jackal barked and
was answered from the far side of the camp. The
fire was dying down, and a native boy came for-
ward to heap on more logs.
"And yet," said Hugh, "what good is the

wanderlust in itself? You may have all manner
of dreams, but you spend your strength in
futility. I daresay Thirlstone sitting chafing in
Parliament is playing a better part in the solid
work of the world than Thirlstone gallivanting
about the Hindu Kush."
"That's where you are wrong, my dear," said
Considine. "We are the advance-guard, always
pushing a little farther on and making the road
easier for those who come after us, the serious
solid fellows who make laws and create indus-
tries, and generally reap where we have sown.
You cannot measure the work of a pioneer by the
scale of a bagman. We keep the fire burning,
though we go out ourselves. Our failure is our
success. We don't found colonies and build
cities, but unless we had gone before no one
would have come after."
"Hugh," said Graham solemnly, "if you en-
courage Teddy, he'll keep on talking like a minor
poet till daybreak."
"I like his minor poetry. Go on, and never
mind that savage. You defend the adventurer
because he keeps a nation restless?"
"True for you. He is the electric force in
civilisation. Without him we should settle, like
Moab, on our lees and rot. And you cannot
measure him by ordinary results, because his

work is spiritual and unworldly. Raleigh failed
in everything he put his hand to, and went to the
scaffold with all his schemes discredited. And
yet he had set moving the force which was to
make his dreams a superb reality. The pioneer
must always be ploughed under, but only the fool
considers him a failure. That Nietzsche fellow
Appin was chaffing me about the other night has
got the right end of the stick. The individual is
tremendously important. We think of men as
mere cog-wheels in some great machine, whose
only value is as part of the works. Heaven forbid
that I should deny the value of the great social
machine in ordinary life. But there are many
who have no share in it, and they have their
value none the less, for, if you don't mind mixed
metaphors, they somehow generate the motive
power for the whole show. Take the case of
Gordon. You may tell me that he was mad and
a fanatic, that he ran his own head into the
noose, that he had flaws in his character, that he
was impossible as a colleague or a subordinate. I
daresay that is all true, and I don't care. His
failure and the manner of it were worth a dozen
successful wars and a whole regiment of impec-
cable statesmen. It put new faith into the race,
and screwed us up for another century.
"Remember," Considine continued, "that indi-

vidualism is the keynote of our work. I have
seen the French business in North Africa, and
know their methods. There the State moves
forward as one man, and not a step is taken in
the advance till lines are laid from the base and
the country is well held in the rear. Everything
is centralised and officially directed. That is not
our way. We send our younger sons out into the
world, expressly forbid them to do things, dis-
avow and discourage them, and then profit by
their disobedience. As long as we have hundreds
of young men who ask only the chance of danger,
and are ready to take the whole world on their
shoulders, we need have no fear for the future.
When every one demands his price and asks to be
shown some fair likelihood of success before he
tackles his job, then we are morally bound to
decay—
"My pipe is out, and I am getting sleepy.
We've an early start before us, so I suppose we
should compose ourselves to slumber."
Soon the world was quiet, save for the occa-
sional crackling of a log and the deep breathing
of the sleepers. Hugh pulled the furs about his
chin, and watched the red heart of the fire glowing
in the velvet dark of the night. He floated off
into vague dreams, where lion-hunts ended in

London ball - rooms, and almost in the same
moment it seemed to him that he was awake
again, with the fire black and the bitter cold
gripping at his exposed neck and shoulders. He
drew his coverings together, and sank into that
light dreamless sleep which is the true luxury of
the wilds. In another moment of time it was
dawn, and, wide awake and refreshed, he was
looking at a pale morning sky from which the
stars were fading, and hearing the cheerful sound
of the boys making early coffee.

CHAPTER VI.
THE gardens at Musuru cover three thousand feet
of a mountain-side, sloping steeply down from the
lawns around the house to a tropical glen, where
a brawling stream runs in thickets of palm and
cactus. For Carey's guests it was a prescribed
excursion to descend to the Tropics some morning,
lunch in a summer-house, and make the best of an
arduous return in the late afternoon. Such an
expedition had its charm, for it was a stimulating
adventure to climb down, as it were, in a few
hours through many degrees of latitude, and
witness in a brief day the scenery of twenty
climates. But it had also its drawbacks, for in
the morning when human energy is high the task
was easy, and all the difficulties were reserved for
that unhallowed season when lunch is a memory
and tea a distant hope. So mules were provided
for the women, and with the accompaniment of
native muleteers and an Arab guide, the party
assembled about eleven o'clock at the point where

the road dipped into an avenue of cool cedars.
Mrs Yorke, in a dress of delicate green muslin,
carried a parasol, and sat her mule with the ease
of one long at home in Southern places. The
others, Marjory Haystoun, Lady Flora, and Mrs
Deloraine, wore broad-brimmed hats and clothes
of some serviceable linen stuff. Lady Flora re-
fused to mount her mule, and tramped sturdily
along with Mr Wakefield and Mr Astbury.
The garden was a labyrinth of paths, for the
most part shadowed with trees, but coming sud-
denly at times to a kind of stage where the
travellers had a wide prospect of the valley. At
first the deep rooty fragrance of pines and cedars
was all about them. Rhododendrons and azaleas
formed the thicket, and there were stretches of
mossy turf down which little streams fell in
cascades to the forest below. Except for the
greater heat of the sun, which the canopy of
green scarcely averted, the road might have been
a drive in some English park. Every now and
then came patches of well-known English flowers,
most of them past their first bloom, though the
heath was still a gorgeous sheet of colour. In-
sensibly, however, the place changed to another
latitude. Now it was some superb Riviera
garden, where myrtles and syringas and shrubby
geraniums crowded on the paths. At one halt-

ing place there was a parterre of flower-beds
bright with a dozen species of canna and lily.
A stream had been dammed to make a small
hanging reservoir, where every variety of water-
plant blossomed, and ducks of a curious burnished
green swam among the white petals. Still they
descended, and now the vegetation closed in, and
instead of an avenue the path was a tunnel.
Huge trees matted with vines and passion-flowers,
tall forests of fern, broad-leaved wild bananas,
and quantities of little palms, made a jungle
which it seemed vain to hope to penetrate.
Insect and bird life, which had been silent above,
awoke in these regions, and the air was a-flutter
with delicate wings. It was very hot, not the
strong glare of the sun, but the moist warmth
of rich vegetable life and a too generous earth.
Mr Wakefield laboured in his tracks, the ladies
on the mules ceased to gossip, and even Lady
Flora looked flushed and breathless. Soon the
noise of water rose above the hum of the forest,
and suddenly through the blue and orange
shadows of the trees gleamed the foam of a
great torrent, as milk-white as any glacier
stream. A well-made bridge of logs led across,
and a few minutes later the party were seated
in a little bungalow, with a floor of beaten earth,
a thatched roof, and a shady verandah.

The sight of a cool luncheon-table with waiting
servants in white tunics restored the travellers
to comfort. They found a light meal of fruit and
cold foods, while Mr Wakefield industriously set
about the quenching of a very respectable thirst.
After a while he recovered his composure, and
had leisure to regard his companions.
"'If these things be done in the green tree,'"
he said, "'what shall be done in the dry 2" If
I am out of breath coming downhill, how on earth
am I to get up again? I have never understood
why an all-wise Providence created the Tropics.
They are full of noxious animals; their climate
embitters life and is apt to end it prematurely."
Astbury, squarely built, fair-haired and ruddy,
was also ill fitted for violent exercise in hot
climates. A noted athlete and a mountaineer
of high reputation, he could endure extremes
of cold and exhaustion and only find his energy
quickened, but in the Tropics he was apt to lose
his restless activity and become an idle and good-
humoured spectator of life.
"I want to know the answer to that question,
too," he said. "What does the white man get
from the Tropics? His strenuousness goes out
of him, and he becomes a heavy-eyed cumberer
of the ground. At Musuru I am always thinking
about reforming the world, while down in this

place the world can go to pieces for all I care.
What do we get from living among palm-trees
and gorgeous colours in the atmosphere of a
Turkish bath 2"
"Nothing," said Mr Wakefield. "The Tropics
are a purgatory appointed by Heaven for the
purging of our immortal souls. They are a
sphere of duty in which for their sins many
honest men are compelled to labour—nothing
more l'"
"I wonder if women are more Oriental than
men'" it was Marjory who spoke. "Because,
you know, all this makes me happy. I seem to
get the creases out of my soul in this hot sun
and this glory of flowers. In what people call
strenuous weather I would much rather stay in
bed. But to-day one really believes that veins
of fire run through the earth, and that nothing is
dead, not even the rocks. One feels the world
so much bigger and fuller and richer and more
mysterious. Don't you think so, Barbara!"
Mrs Deloraine, who had been gazing at a huge
bouquet of orchids presented to her by one of the
servants, lifted an abstracted eye.
"What an intoxication colour is " she mur-
mured. "Look at these scarlet bells and that
great purple chalice. I had no idea such depth
of richness could be found in the world. Our

senses are starved in the north, with nothing
but clean thin scents around us and pale rain-
washed greys and blues. There is no passion
in our Nature, for it is all too well subordinated
to the needs of man. But here we have a world
which has no thought of humanity. These scarlet
blossoms flame for other than mortal eyes. You
cannot think of Pan in one of our hazel thickets
—the thought is almost indecent. But I can
well imagine his slanted eyes looking out from
behind that tangle of vines."
"I, too, feel that," said Mrs Yorke. "In the
North the life-force in the earth is enough for our
needs and no more, but here there is a generous
overflow. I feel as if life were longer and kinder
and easier, but also that I matter less in the
scheme of things than I thought. I am a little
home-sick, too, for I am a daughter of the South,
and the hot air brings back my childhood." Mrs
Yorke sighed with a tender melancholy.
"I feel the wickedness more than the kind-
ness," said Mrs Deloraine. "It is an unmoral
world, this warm-scented place, and there is a
shrieking cruelty behind the splendour. Natura
Maligna and Natura Benigna have walked hand
in hand in these glens. Look at the flowers
No Wordsworth could read any lesson of peace
in them."

Lady Flora arose and examined the bouquet;
then, selecting a huge purple blossom, she
fastened it in Mr Wakefield's coat. She walked
a few steps back and surveyed her handiwork.
"I want you to look wicked, Mr Wakefield,
but it's quite impossible. You only look
benevolent and embarrassed. Barbara, you may
wear orchids if you please, for I think you are
the only one of us who could stand them. Letty
would look a sorceress at once, and Marjory is one
without them."
Astbury had wandered to the door and was
looking up the steep slopes of greenery they had
descended.
"What a Jack-and-the-Beanstalk business it
is, and how little one would imagine a place like
Musuru atop of it all ! I think Miss Haystoun
is right, and that the Tropics should increase
our vitality, but we must be very vital beings
to begin with. A hot sun or a keen frost will
make a strong man stronger, but they will kill a
weakling. So with the Tropics in my view. An
eager fellow can live in them for years and be
none the worse, but your waster dies. That is
why a lean sandy-haired Scot is perfectly happy
in West Africa, while a Portuguese sickens at
once, though the one is a Northerner and the
other a Latin. In my case, the Tropics make

me sleepy, and I don't mind admitting it. But
they also fill me with a vast bovine contentment,
which I suppose is a kind of condensed and
stored vitality. They are the only really rest-
ful places in the world, for you feel that your life
is such a speck on the great wheel of things.
I remember after the Boer War coming home by
the East Coast in a cargo-boat and landing at
a little port called Inhambane. There was a
long sweep of white sand, a line of green palms,
and a lot of whitewashed, green-shuttered,
thatched houses in groves of bananas. I was
rowed up a little river among quiet villages
under palm-trees, where the people always
seemed to be chanting a low, slow Arab song.
It was very hot, and I lay comfortably in the
stern, watching the oily current and the black
arms of the rowers and the snow-white gown of
the steersman and the deep blue sky between
the feathery tops of the palms. And then I
sank for two heavenly hours into Nirwana. I
had never been to Nirwana before, but now I
badly want to go back again. In London my
working-rooms face on a dingy grey street with
a mouldy old cab-horse standing at the corner.
Sometimes, when I look out, that river at Inham-
bane comes over me so badly that I hardly know
what to do. For, if you once get the Tropics

into your blood, however much you may hate
'em and disapprove of 'em, you can't forget 'em.
And some day you will go back."
Marjory, swinging lazily in a low wicker chair,
announced her agreement. "I am of the belief
of the old sailor who said nothing was impossible
'south'ard o' the line.' Your horizon is far wider
and you live in touch with the great elementary
things. Barbara, I am going to repeat some
verses you once wrote. Listen, everybody:-
"In the ancient orderly places, with a blank and orderly mind,
We sit in our green walled gardens and our corn and oil
increase;
Sunset nor dawn can wake us, for the face of the heavens is
kind;
We light our taper at even and call our comfort peace.
Peaceful our clear horizon, calm as our sheltered days
Are the lilied meadows we dwell in, the decent highways
we tread.
Duly we make our offerings, but we know not the God we
praise,
For He is the God of the living, but we, His children, are
dead.
I will arise and get me beyond this country of dreams,
Where all is ancient and ordered and hoar with the frost
of years,
To the land where loftier mountains cradle their wilder
streams,
And the fruitful earth is blessed with more bountiful smiles
and tears,

There in the home of the lightnings, where the fear of the
Lord is set free,
Where the thunderous midnights fade to the turquoise
magic of morn,
The days of man are a vapour, blown from a shoreless sea,
A little cloud before sunrise, a cry in the void forlorn—
I am weary of men and cities and the service of little things,
Where the flamelike glories of life are shrunk to a candle's
ray.
Smite me, my God, with Thy presence, blind my eyes with
Thy wings,
In the heart of Thy virgin earth show me Thy secret
way ! x -:
The verses were received with a murmur of
approval by Mrs Yorke and Mr Astbury. Mr
Wakefield contented himself with observing that
he was glad there was some one to say a good
word for the Tropics, but that personally he
should be unhappy till he was back at Musuru.
As the afternoon had grown cooler a start was
made, which was a little delayed by an attempt
on the part of Lady Flora to explore with her
mule a track which led down to the edge of
the stream. The result was that she could
not turn her animal, which had to be towed
back ignominiously by the whole staff of the
bungalow.
The ascent proved less arduous than had been
expected. Mrs Yorke, stricken with humani-

tarian feelings, declined to burden her mule, and
in the company of Lady Flora walked gallantly
up the steepest part, with the face which her
ancestors may have worn when they rolled the
tea-chests into Boston harbour. As the air grew
colder and pines and cedars reappeared, comfort
descended once more on the party, and even Mr
Wakefield ceased to puff. The scent of heath
was so homely that the experiences of the day
were forgotten, and each felt as if the walk had
lain through some English wood with a con-
ventional country-house to return to. But on
emerging on the lawn from the long avenue the
sudden sight of Musuru brought all to a halt.
The glow of sunset was on the white walls, and
the whole had the airy perfection of a house seen
in a dream.
"What a place to stumble upon by accident l"
exclaimed Mr Astbury. "Imagine a party of
hunters who knew nothing about it and believed
they were in the depths of savagery ! Suddenly,
climbing this long hill, they come on walks and
flower-gardens. They think they are going mad,
and look down at their dirty, torn clothes to
reassure themselves. And then they reach the
top and come in sight of the house. It would
take a long time to persuade them that it was
not an Aladdin's palace."

"Enter the party," said Lady Flora, pointing
to three riders and a regiment of boys who had
halted at the far side of the lawn. Presently
three sunburnt men had joined the rest, and
were assailed with inquiries, whose makers, like
Pilate, did not stay for an answer.
"What sport 2" Lady Flora asked Hugh.
"Good. Fifteen head of buck and two lions.
I got one and Akhub the other, but I was
chivvied by both. And you? Did you find
Melissinde 2 "
"No. She doesn't live in the valley. We've
been all day in the Tropics listening to Barbara's
poetry. I want to see your lions, and you've got
to give me a skin. Since you broke our compact
you must pay toll, you know."
It was a milder evening than had yet been
enjoyed at Musuru, and after dinner the party
sat in the inner hall watching a young moon
climbing that immense arch of sky which is only
given by a hill-top prospect.
"I feel as if I were in a lighthouse," Lady
Warcliff said, with an air which invited con-
tradiction. "I almost expect to hear the horn
of some great ship down below in the fog. If
only each hot country had been given a habitable
mountain, they would be the only places in the

world to live in. On the ordinary upland you
dominate the flat country because you are higher
up, but here we also look down on the plain
because we are wholesome and cool and sane and
they are fevered. We are a lighthouse to the
whole of Equatoria, and if there were fifty other
lighthouses in the Empire there would be no
tropical problem."
Lady Flora and Hugh had discovered a small
couch out of the area of both firelight and lamp-
light and close to the windows, which were lit
from without by the pale glimmer of the moon.
Here they had a vantage-ground for seeing the
faces of the others.
"I do so wish," whispered the girl, "that they
wouldn't all talk in paragraphs. Either let them
chatter in a friendly way or let Mr Carey or
Lord Appin say all that has got to be said
themselves."
"Hush," said Hugh, for Carey from the fire-
place was beginning to speak.
"So far," he said, "we have discussed the
relation of Imperialism to current politics at
home. We have looked, too, at the essential
features of the new constitution which must some
day take the place of the old. And now we
come to the details of administration, and the
first and greatest of these problems is that of

our tropical dependencies. For whatever the
development of the free Colonies, they can never
share in it. The central executive of the Empire
will change its character, but it can never change
its task. The direct responsibility for tropical
administration will always rest with it. The
burden of the Tropics can never be shared with
local and responsible legislatures; for they can
never be wholly settled by the white man, but
must remain largely in the hands of races for
whom autonomy is unthinkable, at any rate for
the next century or two.
"If that is so, clearly the Tropics will furnish
all the administrative problems which are not
concerned with the common services of the
Empire. The work of our imperial executive
will be the joint problems of the whole Empire
plus the day-to-day administration of our tropical
dependencies in Asia, Africa, and America. This
last will be no light business, and must be taken
seriously. I am not a great believer in the cant
of expert knowledge in politics. Efficiency is apt
to be either a meaningless catchword or a stupid
worship of professionalism. But our tropical
administration must be based on expert know-
ledge, for in our everyday life in Europe we
have no experience, no inherited body of ideas,
which is in any way applicable. It is a thing by

itself, governed by other rules than those which
sway popular government.
"We have already decided that it will be the
test of the capacity of democracy for empire if it
can accept the abrogation of its claim over some
part of the territory under its control and trust
its servants. I do not believe that democracy
will be found wanting. The danger, to my mind,
is far more that its trusted servants may be
inadequate to the task. For it is above all
things work which demands a clear eye and
a steady head, and in which supineness and
pedantry will spell disaster. The great adminis-
trative questions of the future will be tropical
questions. The Tropics will be the training-
ground of our great officials. It is high time,
therefore, that we tried to get at some scientific
understanding of our responsibilities. If expert
knowledge and not a mere handful of moral
platitudes is to be our guide, we must take steps
to systematise and develop that knowledge.
"We are not without precedents. Both France
and Germany have set the example in founding
schools of what they call "colonial science."
And four centuries ago our own Hakluyt urged
something of the same kind. The risk is that
we allow ourselves to be misled by the case of
India, where we have made a great success by

a kind of accident. We send out raw boys to
that service, and in a year or two they are
efficient administrators. Yes, but the same rule
will not hold everywhere. India is a long-settled
country, which runs by herself. We control,
amend here and there, give her the benefit of
our protection, but we do not really interfere.
The social machine in its essentials is inde-
pendent of us. It is quite a different matter
in lands where the fabric of civilisation has to
be built up from the beginning. There you
have no rules to go by, except your own
wits; and knowledge is the only dividing line
between success and failure. We must take
up the business very seriously, and equip our-
selves resolutely for the work. I do not propose
to weary you with suggestions, for it is no part
of our programme to burrow among details. But
two points I would insist upon. The first is,
that we must take steps to give our people the
best possible training for the work they are
going to. I want to see imperial colleges
established where young men will be taught
tropical medicine, and surveying, and natural
history and ethnology, where, in a word, the
long experience of the Empire will be con-
centrated into precepts. And the second is,
that we must provide for reciprocity between

the home and the foreign services, so that the
man in the Colonial or the Foreign Office may
have first-hand experience of his own to guide
him, and the man at the outposts may know
the ways of the home office, and may keep in
touch with home politics. At present the two
branches are cursed with a confusion of tongues,
and speak a different language, though they may
mean the same thing. A boy who goes into the
civil service in England would under my scheme
go out automatically in five years to a minor
post in some dependency, and return after some
years of service to a higher post at home. By
this means our governors and our permanent
secretaries would be of the same class, with
the same training, each sympathising with and
understanding the other's work. There would
be some kind of solidarity in imperial adminis-
tration, and when the wheels go smoothly they
go faster and farther."
Lord Appin had joined the group at the
window, and was gently pinching Lady Flora's
ear.
"You know the Tropics, Francis," he said.
"I don't suppose there is any hot country on
earth you haven't been to. Tell me, are they
ever going to change their character? Will
white men and women ever be able to live in

them in reasonable comfort? Or are they to
be a permanent Purgatory to which we resort
for our souls' good?"
"We discussed that question at lunch to-day,"
said Lady Flora. "Mr Wakefield said they
were merely Purgatory, but most of us thought
them more like the Garden of Eden. They
make Barbara and Letty feel wicked, and Mr
Astbury sleepy, and they make me very, very
thirsty."
"Well, what do you propose to do with them,
Francis ?" said Lord Appin again. "Are they
to be a kind of Botany Bay for penitential souls,
or, in your own words, are they some day to
blossom as the rose?"
Carey smiled. "I think Alastair and Sir
Edward are the best authorities," he said.
"We will ask them what they think. My
own opinion is, that we can improve them all,
even the worst parts, up to a certain point.
That is to say, we can make them habitable
by white men and women for a year or two
at a stretch. But that is not enough to secure
continuity in development, and here is where
the doctrine of the vantage-grounds appears,
which Sir Edward was explaining to me the
other morning. Teddy, expound, please."
That gentleman rose courageously from a long

arm-chair where he had been stretching legs
wearied with the day's riding. Leaning against
the mantelpiece, somewhat in the fashion of a
giraffe against a palm-tree, he embarked on his
explanation.
"I was much struck by what Lady Warcliff
said after dinner to-night. She wanted a light-
house like Musuru in every tropical colony, and
she said that if you had such a thing their
problems would be settled. Well, I mean the
same thing, only I call it a vantage-ground
instead of a lighthouse. We needn't trouble
about the seaside strips of land, because either
they are swamps and don't matter much, or the
sea winds make them fairly healthy. We can
also leave India out. It is fully developed, and
we know exactly how much it takes out of
the white man to plant him there. What I
want to say concerns Africa mainly, since it
is here that we have the great undeveloped
speculative dependencies.
"Let us call our possessions in Africa four—
north, east, west, and south. The first gives us
Egypt and the Sudan hinterland up to Gondokoro;
the second is the coast around Mombasa, this
plateau, and the trough of Equatoria; West
Africa is the coast around the Gulf of Guinea
and the hinterland of Nigeria; South Africa is

everything from Lake Nyasa and the Congo to
the Cape. Now some of these are white men's
countries, and in time are going to be colonies.
Some day we shall have the federation of South
Africa, and then the lowlands around the Zam-
besi—what we call North-west and North-east
Rhodesia and Nyasaland—will fall to be admin-
istered by the federal government. So, also, we
shall have the free colony of East Africa, with
its capital on this plateau, administering the low-
lands west and east of it. That is one possible
development. The other is that the colonies
occupy only the healthy country and leave the
lowlands as dependencies under the central ex-
ecutive. It doesn't particularly matter to my
argument what is going to happen. The point
is that wherever you have an unhealthy tropical
tract you have somewhere in the near neighbour-
hood a patch of white man's country.
"I expect you can all see a sort of map in your
mind. Well, first of all, in South Africa we
have high veld from the Cape to within a
hundred miles of the Zambesi, and round the
eastern coast we have the line of the Drakens-
berg running from Cape Colony right up to
Manicaland, so that we are never far from
healthy country. In Nyasaland we have the
Shiré Highlands, and in Barotseland we have

long stretches of pasture, with bracken and
hazels like England. I've hunted there, and
seen it with my own eyes. In East Africa we
have this gorgeous plateau as the vantage-
ground for the coast strip and for Uganda. In
North Africa we have Egypt as the vantage-
ground for the Sudan. It is not an upland, but
it is a place where Europeans can live and work
happily for years. In West Africa we have
nothing quite so good. But in a little while,
when we have railways and better roads, and
can house and feed our people better, there is no
reason why all the Nigerian uplands should not
be at least as healthy as the better parts of
India, if we except the hill stations."
"But the presence of a few wholesome square
miles in a territory will not prevent people from
sickening in the rest," said Mr Wakefield.
"No, but it will give them a place to rest and
recover in. Tropical administration must be
spasmodic — we must make up our minds for
that. But it need not be too spasmodic. If
the land is to be properly governed, and any
policy carried through to a finish, you must have
the same officials resident in the country for a
fair length of time. And, more important still,
you must see that they retain the mental and
bodily vigour which is necessary for all good

work. Now these vantage-grounds of ours will
enable us to secure this. By a merciful fate we
have been permitted to bag all the most habitable
parts of Africa. We have the great hot flats,
where life is hard, but where, if some kind of
civilisation is to penetrate, it must be through
Englishmen who live and work there. And next
door we have the health resorts where these
Englishmen can go when their vitality ebbs and
lay in a fresh supply, and where the greater
administrative problems can be thought out.
They will be what Simla is to India, the work-
shop of government. They are near enough to
be within hail of the lowlands, but they are in
another climate, and give a tired man the moral
and physical tonic he needs."
"Allah has indeed been merciful," said Lord
Appin. "But, my dear Teddy, your vantage-
grounds will not settle the problem of the Tropics.
You have to find the race of men who will tolerate
your régime of alternate sickness and health.
The average official will sigh too continually for
the fleshpots of the vantage-grounds, and instead
of carrying back with him to his station a fresh
supply of force he will carry only an unsettled
mind."
"Maybe. But he will be more unsettled if he
has to go home, seedy, every eighteen months or

so, and can never have his wife and family out.
I assume that the men will be keen on their job.
And this assumption is allowable, for the Tropics
have a tremendous fascination of their own. It is
only the loneliness which scares a man. If he
had a chance of seeing his kind oftener, and
keeping more in touch with civilisation, he would
have little fault to find with his life. I have met
scores of them, and a fellow has to be very stupid
if he does not feel the romance of making a new
country. In time he gets the place into his
bones, and the danger then is not of his losing
heart in his work, but his losing all interest in
home. We must keep both fires alight, other-
wise we become either like the Portuguese who
forgot Portugal, or like certain French colonists
who remember the boulevards all too clearly."
"I wonder how good a judge you are, Teddy,
said Lord Appin. "You like the wilds, I know;
but is it not rather in the way that the ordinary
city man tolerates the discomfort of his Scotch
shooting-box" He feels a certain pleasure in
the sensation, because he knows it will not last
long. But he would be a very sad man if he
had to make a lifetime of it. You go off for a
year or two, and enjoy yourself immensely, but
I wonder how much of the enjoyment comes from
the knowledge that you have always Hill Street

and Considine Abbey behind you somewhere,
awaiting your return ?"
"I suppose I shall never make you under-
stand," said Sir Edward dolefully. "Best ask
Carey."
"Oh, Francis follows the simple expedient of
turning the wilds into something much more
delectable than England. He has no right to
decide."
"I won't argue," said Carey, "because the
point is unarguable. Also Mrs Deloraine is
going to sing. But I live in hopes of convert-
ing Lord Appin to barbarism. After all a meta-
physician should be an adventurer."
Mrs Deloraine had gone to the piano and was
playing the opening chords of a Schumann air.
To her Lady Flora fluttered like a moth to a
candle, music having charms for her which were
at no time to be resisted. Lord Appin had sud-
denly discovered a new Louis Quinze cabinet,
and was devouring it with the keen eye of
the collector. Hugh drifted into the nearest
drawing-room, where he found the Duchess, and
was impounded for a game of cribbage, a taste
for which had always marked the noble house
whose name she bore.
"So far," she said, "the Tropics are the least
exhausting subject we have discussed. I suppose

it is because we are in them and know so much
by instinct that we can afford to leave most of
the platitudes unsaid. I thought Francis and
Sir Edward talked very good sense. But, you
know, they only gave us the rudiments of their
real opinions. Both of them want to make us
all have houses on these vantage-grounds, as
they call them, and live part of the year there,
and regard them as much our home as England.
Sir Edward preached me a long sermon about it
last year, just after George had taken a new
forest in Scotland. He wanted to know why he
didn't go farther afield, to some part of the
Empire, and set a good example. He said that
only one profession was left for our class—to be
the pioneers of a wider patriotism. I suppose he
was right. But I am old-fashioned, and I cannot
quite imagine myself an imperial lady. Till travel
becomes easier I would rather stay at home most
of my time, for running about the world, as
Francis does, is wearing to a woman. I am
middle-aged, and have very little vanity left,
but I would rather remain as I am. I can see
Sir Edward's imperial lady. She will have no
complexion, her voice will be rather high, and
her eyes always a little too bright. Not a very
comforting creature to live with !"
"You prefer Lady Considine !" Hugh asked.

"No, indeed. I don't defend Blanche. Per-
haps when we have reached a further stage of
development women will be able to live up and
down the world and yet keep their restfulness.
But at present the nomad woman is still some-
thing of an excrescence. She is a 'sport,' out-
side our normal development, and therefore high-
coloured and shrill. As for Blanche, she is a

own. Is she a friend of yours, Mr Somerville 7"
"No. She asks me to dinner, but I don't often

universe."
"And yet, if you had seen her ten years ago,
you could not have escaped falling in love with
her. Everybody did, even George, who is as
blind as an owl to female beauty. She was the
most exquisite girl I have ever seen. With her
bright hair and melting eyes she floated through
a room like a creature from another world. No
one knew that she was stupid, for her face mes-
merised everybody, even women. Sir Edward
was the great parti of his time, and she naturally
married him. Happily they are both miracles of
good-humour, so they put up with each other
fairly well. But they haven't an idea or a taste

in common. She would like him to stay at home
and get into the Cabinet, and give great parties
at Considine, and generally move in the sphere
of life where she is conscious of shining. He
considers that Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
Damascus, are better than all the waters of
Israel. I used to think her a fool, but I am
not so dogmatic now. She is intensely clever
in her own way—an eider-down quilt, as you
justly remarked. If Sir Edward were not a born
Esau she would have smothered him long ago.
Her whole life is one devout prostration before
conventional shrines, with her orthodox opinions,
her soft downcast eyes, her gentle voice, her
elaborate and extravagant prettiness. If that
marriage was made in heaven, the gods were in
a comic mood. And yet they love each other
after a fashion."
"Who love each other ?" said Lady Flora,
bearing down upon the cribbage-players like a
privateer on harmless merchantmen. "I hope
you mean Mr Wakefield and me, for I am going
to propose to him to-morrow."
"I trust he won't accept you, my dear," said
the Duchess, "for he will go to prison for bigamy
if he does. He is married already—to an enor-
mous American."
The girl sank upon the couch. "I never loved

a dear gazelle," she began, when the gazelle in
question appeared in the offing.
"To-morrow," said Mr Wakefield, in the tone
of a dying gladiator, "we are going down to the
lake and are going to cross in Carey's steam-
launch. We are not to be allowed to content
ourselves with theorising about the Tropics, but
are to make practical experiments in them. The
only consolation is that we shall get our mail at
Port Florence. I am charged to say that the
outgoing post leaves first thing in the morning,
and that everybody must have their letters
ready to-night."

CHAPTER VII.
ABOUT noon of the following day the party
found themselves shepherded on board a trim
little vessel which lay moored a hundred yards
from the jetty of Port Florence. Thick awnings
warded off the sun; the deck, with its white
wood and gleaming brass, was as trim as the
parlour of a Dutch housewife; a light breeze
ruffled the blue water and fluttered among the
feathery palm-leaves on the shore. Steam had
been got up, and five minutes after embarking
they were gliding through the hot shallows to
the mouth of the bay. The sound of ship's bells
and the airy freshness of the deck delighted the
guests with a mingled sense of homeliness and
strangeness. The arrival of a large English mail
provided abundant occupation for, at any rate,
the early hours of the voyage.
The women wore the lightest of gowns and
the men were in flannels. Lady Warcliff, as the
daughter of an admiral, assumed a proprietary

air when her feet trod a deck, though she was a
bad sailor and abhorred the sea. Faithful to her
duty, she carried off Carey on a tour of inspec-
tion, leaving her letters at the mercy of any
vagrant wind which cared to bear them to the
fishes of Lake Victoria. The Duchess, in a deck-
chair, opened her correspondence with the rapidity
of a conjuror, and distributed fragments of infor-
mation to Lady Flora and Mrs Wilbraham, who,
having had small mails, were busy with a bundle
of home papers.
"George is in Scotland. He says the weather
is dreadful, and that he has had nothing from
the river but three small grilse. How vexa-
tious ! I know exactly what will happen.
He will get no more, and then he'll spend the
whole winter doing calculations how many
hundreds these grilse cost him a pound. . . .
Pamela has gone to Ireland with Mary Daventer.
Flora, I wonder what mischief your mother
will do there? She is much too theatrical to
be allowed to dabble in politics, for she would
turn a parish council into a Guy Fawkes conspir-
acy. . . . Eve Nottingham has written a book,
purporting to be the letters of a Japanese wife
to her English mother-in-law. What will that

theme. She might as well write the letters of
a Coptic greengrocer to his Abyssinian grand-
mother. I suppose it will be the usual erotic
outpouring, which the newspapers will call 'in-
timate' and 'poignant,' and well-brought-up
girls won't be allowed to read. . . . The Prime
Minister has made a good speech about either
criminal aliens or Jerusalem artichokes—I can-
not read Georgiana's writing, and Violet Hex-
ham is going to marry her chauffeur. Really,
English news is very tiresome. How glad I

Mrs Wilbraham arose with an air of tragedy,
sombrely brandishing 'The Times.' "A disaster
of the first magnitude has befallen the Empire
Sir Herbert Jupp has made a speech."
"Where did the horrid affair take place?"
Lord Appin asked.
"At the annual dinner of the Amalgamated
Society of South African Operators' Benevolent
Fund, when Sir Herbert was the guest of the
evening. He said—I quote "The Times'—that
"we had suffered too long from the tyranny of
the foreigner, and that it was high time we
began to get a little of our own back. The

steel' (it sounds as if the children were going
to have a lively time of it). 'Against a united
empire,' says Sir Herbert, "no powers of dark-
ness can prevail. We fling back the jealousy
and hate of the globe in its teeth, content with
the affection of our own kinsfolk. We have
truckled too long before the insolence of Europe.

world, remembering its God-given mission and
its immortal destiny. If the Lord be for us

Lady Flora had been reading a Liberal paper.
"Here's another man who appeals to high
Heaven. On Friday, August 2, in the Ber-
mondsey Tabernacle, the Reverend Doctor Price-
Morgan delivered what this paper calls an
'electric appeal, instinct with a certain fine
quality.' I see that he describes the Empire as
a 'blood-stained monument of human folly,' and
he calls imperialists men "without conscience,
without honour, without patriotism, without
God.' I hope you recognise your portrait, Sir
Edward. 'Let us,' he says, "destroy the ac-
cursed thing and return to the old simple paths
whence we strayed." Can he mean Elizabethan
piracy? He concludes nobly with "A nation

without a conscience is like a man groping in
the dark on the verge of a precipice." Will
somebody explain to me about the Noncon-
formist Conscience 2"
"The Nonconformist Conscience, my dear,"
said Lord Appin, "is too big a thing to be de-
fined casually at mid-day on a tropical lake.
It is the name which most people give to the
particular national failing from which they
happen to be exempt. Under its shade the
militant freethinker and the gentle pietist lie
down like lambs together. Very often it has
nothing to do with conscience. Certain people
choose to defend certain things, in which they
believe by appealing to morals and religion,
when the real reason of their belief is some-
thing quite different. In these cases it is a
mannerism of speech rather than of thought.
With many it is a condemnation of certain
gross and robust shortcomings to which they
are not inclined, by means of which they dis-
tract attention from their own less masculine
vices of lying, dishonesty, and cowardice. With
those of a particular religious persuasion it can
best be described, I think, as the homage which
a feeble present pays to a strong past. At one
time with Nonconformists rested the liberties
of England, and nobly they fought the battle.

Their lives were one long protest against wicked-
ness and folly in high places. But the times
passed, and our own day of easy tolerance
dawned, when the only disability which Dissent
has to endure is a social one and the worst
accusation brought against it is vulgarity. But
the honest fellows still maintain their air of
shrill protest and unwearying dissidence. The
burning wrongs of their forefathers, which were
also the wrongs of England, have become petty
discomforts which it requires an acute mind to
discover, but the rhetoric is as vivid as ever.
The attitude may seem an anachronism and a
parody, but I prefer to look kindly upon it as a
belated concession to romance. It is the tribute
of the prosperous middle-class, seeking to make
the best of both worlds, to the grim Ironside
and Anabaptist who relinquished all to win the
Kingdom of Heaven."
"Why not call it hypocrisy %" said Mrs
Wilbraham. "It is precisely the quality which
makes us the contempt of our European neigh-
bours—an austere creed with a practice limp-
ing far in the rear."
"Because," said Lord Appin, "no summary
definition does justice to so complex a trait.
It is the old desire to make an omelette with-
out breaking eggs, and the curious thing is

that we can discern in it both a firm intention
to make the omelette at any cost and a sincere
conviction that it is infamous to sacrifice a single
egg in the process. Were both feelings equally
strong we should be in a perpetual state of sus-
pended animation. Only the inborn practicality
of our race puts the weight on the former, and
so—under protest—we advance. Till we learn
to think clearly we shall always have the con-
flict between the two, yet till our vitality
perishes the first will always carry the day."
Lord Launceston had come aft from watching
the shore of the bay through a field-glass and
had found a seat beside the Duchess.
"I differ," he said, "in rating most highly
the confused moral instinct which you condemn.
However illogical, however vexatious in its effects,
I would not for worlds see it disappear from our
national life. There may be hypocrisy in it, but
there is also a tremendous reality. It is a con-
cession not so much to tradition as to eternal
principles of conduct, and in its essence it is not
nonconformist but conformist. It is the force of
social persistence, which counteracts the extra-
vagant flights of our national energy. The result
is that any new movement is compelled to carry
with it this heavy ballast before it can succeed,
and originality is made safe and practical. It

is the underlying earnestness of the country,
which, because it believes enormously in its creed,
is conservative and eager to repel assaults. Eng-
land is in consequence slow to convince; but
once convinced, she moves with unique impetus,
just as a strong stream may take longer to divert
into a new channel than a rill, but when diverted
is a far greater force at command."
"What value can there be in the attitude of
some canting rascal of an employer who grinds
down his workpeople and protests piously all the
while against what he calls 'servile conditions'
of labour in some other place : " Sir Edward sat
on the bulwarks with a broad Panama hat on
his head and a cigar in his mouth, his air sug-
gestive of anything but nonconformity or con-
science.
"No value in the man, who will certainly lose
his soul, but much in what he stands for. The
mere fact that a rogue pretends to a conviction
is a sign that there is a preponderating majority
of honest men who sincerely hold it. Cancel all
the hypocrisy, and you will still find an immense
deal of sound moral instinct. I grant you it is
often wrong, hopelessly wrong; but the instinct
is right, it is only the application that is faulty.
The remedy is to educate and persuade, not to
sneer and override. The truth will always

prevail, if we can only put it with sufficient
clearness."
Lady Amysfort's eyebrows had gone up during
these words. "Is Saul also among the pro-
phets?" she asked in that cool voice with the
tinkle of ice in it, which was the despair of her
enemies. "I little thought I should live to hear
Lord Launceston defend Nonconformist ethics.
To me the notion that any conviction must be
respected merely because it happens to be honest
is one of the many Whig superstitions that have
been long ago exploded. Another is that you
cannot kill a heresy by persecution, but must
only encourage it. The truth is that you can
stamp out a heresy for ever if you persecute it
with sufficient vigour, provided it has none of the
stuff of life in it. And equally our business is to
ignore utterly convictions, however honest, unless
they happen to be also intelligent. I am bound
to say that in my researches in the dark place
of Dissent I have rarely found the conjunction."
Lord Launceston laughed. "You give away
your case, Caroline, by admitting that the heresy
you are going to stamp out must not have the
stuff of life in it. I agree. Crush out all the
trumpery crazes as relentlessly as you please.
Only beware of a living conviction, for it will be
too much for you. I am wholly against the

childishness that would flatter and cringe before
fads which should be knocked on the head. All
the more reason, therefore, why one should be
respectful to the things that matter. If you
were faithful to your Tory principles, you would
recognise in this 'conscience' one of the abiding
instincts of our race, which statesmanship, on
your own admission, must reckon with. A very
good working test, whether a conviction is living
or not, is the number of people who share it.
It is not an infallible rule, but if you find any
large proportion of reasonable average men hold-
ing a view, it is worth while taking it seriously.
And remember that this much criticised moral
anxiety is a weapon which may be used on our
own side. If your opponent has a sharp sword,
it is wiser to annex it for your own use than to
destroy it. Our business is to enlist this moral
fervour on behalf of what we regard as truth
and righteousness."
The luncheon - bell began to ring as Lord
Launceston ceased speaking. As the heat of
the sun was now very great, the afternoon found
the company indisposed to exertion, physical or
mental, and inclined to long deck-chairs in the
shade and the lightest of romances. Towards
five o'clock, however, there was a general awak-
ening when it became clear that the yacht was

approaching the farther shore. Lady Warcliff
sat in the bows with a Zeiss glass, staring with
eagle eye, like Cortes, at a wooded hill which
began to loom out of the haze. A crowd of land
birds—flamingoes, cranes, herons, and brilliant-
backed ducks—played the part of sea-gulls, and
thronged around the yacht. Land odours, chiefly
the smell of wood-smoke, were drifted out to the
travellers.
Carey, who had disappeared all afternoon on
some private business, now came on deck and
stood by the bulwarks looking at the sunset.
Hugh joined him, and together they watched
the riot of crimson and saffron in the sky kindle
the olive-green forests till the tree-tops glowed
like jewels. The marshes which fringed the lake
were caught up into the pageant and smouldered
with strange fires of tawny gold.
Carey drew a long breath. "It is Antony's
dream come true," he said. "See, there are all
the elements—the fantastic clouds,
'The forkéd mountain and blue promontory.'
Look, now, for you will see the colours wiped
clean out of the world as the sun dips."
It happened as he said, for it seemed as if a
great curtain were suddenly let down upon the
landscape. The light and colour ran out of the

foreground. Soon the waters were dull grey,
though the forests still burned. Then the forests
were quenched, though the highest trees had gold
crowns and the far ridge of hills. These faded
in turn, and in a grey world the yacht came to
her moorings in the little bay of Entoro. The
dinghies were lowered and the company went
ashore.
They were met on the beach by the whole
population of the place, led by a tall oldish man
with grey whiskers, whom Carey introduced as
the Reverend Alexander Macdowall, in charge
of the Scotch Mission. He led them to a low,
white, barrack-like building, which was an ap-
pendage to the mission-house, and which Carey
used as a lodge on the occasion of his visits. It
was found to be severely but comfortably fur-
nished, and the yacht's servants having brought
up plate and linen and some of the minor com-
forts of civilisation, the company were soon
installed in quarters which might be regarded
as luxurious in any tropical town. The mosquito-
nets and the absence of fireplaces spoke of a
climate very different to Musuru ; but the night,
as it chanced, was not unduly warm. Save for
the humming of insects and that faint musty
smell which is inseparable from houses on which
for most of the year the sun beats hotly, the

dinner, cooked by the yacht's servants, might
have been served in some old-fashioned Scotch
shooting-box.
To the meal came Mr Macdowall, splendidly
habited in an antique suit of broadcloth. His
weathered face, his sharp and kindly blue eyes
set in a maze of wrinkles, and his spare, straight
figure made up a picture which took the eye as
something clean-cut and virile. His manner had
the spacious ease which the wilds give to those
who are not enslaved by them. He called Carey
"Francis," and adopted the company at once into
the circle of his friendship.
"I come from your own countryside, Lord Ap-
pin," he said, in answer to a question; "I have
not been back for ten years, and I question if I
could return. I have made my own place here,
and I could not endure interference very readily
again. I daresay at home I should even be fall-
ing out with the police. Besides, there's no need
to go back. I have no near relations, and the
thing I most cared for in Scotland was the fish-
ing. But I can get that here now, and I'm quite
content."
"What was the place like when you came 2"
Hugh asked.
"A den of cut-throats," said the missionary.
"Tribe warring against tribe, the land raided by

Arab slave-dealers, and no man knowing when
he woke in the morning if he should see another.
I lived through three massacres of Christians and
half-a-dozen native wars, and by-and-by the
place settled down. England began to hear
about the lakes, and we had travellers and
hunters visiting us, and things began to get a
little better. Our work had been much blessed
—not in the ordinary sense, ye understand, for
there were few converts of the real sort, but we
had driven some habits of industry and decency
into the people. It was a hard life in those
days, for we had little but native food, and our
medicines often ran short. I had a good deal
of blackwater fever, and several times I was
nearly dead with it. I remember all those days
I could not get the thought of the Ochils out
of my head—yon fine, green, clean country with
a well-head in every howe. Out on the knoll
where I had my hut I could see on clear days
the long blue line of the Mau, where Musuru
stands now. It used to comfort me to look at
it. I knew there was a cool blessed country up
there, and many a time I said over the psalm
to myself, 'I will lift up mine eyes unto the
hills, from whence cometh my help.' I was con-
vinced that the regeneration of this place could
only come from the heights."

"And did it !" some one asked.
"To be sure. Francis came, and at last we
had a man in this feckless country. I am not
going to bring the blushes to the cheek of my
old friend, but you will believe me when I tell
you that he put new life into the whole land.
All the industries here are his starting. He
has more influence among natives than any man
since Livingstone. And then he has Musuru,
that city set upon a hill-top, to which we can
all go for advice and rest."
"The rainbow trout will be ready for you next
month," said Carey.
"I'll be there," said the old man, chuckling.
"This is Central Africa. And yet in two days
I can get up to a Scotch glen, with bracken to
catch your flies in, and I can get as good trout
out of the pools with a black hackle as ever I
got in the Devon. It is all the refreshment I
ask for. Give me a day now and then with my
rod, and I'm prepared to bide in this vineyard
till my call comes."
Now it chanced that nearest Mr Wakefield's
heart lay a passion for fly-fishing, and when the
meal was over he claimed Mr Macdowall for a
highly technical conversation. The party broke
into groups: two rubbers of bridge were organ-
ised, and the others wandered into the verandah,

beneath which the lake gleamed faintly under
a young moon. Marjory Haystoun, fired with
a sudden zeal for adventure, started with Mrs
Wilbraham for the shore, regardless of a heavy
dew and the thinness of her evening shoes; but
the pair were summarily recalled by Mr Astbury,
who spoke darkly of fever. By - and - by the
bridge ended, and Mr Macdowall, tearing him-
self from a discourse on tiger-fish, made his
farewells.
"I've done what you told me, Francis," he
said to Carey. "The chiefs will come in early
in the morning, and you can hold your palaver
with them after breakfast. The white folk will
be at the kirk at eleven to hear what you have
got to say. I daresay I'm breaking my ordination
vows—resigning my pulpit to a notorious heretic
like you, but a little heresy once in a way does
the world good. It's like an artificial flee, and
excites the appetite if it does not satisfy the
hunger."
The Duchess, who was a pillar of the Estab-
lishment, was relieved to learn next morning
at breakfast that the whole party proposed to
attend church, but she was a little dismayed to
hear that the service was to consist of an address
from their host. Her dismay was not lessened

by the discovery that it was to be preceded by
a gathering of native chiefs to present their
respects to Carey.
"Surely it is scarcely work for a Sunday
morning," she complained. "I dislike mixing
up politics and religion. Besides, Francis is not
in orders, he is not even a lay reader, and I
know that he holds the most terrible opinions
about the bishops. One of them told me that
he always felt that Francis might pat him on
the head if he said anything he agreed with,
and tell him he was a good boy. I am not in
the least afraid of natives, but I object to sit
in the midst of a circle of hundreds. I shall
feel too like an early Christian."
"Some time ago, Susan," said Carey, "I be-
lieve you occupied a conspicuous position on a
platform at the Albert Hall. You were then in
the midst of a circle not of hundreds but of
thousands, and you showed no anxiety. You
will find very little difference in the spectators
to-day except that they have better manners,
and are on the whole better to look at. I
ought to say, however, that they will all be
armed. I will not have these people meet me
except as free men, and in this country it is
the badge of a free man to carry spear and
shield."

The ordeal turned out to be of the mildest
kind. The party were conducted to a spot a
few hundred yards from the beach, where they
found a semicircle of black warriors gathered
around a little green hill. The chiefs stood to
attention as they approached, and saluted in
silence. But when Carey, who came a little
later, ascended the mound he was greeted with
a shout of welcome and a raising of spear-points
skywards, which made the women shiver and
flushed Lady Flora's cheek with excitement.
"That is the royal salute," Hugh whispered.
"I wonder how many tribes in the continent give
him that. He once told me he thought he had
over thirty native names, and they are all
flattering."
Carey sat down on a tree trunk, and the
spokesman of the chiefs approached him. In
the main he spoke their own tongue, but for
those who used a special dialect he had a boy
from the Mission to interpret. So far as the
party could follow, the discussion was mainly
about crops and stock diseases. There was some
talk of a tribal disturbance on the western border,
and once when a decision seemed to be questioned,
Carey's slow, quiet tones changed to a sharp com-
mand, and the watchers saw his mouth harden.
Sitting there among his own people, his massive

figure and brooding face had a superb air of
authority. All the men—Wakefield, Lord Appin,
Lord Launceston, even Sir Edward—seemed to
shrivel in the contrast, like beings out of their
proper sphere.
"I never realised before how handsome he
was," Lady Flora said to Hugh. "He came to
dine with us in London in July, and I remember
thinking that his clothes did not fit and that he
carried himself badly. I could not help compar-
ing him with a colonel in the Guards, who was
also dining and who had the most beautiful
straight figure. But out here he looks like a
king. No one could be afraid of my Guards-
man, but I cannot imagine any one disobeying
Mr Carey. It is that massive head of his which
overawes one like a mountain."
The business did not take long. Carey spoke
a few final words slowly and impressively in a
native tongue, there was a low murmur of
applause, and the indaba was over. The party
walked back silently to the mission-house, where
they found the whole population of the settle-
ment assembling. Besides the Mission staff
there were a number of teachers from the in-
dustrial school, a contingent of local traders
and planters, and a few Government officials.
Carey knew every one by name, and was full

of kindly inquiries. Most of them had been his
guests at Musuru, and his greetings were those
of a popular country squire with his neighbours
at meet or market.
The little whitewashed mission church was
filled to overflowing. The Duchess had rarely
in her life felt at a loss, but the air of the gather-
ing made her nervous. There was a Sabbatical
hush in the audience, which suggested a religious
service, but none of the accessories of church were
present. Mr Macdowall entered and sat down
on the chair commonly reserved for the choir-
master, where he proceeded to take snuff and
gaze at the audience through benevolent spec-
tacles. Then came Carey, who ascended the small
pulpit, cleared away a Bible and a water-bottle
which stood on the book-board, and, standing
erect with his hands in his pockets, thus ad-
dressed his hearers—
"This is not a service, so we need waste no
time in preliminaries. I have asked you to come
here to-day because I wanted to meet you face to
face and say certain things to you. We are all
fellow-workers in one cause, though we call it by
different names. I am older than most of you,
and I have had a wider experience than most of
you, so my views on the things which most deeply
concern you may possibly be of some little assist-

ance. I am not going to talk to you about
theology, but what I have to say is vitally con-
cerned with religion. Whatever our creeds—
and I daresay Macdowall would scarcely credit
me with any—we are all serious men, and in our
various ways, as far as our imperfect light allows,
we may claim to be seeking the kingdom of God
and His righteousness."
"Ye're mistaken, Francis," Mr Macdowall in-
terrupted; "ye're lamentably unsound in the

Carey's face relaxed into a smile. "Well, then,
I will take advantage of this testimonial, and talk
to you in this church about secular things. Every
country and every group of men have some special
problem of their own. They have dozens of
problems, of course, but there is always one
which may be considered the centre of gravity,
and on this it is their business to concentrate
their attention, for on its settlement depends the
settlement of all the others. Your business, on
which everything else depends, is the wise man-
agement of the native peoples that live round
about you. For every white man there are forty
or fifty natives, and yet in your hands lies the
administration and on your head is the respon-
sibility for the future of the country. You have

to fight against ignorance, stupidity, and bar-
barism. So has all the world; but you have
the tremendous advantage that you have your
foes in concrete shape before your eyes and know
exactly what you have to get to grips with. In
England we have the same enemies, but we can-
not see them, and we have first of all to go and
hunt for them; and there is a perpetual difference
of opinion as to which is which — some calling
ignorance honesty and stupidity wisdom. You
are spared all this fuss. You know what
brutality is and what decency is. You have
got to convert the one into the other.
"I am going to talk to you to-day about the
two extremes we have to avoid. The first is the
danger of underrating the status of the black
man, and the second is the still greater danger
of overrating it. As to the first, I know that
most of you feel strongly about certain recent
changes which have been made in the criminal
law. Well, I was largely responsible for these
changes, and I am here to defend and explain
them. You argue, some of you, that the native
is a child and must be treated as a child and pun-
ished at the discretion of his master, who stands to
him in loco parentis. You maintain that to make
native discipline depend upon the cumbersome
machinery of a court of law is to make it a farce.

Who, you ask, when his servant offends will be
at the pains to take him before a magistrate?
He will either take the law into his own hands,
which will be bad for the discipline of the State,
or he will let the matter pass, which will ruin
the discipline of his household. That may be
so, but if he follows the latter course he will
have only himself to thank, and if he follows
the first he will be punished. And the reason
is that we dare not underrate the status of the
native. You may repeat that he is a child, but
the law must look upon him not as a potential
but as an actual citizen, and must give him the
dignity of such. He must stand before it as an
equal with the white man—not a social equal
or a political equal, but a legal equal. It is the
State and not the individual that has the main
interest in his development, and therefore to the
State must be left the responsibility. To place it
with the private citizen is to give him a burden
more heavy than he can bear, and to expose him
to those temptations towards brutality and in-
justice and caprice which may end in his own
degradation. The State rightly refuses to allow
such risks. With it rests the sole duty of punish-
ment. But—and here I speak to practical men
who will not, I think, misunderstand me—what
after all is the meaning of law It is the norm

of conduct framed to suit average circumstances.
A man must comply with it or pay the penalty,
but sometimes it may be right to pay the penalty
and break it. I may prevent a man in a public
street from doing something disgraceful but not
criminal, and I may be guilty of assault in the
process. I am justified in breaking the law, and
the law is right in fining me. There are a
thousand conceivable cases when legal docility
is a moral disgrace or a practical folly. Every
man must have clearly before him his duty as a
citizen. If he breaks the law he must be clear
that his warrant is sound both as regards his
own conscience and the State to which he owes
obedience. Especially is this the case with the
new law as to the rights of natives. It does not
prevent a white man in emergencies from making
a law for himself, but by its prohibition it compels
him to be very certain about his justification.
It will, I trust, put an end to caprice and en-
courage fair dealing, for he who breaks it can
only appeal to the last and most rigorous of
tribunals. -
"The second danger is that you conceive of
the native status as higher than it really is.
This fault will be committed by the idealists
among you, as the other will be the error of the
practical man. And yet I have often found

idealists and practical men alike doing homage
to what I can only think is a false conception
of native development. The native's mind is
sharp and quick, his memory is often prodigious,
and he has histrionic and mimetic gifts which
may mislead his teachers. But for all that he
stands at a different end of the scale of develop-
ment from the white man. He represents the
first stage of humanity, and he has to travel
a long way before he can reach that level which
we roughly call our civilisation. You cannot an-
nihilate ten strenuous centuries by assuming that
they have not existed, and inviting the native
to crowd the work of them into a year or two.
Between his mind at its highest and ours at
its lowest there is a great gulf fixed, which is
not to be crossed by taking thought. It is less
a difference in powers—for he has powers as
remarkable often as our own — as in mental
atmosphere, the conditions under which his
mind works, and consequently the axioms of
his thought. He will learn gladly what we
have to teach him, and you will imagine that
the lesson of civilisation has been learned, when
suddenly you are pulled up by some piece of
colossal childishness which shows that that mind
whose docility you have admired has been moving
all the time in a world a thousand years distant

from your own. We must recognise this gulf
and frame our education accordingly. At bottom,
and for obvious reasons, the native mind is
grossly materialistic. The higher virtues and
what we call "spirituality" are radically unin-
telligible to it, though it may learn to claim
them and to talk their jargon. We must begin,
therefore, with the first things, if we do not
wish to get a dishonest parrot-like adherence to
creeds which are not understood and have no
power to influence life. I think there is more
need for imagination and insight and foresight
in a missionary among the black races than in
most statesmen, for he has to study a mind
and character most alien to our own and select
from the vast storehouse of our civilisation the
kind of nourishment suited to it.
"Remember that education is a thing which
must take its colour from the needs that it is
provided to satisfy. Your business is to incul-
cate in the native mind the elements of citizen-
ship and Christian morality. It can only be
done by degrees, but for heaven's sake begin
with the truths that matter, and never mind
the frillings for the moment. Get your founda-
tions laid deep and solid. Preach the Atone-
ment and the Fatherhood of God, and leave
out your fancy dogmas. Teach the children to

read and write, but do not aim at higher educa-
tion, for that means black parsons and black
schoolmasters, and for that class the market is
overstocked, and they are outcasts from the
society of those whom they would claim as in-
tellectual equals. Above all things teach them
trades and handicrafts and the simple laws of
a decent life. It is not our business, as I keep
telling my friends, to create a new heaven but
to create a new earth. Get these strange, sullen,
childish, dark-skinned people hammered into a
peaceable and prosperous society, and you have
laid the foundation of all the virtues. Teach
them the elements of cleanliness and comfort
and you will find them already grounded in
honesty and loyalty; and you may soon get
them to take their place in our complex system,
—low down, of course, but still indubitably
within it. Don't try and make out of them
theologians or schoolmasters or bagmen or
electioneering humbugs. Leave the scum of
civilisation for civilisation to deal with. You
have still, thank Heaven a simple community:
keep it simple so long as you can, for it is
on simple lines alone that it can make true
progress.

say, by slow methods, and we shall be dead and
buried long before the results come. Your com-
plaint would be just if your only task were native
administration. But it is not. You have the
economic and political development of the land
to think of, and you have your own future, for
there is a white community growing up beside
the black. And remember that the presence of
the native races makes every man of you an
administrator. If you face your duty, every
white citizen will have the training of a pro-
consul, the same kind of problems to solve, the
same qualities of character in demand. That
is no small honour. What kind of race will
your sons be if they grow up with the sense of
civic duty alive in them, content to work slowly
because hopefully and long-sightedly : I am one
of the men who believe in the regeneration of
the African continent. When the world has
preached its lessons to her, she will also have
something to say to the world. I do not think
that the battles and the bloodshed, the young men
who never came back, the lonely graves in the
desert, the hopes crushed only to revive again—
I do not think that these will have been in vain.

Do you remember one of Pitt's perorations when
that austere statesman gave rein to his fancy
and delivered a prophecy whose justification
you and I still await? I commend its rhetoric
to you as a watchword. 'If we listen, he said,
'to the voice of reason and duty, and pursue
the line of conduct which they prescribe, some
of us may live to see the reverse of that picture,
from which we now turn our eyes with shame
and regret. We may live to behold the nations
of Africa engaged in the calm occupations of
industry, in the pursuits of a just and legitimate
commerce. We may behold the beams of science
and philosophy breaking in upon this land, which
at some happy period in still later times may
blaze with full lustre, and, joining their influence
to that of pure religion, may illuminate and in-
vigorate the most distant extremities of that
immense continent. Then may we hope that
even Africa, though last of all the quarters of
the globe, shall enjoy at length in the evening
of her days those blessings which have descended
so plentifully upon us in a much earlier period
of the world. Then also will Europe, participat-
ing in her improvement and prosperity, receive
an ample recompense for the tardy kindness—
if kindness it can be called—of no longer hinder-
ing that continent from extricating herself out

Late in the afternoon, as the yacht was once
again slipping through violet waters, and tea
was being served on deck, the Duchess found
herself beside Mr Wakefield.
"Francis is the oddest speaker of my acquaint-
ance," she said. "It is such a mixture of straight-
forward prose and ambiguous poetry. And yet
there is an art in it. You saw how he impressed
these people. My brother might have spoken
like an angel for hours without anything like
the effect that Francis had with a few abrupt
sentences. It is the man that does it. His
figure, with his hands in pockets, has such a
power about it, and such a past behind it, that
people listen not so much to what his voice says
as to his presence."
Mr Wakefield looked back to where the forests
and blue mountains of Entoro were growing faint
in the evening haze. "On the second day of my
visit," he said slowly, "I objected to the 'man
of destiny.' I withdraw that objection now.

At dinner the following evening Carey an-
nounced that the subject for discussion that
night was economic. A profound gloom fell on
the company.
"I hate the word," said the Duchess. "When
any one proposes some generous scheme the im-
mediate answer is that it is 'uneconomic.' I
believe that the whole thing is a false science,
invented by the trading classes to conceal their
own rapacity. They identify their penny-wise
cunning with the laws of nature and claim a
divine sanction for their misdeeds. Besides, I am
sick of the kind of argument we have heard so
much of for the past two years. To my mind
even the few economic laws which are certain
may very properly be overridden for the sake
of higher interests. You tell me that Protection
is good or bad economics, and I don't care a
fig. I want to know if it is good or bad
policy."

Lord Appin raised his eyebrows. "My dear
Susan, do my ears deceive me? What you say
is excellent Tory doctrine, which I have been
industriously preaching for many years. Carey,
living with you is turning all our heads. You
have made Susan a Tory and Launceston a
Dissenter."
"I am not going to ask you to talk Benthamite
economics," said Carey, "though there is a great
deal to be said for them. All I want you to do
is to look at the eternal problem which you find
in all States—riches and poverty, the use and
control of the one and the cure of the other.
It is an immense subject, and if we once get
among facts and figures we shall be in a hopeless
morass. At the same time there are general
principles here as elsewhere, and I think it is
possible to disentangle a few of them. To show
fully how the recognition of the possibilities of
empire will affect capital and labour would take
a man's lifetime. But I think we can say roughly
what the general line of the answer will be. I
promise you, Susan, you shall not hear a word
of orthodox jargon, for the excellent reason that
none of us know any, except Lord Appin, and he
doesn't believe in it."

itself with nothing else, I claim complete econo-
mic orthodoxy. My objection to the science is
that it tends to approximate in its methods to
theology. Its votaries are apt to make laws of
Sinai out of deductions from the commerce of a
single epoch, forgetting to distinguish between
what is sufficiently axiomatic to constitute a
general law and what is only true under special
and terminable conditions. Indeed, my chief com-
plaint against the science is that it is too loose
rather than too formal. My other complaint is
that it mistakes its vocation. It starts from highly
abstract data and builds up on them a structure
of ingenious puzzles. It erects into a real-phil-
osophie what is purely formal, and, forgetting the
abstraction of its starting-point, it imagines that
it has provided a philosophy of life. A few ele-
mentary lessons in the art of definition would
make the toil of economists of some use. As it
is, they spend much of their time in the agreeable
intellectual pastime of spinning cocoons. You
may say, so does the metaphysician. But he is
dealing with tremendous verities. And however
fallacious, however over-subtle he may be, the
magnitude of his task ennobles him. I cannot
find the same elevation in tracking the vagaries
of that quaint fiction the 'economic man.'"

discussion the party assembled after dinner in
the Blue Drawing-room, which of all the rooms
at Musuru was the most exquisite in its decora-
tions. Its fluted white walls were set with
panels of old turquoise-blue silk; the ceiling
was modelled on that of a famous chamber at
Versailles; the carpet was of rich white velvet
pile; the furniture was all copied from a boudoir
of Marie Antoinette. The books in the cabinets
and on the tables were bound in vellum or blue
morocco, and the few ornaments were of blue
Sèvres ware or old ivory. The one picture,
which hung over the chimney, was a Watteau
of blue-robed nymphs dancing under a great
expanse of spring sky. The lamps had shades
of ivory silk, and in the soft light the pure colours
swam in a delicate harmony as of a summer noon.
The scene was so strange and perfect that most
of the guests gave an involuntary gasp of ad-
miration. Even Mr Wakefield snorted when he
entered, and subjected the Watteau to the tribute
of a long and critical stare.
"We are told," said Carey, "that the Empire
is the dream of capitalism, and like every false-
hood the saying contains the perversion of a
truth. Large schemes over a large area require
money and an elaborate organisation. Imperial-
ism involves such schemes; therefore Imperialism

demands wealth and organisation. That is our
simple syllogism. Imperialism is not capitalism,
but it is akin to it in method. The capitalist
makes his fortune by recognising the value of
combination and the wisdom of earning profits
over the largest area possible. Imperialism de-
pends likewise upon a form of combination. Both
believe that Providence is on the side of the
bigger social battalions.
"This, of course, is a truism. The difficulty
arises when the imperialist State and the capit-
alist citizen come into conflict. Both have ad-
mittedly the same methods. Moreover, the
great capitalist schemes must be semi-political,
so the standpoint of pure individualism cannot
be maintained. Our question therefore is, What
is to be the relation of an imperial State to the
rich citizen ; and how far can the State imitate
his activity on its own account." Or, to put it
simply, admitting that combination and capital
are necessary to any empire for imperial purposes,
is the State in pursuit of such purposes to super-
vise or to supersede the individual %

mendous question of Socialism or Individualism,

embark on that wintry sea. I am afraid I cannot

Like Protection and Free Trade, they are methods,
not ideals: curative measures, not forms of diet.
To declare for one or the other is as if anglers
were passionately to take sides in the question
of dry-fly against wet-fly. To say whether the
Empire in the future will be socialist or in-
dividualist requires the gift not of reasoning
but of prophecy, for to dogmatise on the char-
acter of its development you must foretell the
circumstances which may control it. My own
view is that we shall see the State become in-
creasingly more concerned with matters which
our forefathers left to private enterprise. Partly
it will be the result of that new view of the State
as something intimately and organically related
to the private life of its citizens: partly it will
be the result simply of our greater geographical
area. Things which were once well within the
scope of the individual now require an organisa-
tion so vast and complex that only the State can
provide it, or, if the individual can compass it,
he becomes a public menace. I can face with
equanimity the day when our great shipping
lines, our railways, our cable systems, even our
mines, will be State-owned, but before that day
can come the State must have learned more in
the way of administration than it knows at
present.

"At the same time, I cannot conceive that the
day will ever dawn when the private capitalist
can be wholly or even largely superseded. For
many activities you will always want the quicken-
ing of the individual brain and will. Here I differ
from my socialist friends, and I differ from them
only because I am less of an idealist than they
are. I do not think that men will ever spend
themselves with the same fervour on behalf of a
remote entity called the State as they will on
their own private adventures. You may have
the most admirable and conscientious officials, but
they will be uninspired. They will administer,
but rarely originate. In any case, any complete
State-socialism is impossible to our Empire. I
can picture it working well in a small neutralised
State with no mysteries in her future. But what
possible State organisation is capable of dealing
with the whole life of a vast complex of States
in all the latitudes of the globe"
"The socialist would answer," said Hugh,
"that if empire does not admit of his creed,
then so much the worse for empire."
"He might," said Carey, "but I do not think
he will, if he is given to thinking seriously about
the question. I have never found his class a re-
actionary one. But if he does, then I say in turn,
so much the worse for socialism. For of the two

creeds there can be no question which is the
stronger. The one is a method, a particular
theory of administration; the other is an ideal,
a gospel of a fuller national life. Few people, I
think, will be prepared on behalf of a speculation
as to the best mode of government to give up the
task of government altogether—which is what
the demand would be.
"However, I am not concerned to prophesy,
and sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. I
assume that the private capitalist will not be
unknown in the future, that the State cannot
wholly supersede him. Is it, then, to supervise
him # Remember that the great fortunes of the
future will not be made by old methods. Their
makers will be no longer object-lessons in the
wisdom of Benjamin Franklin's maxims. The
millionaire of the future will be a statesman. He
will administer affairs as complex and vast as the
politics of a small nation. I am myself only a
beginner, but politics in some form or other enter
into every detail of my business. The great
capitalist will have imagination and courage and
foresight beyond most men.
"Now, there is to my mind a very great
danger in the appearance of a class of men of
the first order in ability and force of character,
and with immense power at their command, and

the whole outside the State. It is a government
within a government, private citizens who in
effect have governing powers. I merely point
out the danger, for I have no remedy prepared.
We must recognise that empire will extend the
sphere of the great capitalist, and take measures
accordingly. If I were sketching out a Utopia,
it would, of course, be easy to fix a limit beyond
which private fortunes should not go. We should
allow our capitalist his energy but not his profits.
He would be a tame revenue-earning machine for
the State, making millions and receiving a few
thousands as pocket-money. But I confess I can
see no scheme which, as the world stands, would
prevent the danger and yet not put an end to
the fact of capitalism, and, since I believe that
fact to be desirable on public grounds, I am not
prepared for any heroic remedy.
"There is one thing to be said, however, which
may give us hope. The capitalist of the future,
we agreed, will not be the ordinary dull rich
man. He will either be a great criminal or a
considerable patriot. If he is the first I hope
that the law may be strong enough to keep him
in bounds, but if he is the latter he may be a
great ally of the State. The millionaire who
makes money solely to spend it on his pleasures
is a cumberer of the ground. I do not care

whether his pleasures are gross or refined, he is
in any case a cumberer of the ground. But the
man who with such a narrow soul will make a
great fortune in the future will be rare indeed.
He may make a million by rigging the market,
but he will do little good at that serious exploit-
ation which is closely akin to statecraft. It is
only the latter which concerns us, for it is only
if the latter falls into the hands of the fool or
the knave that the political danger I dread will
appear. Remember, I am talking of exploitation
and of new production, not of the mere control of
distribution, which is the object of the ordinary
Transatlantic trust, for it is in the first kind of
activity only that empire and capital come into
close relation. The men who will succeed, I
hope, will be those who find themselves capable
of only spending a portion of their fortune on
themselves and who have no desire to ruin their
families by hoarding it for them. They will find
their hobby not in rare furniture or on the Turf,
but in doing, so far as the individual can, the
work of the State."
Carey spoke these last words with a smile,
looking towards Lord Appin. The shaft, how-
ever, failed of effect, for, as it chanced, Lord
Appin's gaze was occupied with a beautiful
cabinet, inlaid with agate and ivory. He looked

inestimable treasure. "No, Francis," he said
sadly, "it is very clear that neither you nor I
can live at that austere height. I hope you will
spare the poor fellows some foible to keep them
from the ennui of unvarying altruism."
"I am not very much concerned with the
capitalist," said the Duchess. "I am much more
anxious about labour. Mr Lowenstein, you once
spoke at my Plaistow settlement on the subject.
I wish you would say again what you told us
then."
Mr Lowenstein was so frail in constitution
that even the tonic air of Musuru had failed to
give him complete health. His nervous activity
made him the prey of headaches, and at the
earlier discussions he had sat silent and miser-
able. For some reason, however, the trip to
Entoro had done him good, and to-night he was
in the best of spirits.
"What I have to say," he began, "can be put
very shortly. And it has been put in far better
words than I can command."
He opened a slim, well-worn book, that looked
a very shabby intruder among the superb bind-
ings around him.

that his day is over. I think Mrs Deloraine told

for him. And he happens to say in one passage
exactly what I wish to say to-night. It is in

gies, and since we have put all our eggs into
the industrial basket, our prospects on the
insular basis depends on its continuance at a
certain high and artificial level. I say 'arti-
ficial,' for I think English industrialism must be

beyond the point where it is only one of many
elements in the national life. Almost everything
else has been sacrificed to it, and our peculiar
position, historically and geographically, has
given us the chance of achieving this abnormal
development. But because it is abnormal it is
all on a needle-point. We have no background
such as other countries possess in their rural
prosperity. We are urban and industrial or
nothing. The ordinary large works are situated
in some densely inhabited and highly rated
neighbourhood. Their working expenses are
enormous, and their margin of profit variable,
since it depends upon so many undetermined
conditions. Let there be a shortage in the for-
eign crop which furnishes their raw material,
or a new tariff clapped on their manufactured
article by some large consumer, or a new Factory
Act, or a fresh rate, and the whole system gets
out of gear. The work for the labourer is there-
fore generally speculative, and there is an equally

speculative element on his side. He finds the
housing problem insoluble, and he labours gener-
ally under conditions which break his health;
and he is at the mercy of the organisation of
his own trade, and may find himself called to
sacrifice his own present comfort for the assumed
ultimate advantage of his class.
"These and a dozen other elements of uncer-
tainty, which spring from the extreme artificiality
of our industrial system, tend to create the un-
employed problem. Even the skilled workman
finds himself frequently out of work, while the
vast class of the unskilled—the unfortunates who
are morally, mentally, or physically handicapped,
or who through misfortune or lack of energy
have remained at the foot of the ladder of
labour—feel the insecurity more deeply. To my
mind there is only one diagnosis of the evil.
Industrialism has eaten us up, and, like all
monopolies, has become a morbid growth, taking
our life's blood and giving us little back. We
are too preoccupied with it, and it is too pre-
occupied with itself. It is—how shall I say?—
like a quantity of hot charcoal which, if spread
through all the rooms of the house would have
pleasantly warmed them, but if collected in one
chamber will asphyxiate the inmates. And the
result is the starving poor in our streets, and in

every great city some quarter which is a sink
of misery and crime.
"There are, of course, a hundred proposals.
Some maintain that the State should turn itself
into a kind of Universal Employer, and use the
derelict classes on public works devised for no
other purpose than their relief. I do not think
such a course would do much good. The State,
by its large outlay on unproductive and un-
necessary works, would be lessening the wealth
of the country, and thereby lowering industrial
well-being and adding indirectly to that evil of
unemployment which it purported to cure.
Some again are prepared to nationalise means
of production, and make all industry a State
concern. No doubt that course would effect
many startling changes, but it would overturn
the foundations of our society, the good with the
evil; and I do not think that the English people
will be inclined to burn their house down in
order to cure the damp in the cellar. Some
people propose, vaguely but benevolently, a
return to the land. The great proprietors would
disappear, and their estates would be converted
into a multitude of small holdings, on which the
unskilled, who had failed to maintain themselves
at simple trades, would be set down to the most
difficult of all professions. Of all schemes this

seems to me the most crazy. If you make the
holdings small enough to admit of a great num-
ber of families being settled on the land, you
will make it impossible for these families to make
a living. It is the simplest calculation. In the
present state of English agriculture we know
exactly how much land and how much capital
are required before there can be sufficient return
to make an income. If, on the other hand, you
create only a small number of largish farms, you
do not touch the unemployed problem.
"There are many other suggestions which I
need not repeat. But there is one feature com-
mon to them all. They all propose to settle the
* question on the basis of England, and England
alone. Now I maintain that to attempt this is
simply to reshuffle the cards without an atom
of positive gain. The disease we are suffering
from is congestion, a poverty of means to ends,
a lack of breathing - space and opportunity.
Millions are being morally starved because they
have no hope in their lives, and their labour is
without honour or ideals; and, may be, physi-
cally starved because they are not wanted in the
present industrial market. What we have to
realise is that these islands of ours are over-
exploited. You may arrange your beans in dif-
ferent ways, but you will never make more than

five; and if you want a square meal you must
get more beans.
"Therefore I say with all the earnestness I
possess, that we can never settle the labour
question with its kindred problem of unem-
ployment on an English basis. What would
we think of a landowner whose fields were
grossly overstocked and his animals starved, al-
though he had a rich farm at the other side
of the county which was wholly ungrazed. We
must take into account all our assets and face
the difficulties in a spirit of sober reason. Let
us find out what margin of workmen are crowded
out of regular employment, let us classify care-
fully, for each problem must be dealt with on
its merits, and there is no short cut to a
solution. But let us keep in mind all the data,
for there is no hope for us if we refuse to admit
more than one-third into our inquiry. Public
works for the unemployed may be unnecessary
and wasteful in England, but elsewhere in the
Empire they may be both necessary and econ-
omical. 'Back to the land' may be a foolish
cry in a country where the soil refuses to
support its owners, but the same thing is not
true of the whole globe. There are countries
which need above all things men, that com-
modity of which we have enough and to spare.

They will take our raw human material and
shape it for us. And they will take our in-
dustries and plant them in places where the
men employed can lead a free life. The day
of the great factory with its operatives living
in the acres of squalid houses around it is
going, I believe, even in England. It is re-
cognised that industries under such conditions
sin alike against decency, patriotism, and true
economy. Even in England to-day you have
your factories in the country and your model
industrial villages. What is done on a small
scale within our island can be done on a great
scale within the Empire. It is for wiser men
than me to settle the details, but I am con-
vinced that Ruskin has found in the matter a
truth which is hidden from Royal Commissions."
Mr Lowenstein spoke nervously and rapidly,
and when he ceased he lay back in his chair
as if much fatigued and closed his eyes. Lady
Warcliff, who in spite of her energy and in-
dependence had always some prophet at whose
feet she sat in her leisure, watched him with a
solicitous face, and, since he showed no signs of
continuing, took up his parable.
"As a woman interested in philanthropy,"
she began, "I heartily wish the thing had never
been heard of. We are smothered with it now-

adays. We want less charity, and more justice
and intelligence. Some one has divided man-
kind into soft-hearted cruel people and hard-
hearted kind people. The first have had their
day, and a pretty mess they have made of it.
They have filled our hospitals and asylums, and
given us our East Ends, and our unemployed
demonstrations. Comfortable people like a little
easy charity as the sauce to their enjoyment.
They are too cowardly and supine to face the
truth, so they hang over it the cloak of their
egregious generosity. We shall never get one
step farther till we recognise that the destitute
must be divided sharply into two classes—those
who may be saved and those who, being past
hope, should cease to exist."
"Upon my word, Margaret, our sex comes
very badly out of these discussions," the
Duchess's voice had a startled note in it. "On
board the yacht I heard Caroline airily ad-
vocating persecution, and now you want to cure
our disorders by the euthanasia of social cripples.
I am horrified that barbarism should find its
only advocates among women."
"I was afraid I should shock you," said Lady
Warcliff sweetly. "And yet—will you show
me any other remedy ? There are classes of
the poor in every town who in all seriousness

are beyond hope. It may be physical, or moral,
or mental, but the weakness is there and cannot
be overcome. We shut up criminals and lunatics,
and yet we allow these people, who are as cer-
tainly a leprous spot in our society, to go on
marrying and perpetuating their worthless stock
and hampering the activity of the State. Sharp
surgery is the only cure. I want to see these
hordes of thriftless, degenerate, scrofulous pariahs
treated as what they are, irredeemable outcasts
from society, and compelled by the State to keep
their noxious influence away from the saner
parts. This, however, is beside the question.
It is the people who are worth saving that I
want to talk about.
"Like everybody who has been much among
the poor, I have had many theories as to the
cause and the cure of the evils I saw before
me. But after I had tried many and found
them wanting, I came round to the kind of
creed which Mr Lowenstein has been sketching.
It is this alone which makes me call myself an
Imperialist. The common cant of empire is more
obnoxious to me, I think, than any other cant.
I have no liking for rhetoric or adventure, and
most of my best friends belong to the school
which is untouched by the glamour of foreign
dominion. I want, like them, to cure our own

evils before we proselytise up and down the
earth, but it is just because of that desire that
I am an Imperialist.
"Take the very poor—men and women who
are capable of work and could be raised under
decent conditions to a wholesome level of life.
If you keep such people on charity you ruin
their self-respect. Besides, there is not enough
charity to go round. But what they want in
their lives is not so much the bare means of
existence as some kind of hope. They must
have a horizon before them, not straight grey
walls between which they will be shepherded
till they die. They want to be given oppor-
tunity, where on their own feet they can fight
with fair confidence, first for a living and then
for the amenities of life. Now it is my con-
viction that as things stand to-day in England
it is impossible to give them opportunity. We
may slightly improve their condition, and save
a few here and there from starvation, but it
is all an attempt to cure an earthquake with
a pill. If we are true reformers we must go
to the root of the matter and change the con-
ditions which make destitution possible.
"This is the creed of socialism, and so far we
all agree with it. Our common position is, that
we must create opportunity for all, not merely

rescue hard cases. Where we part company is
the method of this reform. One way is to lower
the rich and raise the poor, until the whole State
forms one vast lower middle-class in respect of
income. By this means we should not increase
the aggregate of opportunity, but we should
make a fairer distribution. My objection to it—
or rather the chief of my many objections—is,
that it involves so complete a revolution not only
in the material aspects of our society but in its
whole thought and tradition, that it will be an
uncommonly hard thing to achieve. Besides, I
see little attraction in a society where, as Bagehot
said, people would be forbidden to go barefoot,
and everybody would have one boot apiece. I
prefer the alternative, which is more logical, and
to my mind infinitely more attractive, than a
levelled-down middle-class State. My proposal
is to add to the aggregate of opportunity. I
want to follow the great law of supply and
demand, and send men and women away from
the place where they are not wanted to places
where they will be welcomed.
"At the same time I do not call my scheme
emigration. People are free to emigrate as they
choose to any part of the world, and if this were
the unfailing cure for poverty the poor would long
ago have found it out for themselves. I advocate

State-organised emigration within the Empire,
because it is only under these conditions that
you can have it scientifically organised and super-
vised. Emigration is the least easy art in the
world. It needs careful selection, long prepara-
tion of land and people for each other, and it
wants at the back of it all the authority of the
State. I have seen many experiments made by
private individuals and philanthropic agencies
which have been successful, but for our problem
the solution must be on a great scale, otherwise
we shall not have faced the difficulties fairly.
The State must be the great emigrator. It alone
has the power to collect full information and
decide whether this or that scheme is justifiable.
It can make arrangements with the Colonies, and
it can reduce the cost of transport to a minimum.
An imperial executive, such as we talked of the
other evening, will be equal to the task, for
being representative of the whole empire it will
be spared the long negotiations with Colonial
Governments which we have to put up with at
present. Besides, in its permanent Bureau of
Intelligence it will have the machinery for framing
its schemes on the surest and most scientific
grounds.
"If you send the right man to the right place
in the right way you will manufacture citizens

out of material which at present is sinking into
the slough of despair. You will give our empty
lands population and reduce the congestion of
our English slums. And you will bring hope,
and a reasonable hope, into a kind of life which is
starved for the lack of it. I do not say that the
result can be achieved at once. But you will
have opened up a path, and soon it will be well
trodden. We Imperialists look forward to our
people becoming more mobile, and seeking a
home wherever life can be lived freely and
sanely, instead of choking within the limits which
were sufficient for the fathers but are too narrow
for the sons. We agreed the other evening that
our industries must move as occasion demands,
and labour will naturally follow them. These
are inevitable but unconscious processes due to
the compulsion of facts. Meanwhile we can
begin by a conscious attempt to redeem the
tragedy of our civilisation not by any violent
cataclysm but by using those means which are
ready at hand. In Canning's phrase, we must
call in the new world to redress the balance of
the old."
"At last," said the Duchess, "we have got a
proposal with which I can cordially agree. I
thought when you began to talk about labour
you were going to defend things like the im-

portation of coolies into South Africa. You know
how much I and many other good Imperialists
were distressed by that."
"You are not going to escape, Susan," said
Lady Lucy, smiling. "Lady Warcliff has been
talking about English labour, and I have some-
thing to say about the other kinds which the
Empire has to show. She pleads for greater
elasticity for labour at home, but she has only
touched on one part of a very large question. If
we owe duties to English labour, we owe duties
also to every man under our rule who works with
his hands. You will find labour problems as
difficult and as urgent as your English question
in many parts of the Empire—in India, in the Far
East, in the West Indies, in most parts of Africa.
You have great tracts, like Southern India, which
are so thronged with human beings that there is
no room to live; and you have places like the
Sudan and the Transvaal, and even this neigh-
bourhood, where the land is far richer than the
human population it supports. If we take up the
task of government in a scientific spirit, it is
surely our business to fit the people to the land.
I agree with Lady Warcliff that nothing is so
much wanted as mobility in labour. The old idea
was that the labouring man was rooted by Pro-
vidence in the soil where he was born. He might

go away if he pleased, but the desire was thought
to indicate frivolity. The notion that the State
should encourage him to leave would have made
the honest Benthamite blush. Happily that frame
of mind is gone for ever. Where we see men
suffocated for lack of space, and great spaces
barren for lack of men, we are not to be kept
from adopting the common-sense remedy by any
laissez-faire croakings."
The Duchess saw danger ahead and made haste
to meet it half-way.
"I have no fault to find with that, so far as it
goes. If the Sudan can support ten millions and
has got only three, then by all means import the
natives of Southern India who, you say, are too
many for their land to feed. Or let them come
and cultivate the marshy coastlands near Mom-
basa, where the white man cannot live. All that
is legitimate emigration, and no Liberal could
object to it. What I am opposed to is the
shifting of masses of men about the world, like
chattels, at the will of private employers. You
exploit their labour and pack them home again,
and the main inducement to emigrate—the chance
of a new home—is denied them."
"And yet," said Lady Lucy, "I do not see
why we should subscribe to the mystical doc-
trine that emigration is a good thing if we carry

it out to the full, but very bad if we stop half-
way. I can imagine so many cases where the
half would be more than the whole—where,
indeed, the whole would be a positive blunder.
There are districts in India where the people
are landowners and farmers. What they need
is a little capital to buy more land or stock, and
so enable themselves to make a steady living.
They have no desire to settle abroad for good,
and they have no need to do so. But if they
can give their labour for a few years at good
wages to some country which wants it, why
should they be prevented ? Or you may have
the case of a country such as this or South
Africa, which is naturally a white man's country,
and which we all hope some day to see filled
with white settlers; but some urgent tempor-
ary work has to be done—a railway built or
new mines opened—and we must import labour
at once and in large quantities. Is there any
reason why coolies should not be brought in on
contract, paid well for their work, and shipped
back again? They are not compelled to come, and
they are paid for coming; their coming benefits
both themselves and the land, but their remain-
ing would in no way benefit the land. In such
a case surely we can have restricted emigration
without breaking any of the Commandments."

The Duchess looked round the company in
despair. "What has come over my sex 7" she
asked. "According to Caroline the chief weapon
of Imperialism is the rack or the thumbscrew;
according to Margaret, the lethal chamber; and
now, according to Lady Lucy, it is the chain
and the sjambok we must really look to. I
begin to be afraid that our enemies are right,
and that we have got a taint of the later Roman
Empire in our blood. As for this restricted emi-
gration, I refuse to distinguish it from slavery.
It is temporary slavery, to be sure, but the
quality is the same."
"If you will really think what you mean by
"slavery, Susan, you will change your mind.
The word is like so many others—"despotism,'
"force,' 'filibustering,' 'perpetual tutelage,' which
the heavy guns of our opponents fire daily,–it
looks impressive in the air, but when it strikes
it is found to be filled with sawdust. The
word is formidable only when it is not examined.
If you mean by it "discipline,' then all types of
organised action are slavery. A coolie who con-
tracts to come here and work on a railway or
mine, undertakes to do his work under such
conditions as his employers prescribe. So long
as these conditions are not such as to offend
public morals, the men who organise it have an

ample right to say what the particular work
demands. The State says, further, that it does
not wish these coolies to remain in the country.
Is not the State the best judge of what the
country requires? Is there anything immoral
in a country shutting its doors against a special
kind of emigrant? You say that it is wrong for
a State to exploit the labour of these emigrants
and yet to refuse them permanent citizenship.
That, I confess, is a doctrine beyond my com-
prehension. You may as well say that I have
no right to buy provisions from the Stores,
when I prefer to order my wine elsewhere."
"I do not feel so strongly opposed to State
action," said the Duchess. "After all, the State
has certain rights, and its motives are disin-
terested, and its oversight will be rigorous. If
the indentured labourers were only imported for
public works, I should not complain. It is when
they are brought in for the use of private firms
that the taint of slavery appears."
Lady Lucy laughed. "Well, let us argue in
the style of the Platonic dialogues. How, and by
means of what qualities, are we to define State
action? And shall we include municipal action in
this category ! And if State action is the action
of the organised community for the good of the
community, on what principle are we to exclude

main industries of the State 2 And again xx
"For goodness' sake stop, Lucy l'" said the
Duchess good-humouredly. "I never could bear
the Socratic method. Its little pistol-shot argu-
ments give me a headache. I daresay there is
something in what you say. Slavery may be
an inaccurate term to describe what I so much
dislike, but in any case it involves a perpetual
danger of slavery. If you tie up by contract
the liberty of an individual for a term, you pave
the way for restricting it without any contract
for life. It is the thin end of the wedge."
"I shouldn't use that phrase, my dear," said
Lord Appin solemnly. "It is the worst of our
parliamentary clichés, and, besides, Hardcastle has
made it comic for ever. I was privileged to hear
his great speech in the Lords against the De-
ceased Wife's Sister's Bill. He declared that he
did not object to the present measure, which was
merely permissive. "But,' said Hardcastle, 'it

that she had risen to her feet, and now ad-

dressed the company from beside Carey on the
hearthrug.
"Susan does not mean what she says. She
is only repeating the arguments of her party,
like a pious brigand who mumbles a paternoster
before robbing a coach. Her last phrase is typi-
cal of a frame of mind which is very common and
very hopeless. You are not to embark upon a
scheme, however clearly you define its limits, be-
cause of its possible maleficent extension. I can-
not understand the creed. If we believed in it
all energy and progress would cease. We should
sit like Buddha, twirling our thumbs, afraid to
move a muscle lest we blundered. Not that any
one seriously holds this faith. They imagine
they do, because they are confused and slack,
and have never taken the pains to think out what
words mean. That is one class of my opponents.
The others frankly detest the Empire, and hide
their bias under the cloak of humanitarian ten-
derness. They hate colonial indentured labour,
as Macaulay's Puritans hated bear-baiting, not
because it does harm to the labourer, but be-
cause it does good to the colony.
"The honest souls who dread the bugbear of
slavery need not concern themselves. Slavery,
which means that one man is at the mercy of
another's caprices, will never raise its head again.

Even though it had done no ill to the slave, it
was economically and morally ruinous for the
master. No! what we have to do is to save
men from the far more relentless tyranny of
circumstance. The bondage of things, believe
me, is more cruel than the bondage of men. I
call a dock-labourer in Poplar, who sees no hope
for himself or his children, a slave. I call men
slaves who, whether they own their land or not,
are living always on the brink of starvation. But
I call him a free man who sells his labour under
contract for a term of years that he may earn
enough to make his livelihood secure. I grant
you that liberty is beyond price; but, like Burke,
I want to see a 'manly, moral, and regulated
liberty." How often must it be repeated that
freedom is not the absence of restraints, but a
willing acceptance of them, because their purpose
is understood and approved."
Lady Lucy's quiet voice had risen to that pitch
of fervour which betrays the natural orator. As
she stopped, she looked with some little embar-
rassment at the Duchess, and with a sudden
movement sank on the floor beside her chair and
took a hand in hers.
"Please forgive me for scolding you, Susan
dear! But you know you deserved it. You
have still got the General Election in your ears,

at home, but one must leave it behind at
Musuru."
"I am not convinced," said the Duchess.
"Your principle may be right, but all your
applications are wrong. And I am far from
being sure about your principle. Without being
a dogmatic individualist, I protest against the
idea of the State incurring such vast respon-
sibilities as providing employers with labour
and moving populations about the world. I
admit that the province of the State has been
widened, but such an insane stretching of bound-
aries seems to me to court disaster."
"Your fears always make me nervous, Susan,"
said Carey, "for you have an uncanny instinct
for being right. But I think I can persuade—"
He was not permitted, for the Duchess rose
and held before him protesting hands. "No,
Francis, you shall not lecture me. And I promise
in return to talk no more platform stuff. Besides,
I am to be left alone after to-morrow with you,
and you will have every chance to convert me.

CHAPTER IX.
THE whole party, men and women, breakfasted
at the same hour next morning, most of them
with that look of mingled unrest and high spirits
which marks the expectant traveller. All their
clothes spoke of the road, though the various
styles showed that that road was not the same
for every one. Those who were to stay behind
—the Duchess, Lord Appin, and Lord Launces-
ton—had the bland air of ease and proprietorship
which all steadfast things wear in a changing
world. The clock-work régime of Musuru made
bustle impossible. There was no running about
of maids and valets, no ringing of bells and con-
fused directions. Carey consulted a paper in
his hand, and now and then gave an order to
a noiseless servant. The vast size of the house
prevented the guests from catching any unsettling
intimations of departure.

breakfast was a cheerful meal, "about to begin

the inter-act in our comedy. I should like to
know, before we scatter, what point we have
reached in our discussions. We have talked
about a great many different things, and on the
whole I think we have been fair."
"When Susan calls any one fair," said Lord
Appin, "she means that he is a little biassed in
her own favour."
"Of course," said the Duchess, "I have that
complete candour which does not mind confess-
ing a slight lack of it. We won't quarrel about
words. We have examined home politics and
found them largely at war about irrelevant
issues. For myself, I think that we overstated
the case, but I have no complaint against our
positive conclusion—that Imperialism meant the
treatment of all our problems on a wider basis.
Then we took up certain questions in detail.
Some, such as the kind of imperial constitution
we must look forward to, and the kind of ad-
ministration the Tropics will require, were im-
perial questions in the strictest sense — new
conundrums which the fact of empire calls into
being. Others, such as the proper way of
remedying our social disorders, were ordinary
home problems discussed from the imperialist
standpoint. Am I right, Francis ? You always
said I had a logical mind."

Carey nodded, and the Duchess continued.
"I don't want to be unreasonable, but it seems
to me that the subject wants a broader handling.
I am old-fashioned enough to believe in principles.
I want the principles, and not the details, of em-
pire. Stop me if I am talking nonsense, please,
for I never pretended to be a philosopher. But
tell me, some one, if the orthodox way is not to
get the general principles clear and leave the
treatment of specific points to be deduced from
them. Hugh, will you get me some cold
partridge"
"My complaint," said Mr Wakefield, "is just
the opposite—I am in no great hurry for prin-
ciples. A vague philosophy of empire seems
to me of the slenderest value at the present
moment. Wait till we have penetrated some
distance into the new country before we begin
to map it. It is surely our business to have
a clear policy on the different imperial questions,
—that is to say, on every phase of our political
life, and having got that, to consider the best
way and means of forcing it upon the world.
That is the omission which I complain of We
all know roughly what we mean by Imperialism.
What I want to know is how to make the ideal a
fact, to exchange Imperialism for Empire. We
have discussed most of the great practical ques-

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS. 247
tions except that of the tariff—and I am content
to leave that alone for the moment. But how
are we to set to work to enforce our solution ?"
"If you know what Imperialism is," said Lord
Appin, "you know more than I do. I don't think
your complaint can be admitted, Wakefield. As
Carey declared a fortnight ago, we are here to get
our minds clear. We are not in office with a
solemn mandate to reconstruct the Empire. Our
business is to create opinion. Our works, to
adopt the old distinction, must be light-giving
before they can be fruit-bearing."
"Then what better are we than other framers
of barren Utopias" asked Mr Wakefield, in the
act of assaulting a ham.
"The distinction is easy. A Utopia is a
scheme of things which is possible but not
practicable. There is nothing in it inherently
inconceivable, but it demands a change of condi-
tions so complete as to be beyond reasonable
hope. The empire we wish is not only possible,
but practicable. We have all the elements of it
before us. It only requires a slight adjustment
of things as they are to make it a reality. If,
then, it needs no magician's wand to change our
dream into fact, but only a touch here and there,
surely it is our first duty to see that the dream
is clear and complete. Once that is accomplished,

once something has been prepared which the
mind of our people will accept as its creed, then
with an easy conscience we can leave the rest to
the hacks and journeymen of politics."
"There's something in what you say," Mr
Wakefield admitted. "I don't ask for office-
bearers, a committee, a list of members, and a
telegraphic address. There is a foolish matter-
of-factness as well as a wise. But I think we
should turn our attention to methods as well
as to ideals. All about us lies a stubborn and
unregenerate world. Though we speak with the
tongues of men and angels we shall not be
listened to, unless we prepare for ourselves a
hearing."
"Again, I say, that it is not our business.
Imperialism is not a propaganda which needs to
be canvassed like an election policy. It will find
acceptation when it is acceptable—not before.
Our trouble is that ours is still a cryptic faith,
unformulated and incoherent. Our task is to
bring its meaning to light, first for our own
sakes and then for our people's. One man with
a clear mind is more of a dynamic force than a
dozen well-organised guilds for the dissemination
of platitudes. When our symposium is at an
end and we go back to the world, then by all
means let us talk about methods. But do not

let us confuse ourselves here by any obeisance to
that intolerable fool, the 'practical man.'"
"That is all very well," said the Duchess,
"but nobody has answered my question. I am
content that we should discuss empire without
any eye to the ways and means of speedy real-
isation. But I am not content that we should
settle isolated details and leave our principles all
vague and inconclusive."
"L'ineptie," Lady Flora quoted wickedly,
"consiste & vouloir conclure."
The Duchess laughed. "A very apposite
quotation, my dear, but I am not to be silenced
by a tag from a French novelist. Francis, give
me some comfort."
"I am quite ready to defend our course," said
Carey. "A question so vast and so subtle as
ours—one, too, which has a bearing on every
interest of our mortal life—cannot be treated in a
mechanical way. It would be easy for us to pass
a string of dapper resolutions, but, if we did, we
should leave things as we found them. Principles
and axioms we have, but they will only emerge
when we have re-thought the conditions of our
new world. We must creep before we can walk,
and feel our way humbly in the mysterious
twilight of dawn. We shall make many
mistakes in that half-light, for the objects are

blurred and the morning haze is still on the
hills: but at least we can learn something of the
nature of the land, and we can tell where the
east lies. All of us have slightly different
standpoints, different principles, and different
prejudices. When a man lays down a dogma he
is bound to colour it in a large degree by his
temperamental bias. The colouring is probably
unconscious, but the result is that truths appear,
not in their white light, but all shot across with
rays from the thinker's personality. There is a
vast deal of irrelevant stuff in them, which is
dear to some minds and antipathetic to others.
Now, the best way, in my opinion, to get rid
of this embarrassing surplus is to let the various
temperaments conflict, for out of such conflict
emerges the ultimate agreement. Ideals ex-
pressed crudely and summarily in conversation
may be far from the perfection of a dogma
patiently elaborated in the study. But they will
have the merit of life, and the strife of living
things always bears fruit in the end. Our object,
as I said before, is to get our minds clear, not to
frame a political catechism. And if this is so,
then the minds must speak in their own accents,
for it is only when we have understood wherein
we differ from each other that we can realise
wherein we agree. There is a method which

philosophers call dialectic — the attainment of
harmony by the reaction upon each other of
opposing theories—and the plan we are following
is in its way a homely kind of dialectic. Clearly
we could not begin by laying down principles,
for they would have been intelligible only to the
man who laid them down. But at the start we
found we were agreed, not on our axioms, but on
our attitude. Imperialism, we decided, was the
realisation of new conditions for all our problems,
an enlarged basis, and fuller data. We did not
attempt to find an answer to any of the great
political questions: we only indicated the lines
on which the answer must be sought. Imperial-
ism, so ran our conclusion, is a spiritual change.
We next looked at some of the simpler results
which flow from the acceptance of the fact of
empire, especially the need for a new machinery
of State, and we applied the conception to our
eternal labour problem, not to solve it, but to see
how far it lit the path to a solution. But the
kernel of our inquiry still awaits us, though we
have cracked the shell. We have all by this time
got a rough idea of what is the general meaning
of the imperial attitude. But we must under-
stand more fully the nature of the spiritual
change we have talked of. I suggest, therefore,
that we look at some of the great compartments

252 A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS.
of life and see how our conception will apply. It
is a political conception, remember, but since
politics in their new meaning are so intimately
inwoven with life, we may learn something of its
meaning by examining its bearing on art and
conduct. And then, having got some under-
standing of the concrete significance of our ideal,
we can hazard a fuller definition. So you shall
have your principles, Susan, but at the end
instead of at the beginning."
"And in the meantime," said the Duchess,
"we are to be assisted to understand what you
call 'the concrete significance'—odious phrase !
—of Imperialism by going off into the real
wilderness for three weeks. I daresay we shall
get the atmosphere of empire into our souls,
but I shall be surprised if some of us don't
get fever into our bones. I do hope you have
been careful, Francis. I don't want Musuru to
end as a nursing home."
"There is just a chance of fever for those
who go to Ruwenzori, but I think it may be
avoided, and in any case it would be slight.
The other expeditions are as healthy as a
cruise in the North Sea. Shall I tell you the
plans?"
Carey had privately arranged with each mem-
ber of the party as to how the next weeks

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS. 253
should be spent, but no one had been permitted
to divulge the arrangement. Hence, while all
knew their destinations they had no inkling of
who their companions might be, and their host's
announcement was awaited with much interest.
"First of all the Duchess stays on at Musuru
with me; and Lord Appin and Lord Launceston
keep us company. Lady Warcliff is going to
Aden by the Austrian Lloyd to meet Sir Arthur
on his way home from India. Mrs Deloraine
was anxious to explore the East Coast, and Mr
Wakefield wanted to have a look at the South
African colonies, so they will join one of my
yachts to-morrow at Mombasa. Mrs Wilbraham,
Mrs Yorke, and Mr Lowenstein are going too,
and I think they should be able to get as far
as Durban, and spend three or four days ashore.
I am a little doubtful about the next expedition,
which is Astbury's idea. He and Graham and
Marjory and Lady Lucy propose to go off to
Ruwenzori, and make an attempt to ascend
Kiyanja. It is well worth doing, for there is
no stranger or lovelier mountain scenery on
earth, but it is a long job, and the country
before you reach the Mubuku valley is a little
wearing. However, I have collected for them
a good caravan, they can cross the lake in the
yacht to the best starting-point, and two

Chamonix guides, who live here in the settle-
ment, will accompany them. They took me
up the second time the ascent was made, and
know every step of the road. Last of all
comes the hunting-party, - Lady Flora, Lady
Amysfort, Hugh, and Sir Edward. Teddy still
yearns for a good eland head, so they are going
off to the north to look for one—first, the Uasin-
Gishu flats, and then up towards Rudolf. Re-
member you have only three weeks, and you
won't be allowed to outstay your leave, for my
men have orders to bring you back at all costs
to Musuru twenty-two days hence. Bon voyage
to you all, and good hunting to you, Teddy, and
for Heaven's sake, Hugh, give up the habit of
stalking lions with a pop-gun."
"I wish," said the Duchess, "that I were not
an old woman. Or, since that is a foolish thing
to say, I wish that, being old, I did not feel so
young. I suppose some one must remain behind
to write to sorrowing relatives. You must be
very kind to me, Francis, for I foresee I am
going to be in a bad temper."

CHAPTER X.
THREE weeks later Lady Flora and Hugh were
riding with slack reins over the great downs
which sweep from Musuru to the north. Their
caravan was visible some miles in the rear, a
small dot in the interminable expanse of green.
The riders were facing south, and far away
appeared the dark line which told of the
forests which surrounded the house. It was
a windless afternoon, but at that height the
air had the freshness of a mountain - top.
The world slept in the still and golden weather
—only the sound of their horses' hoofs, and now
and then the cry of a bird, broke in upon the
warm, scented silence. The bent, green with
springtide in the near distance, mellowed in
the farther spaces to a pale gold, which stood
out with entrancing clearness against the crystal-
line blue of the sky. It was a plateau on which
they rode, for to the west the tops of little hills
showed up on the horizon, foreshortened like the

masts of ships at sea. This sight, and the
diamond air and the westering sun, gave the
riders the sensation of moving in some cloud-
built world raised far above the levels of man.
The three weeks had worked changes in their
appearance. In spite of veils Lady Flora had
become sunburnt, and she had exchanged her
prim English seat for the easy pose of the
backwoods. Hugh, tanned like an Indian,
wore clothes so stained and ragged that he
looked like some swagman who had stolen a
good horse. He caught the girl's amused eye
and laughed.
"I know I'm pretty bad, but I'm not so bad
as Teddy. I wish his wife could see him at this
moment. And I wish the whole round earth
could behold Lady Amysfort. Who could have
guessed that the wilds would have wrought such
a change 2"
"You don't know Caroline as well as I do, or
you would wonder more. I was afraid she would
be bored, or have a headache or something, for
she is so accustomed to being served and wor-
shipped that I did not think she would see any
fun in roughing it. I suppose Mr Carey knew
her better. But when I saw her making pan-
cakes the first night, I knew it would be all
right. Before we started, she was the last

woman I would have chosen to travel with, and
now she is the first. And that is a pretty high
recommendation, I think."
"Like Charles Lamb's praise—'What a lass to
go a-gipsying through the world with !' I think
so too. Well, it's all over now, Lady Flora.
Have you enjoyed yourself?"
"Shall I ever forget it—those magical weeks?
We are not going back to anything half as good
as we are leaving behind. I know now what
Mr Astbury meant by Nirwana, for I have
been living in it. Do you remember when
we camped in the little ravine above Asinyo?
When you and Sir Edward were away hunt-
ing all day, Charlotte and I used to climb up
to the top of the rocks among the whortle-
berries, and watch the shadows running over
the plain, and get blown on by the cool winds
from the Back of Beyond. I never knew one
could be so happy alone. And then the even-
ings, with the big fire and the natives' chatter,
and Sir Edward's stories and Caroline's singing !
Do you remember one night we argued for hours
about what could be done to make Ascot more
amusing? And then we suddenly remembered
where we were, and burst out laughing. What
fun it was, too, to lie awake in bed, quite warm
and comfortable, and see the stars twinkling

through the door of one's tent, and hear the
wolves howling to each other I hate coming
back—even to Musuru.
"And in all that huge, heavenly country," the
girl went on, "there was not one white man. I
shall soon be as fanatical about settlement as
Lady Warcliff. Only I am going to preach a
different creed. Think of the numbers of young
men of our class who have sufficient money to
live on and nothing to do. They somehow fall
out of the professions, and hang about at a loose
end. But there is excellent stuff in them if they
found the kind of life to suit them. They would
have made good eldest sons, though they are
very unsatisfactory younger ones. But out here
they could all be eldest sons. They would have
a Christian life, plenty of shooting, plenty of
hard work of the kind they could really do well;
and then they could marry and found a new
aristocracy. I don't suppose Mr Carey wants the
new countries to be without their gentry. What
a delightful society it would be 1 I can picture
country-houses—simple places, not palaces like
Musuru, - and pretty gardens, and packs of
hounds, and—oh, all that makes England nice,
without any of the things that bore us. There
would be no Season, because there would be no
towns, and everybody would remain young, be-

cause there would be nothing to make them
grow old."
"Would you be one of the citizens of your
Utopia?" Hugh asked.
"I think I should. At least my Better Self
would. At this moment I look on the com-
plicated world with disgust. My tastes are half
pagan and half early Christian. I want to have
all the things that really matter in life, and
nothing else. I want to be able to look out on
everything with clear eyes and without any
sentimentality or second-hand emotion. Do you
know, if I spent many weeks like the last three
I should become very like a man. I have
caught Sir Edward's slang, and I have almost
fallen into his way of regarding things. What
was that odd poem he was always quoting, some-
thing about the "wind in his teeth'?"
"'May I stand in the mist and the clear and the chill,'"
Hugh repeated—
"In the cycle of wars,
In the brown of the moss and the grey of the hill,
With my eyes to the stars 1
Gift this guerdon and grant this grace,
That I bid good-e'en,
The sword in my hand and my foot to the race,
The wind in my teeth and the rain in my face l'
"Be it so,' said the Queen."

"Well, I am all for 'the wind in my teeth and
the rain in my face,' though it would be very
bad for my complexion. Where does Sir Edward
get his verses?"
"Heaven knows! Partly he invents them,
and partly he misremembers things he has read.
They are the strangest mixture. And he hasn't
an idea who wrote what. He will put down
some hideous doggerel to Shakespeare, and credit
Whyte-Melville with the best things of Brown-
ing. He argued with me for a long time the
other day about 'The desire of the moth for the
star." He only knew the last verse, and main-
tained that it had been written by an Australian
poet of his acquaintance called Buck Jones. . . .
How long do you think this new mood of yours
will last ! I am coming to shoot at Wirlesdon
in November. Shall I find it gone?"
"I don't know," said the girl dolefully. "Of
course I shall go back and become a conventional
young woman again. And yet I shall never be
able to forget the other side. I shall always be
longing for this plateau, and the sun, and the
smell of the camp-fire. And when I see myself
in a mirror at balls, my Better Self will say to
my Ordinary Self, 'Now you are like a thousand
people in a crowd; but once, little goose, you
were a woman that mattered '' . . . But, indeed,

we can never get away from Musuru so long as
Mr Carey lives. All that is delightful in the
place is in him. I could not help thinking while
we were on trek that the wilderness was his real
setting, and not the splendours of Musuru. He
broods over the country like a fate."
"I have had the same feeling in all our
travels," said Hugh. "Carey has the wilds so
much in his soul, and he lives so entirely among
elemental things, that he has the same aura as
this land. When I think of him it is never at
Musuru or in London, but as I first saw him in
Rhodesia forcing his great shoulders through the
bush with a dusty caravan behind him. No
divine teacher would ever bid him sell all his
goods and give to the poor, for it would be no
sacrifice. He sits as loose among his great pos-
sessions as if he were a pilgrim with only a
begging-bowl to his credit."
"You once praised detachment," said Lady
Flora, "and I didn't quite agree. I think it
often means selfishness or a cold heart or a weak
digestion. But Mr Carey's detachment is the
most wonderful thing on earth. He has such
a fire in his own soul that he does not need to
warm his hands at any of the blazes which we
poor worldly mortals shiver around."
"You know how every now and again he

breaks out into some proverb. I remember once
in London walking down Piccadilly, when sud-
denly Carey came up and put his arm in mine.
He walked with me for a hundred yards without
speaking, and then he said in that abstracted
way of his, 'Every man should be lonely at
heart,' and went off. He, at any rate, has the
true spiritual austerity. Do you remember the
story of the Italian poet's mistress, sitting at
some fete in beautiful clothes, when a scaffolding
broke and she was crushed to death 2 And then
they found that beneath her silken robes she had
worn sackcloth. The world pictures Carey with
his power and his wealth, and notes only the
purple and fine linen, but few can penetrate to
that inner austerity which looks upon such things
as degrees of the infinitely small. He is, if you
like, a practical mystic—an iron hand to change
the fate of nations, and all the while a soul lit
by its own immortal dreams. As you said, Lady
Flora, while he lives we, who are his friends, can
never sink altogether into the commonplace. And
when he dies we can write over him that most
tremendous of all epitaphs—"Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God.'"
The darkness was gathering fast, and the
travellers were almost on the edge of the first
belt of forest, beyond which lay Musuru. A

clatter of hoofs behind them made them turn
their heads sharply, and they found themselves
overtaken by Lady Amysfort and Sir Edward.
"We hurried on," said that gentleman, who
in the twilight seemed longer and leaner than
ever, "because we couldn't stand the pace of
those confounded mules. So we left Akhub to
bring in the caravan. We are not more than
a mile from Musuru, so you'd better stick that
hat of yours straight, Hugh. You look as if you
had escaped from some Wild West show. Do
you mind if I push on by myself? I am very
keen to know what has won the Leger?"
The dinner-table that evening was a very
different sight from that presented on the first
night of the visit. Then every one was fresh
from home, a little strange and shy, inclined to
be in awe equally of their neighbours and their
host. A month of close comradeship in the wilds
had made smooth the rough places, and the
whole company had become excellent friends.
The men were all tanned to a uniform brown,
which in Sir Edward's case had deepened into
a Mephistophelian duskiness, and all had the
clear eyes and alert figures which tell of perfect
health. Even Mr Lowenstein had so greatly
benefited by the voyage that he showed no trace

of weakness. The women had changed the pink
and white of civilisation for wholesome sunburn.
As for the Ruwenzori party, they had escaped
fever but had left their complexions on the high
snows, and Graham and Astbury showed faces
so wonderfully tattered that by contrast Hugh
looked modish and refined.
"Francis," said the Duchess, "may I beg a
favour? Don't let the name of empire be men-
tioned to-night. I want to hear all about these
young people's doings. Besides, they will soon
be much too sleepy to talk. Flora says she rode
thirty miles to-day."
"First you must tell us what has been happen-
ing at home, Aunt Susan. I haven't had time to
read my letters. I know what won the St Leger,
for Sir Edward has told me the news eighteen
times, but I don't know anything else."
"What could happen at home in September 2
My letters are mostly from Scotland, where
your uncle is still saying hard things about the
fishing. All the history manufactured lately has
been made here. You cannot imagine the pro-
found peace of Musuru when you are all away.
Bob read, and Lord Launceston wrote, and Francis
was either shut up in his den working or roving
about the estate. I dozed a good deal of the
day, but we all woke up in the evening, and

talked, no politics, only simple friendly gossip.
We made Bob read Scott aloud after dinner,
and we got through the "Heart of Midlothian.'
Never in my life have I spent a more restful
time, and now I feel like some quiet old abbess
whose convent has been invaded by Goths. You
must atone for the jar to my nerves by giving
me a faithful tale of your adventures. You may
begin, Margaret !"
"Alas, nothing happened to me," said Lady
Warcliff, with that air of mingled petulance and
candour which was the chief of her charms.
"Aden was a simple inferno with heat and dust.
I saw Arthur, and tried to get him to come on
here with me, but the call of the partridges was
stronger than my eloquence. He hurried home,
and I came back and stopped for two nights to
explore Mombasa. My story is a very dull one.
How did you enjoy the East Coast !" she asked,
turning to Mrs Deloraine.
"It was all I had hoped for. We put into
little decayed wayside ports, with a background
of palms and green-shuttered white houses. All
were hot and some smelt abominably, but there is
nothing quite like them elsewhere. You feel
around them still the romance of that greatest
of the Crusades, the Portuguese Age of Adven-
ture. You can picture the days when those

fierce dark sea-captains, with half their men sick
and their own faces haggard with the long
voyage round the Cape, put into their harbours
and said prayers of thanksgivings before the
humble mission shrines. Those were the great
days, when Albuquerque was conquering the
Indies and in treaty with the Sultan for the
Holy Sepulchre. And you can read in them,
too, the visible record of the degeneration of a
race. Once, in spite of heat and fever, they
were the abodes of men. Hard-handed seigneurs
lived in the prazos, and the soldiers who swag-
gered on the quays were no carpet-knights.
But now you have a breed of dwarfish people,
with black blood showing in their eyes and
finger-nails, and the soldiers, in flapping trousers
and tinsel medals, might have walked out of a
comic opera. They have long ago forgotten
Europe and the white man's pride, and Albu-
querque is only a myth to swear by. The fathers
have eaten sour grapes and the teeth of the
children are set on edge. There is something
about the weather, and the colour of the sea,
and the colour of the vegetation, which speaks
of decadence and apathy. But some places have
found a life of their own, which has no remin-
iscence of Europe in it. I found out Inhambane,
Mr Astbury, with your river and boatmen and

everything. There's no decadence there—only
a wholesome, sleepy barbarism."
"I did not land," said Mr Wakefield stolidly,
"till we reached Natal. I refused to land, for
I am depressed by the imperial failures of other
peoples. Personally I attribute Portugal's fiasco
to that dead-weight of Roman Catholicism which
she carried with her. But I was much cheered
by Natal. Some of the Ministers got up a
dinner for me, and I made a speech in which I
hope I gave the colony some useful advice."
"He made a speech," said Mrs Wilbraham
tragically, "and the name of Natal was never
mentioned in it. Nothing but Canada, Canada."
"How could I deliver a panegyric on a place
in which I had only lived for two days? I
told them about the country I do know and left
them to draw the moral. If I had begun to
patronise them with advice on their domestic
affairs they would all have been in arms. When
we get the Premier of Natal over to Toronto
you may bet that he'll talk about Natal and
nothing else. The secret of keeping the peace
in the colonies is for each man to expatiate on
his own hen-roost. Colonials have known that
for a long time, but English statesmen are just
beginning to learn it."
"In another minute," said Mrs Yorke, "we

shall be talking politics. What is your story,

"Sir Edward got his big eland and thinks it
a record, but he hasn't looked up Rowland Ward
yet. There isn't really much to tell about our
doings. We wandered along from day to day
in perfect weather through a great green
country. Ask Caroline."
"I can't add anything," said Lady Amysfort.
"It was a time of perfect rest. I thought of
nothing in the daytime except the beauty of
the place and the flowers and the wild beasts,
and how good it was to look forward to dinner
and the evening round the fire. After dinner
we talked about everything in the world and
rediscovered all the most profound platitudes.
And one went to bed thinking how nice waking
would be. It was a very happy time, but like
all happy times it had no landmarks."
The Duchess turned dejectedly to Lady Lucy.
"It is what I always find. People who do in-
teresting things have not a word to say about
them. Surely you have something to tell me
about the Mountains of the Moon 2"
"Oh yes. We climbed Kiyanja, and Marjory
nearly ended her mortal career by sliding down
a snow-slope. It is impossible to give you any
conception of the upper Mubuku valley by mere

description. You have to see it to believe in
it. Imagine a giant Alpine flora—groundsels like
shrubs, heather in trees, azaleas and Alpine
roses making a flame - coloured forest, and
creepers of every tint blazing between the
trunks. And at the end you come out on a
glacier, and far up in a rocky cup there is a
spring. It took me some time to realise that
this was the real source of the Nile—the place
which Alexander the Great saw in his dreams,
and Speke and Baker thought they had found
in Lake Victoria. All around us was a snow-
field which might have been on the aiguilles
above Chamonix. I have often felt the lack of
the true geographical imagination, for I could
not focus the place in my thoughts. The little
trickle I drank of, instead of running down to
feed some tame Swiss torrent, was the head
waters of the greatest and most mysterious
river in the world. . . . We camped beside it,
and bitterly cold we found it, and then before
dawn next morning we started for the summit.
I thought the snow very difficult, and it was a
blessing to get on hard rock. In one couloir
Marjory fell and pulled Mr Astbury out of his
steps. They were well held, but it took us an
hour to get them up, for we had to dig gigantic
caverns before we got a step that was really safe."

"Had you any view "
"For five minutes on the top we saw the
kingdoms of the earth spread out beneath us.
Then the mist came down, and we had a weary
descent before we reached our high camp.
Marjory and I were utterly tired and soaked
to the bone. Do you remember that evening,
Mr Astbury, with the rain pelting on our tents,
after we had drunk soup and brandy and got
into dry clothes? You said that these occasions
got rid of every difference of education and
temperament and sex, and made us all elemental
human creatures, and I quite agreed with you.
It was worth while travelling a long way to
hear our critical Marjory gloating over food
like a glutton and talking wild mountaineering
slang with the guides."
"She's an uncommonly fine climber," said Mr
Astbury with conviction. "There was a bit on
the highest rocks, as bad as anything on the
Grèpon, and she took it like a chamois. I don't
praise you, Lady Lucy, for there's nothing you
can't do. Besides, you are an old mountaineer.
But it gives me enormous pleasure to have made
another convert."
"Perhaps I should not care for ordinary
climbing," said Miss Haystoun, who looked very
beautiful with the flush of sunburn in place of

her wonted pallor. "But Ruwenzori can be
like nothing in the world. The sharp contrast
between the rich moist glens and the cool snow
is an intoxication in itself. Besides, why should
I not be a lover of mountains? We have all
in our breasts odds and ends of strange souls.
If we were clean-cut, four-square beings we
should not be worth talking to."
Lord Appin nodded approval. "When I was
a very young man at Oxford," he said, "I
evolved what I flattered myself was a new
system of philosophy. I called it Romanticism.
It was a very crude system, strong on the
aesthetic and ethical sides, but lamentably weak
in logic and metaphysics. Its central doctrine,
if it could be said to have one, was that truth,
virtue, happiness, all the ideals, were attained
by the clash of opposites. Holiness was possible
only as the result of the struggle of the soul with
an alien world; happiness as the outcome of pain
endured and difficulties surmounted. The beauty
of art was the conquest of human genius over
intractable matter. And romance—an abstrac-
tion of my own which I interwove with the whole
system—was the perpetual contrast between the
human spirit and its environment—nobility side
by side with baseness in one soul, or the courage
of man transcending impossible disasters, or

beauty flowering in a mean place. It was a
very young man's confession of faith, and yet
there was the glimmering of a truth at the back
of it. It was my instinctive protest against the
undue simplification of life. We are all a strange
compound, and we shall never reach our full
stature by starving certain parts of our nature
of their due. What you call romance, Marjory,
is another form of the old conflict between the
real and the ideal, the world into which we are
born and the world which we would recreate for
ourselves. It involves conflict between ideals,
but not the neglect and starvation of any. Of
course this truth is at the bottom of our new

conception of empire. Imperialism
But at this point the Duchess rose. "You are
slipping into politics, Bob," she said. "Never
mind Imperialism to-night, but by all means let
us talk about romance. Letty has a fascinating
story she might tell us if you asked her very
nicely. . . ."
Soon the company were settled comfortably
around the fire in the inner hall. Mrs Yorke,
after a little pressure, had sent to her room for
a despatch-box, from which she took a small
manuscript book.
"I don't know why I should bore you with
family history," she said, "but I was once rash

enough to tell Susan this story, and she liked it,
and said it was an allegory and true of us all.
I have no theories about it, except that it seems
to fit in very well with what Lord Appin has
been saying. So if it amuses you, you shall
have it.
"There was a certain relative of my husband's
whom I shall call Sir Charles Weston. It is not
his real name, and Lord Appin will probably see
through the disguise, as Susan did, but I owe it
to my self-respect not to be more explicit. He
was an eminent lawyer—at least he made a large
fortune in the law courts—and, above all things,
he was an earnest Liberal. His life was published
not so very long ago in two volumes, and I re-
member that his biographers said that he was
almost the last of the old stalwart God-fearing
statesmen. They said that he lived only for the
great causes of peace, economy, and reform. He
left among his papers some notes, called "Reflec-
tions on certain modern tendencies,' which are
not very cheerful reading. He assumes the rôle
of a minor prophet, and cries "Ichabod' to the
future of Israel.
"I only met him once, shortly after my
marriage. He had disapproved of it strongly;
indeed there was hardly a vice which he did
not trace to the "Americanising' of England.

He said that the people of the United States
had fallen like Lucifer from their high estate,
and the latest American he had any respect for
was Jefferson. Once he made Henry very angry
by telling him that all American women seemed
to be serving behind an intellectual counter.
However, he disapproved so much of Henry on
every ground that one blunder more or less did
not make much difference. I had to be taken to
see him, and the prospect made me very nervous.
But he turned out quite kind, and he had nice,
courtly, old-fashioned manners, which I thought
sweet. He was a great philanthropist, but rather
a dictator, I fancy, for he had no idea of giving
the poor any choice in the way they should be
helped. His face was like an old woman's—
amiable, vacant, a little foolish, though he had
moments of mental activity when a kind of
power would come into it. His talk was one
mosaic of moral and political platitudes; and I
should have said that he had never possessed
the imagination of a cow.
"Well, he died, full of years and honour, and
to our amazement he left all his papers to
Henry. We sorted them out, and the Liberation
Society, or something of the kind, wanted to
have his life written, so we handed over the bulk
of them. But one little diary we kept to our-
selves. There was a big diary in about thirty

volumes which plays a great part in the biog-
raphy. But the little diary which we found in
an old safe did not appear in that work.
"I shall never forget the day we found it.
Henry picked it up and said, 'Another diary,'
opened it at random, and began to read: 'Rhoda
came to-night as I sat alone in the Purple
Chamber. There was no lamp, and her pale
beauty shone in the dusk like the silver of
moonlight. I thought how in this little dancing-
girl one caught something of the mystery'—and
then Henry could read no more, but sat down
and gasped. When he found his breath he could
only keep repeating, 'The old scamp !'
"We tried another page, and found an account
of some battle that Sir Charles talked of having
fought, and then a long tale of a mid-winter march
on the Danube. Henry, when he heard this, ob-
served that to his certain knowledge his relative
had never been out of England. Last of all, we
came on a reference to Theodora, his wife. "My
great-aunt," said Henry, "was christened Eliza-
beth Anne. There are three possible explana-
tions of this affair. Either he was a most
uncommon old sinner, or a most accomplished
liar, or as mad as a March hare. I incline to
the last.'
"But he was wrong, for in a little while we
hit upon the right explanation. I think I was

the first to see it, but after we had read the
diary through, doubt was impossible. We saw
that behind the bland Sir Charles there had
stood another figure, Heaven knows what
revenant from the splendid past. There were
two souls in his body, one timid, pragmatical,
humane, slow, and stupid—the soul of all demo-
cratic lawyers from the beginning of time; the
other the soul of a king, merciless, passionate,
and incomparably able. So all the time he lived
a double life. In the daytime he went through
the ordinary routine. He was a great advocate
of the reform of the criminal law, he was presi-
dent of the London Missionary Society, and in
the House of Commons he was famous for his
attacks upon Tory extravagance, and especially
upon militarism. He emptied the House, for he
was the prince of bores. Disraeli said that he
made a solitude and called it a Peace debate.
"But late at night and in the early morn-
ings and at odd moments the other soul had
its chance. And then he was an Emperor of
Byzantium, ruling half the world with an iron
hand. The diary showed his accession to power,
for to begin with he was only John Chrysaor,
the General of the Army of the East. Bit by
bit he became the strong man in the empire. He
won the Church to his side, and when he fought

a great battle on the eastern marches which
turned back the tide of Mohammedan invasion,
he became the popular hero. The Emperor died,
leaving an effeminate son as his successor; but
John hurried back to New Rome, cleared out the
mob of eunuchs and parasites, and seized the
throne with universal goodwill. Then began a
reign of iron, as appeared from the little diary.
The Emperor John fought the Church and won,
he subdued a Dacian insurrection, he built palaces
and churches, he ransacked East and West for
art treasures, and he had great dreams of restor-
ing the unity of the empire and carrying his court
to Rome.
"I am not going to retell this wild story, but
once, after I had been ill, I amused myself with
taking the two diaries and comparing the entries.
In the little book no year was given, but it
seemed to correspond to a certain epoch in the
long one, and the days and months followed as
regularly as in the other. So I chose parallel
passages of the same date, to show the gulf be-
tween the two souls. -
"The first is dated June 10th. In the large
diary he wrote—
"'I have been in the House all afternoon. Indian
frontier policy was discussed, and Disraeli made a
flippant and hectoring reply to the profound argu-

ments of Mr G. Many applauded, and, being
unable to find a chance to speak, I came away greatly
saddened. Liberalism for the moment is eclipsed and
shadowed by a vulgar worship of reaction. Do these
vain people who prate about the prestige of Britain
ever reflect, I wonder, on the shallow foundations of
their creed ? We have taken upon ourselves re-
sponsibilities which carry with them no increase in
moral stature—nay, which minister to the lowest
and most depraved elements in our nature. We
claim a right to rule certain dark-skinned peoples,
thereby offending against the oldest and most indis-
putable of human rights—the right to liberty. It
tickles our sense of authority, and degrades alike our
reason and our conscience. And it always brings
war. These stay-at-home roysterers are very ready
to unsheath the sword. Well for their peace of mind
that they cannot realise the horrors of which they
are, before God, the cause. The older I grow the
deeper becomes my conviction that in these days of
enlightenment no war can be justified. Every war—
I do not care what its pretext—must be a blunder in
statesmanship and a sin against the Most High.'
"On the same day he wrote in the little
diary—
"'It is the evening of the greatest day in my life.
The blood is crusted over my eyes, my left arm is
crippled, and I am caked in dust. A quarter of my
men are slain, but the enemy have been ground
between the millstones. I staked everything on a
great throw and I have won. I sent my cavalry into
a death-trap well aware that few would return, but
the ruse succeeded, and the Emirs found their own
shambles before the sun set. . . . To-morrow at

dawn five thousand captives, with the Cross branded
on their shoulders, shall be sent to New Rome as the
first fruits of my victory. The plunder follows, and
I can see the weak eyes of my Imperial Master glitter
when he sees the spoils of Damascus in his treasury.
. . . I have taken the first step in the great march to
a Throne and nothing but death can stop my pilgrim-
age. Nay, death is an ally: he will not betray one
who has offered him such princely bribes. . . ."
"The strange thing," Mrs Yorke continued,
"is that the entries in the two books always cor-
respond. If any subject has been occupying his
mind in the one diary it reappears in some form
or other in the second. For instance, he made a
great speech at a meeting at Exeter Hall to protest
against Gordon's proposal to take Zebehr Pasha,
the ex-slave-dealer, as his colleague. It is printed
in full in the Life, and the editors remark that
'the passionate conscience of England spoke
through its chosen mouthpiece." In the entry
in the little diary we read—
"To-day the fruits of my Dacian wars were sold
in the market. Fifty maids were kept for the Palace,
and five hundred of the lustiest young men were
enrolled in the Praetorians. New Rome will be full
of stalwart barbarians, and the Circus enriched by
promising recruits. Would that each year could see
an infusion of such virile stock among our languid
citizens!'
"On September 25th he was adding to
Fairholme, his place in Surrey, and was very

much worried about the cost. Says the big
diary—
"'I can postpone the addition no longer, but I
seriously grudge the outlay. I have taken the best
advice I could find and have made considerable
reductions in the estimates, but the expense still
seems to me undue. The ground-floor of the new
wing will be occupied by a library and a billiard-
room, the floor above by six bedrooms, each of which
—my wife insists—must have its own bathroom.
Elizabeth is anxious that the housemaids shall have
better quarters, so the top-floor will be utilised . . .'
and so on with many tiresome details.
"Now for the little book—
"To-day the building of my summer Palace begins.
The walls will rise level with the cliffs, and the portico
will be open to the sea. For months ships have
brought Parian marble and cedar logs to the little
wharf below, and this morning the first hammer
rang on the foundations. The great library is on
the side facing the hills, so that I may have the open
air even when the wind blows. There the hundred
thousand volumes which Philotimus has gathered for
me will be housed in cedar cabinets, and there I may
find peace to wrestle with the problems of the state.
It has been my order that the work should proceed
by night and day, and the torch-lit dusk will be a
sign to Theodora of my love, for it is for her sake
alone that I burden my soul with trifles.'
"Which," said Mrs Yorke, "brings us to
Theodora. The Emperor John had a wide choice
of princesses, but he imitated Justinian in falling

in love with a slave-girl who was also a popular
actress. He married her, and judging by the
diary, she seems to have led him a pretty dance.
She had other lovers, and there is a really horrid
passage in the book where he describes the
revenge he took on the man he found in the
Empress's boudoir. The two most piquant con-
trasts in the diaries concern the two women
whom he thought he loved. On January 17th
we read in the big diary—
"'I have just returned from the churchyard where
all that is mortal of my dear wife was this afternoon
laid to rest. Even in my private diary I cannot write
the thoughts which are now surging in on my mind.
The sense of loss has crippled my power of reflection
and drugged my memory. For forty years she was
my comrade and friend, the sharer of every hope and
every sorrow. Elizabeth was one of those rare women
whose price is indeed above rubies. In her husband's
work and in the calm atmosphere of the home her
sweet, pure domesticity found perfect content. No
passion ever ruffled the calm surface of her soul. As
I think of her, I realise how unstable a foundation
for wedded happiness is the volcanic love which
modern poets prate of. Mutual respect, a vivid
interest in the personality of each other, a gentle
and constant affection, are the only guarantees of
that private tranquillity which enables a man to face
the rough fortunes of the outer world. Passion 1
The word should be expunged from our language,
for when it is not begotten of folly and weak emotion
it is first cousin to morbidity and vice.'

"Under the same date in the little book there
is a rhapsody on Theodora's beauty which is not
unlike the Song of Solomon. And there is a long
passionate appeal to her to give him her heart
as he had given her his. I will not read these
passages, for the style of Byzantium was—well,
Byzantine. And then the statesman appears,
for the Emperor John was, like Napoleon, un
étre politique. He tells his love of the power
which shall be hers, and the honours and
treasures that he will cast at her feet.
"These dogs of the Senate and the Church have
again besought me to break with you. They say that
the sacrosanctity of the throne will be gone if it is
shared with a dancing-girl. Who are they to dictate
the choice of an Emperor of Rome! I swear to you,
angel, by the Most High God that I will create for
you a new earth. Cities and temples shall be ground
into dust to make a path for these delicate feet. Your
white hand shall fling open the door of a new Empire.
Together we will sweep across the west, and when
we have crushed the barbarians and shaken down the
dotards of Italy, our palace shall be the Capitol, and
you and I, little one, side by side, shall rule the world
from the secular throne of Augustus.'"
"And what happened in the end?" Marjory
asked.
"Alas, the diary stops long before Rome was
conquered. He had an illness some years before
his death, and after that he never resumed it.

But how I wish that I had known that all the
while, when he was talking platitudes at Henry,
one-half of him was revelling in such a dream l'
"And the moral of that is ?" asked the
Duchess.
"Surely, Susan," said Lord Appin, "that we
are such very composite creatures that, as Mar-
jory said, we should be very shy of dogmatising
on each other's natures. That, I suppose, is the
worst platitude I have ever uttered, but then,
all morals are platitudes, and you asked me for
one."
"Well, I think they were both very unpleas-
ant characters—especially the Emperor John.
Sir Charles was at least respectable."
"Really, Aunt Susan," said Lady Flora, "we
have all got to the stage of talking like Alice
in Wonderland. Don't you think it is time to
go to bed!"

CHAPTER XI.
THE evenings had grown milder, and after dinner
it was possible to sit in one of the airier draw-
ing-rooms which opened on the stoep. So soft
was the weather that the great windows were
left half open, and through them blew scented
wafts from the gardens.
Mrs Deloraine's beautiful head was silhouetted
by a little lamp against an ebony screen. She
arranged some papers on a table beside her and
began to speak in her curiously gentle voice.
"I have been given my orders by Francis, and
I can't disobey them. But I hope you will be
a very charitable audience. I am not a contro-
versialist, and, though I have written a little it
is very hasty and imperfect, and I shall have to
supplement it as best I can. I want to speak
about the bearing of our creed upon the aesthetic
side of life, and my only claim to speak on the
subject is that I was warned that I should be
expected to deal with it, and I have been trying

to think it over on our Ruwenzori trip. Moun-
tains give one a hill-top prospect, but they
do not help one to put ideas into a clear
system. So if what I say is very full of loose
ends, you must remember the mountains and
forgive me.
"I know no pocket definition of Art. But as
I understand it, it is the quest of beauty under
certain conditions. All honest work, all right
conduct, all true speech, have beauty in them,
and the worker and the speaker are in one sense
artists. But in its usual acceptation it means a
conscious quest, where beauty is the goal sought
for its own sake, and not the attendant of an
alien ideal. And this beauty must be presented
in terms of our common life. Poetry must be
written in some tongue familiar to mankind;
painting works through the homely medium of
paint and canvas, and makes its appeal to eyes
accustomed to the rough world; music is con-
tained in notes within the range of the human
ear. In a deeper sense, too, Art is rooted in life.
For its material must not be sought in some
rarefied world, or even in certain carefully defined
provinces of that world which we know. Our
poetry must not come from the stars or the Far
Islands, but from the men and women we see
daily, and the warm breathing life which we

286 A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS.
call 'real' because we cannot escape from it.
To Art nothing can be unclean or common, pro-
vided it has the warrant of reality. If we limit
ourselves by any of the many conventions which
have stifled growth, and say that Art can deal
only with the fortunes of gentlefolk, or, at the
other extreme, of peasants; that Art belongs to
civilisation and is urban at heart, or that it is
natural and untamed and can be found only in
the wilds; that it must deal with things fair
and comely or only with the ugliness and tragedy
of life, then we sin against its catholicity and
truth.
"But all this is only to define the material and
to leave out the spirit. The realist is so absorbed
in the variety and multiplicity of the world, that
he imagines that in a dull chronicle of details he
has fulfilled the purpose of the artist. But the
essence of Art is that it is creative. It brings
into the wilderness the shaping spirit of imagin-
ation, and by selection, by a deeper instinct, it
shows us harmony in chaos, nobility in the
squalid, and a fugitive poetry in the common-
place. The temporal, in the hand of Art, takes
on the guise of the eternal. The ordinary man
sees in a passing face comeliness, or want, or
vice, or misery, but when fixed on the canvas
of a master the original is forgotten, and the

whole tale of mortal passion is enshrined in that
face for the seeing eye. Art is the revolt against
the bondage of the superficial, the accidental, and
the trite. It means always a spiritual adventure
and the conquest of new worlds for the mind—
worlds none the less new because they are the
re-creation of the old. Every one has known
what it is to visit a place many times and find
it dreary and uninspiring, till one day comes an
hour of illumination, and the common fields and
woods are touched with a light that never
leaves them. Art brings this fairyland gleam to
life, and we realise that it is no importation
from without but life itself laid bare in its pro-
foundest meaning.
"I am one of those who hold the orthodox view
about Art. Its purpose to my mind is not
merely to inform, or merely to delight, but to
illumine. I believe that there are fixed laws of
beauty, canons for the artist which are as eternal
as beauty itself. But we need not delay now
to discuss these ultimate questions of aesthetics.
The truth I wish to enforce is, that while the
canons of Art may be limited and stationary the
subject-matter to which they apply is endless
and ever growing. Its boundaries are extended
with each addition to the world's knowledge.
To my mind the worst crime against the laws

288 A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS.
of Art is the attempt to limit their sphere of
application.
"For mark what happens. We are left with a
weary catalogue of things which Art may play
with. And because a wall has been built round
them, they are divorced from the rest of life, and
become in themselves a phantasmal world. Their
roots are no longer in reality, and therefore there
can be no growth. The artist becomes a man-
ipulator of mechanical toys, very subtle, exquis-
itely clever, and utterly futile—a purveyor of
second-hand emotions and academic tragedies.
The Muses become either genteel spinsters or
stupid housemaids. For you cannot subdue the
winds of the world to orderly breezes which
never ruffle or chill, and when Art becomes
domestic it dies.
"I seem to find in our Art to-day something of
this vice, not so much in creed as in practice.
We have not the wits to see that life is a violent,
far-ranging thing, delighting in large contrasts
and nobly tolerant. We are too fond of little
prettinesses, too complex, too preoccupied with
the small intricate things to have leisure for the
great simple things which are the root of the
matter. So we spend our time spinning cocoons,
excellent as cocoons go, but, if I may borrow
Lady Flora's pet phrase about people, they

'don't matter.' And the result is that Art
misses that direct emotional appeal which is the
final test of its truth. Great Art affects us with
something of the emotion of life. The high rubs
shoulders with the low, and the face of the
laugher changes suddenly into the face of the
seer and prophet. Cleopatra passes from banter
with a peasant to the loftiest of human solilo-
quies. But in our dim half-world such heights
are beyond us. We have too little of the real,
for we are apt to limit arbitrarily the material of
our art, and the ideal eludes us because it belongs
to a nobler philosophy than ours. I am afraid
we are in danger of decadence, and our only hope
is in finding a new world.
"If I were a great poet I should write an epic
on new worlds. A veil seems to lift when life is
becoming dingy and narrow, and, behold ! the
gleam of dawn on untravelled seas. Men sud-
denly look up from their daily round and become
aware of a great hope. It may be the revelation
of a new Messiah or a new social creed, or in the
literal sense a new world. Now, what we espe-
cially need is the last, for our Art wants above all
things something of that spirit which you may
call Ionian or Elizabethan or romantic, as you
please. It is an enlarged basis of life that we
require, rather than a new interpretation of our

present routine. We must be shaken out of our
content and our cynicism, and shown that the
earth is full of wonderful and beautiful things,
and that the wisdom of our grandfathers has not
exhausted it. I believe in my heart that such a
revelation awaits us. Mankind stands at the
end of one long epoch, and has made itself master
of the material globe. Science has opened her
door half-way to us, we have circumnavigated
and explored the whole earth, but still we are
only at the beginning. For there still remains
the task of taking possession — of reshaping all
our creeds to correspond with our new heritage,
and remodelling our heritage on an ideal plan.
I am only concerned with the meaning of this
illumination for Art, and two truths seem to be
vital. The first is that we must absorb this
enlarged material basis and make it part of our
spiritual life. Otherwise it remains only a mys-
terious background, such as we find in the Roman
decadence, while all the time we go on living
among our stale conventions. To us, as to the
poets of the Silver Age, the outer empire will be
only matter for a metaphor or a jest, unless we
draw it within the circle of our lives. The second
is that we must carry into our new sphere the
inherited traditions of our culture, and not jet-
tison them as useless ballast. Art, remember,

looks towards the future, but her foundations are
always in the past. Otherwise we shall become
outlaws from her kingdom, and all the freshness
of a new earth will not avail since we have lost
the canons of interpretation. This, I think, is
the weakness of so much colonial poetry. The
novelty of the matter is believed to atone for the
absence of the great tradition in the manner.
But the rococo phrases of Fleet Street will never
reproduce the mystery of the wilderness. What
is lost, however, in Art which is colonial, and
therefore provincial, may be recovered in Art
which is imperial."
"I think I understand what you mean," said
Lady Warcliff, "but I am far from certain that I
agree with you. I should have thought that the
essence of empire is the indefiniteness of its
horizon and the unexplored chances of its future,
whereas the essence of Art is that it works within
clear limits. Surely, for "great verse' we are
taught to look to a 'little clan.' Material great-
ness is generally assumed to be hostile to spiritual
perfection."
Mrs Deloraine was always embarrassed by Lady
Warcliff's precision. "I know that opinion," she
said a little nervously, "but I most profoundly
disagree with it. Of course, Art works within
limits and abhors loose outlines. This has been

said a hundred times, as in Goethe's famous
line— -
"In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister.'
But these limits are the eternal laws of Art's
being and not the accidents of circumstance.
Power and space will kill Art unless they are
absorbed by the spirit of the artist. But that is
not to say that when properly used they may not
be Art's best allies. Just as asceticism is only
possible for those who have some inner core of
grossness in their nature, so those who would
make Art a nun are those who are also capable
of making her a courtesan. It is a creed whose
spirituality is not more but less than ours. If
we limit Art to simple men and a little nation,
we assume that her spiritual power is so slight
that she will be overwhelmed and coarsened by
a richer material environment. What warrant
have we for so low a view of the fire in her
heart? I grant you that in a great empire she
walks in dangerous paths, but then the goal is
more splendid, and it would be the part of
cowardice to shirk the journey.
"I do not think that in this company at any
rate I need linger on this point. My business
is to try to show wherein the creed which we
call Imperialism offers Art that new world

which she needs. I remember that when I
was a young girl the very name of Empire
was a hateful thing to me. All the old orderly
life which I loved seemed to be threatened by
these barbarians who talked in a strange jargon,
half mercantile, half Jingo. Their Palace of Art
seemed to be constructed on the lines of a
New York sky-scraper, and their music was
the thumping of a brass band. And yet even
then I seemed to hear behind the shouting
a new note which haunted me in spite of my
prejudice. As I grew older I came to live less
in the past, and looked more to the realities of
the world around me. Art came to be less a
thing of dainty memories and delicate echoes,
and more and more something solemn and
tragic, and yet instinct with immortal humour,
the voice of God speaking through the clamour
of His creations. And then I felt the need
of a wider horizon, a hope which should not
be the perquisite of the few but the treasure
of the humble. And suddenly I saw that I
had been blind and deaf to a new world of
which simple folk had long ago entered into
possession.
"Imperialism brings into life, and therefore into
Art, which is life's interpretation, a vision of a
wider world. It shows us all the hard walled-in

highroads which we had thought eternal, open-
ing out on an upland which still retains the
light of morning. That is the first of its gifts.
Stale conventions, preciosity, all vapouring and
trifling prettiness, must perish in that high air.
Democracy, we agreed some time ago, cleared
the way for superiority. So, too, this Imperial-
ism of ours will clear the way for great Art
by withering all that is petty and unreal.
There is a profound maxim of S. Augustine's,
'Ubi magnitudo, ibi veritas,'—a maxim which,
like all truths, is equally true in its converse.
Greatness and truth in Art must walk hand in
hand. And this vision brings with it a new
hope, and without hope there is no enduring
quality in any mortal work. Art demands in
its creator an abounding optimism and vitality.
He must see beyond all the tangles and deserts
of the way to the ultimate city on its hill-top,
and he must go singing on his pilgrimage.
"This new world, again, is not only a world
of cities but of wilds. We have grown deplor-
ably urban in our civilisation. We still talk of
nature, but it is a garden-nature, and its interest
for us is only in its bearing upon our petty life.
We are always on the watch for the 'pathetic
fallacy," and we read into the inanimate world
some trivial human moral. But nature, equally

with man, is the cipher of the Divine, and we
shall never fathom it until we learn that it
has a key of its own.
"I mean," said Mrs Deloraine, looking up
from her notes, "that we want a new poetry
of nature, nature in its simplicity and vastness
and savagery. Our modern civilisation, with
its suburban country, gives us no scope for
getting at the heart of the great forces which
endure when we and all our work have perished.
We take them as a pious opinion, something to
make phrases about, but what chance does our
normal life hold of any true communion ? An
ampler and newer earth will bring us back to
the beginning of things. We shall feel the spray
on our faces from antediluvian seas, and our lips
will be salt with their brine. Our great poet
when he arises will not be a Wordsworth, for
he will be too bowed down with the wonder
of it all to have any desire to read into it
a system of philosophy. He will look on the
world, I fancy, as Homer must have looked
on that youthful world of his, rejoicing in its
marvels, and seeing in them the working of some
ageless plan, and yet facing it all with that frank
human hope which tells him that neither space
nor time can conquer the spirit.
"But there is no hope without mystery. The

horizon must not be too clear if the adventurer
is to have the true joy of his enterprise. Some-
thing magical and beautiful must lurk behind
the twilight haze. Art cannot rise to the
heights, except in the consciousness of a
destiny too infinite to be expressed in for-
mulas. We have tried our best to materialise
life. We have stifled it with prudential maxims,
we have turned policy into a profit-and-loss
account, and we have striven to analyse and
docket the aspirations of the human heart.
And we have failed, grossly and finally.
Science, once the ally of the economists, has
ranged herself on the side of the poets. It is
because Imperialism gives us a world whose
boundaries no man can define that it ministers
especially to the needs of Art. You remember
the chorus in the Bacchae :-
'Knowledge, we are not foes |
I seek thee diligently;
But the world with a great wind blows,
Shining, and not from thee;
Blowing to beautiful things,
On, amid dark and light,
Till Life, through the trammellings
Of Laws that are not the Right,
Breaks clean and pure, and sings
Glorying to God on the height !"
1 Bacchae, 1007-1010 (Mr Gilbert Murray's translation).

"But this creed of ours has a vertical as well
as a horizontal extension. It not only carries
the few into a wider world, but it carries all
classes in the State. In the true sense it is
democratic, for its ends can only be attained by
the union of all citizens. It cries out for a new
sense of civic duty, a richer and more enduring
ideal of civic well-being. Politics will cease to
be the hobby of the few and become the duty
and the privilege of all. So, too, the Art which
is to come to fruit in such a State must be, as
all great Art has been, a democratic thing. Art
has never truly flourished when it was the per-
quisite of a class or a sect. The minor poet
who creates a little garden of his own, and de-
clares that no vulgar wind from the outer world
shall ever shake his rose-trees, stands confessed
by his declaration as eternally second-rate. If
a man has not the wit to be a citizen he has
still less the wit to be an artist. In an empire
inspired throughout with a corporate ideal we
shall recapture for our Art something of the
immortal simplicity of the Greek spirit, which
did not disdain the market-place or the schools
or the battlefield. Our Muse must put off her
modish silks and gems, which so quickly tarnish,
and go out like a beggar-maid to the highways
of the world. But in the end she will find far

nobler jewels, for in her eyes there will be star-
light and on her brow the glory of morning.
"But, as I have already said, we must carry
into the new world all that is best in our past.
For Art at bottom is conservative. The laws
of her kingdom are immutable, though her sub-
jects change and her boundaries expand. The
categories remain the same though their con-
tent may alter. This morning I went fishing
in a meadow on the edge of the downs. Angling
has long been a classic sport, and Izaak Walton
ages ago gave it a certain literary atmosphere.
When I think of a trout-stream I think of the
Lea or the Dove—English meadows, with clear,
slow-flowing water, little fishing-houses on the
bank, old country inns to lodge at, milkmaids
and gipsy choruses, and Corydon's song among
the willows. Or I think of some Scotch burn
falling in golden pools, overhung with rowan-
berries, with the scent of thyme and heather
around, and all the magic of long tradition.
But my fishing to-day was a revelation. Only
the big trout and the clear water and the limpid
air belonged to my old picture. I cast my flies
over strange flowers, and the birds which I
stirred were not larks or curlews. My gillie
was a Masai hunter, who carried a gun in case
of meeting wild animals. And when I stopped

to rest and looked round, I did not see English
woodlands or a Scotch glen, but the immense
mystical panorama of Equatoria. I realised how,
even in a little thing like a sport, it was only
the essentials that mattered, and that it might
be carried to any clime, provided the spirit re-
mained unchanged. It seemed to me a kind of
parable for Art. She may trim her sails and
set her helm for new seas, but the ship and the
compass are the same as of old. Abana and
Pharpar are running rivers like Jordan. And
though the waters are strange, and wilder forests
clothe unfamiliar hills, she will still hear the
pipes of Pan among the trees, and in some
secret glade have sight of Venus and the sister
nymphs—
'Panaque, Silvanumque senem, Nymphasque sorores.'"
Mrs Deloraine paused and looked deprecat-
ingly at the company. "I am afraid that what
I have had to say has been very confused and
schwärmerisch. Perhaps I can put it better in
verse, for I am more accustomed to write in
that form than in prose. I have here a kind
of dialogue between Youth and the Spirit of Art,
in which the same idea appears as I have been
trying to expound. May I read it, if it does
not bore you?"

Being assured of the attention of her audience,
Mrs Deloraine read the following poem:—
YoUTH.
Angel of love and light and truth,
In whose deep eyes the stars are set,
And in whose calm unchanging youth,
The mysteries of the world have met,
What means thy forward-beckoning hand,
The steadfast brow, the enraptur'd gaze?
They point me to a lonely land—
I cannot pierce the twilight haze.
With thee of old I walked at noon
In gardens where the airs were kind,
And from thy lips I read the rune
Of joy in every wave and wind.
We roamed blue hills of far romance,
We worshipped at the ancient shrines:
For us the oreads joined their dance
At even in the moonlit pines.
What darkling spell has rent thy skies
And turned thy heart to steel and fire,
And drawn across thy starry eyes
The curtains of a wild desire?
THE SPIRIT of ART.
I change not. I am old as Time
And younger than the dews of morn.
Those lips will sing the world's high prime
Which blessed the toils when life was born.

I am the priestess of the flame
Which on the eternal altar springs;
Beauty and truth and joy and fame
Sleep in the shelter of my wings.
I wear the mask of age and clime,
But he who of my love is fain
Must learn my heart which knows not time,
And seek my path which fears not pain,_
Till, bruised and worn with wandering
In the dark wilds my feet have trod,
He hears the songs the Immortals sing
At even in the glades of God.
YoUTH.
Angel, that heart I seek to know,
I fain would make thy word my stay,
Upon thy path I yearn to go
If thy clear eyes will light the way.
But ancient loves my memory hold,
And I am weak and thou art strong;
I fear the blasts of outland cold,—
Say if the way be dark and long.
THE SPIRIT of ART.
On mountain lawns, in meads of spring,
With idle boys bedeck thy hair,
Or in deep greenwood loitering
Tell to thy heart the world is fair.

That joy I give, but frail and poor
Is such a boon, for youth must die;
A little day the flowers endure,
And clouds o'erride the April sky.
Upon the windy ways of life,
In dark abyss of toil and wrong,
Through storm and sun, through death and strife,
I seek the nobler spheral song.
No dulcet lute with golden strings
Can hymn the world that is to be.
Out of the jarring soul of things
I weave the eternal harmony.—
In forest deeps, in wastes of sand,
Where the cold snows outdare the skies:
Where wanderers roam uncharted lands,
And the last camp-fire flares and dies:
In sweating mart, in camp and court,
Where hopes forlorn have vanquished ease:
Where ships, intent on desperate port,
Strain through the quiet of lonely seas:
Where'er o'erborne by sense and sin,
With bruised head and aching hand,
Guarding the holy fire within,
Man dares to steel his heart and stand—
Breasting the serried spears of fate,
Broken and spent, yet joyous still,
Matching against the blind world's hate
The stark battalions of his will:—

Whoso hath ears, to him shall fall,
When stars are hid and hopes are dim,
To hear the heavenly voices call,
And, faint and far, the cosmic hymn—
That hymn of peace when wars are done,
Of joy which breaks through tears of pain,
Of dawns beyond the westering sun,
Of skies clear shining after rain.
No sinless Edens know the song,
No Arcady of youth and light,
But, born amid the glooms of wrong,
It floats upon the glimmering height,
Where they who faced the dust and scars,
And shrank not from the fires of hate,
Can walk among the kindred stars,
Master of Time and lords of Fate.
And haply then will youth, reborn,
Restore the world thou fain wouldst hold;
The dawn of an auguster morn
Will flush thy skies with fairy gold.
The flute of Pan in wild-wood glade
Will pipe its ancient sweet refrain;
Still, still for thee through April shade
Will Venus and her sister train
Lead the old dance of spring and youth.
But thine the wiser, clearer eyes,
Which having sought the shrine of truth
And faced the unending sacrifice,

Mr Wakefield had listened to Mrs Deloraine's
theories of art with an interested but puzzled
expression. He was so wholly under the spell
of her charm that he was prepared to take every
word she uttered for gospel, and his sense of the
ridiculous, which made him explosive in the pres-
ence of the transcendental, was rapidly perish-
ing from disuse. A strenuous career at the Bar,
and a middle age spent mainly in fiscal contro-
versy, had not fitted him to appreciate a dis-
course on aesthetic. But he was cheerful and
congratulatory about the poem.
"I know what you mean by a background of
mystery," he said. "I wish I could take you
up with me to the great lakes and forests of
our northern country, and show you some of our
voyageurs. You might make a lot out of them.
I think you are perfectly right in saying that
what poetry wants is a fresh subject, and not
something that has been hammered at by every

poet since King David. I can no more read
Tennyson than I can drink stagnant water."
Mrs Deloraine looked a little aghast at this
version of her conclusions. Sir Edward, whose
eyes had a far-away look, said abruptly from a
dark corner—
"Do you know that what you have been say-
ing is what I have been trying to think out for
a long time? It is what distinguishes our own
people from any other breed of pioneer. We
won't admit any hard-and-fast line between the
known and the unknown, and so our horizon is
always a little misty. The Frenchman wants to
draw a clear line and say that all on one side is
civilisation, and all on the other side is bar-
barism, and he doesn't care a cent what becomes
of it. He wants a cosy self-contained little
kingdom, because at heart he fears the wilds,
while we love them. Our people won't admit
any final march where they must stop short and
pitch their tents. They must always be pushing
on and possessing some new country. And
therefore there is no limit to their hopes, for
any evening may bring them to the Land of
Promise. There's a lot in that if you think
it over. I don't know much about art, but
I am sure Mrs Deloraine and I mean the same
thing."

Mr Lowenstein intervened as if to rescue the
unfortunate lady from Philistine approval.
"You have said many beautiful and convincing
things, for which I am very grateful. Our diffi-
culty as Imperialists has always been that,
though the common people may hear us gladly,
the elect will shrug their shoulders and turn
away. We are in danger of making Imperialism
purely what Mr Wakefield calls 'a business pro-
position,' and therefore of identifying it with an
arid, mercantile view of life. The people who
love beauty—the artists, the scholars, the poets
—will behave towards it like a well-dressed
woman towards a street accident—cast a glance
of pity or dislike, and then pass by on the other
side. I almost think that our most urgent duty
is to insist upon the spiritual renaissance at the
back of everything. For, properly regarded, our
creed is a religion, and we must hold it with the
fervour of a convert."
Lord Launceston abandoned his seat by the
window and came forward into the firelight to
get himself a cigarette.
"I think I agree with most of your conclu-
sions," he said, looking down at Mrs Deloraine;
"but you will not think me dull if I put the
thing more prosaically. We seek to show that
empire is not antagonistic to a high spiritual

development. I think we can go further and
prove that it may be a positive aid. But when
we have said that, we must be careful of going
further. For Imperialism is in its essence a
political thing. It is concerned with man as a
political animal, man in the social aspect, and not
directly with the spiritual life of the citizen. It
provides a fuller basis for art and morality, and,
I think I may add, religion, but in itself it is
none of these things. It deals—it must deal—
mainly with the formal side of life. I grant you
willingly that the tendency is for the vie intime
of any man to be more closely knit to the
communal life. But there must always remain
something which no state, however noble in its
character, can give—that inner peace and satis-
faction of the soul. Many of us, I think, tend
to exalt Imperialism to too high a plane, and
seek in a political ideal that which belongs only
to what, in the widest sense of the word, we call
religion. This seems to me a very real danger.
For if we make claims for our creed which it
cannot fulfil, sooner or later we shall discredit
it. No alchemy can turn the stones of our
dream-city into bread for the hungry."
Mrs Deloraine cried out in warm approval.
"I am so glad to hear you say that, for it is
what I should have liked to add if I had thought

my subject allowed of it. I feel that the over-
statement of our creed is one of the gravest
perils which it has to face. We must maintain
that it has its spiritual aspect, but we dare not
claim that in itself it will satisfy the eternal
cravings of the spirit. We may make a new
earth, a prosperous and happy and civilised
earth, but if our citizens can look no further
they will be worse off than at the beginning.
The poor man even now, broken by want and
disease, who can declare in his last hours that
his Redeemer liveth, has reached a spiritual
height to which no ideal citizenship of itself can
ever rise. I do not wish to preach about those
viewless things on which we all must make our
peace with our own souls, but I ask that we
recognise their profundity, and do not attempt
to allot them to a creed which has no answer to
make to them."
"That is the most sensible thing I have heard
you say, Barbara." The Duchess had slept
peacefully through the earlier discussion, and
had awakened in time to be shocked by Mr
Lowenstein. "Don't you see that if you con-
found religion with politics you are falling into
the very blunder which you were kind enough to
say was the favourite pastime of my party 2
You will vulgarise the one and sentimentalise

the other. I am old-fashioned enough to think
it impious, and, what is more to the purpose,
it is extremely silly. There is a kind of disease
in men's minds which compels them to break
down all the common-sense boundary-fences and
to turn every nostrum into a complete philosophy
of life. Why can't they be content with the
Here and leave the Hereafter to its proper
exponents? Tories like Caroline are always
telling me that politics have no principles and
are wholly opportunist, but if they were faithful
to their creed they would never try to stretch
the bounds of politics so wide that they include
provinces like religion where opportunism is
unthinkable."
The Duchess turned a friendly eye upon Mr
Wakefield, in whom she believed she would find
a supporter. Mr Wakefield, however, was too
much a devotee of Mrs Deloraine to be willing
to argue with his wonted brusqueness on a side
where he was uncertain of her sympathies. He
took refuge in a distinction.
"Of course you are right, generally speaking,
but then Imperialism is not quite an ordinary
political creed. We have already defined it as
an attitude of mind, and that implies some sort
of philosophy of life. I think Mrs Deloraine has
made the distinction clear. It gives us a better

basis for art and religion, but it does not take the
place of one or the other. I think that is true,
although, as I have often said, I am mortally
afraid of getting too high-falutin on the subject.
I detest mysticism and want to keep close to
fact, but at the same time that is no reason why
I should make our creed narrower than it really
is. There are many who will prefer the dessert
to the joint, and by all means let them have it
if it is in the bill of fare. The instinct of empire
is towards comprehension, not exclusion."
"Mr Wakefield has suggested the true
parallel," said Lord Appin, who had listened to
Mrs Deloraine with grave approval. "We do
not profess to teach a religion, but, if we are not
theologians, we are in a sense ecclesiastics. The
state, remember, has now taken the place of the
mediaeval church. Once we had popes and
bishops supervising the lives of their flock and
making themselves sponsors for their spiritual
well-being. But their pride crumbled, because
they fell into that very error against which
Lord Launceston has been warning us, and
sought to imprison the longings of the human
spirit within the narrow walls of creed and
ritual. Religion has triumphantly proved itself
stronger than ecclesiasticism, and to-day we see
a revolt—perhaps an unwise revolt—against all

that savours of formality. And yet man cannot
advance except through organised action, and
if his Church is destroyed under one guise he
will revive it under another. The Church in
the Middle Ages had three great attributes.
In the first place it was a brotherhood, a body
of men linked together by a common faith.
Again, it was inspired by an ideal which was
professedly spiritual, a creed where success or
failure was defined by other than material
standards. Lastly, it was surrounded by an
alien and hostile world, so that its members
were drawn close to each other, and filled with
a zeal which, according to our view of history,
we label missionary or intolerant. That old
church can never be re-established, for we have
travelled too far from the sanctions which gave
it strength. But we can no more do without
a church than without a religion. Only we
have learned nowadays that the true and
lasting work for which such an organisation is
adapted is rather political than doctrinal, and
that the Seal of the Fisherman is better affixed
to state decrees than to edicts against con-
science. I maintain that our view of empire
gives that empire something of the character
of a church. We are a brotherhood banded
together in a common quest. Our union, if

less mystic than that which Augustine preached,
has yet in it something not wholly human, not
merely the sum of individual effort. In the
midst of all our failures the work advances, for
the plan is greater than the builders. Above
all, we must achieve our desires in face of a
stubborn and alien world. All around us are
the frontiers of barbarism—I use the word as
the Greeks used it. It is this environment
which will perfect our brotherhood and give us
something of the old crusading fervour. And
if we have this clear purpose, not untouched
with emotion, our empire will be another, and
more truly Catholic, church. Then — to use
Plato's phrase—the quest of truth will not lack
the warmth of desire."
The party had hitherto been sitting in dark-
ness, broken only by the glow from the hearth
and Mrs Deloraine's lamp. Now the lights were
turned on and there was a general shifting of
seats. Lady Flora, who had sat with exemplary
patience through the long discussion, discovered
that only a walk on the terrace would be suffi-
cient reward, and carried off Hugh and Mr
Wakefield in her train. Soon wild laughter
and the barking of small terriers showed that
some mischief was afoot.
"What I feel about all that has been said

to-night," said Mrs Yorke wearily, "and about
everything that you all have said since you
came here, is that Imperialism promises to be
a very exhausting faith. It demands a superb
vitality like Flora's or Sir Edward's. We are
all to live at high pressure. We must try all
our easy-going beliefs by a new touchstone, we
must forget all our comfortable clichés, and we
must never weary in well-doing. For the young,
I grant you, it is an inspiring creed, but for a
woman drawing towards middle life it is—well,
exacting."
"So is any creed worth the name," said
Carey. "They are all counsels of perfection,
requiring us to strain every nerve for their ful-
filment. Of course we tire and slacken, but
our energy revives if we have got the true fire
in our hearts. As for growing old, I do not
believe in the thing. If our vitality sinks in
one direction it increases in another. You are
a much more active man now, Appin, than
when in your youth you slumbered peacefully
on the right hand of the Woolsack. We can
no longer climb mountains like Astbury, or go
lion-hunting like Teddy, but we make up for
it by getting rid of the preoccupations which
distract the young. Wise men never grow up;
indeed, they grow younger, for they lose the

appalling worldly wisdom of youth. Wakefield,

But at this moment Lady Flora came in
breathlessly from the verandah.
"Oh, Aunt Susan, do you know what those
extraordinary men are doing? They have made
a kind of toboggan and are glissading down the
steep part of the lawn into the Dutch garden.
I daren't try it, for I know I should ruin my
gown."

CHAPTER XII.
LADY FLORA woke early, before daybreak, and
found it impossible to go to sleep again. The
strange foreglow of dawn looked so attractive
that she dressed and descended a silent stair-
case to the inner hall, where already the house-
boys were beginning their labours. The
verandahs were still in dusk, but when she
had crossed the terrace and reached the lawns
on the edge of the hill she came into a patch
of pale sunlight and found that the skies were
clear and that the sun was rising over the crest
of the downs. The place intoxicated her, so
quiet it was, so cool and fresh and dewy. She
drank great draughts of the delicious air, and
wondered why she had never discovered the
charm of early rising before. At this hour
most people were still wrapt in dull slumber
with a doleful getting-up before them when
the natural hour should have passed and the
world become noisy and common. In this airy

clime one's thoughts must perforce be clear and
beautiful. Even a flower-pot looked an ex-
quisite thing with the dew on it and the gold
of sunrise on the dew. It occurred to her that
it might be well if life were to be so rearranged
that all the things which mattered were done be-
fore breakfast. Or it might be enough, she re-
flected, if one could attain to this morning frame
of mind and keep it unsullied at all hours. Some
creed might give this, or some great passion.
And as the girl wandered through the ineffable
colours of the awakening day she thought very
deeply.
Hugh, coming back from an early gallop on
the moor, found her sitting on a sunny corner
of a parapet absorbed in thought. His horse
shied at the apparition, and the rider, who had
been half in a dream himself, promptly came off
and disappeared in a bed of lilies. The horse
began to graze peaceably, and Hugh, emerging
dishevelled and surprised, found that the Muse
of Contemplation had changed into a laughing
girl.
"'The lark now leaves his watery nest,'" she
quoted. "When you have shaken your "dewy
wing," Mr Somerville, you might get one of the
garden boys to take back the horse to the stable
and come for a walk with me. I've been up

since before daybreak, and I don't a bit want
to go back yet."
Hugh commandeered the services of the nearest
gardener, and with Lady Flora wandered back
across the lawn.
"What brought you out of doors at this
time?" he asked.
"Restlessness and this glorious morning. And,
once out, I made up my mind that I must find a
creed. I had nearly got one when you came
tumbling off your horse among the lilies. Do
you remember the contract we made our second
day here? You were to explain to me all the
things I could not understand. Well, I haven't
bothered you much, for I found I was cleverer
than I thought, and I followed most of the dis-
cussions quite easily. But last night Barbara
stumped me completely. It wasn't so much
what she said, for I understood her meaning
more or less, but she and all the others seemed
to find so much more in it than I could see. I
am not an artist of any kind, or ever likely to
be, but I agree with her argument about the
new field for art which empire gives. And of
course it makes life pleasanter all round to have
big horizons and a great deal to do. But in
spite of all that Lord Launceston said, I think we
are making more out of the creed than reason

allows. Though we deny it in words, yet we
behave as if this were a new religion instead
of merely a better groundwork for one. We
can't turn politics into something which satisfies
all our longings and fills all our life."
Hugh looked gravely at his companion. "You
have your aunt's appalling clearness of mind.
I agree with every word you say. What
next 2"
"Well, I want to know how I am to find the
trait d'union ? For I have become an Imperial-
ist, you know. I have got an interest so absorb-
ing that I do not think I can ever be bored again.
I suppose there are things I can do to help, for
you said that in our new state no one would be
left out of citizenship. But Barbara and Mr
Carey and Lord Launceston — but especially
Barbara—make me feel as if Imperialism shaded
off into all manner of beautiful and far-off things,
and I can't see it. I have my own private
dreams, but they are my own, and I can't fit
them in with politics. I wish I could, for I am
sure the happiest people have only one creed
which covers everything in their lives."
Hugh began to laugh, but stopped short at
the sight of the girl's serious eyes.
"Please forgive me. I didn't mean to be rude,
but I was never so surprised before. What you

want is a synthetic philosophy, and that you
should want it and know that you want it
staggers me. You are a very remarkable young
woman."
"I will not be treated like a child," said Lady
Flora indignantly, "and I will not have philo-
sophy talked to me. I agree with Mr Wakefield
that metaphysics are a bore, and only useful in
staving off a difficult question. I have no more a
desire for a synthetic philosophy than for the
moon. But you might give me a Christian
answer."
"I have given it you. You must find a philo-
sophy, and it will take years in the finding.
Don't you see, Lady Flora, that your question
goes to the very root of all things? We want
a key to life, an ideal which will leave out
nothing and completely satisfy the hunger in
our hearts. When you were a child and in-
vented fairylands you brought into them every-
thing you loved—cats and dogs and toys and
people—and so with the bigger fairyland we
make when we grow up. Everything shades
sooner or later into metaphysics, and the humblest
difficulty—if we press it home—brings us within
hailing distance of the Infinite. Well, I have no
philosophy to teach you. Lord Appin to-night
is going to give us what he calls 'some ele-

mentary notes on the speculative basis' of Im-
perialism, and I hope you will be very kind
and keep Mr Wakefield quiet in a corner.
But no ready-made philosophy will be of any
use to you. If you and I were great geniuses
we might sit down and think it all out from
the beginning, but we have neither the time
nor the patience for that. But the synthesis,
remember, must either be made honestly by
ourselves or come to us as a slow distillation
from experience. Years, you know, bring the
philosophic mind, and a certain unity creeps into
life without our knowing it. Mrs Deloraine is
absorbed in art, and she is also in love with a
new political creed, and the two merge in a
common ideal. So with Carey. His interest in
empire is so consuming that everything in his
life is brought into line with it. It is not the
result of a conscious philosophy, for the thing
is psychological rather than logical. The nexus
is the human character."
"Yes," said Lady Flora, "that sounds as if it
might be true. So you advise me not to trouble
about the high-falutin side, but to leave that to
my old age. And yet—I don't know. A morn-
ing like this makes one feel as if it were the only
side that mattered. And after all, unless we can
keep the morning freshness we must fail, for to

create our new world we must have uncommon
vitality."
"We must have vitality, but each must get it
as best he can. We all of us, if we are to keep
up our heads in the world, must have some secret
fountain of youth within us. But an arbitrary
unification of life will only choke the springs.
Wakefield said a thing to me at the beginning of
our visit, and I am daily growing more convinced
of its truth. He said that all Imperialists would
add their own poetry to the facts, but that it was
only on the facts themselves that we could expect
agreement, and if we tried to dogmatise on the
poetry we should quarrel at once. So by all
means let us try to be prosaic, for I don't think
any of us will sink too deeply into prose."
"Mr Wakefield said that ? What a wise old
Philistine he is He has asked me to go and
stay with him next year in Canada. He says
that people will call me either 'Lady Brune'
or "Flora,' and that I shall be an enormous
succès. And we are going out to camp in the
northern woods, and fish the lakes, and voyage in
canoes, and have the time of our lives . . . Oh,
by the by, Mr Somerville, you know you promised
me a motto for my journal of our trek. It must
be Greek, to look learned, and it must be about
camping. Have you found one?"

Hugh rummaged in the pockets of his coat.
"Yes—the very thing you want. It's Greek—
latish to be sure, and it comes out of the Anth-
ology. The sportsman who wrote it was called
Antiphilus of Byzantium, and flourished in the
reign of the Emperor Nero. I have done a sort
of translation, rather rough and free. Here
it is:—
"Give me a mat on the deck
When the awnings sound to the blows of the spray,
And the hearthstones crack with the flames a-back,
And the pot goes bubbling away.
Give me a boy to cook my broth,
For table a ship's plank laid with a cloth
(But never a fork or knife);
And after a game with a rusty pack,
The bo'sun's whistle to call us back—
That's the fortune fit for a king,
For oh! I love common life l'"
After dinner, by a general impulse the party
sought the library, where Lord Appin ensconced
himself in the central arm-chair.
"I don't want any lamp," he said, "for I have
nothing to read. My business, as I threatened
long ago, is to try to put to you the fundamental
question in Imperialism. If we cannot make good
our defence on it, then we have surrendered the
key of the position.

"But first of all, there are a few preliminaries
to be got over, and I am afraid I must take you
through some elementary philosophy. I apologise
to you, Launceston, for what must seem very
trite and obvious; but unless one condescends to
platitudes now and then, there must be gaps in
the argument. Let me relieve Mr Wakefield's
mind by saying that I am not going to talk
Hegelianism or any other creed. What I have
to say is admitted by all philosophers, and belongs
to the world's common stock of speculation.
"I remember that once in my public career I
was twitted with being a philosopher in politics.
My critic urged that philosophy unfitted a man
for making the clear distinctions which are the
working hypotheses of life. Good is good, he
said, to the average man, and bad is bad, and on
the distinction depends the moral life. Progress
and reform are real and ascertained benefits, and
on this assumption the State is governed. But
the philosopher, he went on, will tell you that
black is black only because in some sense it is
also white; that vice is only virtue regarded
from another plane of thought; that there is no
truth in this or that isolated dogma, but only in
something which he calls a system; that progress
is illusory, since reaction may be one of the forms
through which the Infinite is moving towards

realisation. All differences are smoothed away
by him in some trumpery unification, and yet it
is on the reality of these differences that human
aspirations and human happiness depend. There-
fore, my critic argued, the philosopher must be
kept out of politics like a bull out of a china shop,
for if he have a persuasive tongue he will end by
corrupting the manhood of the nation. I remem-
ber that he became quite witty on the subject.
'Let us remove,' he cried, "such philosophers
from public life. There are places already ap-
pointed for their reception. Lunatic asylum is
a vulgar word, so let us change their name to
contemplative retreats. There let them live,
happy and well cared for, hobnobbing with the
Infinite, and leave the management of human
affairs to unsophisticated human nature l'
"My friend would have been surprised could
he have known how cordially I agreed with him.
The philosopher has no business in politics, unless
he can bring himself to the mode of thinking
which that province requires. The pastime of
bursting old, but valuable, bottles by putting
new wine into them will not commend itself to
the same man. Then what is the mode of think-
ing which is proper to the political life?
"I do not propose to trace the history of thought
from its first psychological embryo. Let us take

the stage where it is manifest to all the world,
the stage which is indicated when we speak of a
man's having common-sense, or a practical mind,
or a great intelligence. I do not wish to use
German words, so let us call it the sphere of the
Understanding. Now the essence of this mode
of thought is that it insists upon clear divisions,
upon the distinctions rather than upon any funda-
mental unity in things. A vast datum is pre-
sented to it by experience, and its business is to
classify and arrange that datum. The distinctions
which the Mind makes it regards as hard and
fast—it must, for it has to act upon them. It
acknowledges principles of union within such data,
but the union is mechanical and external, like
the classification of devices in heraldry. It refuses
to theorise, to go one step further in its synthesis
than practical needs require. Let us take some
of the ordinary political counters. Law, for ex-
ample, is not and does not profess to be complete
justice. It is a working solution under which
certain things are called right and certain things
are labelled wrong, and have appropriate penalties
attached. The good lawyer is he who can make
the most of the mechanical unity within such a
system; not he who pushes the analysis too far,
and gets into metaphysics. But legal dogmas,
such as they are, must be treated as final; the

326 A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS.
half-way house of thought must be regarded as
the ultimate goal. Or take Liberty, that old
will-o'-the-wisp of man. The Understanding,
looking to the common needs of the State, declares
that on one point the individual shall be un-
trammelled, and on another restricted. It does not
examine the conception which is provided for it;
it only takes steps to give it a practical meaning.
So too with other general conceptions, such as
education, national character, or the welfare of
the people. The Understanding does not consider
the welfare of humanity at large, but of humanity
in a particular area—the nation or the race. It
demands always the practical test, for it is purely
utilitarian. It is not cosmopolitan; it is British,
or French, or Siamese.
The chief features, then, of this half-way house
of thought are that the world is classified with
sharp distinctions between the classes, that the
distinguishing principle—race, liberty, law, any-
thing you please—is something given to the
mind and not examined by the mind, and lastly,
that such distinctions are considered and acted
upon as final. It is emphatically the sphere of
the practical man. It does not confuse the
common issues of life with any of the uncertain-
ties of speculation. Its guiding principle is the
law of the Sufficient Reason; it explains every-

thing by something else. The world it creates
for itself is orderly, logical, and free from any
atmospheric haze. Such is the true world of
politics, for it is the Understanding which makes
states rich and well governed, and their citizens
prosperous and contented. I have said that it is
a world of compromise, but remember that most
of the people who live in it see no compromise
about the matter. It is for them a world of
final and unalterable truths. I need not labour
the point, for Lady Amysfort on the second day
of our visit gave us an admirable exposition of
this half-way house of the Understanding on its
political side, and Mr Wakefield, if I may say so,
is a living instance of it."
Mr Wakefield, hearing his name mentioned,
awoke from a short nap, and prepared to give
Lord Appin his critical and hostile attention.
"I shall not be accused of underestimating
this most admirable attitude if I say that if it
were universal the world would come to an end.
Happily it is not universal, for there will always
be many who, while insisting upon its merits,
bring to it in practice a principle from another
and a further stage of thought. Mr Wakefield,
for example, would not be an Imperialist if he
were content to dwell wholly in its confines.
Its merits, let me repeat, are that it insists upon

clear working distinctions, and that with its
practical bias it looks always to facts, since its
datum is Experience. Yes! But with Experi-
ence we admit at once one of the dynamic forces
of revolution. I will not bring in any meta-
physical doctrine of the Absolute Process of
Thought. I will take this one recreating and
reforming element in the sphere of the Under-
standing itself, that Experience which is its
foundation. Sooner or later, as facts change,
the change impresses itself even upon their
formal interpretation. There will always be
some who, living in the greater world of
what, in contradistinction, we may call Reason,
will be conscious from the start of the limitations
of the Understanding; they will see its laws as
compromises, its solutions as working hypotheses.
Such men will be the midwives of change, and
their maieutic skill will be aided by the slow
compulsion of Experience. There is a name for
this compelling force which has been in common
use since Plato—Dialectic. It is the sceptical
dissolvent, the inquiètude poussante, which acts
upon the dogmatism of the Understanding.
Hegel has an instance from theology which I
daresay Lord Launceston remembers. But please
keep in mind that, though I use this illustration,
I am not giving you Hegelianism, but one of

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS. 329
the accepted platitudes of philosophy. We first
of all, Hegel says, conceive of God as a remote
but beneficent force. We see seed-time and
harvest return, children born and growing gently
to maturity, and God following a laissez-faire
policy, and suffering nature to run smoothly in
compartments. Then suddenly comes in Dia-
lectic in the thunderstorm which ruins the crops,
the plague which devastates the family, in the
awful terror of the Unseen, and the mystery of
an inscrutable Fate. We are shaken out of our
ease, and know that the Lord is a jealous God,
and that nature is careless of our pigmy life.
And then, at the last, comes the reconciliation
in the domain of Reason, when we learn that
God is made one with man. With this final
stage of the infinite Reason we have no concern
to-night. Politics is a mundane and a dusty
game at best, and does not call for the highest
function of thought. Sometimes, it is true, the
humblest among us have seasons of revelation
when a new dawn flushes our prosaic sky, and
we have a glimpse of a City without foundations,
and aspire for a moment to
'the shining table-lands
To which our God Himself is moon and sun."
A great seer or mystic will kindle a nation to
pursue for a little an ideal, of which the Under-

standing knows nothing, and that patchwork,
which we call our world, seems in very truth
the garment of God. But these sublime imagin-
ings are not for practical men such as Mr Wake-
field and—magno intervallo—myself. In politics
Dialectic acting upon the Understanding does
not lead us, as Hegel's illustration suggests, to
the deeper unity of the Reason, but only to
a reformed Understanding in harmony with
changed conditions. The right mode of political
thinking, I repeat, is this sphere, where the
manifold world of experience is broken up into
a clear system, where distinctions are regarded
as final, and where the practical end is never
lost to view. But for those who would lead
their generation the Understanding must be
tinged by Dialectic, compromises must be seen as
such, and the coercive force of change which
resides in experience must be aided and abetted.
The result, as I have said, will be only another
world of the Understanding, but the datum will
have been revised. So in a roundabout way,
and from a different side, we get back to the
definition of Imperialism which we reached quite
early in our stay here. We claim as our attitude
this dialectical Understanding, or, in other words,
while we needlessly destroy no one of the dis-
tinctions which compose our traditional creed,

we desire to rethink them in the light of a new
world."
"It is an extraordinary thing," said the
Duchess, "how much wisdom there is in ordinary
political labels. I should have said that Caroline
and you, Bob, though you both call yourselves
Conservatives, were at the opposite poles of
opinion, and yet, when you come to a frank
confession, you reach almost the same conclusion.
I am not at all certain that I don't agree with
you. Only, what I feel about your definition of
Imperialism is that it does not distinguish it
from any other sound political creed. You define
it by the attitude of mind which it implies—
clearness, practicality, an adequate recognition
of the conditions of policy. But the Liberal
might say the same thing of his faith, and the
Conservative, and the Socialist. There is no
serious politician alive who would not subscribe
to the formula."
"Most true, Susan, but I have not nearly
done with my definition. The attitude I have
described belongs to all sane and practical creeds
—creeds, that is to say, which incline neither
to reaction nor to revolution. No faith which
claims to be in tune with the spirit of its age
would dare to disavow it. No; the difference
is between those who hold the belief merely as

a pious opinion and those who are prepared to
act strenuously upon it. The difference, that is
to say, lies in the rigour of our examination of
our data. We Imperialists, whatever our political
labels at home, are confronted with two alter-
natives. A huge empire has grown up around
us, full of problems on which we can gain little
light from our precedent history. We cannot
deny the existence of that empire and those
problems: so far we are all agreed. But we
may regard it as an encumbrance, a menace to
our older traditions; or we may see in it a hope
of a richer and better public life, where greater
responsibilities are counterbalanced by nobler
rewards. To be an Imperialist demands two
things—the eye to discern the new conditions
and the will to accept them."
"Do you argue, then," said Hugh, "that the
opposition we have to face is due not to intel-
lectual blindness, but to moral lethargy 2"
"Not to moral lethargy in the best cases, but
to a quite honest and logical fidelity to a doctrine
which I believe to be false. Our opponents may
be divided into two classes. One class admits
that these new conditions may be valuable, and
that Imperialism is a beautiful dream; but they
add that it is impossible. It is beyond the
power of humanity, they argue, to construct

such a state. Now, I am far from advocating
impracticable ideals. It is a perfectly good
answer to any proposal to say that it is im-
possible. But we must be careful how we admit
the defence propter infirmitatem. If it were a
question of building out of the void a Utopia
where war should be unknown and property held
in common, I should declare it impossible, be-
cause it would demand a revolution in human
nature and human methods so complete as to
be inconceivable. But when we are given the
foundations to build on and the materials are
ready to our hand, and the only further require-
ments are intelligence and vitality in the build-
ers, then to say that the work is too hard to
attempt is a confession of moral lethargy. It is
not political wisdom, but political cowardice.
"The other class have a more formidable de-
fence. They altogether deny the value of the
new conditions and the new ideal. They com-
plain that a vast material extension has no
organic relation to national well-being. Britain,
they say, owns one-fourth of the territory of the
globe, rules one-fourth of the population, and
conducts one-third of the trade; but she is no
greater on that account than if she possessed not
a rood outside the British Islands. In a word,
they deny that principle which I have always

maintained to lie at the very root of Imperialism
—the need of a quantitative basis for qualitative
development.
"Let me try to state their case as fairly as I
can. No state, they say, owes its greatness in
any real sense to its material equipment. Russia
may govern from the Baltic to the Behring Sea
and yet be an inferior power to Germany.
Themistocles will always defeat Xerxes, and rich
Carthage must yield in the end to poverty-
stricken Rome. The claim of Britain to a great
place in the world is due to the liberties which
she has evolved in her long history; to a
constitution which has been a model for all
free nations; to her propaganda on behalf of
humanity and liberalism; to the vitality of
her sons who have led the way in exploration
and invention and adventure. It is true that
great wealth and great possessions have been
the result, but they are the accidents, not the
springs, of her greatness. Her true magnificence
is seen in the way in which she has built up
nations overseas with no thought of her own
advantage. Britain, confined to her islands,
with every colony elevated into an independent
state, is richer in all that constitutes national
wealth than if she owned a quarter of the globe
in fee-simple, and administered it as a tributary

province. By remaining loyal to her faith in
liberty she provides the conditions in which her
people can grow to their full stature far more
effectively than if she compelled the other nations
of the world to become her servants to this end.
So far I, for one, am ready to admit that the
argument is indisputable.
"But, they continue, this modern talk of
empire introduces another ideal, and a grossly
material one. It brings in mere size as in itself
of value. It seeks to extend the borders of
Britain so that a quarter of the world shall be
one state. The assumption on which it acts is
that a complex organisation, which taxes all the
powers of its organisers, is likely to produce a
higher civic development than a simpler polity.
The whole creed, they argue, is simply a shelving
of the question. Granted that many things are
ruinously wrong in our public life, surely the
right way to remedy them is to get at the root
of the mischief, to reform the heart, to transform
the spirit, and not merely to say there is a big
empire which will cure these ills if we allow it.
They add—and I know I am repeating what
has already been better said—that an immense
material environment will cripple the soul. We
shall think in continents instead of in truths.
Our prosperity and its responsibilities will choke

us till we become leaden-eyed galley-slaves killed
by a too generous fortune.
"I can distinguish two separate points of at-
tack. The first is that Imperialism tends to seek
material cures for spiritual diseases. That is to
say, our opponents deny that qualitative develop-
ment can depend upon a quantitative basis. The
second is that a vast material environment is
not only no remedy for moral ills, but a direct
menace to moral well-being. Let us take these
arguments separately.
"The first, to my mind, is true up to a point.
It adopts an illustration from biology, and holds
that organic disease in a living body is not re-
moved by growth in size or by any stimulants
which promote such growth. Well, I am in
entire agreement. But to adduce this illustra-
tion as an answer to my contention is to be
guilty of a glaring ignoratio elemchi. I have
used the word 'development,' not health. And
my argument is that just as you cannot find the
mind and spirit of a man in a body which has
been starved and stunted till it is no better
than an infant's, so you cannot find true spiritual
progress unless you provide adequate material
conditions. But I do not care for this pictorial
reasoning, so let us put the matter differently.
What do we mean by spiritual development 2

Surely, the broadening and deepening of the mind
till it regards the world in its true perspective,
and the strengthening of the character so that
the will is a tempered and unerring weapon in
the charge of a man's soul. And this end is to
be achieved only by the exercise of the mind
upon the largest possible manifold of experience,
and by the conflict of character with the alien
forces of the world. I am talking, remember,
not of the saint and recluse, but of the citizen.
What is true of individual development is no less
true of the state's. A nation becomes great in
the most sublimated sense of the word by its
ability to present its citizens with a sphere of
action wherein their civic responsibilities may
be fulfilled. A microcosm, however perfect, will
never be a true arena for civic virtue.
"But, it may be argued, no one denies that the
state must have an ample sphere of action; the
objection to your doctrine is that you declare
that the sphere of action involves a spacial ex-
tension, whereas we say that it may be intensive.
There is sufficient work for the citizen in settling
his home problems without embarking on foreign
adventures. My answer is that for a state such
as ours the two things are synonymous. I do
not for a moment deny that for a new colony in-
tensive activity may be the path of wisdom. But

in all old and highly developed lands there comes
a time when, without spacial extension, all that
is possible is a barren rearrangement, a shuffling
of the cards. Just as we cannot describe a mere
analysis and readjustment of a few dogmas as
mental progress, so I call any preoccupation with
what after all must be the formal aspect of our
own affairs—their emendation without the intro-
duction of fresh elements, I call that national
stagnation. And this brings me to my second
answer to the first argument of our opponents.
I am prepared to maintain that spacial extension
may cure a disease, when that disease is itself
the result of undue confinement. If a man is
fainting from foul air, he will revive under the
winds of heaven. A palm may be perishing in
a flower-pot, when it would thrive in the forest.
Mrs Deloraine has suggested that certain of the
vices in our modern art are due to the narrowing
of its borders. Take, again, our labour problem.
You may talk about the reorganisation of indus-
try, you may accept any socialist nostrum, you
may abolish capitalism, and yet you will be no
better off, if, as I believe, the radical fault is
that we are over-industrialised. The cure for
our economic ills, if cure there be, is to bring
fresh capital into the business. One of the mis-
fortunes of our age is that in one sense it is too

ideal, too prone to neglect the material conditions
without which no great end can be achieved in
this world or any other. It is a flimsy idealism
at the best, for the great idealists never forgot
that, if it was well to trust in God, it was no less
right to keep their powder dry."
"We are too ideal," continued Lord Appin,
meeting the approving glance of Mr Wakefield,
"and at the same time we are not ideal enough.
If we were, we should not hear the second argu-
ment which our opponents use. Material great-
ness, they say, is an enemy to moral well-being.
It debases our standards, inflames our pride, and
stirs our passions. To this I have only one
answer to make. If our national life be of so
poor a quality that it is smothered by pos-
sessions, then the battle need never be joined at
all. The "small nation' fallacy is like the
'sheltered life' humbug in education. A people
must keep itself clear from the world lest its
garments be spotted, just as a boy should not be
sent to a public school in case his moral
sense be dimmed. If our soul is to be lost
because we go down into the arena of life, then
the odds are that it was not worth saving from
the first. If we will escape the danger of de-
cadence, we will also forego the hope of progress;
and remember, the nation which stands still is

doomed. If we do not go forward, we shall most
certainly go back.
"But at the same time it is well that this
objection should be stated, because it contains
a warning against the sins to which great empires
are prone,—what the French call the disease of
'grandeur.' I believe most firmly that in the
deepest sense Providence is on the side of the
bigger battalions. I cannot see why size should
not have its ideal as well as littleness. All the
world inclines to reserve its affection for small
things—a small country, a small people—because
I assume there is a stronger sense of proprietor-
ship attaching to what is limited in bulk. Yet
I can conceive of as deep a patriotism in an
empire as in a city, and a love of great moun-
tains and plains as real as any affection for a
garden. But size has its own disease, and we
may easily fall into the vice of looking upon it
as something worthy in itself, however alien it
may remain to our culture. Whether we call
the disease "Jingoism' or "grandeur' or "self-
complacency,' its root is the same. It means
that we regard our empire as a mere possession,
as the vulgar rich regard their bank accounts—
a matter to boast of, and not an added duty.
All the braggart glorification we sometimes hear
means a shallow and frivolous understanding of

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS. 341
what empire involves. No serious man dare
boast of the millions of square miles which his
people rule, when he remembers that each mile
has its own problem, and that on him and his
fellows lies the burden of solution.
"Jingoism, then, is not a crude Imperialism;
it is Imperialism's stark opposite. It belongs to
the school of thought which thinks of the Empire
as England, with a train of dependencies and
colonies to enhance her insular prestige; but it
has no kinship with the ideal of an empire mov-
ing with one impulse towards a richer destiny.
The true Imperialist will be very little inclined
to a cheap complacency. He is kindled at times
to ardour by the magnitude of his inheritance,
and he has always, if he keeps the faith, optim-
ism and hope to cheer him. But he is equally
weighed down with the burden of his duties and
the complexity of the task before him, if he
would translate his dream into fact. A depend-
ency to him is not a possession but a trust. The
glory of England is not the mileage of her terri-
tory but the state into which she is welding it.
"And therefore I say that Imperialism, sanely
considered, is the best guardian of peace. Its
aim is not conquest but consolidation and de-
velopment, and its task within its own borders
is so great that it has little inducement to meddle

with its neighbours. I am no believer in cosmo-
politanism. I have always thought that a man
must cleave to his own people, and that the
purpose of God is best attained by the strife of
race with race and ideal with ideal. War will
remain as the last resort when two race ideals,
passionately held, meet in conflict. But the war
which comes from a vague lust of possession I
abhor, and the remedy for it is a preoccupation
with nobler tasks. England has completed her
great era of expansion. Her work for ages was
to find new outlets for the vigour of her sons,
and to occupy the waste or derelict places of the
earth. Now, the land being won, it is her task
to develop the wilds, to unite the scattered
settlements, and to bring the whole within the
influence of her tradition and faith. This labour
we call empire-building, and above all things it
is a labour of peace."
"I thought that you were going to talk meta-
physics," said Mr Wakefield in an aggrieved
voice. "Instead, you have talked ordinary com-
mon-sense, with which I can pick no quarrel. I
object to having my patent infringed."
Lord Appin had got himself a cigar and was
smoking steadily.
"In the last resort," he said blandly, "the two
things are not distinguishable. I feared I had

been a little too high-coloured in my argument
to earn your approval, for Mrs Deloraine has
affected us all with a tendency to emotion. Still,
I think, the main position is sound."
"Sound !" cried Mr Wakefield. "There is no
answer to it. But I am glad that I am not
obliged to make the defence too often, for I am
not an adept at this kind of discussion. In the
colonies we go on simpler lines. One opponent
says that he wants a republic, another declares
that England is played out, while a third idiot—
and he is the commonest—is too anxious to get
his township started to care what happens to the
Empire. His only question is, "And what am I
to get out of it?' I meet these reprobates with
business arguments—figures, you know, and a
little sentiment. In the colonies, happily, they
do not get down to fundamentals."
"Nor in England," said Hugh. "The people
who go back to first principles, as a rule make
the journey only to find some defence for a pre-
judice which nothing will induce them to forego.
There are no conversions in that rarefied air."
"Well, let us leave it at that," Lord Appin
said cheerfully. "We, too, have recourse to
fundamentals merely to justify to ourselves the
faith which comes to us from other sources. I
have a great belief in common-sense, which, after

all, is the method proper to the sphere of the
Understanding. Only, as some of us have in-
quisitive minds, it is as well now and then to go
a little farther for the sake of a more reasonable
satisfaction. Heaven forbid that I should ever
try to transfer for good the case for Imperialism
to the cloudy plateau of philosophy. Philosophy
is not a necessary of life, it is not even a special
pleasure; but, remember, if it once lays hold of
the mind, it is the only thing which can solve the
doubts it creates. . . . There, Wakefield, I hope
I have climbed off my perch with sufficient
humility to please you. And now, having blas-
phemed my idols, I shall restore my self-respect
by beating you at billiards."

CHAPTER XIII.
"WE shall get back," said the Duchess next
night at dinner, "just in time for the autumn
session. I am told I must give a political party,
and I want you all to come. Bob always does,
and our people stare at him as if he were a
strange new beast. It does them good to find
out that he has not a cloven hoof, and I am sure
it is the best thing in the world for him to be
civil to people who annoy him. Will you come,
Sir Edward 2 "
That gentleman had been unaccountably glum
during the meal, so that Mrs Yorke had given up
in despair the effort of making conversation.
"I'm afraid I can't," he said moodily. "I
shan't be in England till after Christmas, for I
promised Carey to go up to Kashmir and have a
look at his place there. But it would be worth
while going back if I thought I would meet that
fellow Bronson, and tell him what I thought of
him with a dog - whip. Of all the damned

scoundrels —I beg your pardon, Duchess, but it's
a fact. Have you seen the home papers? You
know there's a row in West Africa, a very tick-
lish affair for us, for we hold a big country with
a handful of troops and no base within hundreds
of miles. Well, because we have killed a score
or two of natives in the way of duty, the fellow
has been spitting venom about our men, calling
them murderers, and accusing them of every un-
mentionable atrocity. I don't mind his slinging
accusations into the air; it's the favourite game
of these vermin, and eases them without doing
anybody much harm. But when it comes to
calling old Mitchinson a blackguard, who, as
everybody knows, is the straightest and kindest
fellow on earth, then, I think, it's about time for
somebody to interfere. If half a dozen English-
men in lonely stations are massacred and have
their eyes gouged out, in the language of that
rabble it's the effort of a brave people rightly
struggling to be free. But if in self-defence we
teach some of the sportsmen the ways of the
Maxim, then it's a cold-blooded brutal murder.
I would give all I possess to show some of these
gentry the pretty habits of the full-blooded
savage."
"My dear Teddy," said Lord Appin, "your
language is a little unparliamentary. No, I
forgot. You would consider that a compliment,

so I shall say unnecessarily abusive. I don't
object to Mr Bronson, who is merely an honest
well-meaning ass. He feels in his way as deeply
about the affair as you do, and means as well by
his country. As Bismarck said, "Every nation
must have its national fools.' The sentimentalist
is a much worse fellow, for he has no earnestness
to justify his folly. Let me quote from my
favourite newspaper a few remarks about that
fight in Northern Nigeria you were talking
about.
"'On Sunday — the day of rest and gladness
throughout the Christian world — three hundred
brave, black British citizens were murdered in West
Africa. Their offence was that they had taken up
arms for their native land. Remember that these
men were not a foreign foe, but subjects of our King,
sharers with ourselves in the benefits which are
assumed to follow our flag. What account have we
to render of our stewardship towards them Before
we came into their country they were living their
simple lives happily and innocently—in darkness, it
may be, but yet in peace. We come among them,
outrage their traditions, violate their sanctities,
coerce them in an unfamiliar bondage. Can we
wonder that a high-spirited people rebels? And we
meet their revolt with the savage measures which
weakness and panic dictate. West Africa is,
indeed, a signal and ominous lesson in imperial
futility and crime, but it is a lesson, we hope and
believe, which is now scarcely needed. Already the
grandiose dreams of empire are foundering in the
bud.'"

"There !" said Sir Edward triumphantly.
"There you have the stuff I mean. Launceston,
you defended the Nonconformist conscience when
we were crossing the Lake. Have you anything
to say in defence of that ?"
"I make the same distinction as Lord Appin."
Lord Launceston, who had scarcely smiled during
the reading of the extract, spoke with a grave
deliberation which hushed the talk. "Two men
may differ profoundly and yet be equally entitled
to the name of patriot. Take the case of con-
scription. I may desire to see every citizen
trained to arms, and my neighbour may hold
all war immoral and military training no better
than a preparation for crime. I desire the thing
because I wish my country well, and he opposes
me because he also wishes it well. We differ
because we are patriots: if he, with his convic-
tions, were less of a patriot, he might agree with
me. There are many people who must be troubled
by the incidents of a native war—quite honestly
and reasonably troubled. They believe that their
country is degrading herself, and, because they
love their country, they are bound to protest.
We differ intellectually, but morally we are at
one with them. I do not object to the killing
of men in a right cause, just as I do not object
to capital punishment, because I have no extreme

respect for human life. Nor do I object to
flogging when it may be expedient, because I do
not believe in the dignity of the human person.
But I recognise that many good men do not
share my scepticism, and that for them to condone
these things would be a betrayal of their moral
standards. I want to see every genuine fanatic
fought tooth and nail if need be, but respected as
a foe who by a turn of fortune's wheel may be-
come an ally. Fanaticism means steel and fire,
and we are nothing without them. Every true
Imperialist, it seems to me, must be at heart a
kind of fanatic. We can do something with
the cranks, but we can do nothing with the
fláneur. They differ from us only in opinion,
not in purpose, and any day a new light
or a wider experience may range them on our
side."
Sir Edward grunted. "Then if we are to
respect them so much, how are we to fight them?
You can't fight without a little animosity, and it
looks as if that excellent quality were to be
swamped with unwilling admiration."
"We fight them because we believe them to
be utterly and mischievously wrong. We are
in as deadly earnest as they are, and we are as
certain of our faith. When fanaticism comes
in our way we must convert it or destroy it.

But when that is done we can build its tomb
and give it a friendly epitaph."
"Do you mean to say that the fellows who are
screaming about Mitchinson are only mistaken
patriots?"
"Some are undoubtedly," said Lord Launces-
ton. "But not over many, because the true
fanatic is rarely a fool, and this attack is so
curiously foolish. No, I fear it springs in the
main from a quality for which I have no
defence to make — a shallow and calculating
sentimentality."
Lady Flora protested. "Please, Lord Launces-
ton, don't join in the conventional abuse of
sentiment. I like it, for it means that people
are simple-minded and cheerful."
"I don't mean your kind of sentiment, my
dear child. We shall all pray for its continu-
ance. The sentiment I mean is the decadence
of everything simple and cheerful. It comes
from a mind and heart whose powers have gone
rotten."
Lady Warcliff nodded her agreement. "I
like that distinction I used before between the
hard-hearted kind people and the soft-hearted
cruel people. The sentimentalist is the egotist
who cloaks his selfishness by claiming a monopoly
of the purer emotions. There is no province of

life which he does not pollute. In love he is the
philanderer, in politics the Jingo or the humani-
tarian, in art the purveyor of all that is weak
and fatuous and second-rate. He is incapable of
greatness: he is incapable of even common truth.
He goes through life without ever seeing the
world in its reality, for between him and it hangs
the veil of the second-hand emotionalism. He is
the kind of being who calls physical cowardice
moral courage, who will shed tears over the
poor and bully his own servants, whose mouth
is full of noble words and his heart of little fears
and vanities. There is nothing to lay hold of in
him, only rottenness, like a decaying tree. He
has so debauched his soul that he is incapable of
any clean strong passion, and therefore I say, God
pity the man or woman who trusts in him. For,
like all weak unwholesome things, he is capable of
the last extreme of cruelty."
"Poor sentimentalist l" sighed the Duchess.
"Really, Margaret, you are too unkind, for we
have all a bit of him in our nature, and your
censure is horribly personal. Let us walk round
the terrace while the men smoke, and then we
may be in a better frame of mind for Lord
Launceston."
Half an hour later in the inner hall the com-
pany reassembled. Lady Flora had begged for

lights. "I feel so eerie in the dark," she said,
"and besides, I like to watch people's faces. Mr
Wakefield, will you sit beside me and translate
the fragments of the dead languages which no
one seems able to do without 7"
Lord Launceston began with a great air of
diffidence.
"I have been given an appalling task by our
host—nothing less than to sum up the kind of
conclusions we have been hovering round since
we came here. It was no use my protesting
and quoting Fichte's reply to Madame de Staël,
'Ces choses ne ses laissent pas dire succincte-
ment.' He replied that if we had any clear
ideas at all, there were always words to fit them.
I suppose he is right, and though our body of
results is not very great, yet there are one or
two points established. Like all living faiths,
Imperialism must grow insensibly into men's
hearts. Almost the last thing it finds is its
principles, but long before that it has revealed
itself in a new way of looking at the world,
a new hope, vague, indeterminate, and yet so
priceless that those who catch the gleam are
ready to leave everything and follow it.
"Our first conclusion, therefore, was that Im-
perialism was not Liberalism or Conservatism or
any other traditional creed. It was a new

attitude of mind which admitted certain new
conditions into the problem of statesmanship.
On the interpretation of these conditions there
will be a great difference of opinion. We shall
have liberals and conservatives, socialists and
individualists, free-traders and protectionists, but
all these differences will exist within Imperialism.
The sign-manual of our creed is the belief that
our problems must be settled on the basis of
the Empire, that it is our business to look at
all the facts instead of at only a few of them.
"This is, of course, the merest formal state-
ment, and gets us very little farther. On these
terms we could enlist, I believe, ninety-nine out
of every hundred Englishmen in a lip-service to
the creed. What we desire to create is the
Imperialist with the intelligence to estimate his
data correctly, and the will to act upon his con-
clusions. That is to say, we ask for a more
highly-developed type of citizen. Lord Appin
has already explained to you the practical stand-
point of such a citizen, and the philosophical
justification for it. We do not need theorists
or sentimentalists or anarchists: we want the
practical intelligence which is acute in foresight
and sober in ideal, and which is joined to an
unhesitating instinct for deeds. He has also
explained the kind of philosophical preconcep-

tion which is involved in any examination of
our new data, and which must be taken as
the sine qua non of Imperialism. He defined it
roughly, if I remember, as the recognition of the
value of material greatness for spiritual develop-
ment, the belief that since ideals can only be
realised under conditions of space and time, it
is right and proper to attend to these condi-
tions. So our Imperialist—liberal, conservative,
individualist, socialist—we may take to be the
man who accepts the Empire as the basis of all
our problems, who believes that spacial expan-
sion is not inconsistent with civic well-being
but may be a valuable ally, and who carries to
his task a mind which understands the limita-
tions of political activity, and at the same time
is quick to apprehend and resolute to act. Many
Imperialists, no doubt, will fall short of this high
standard, but we define a party by its ideal.
"In the early part of our discussions much
was said about the relations of Imperialism to
current politics at home. We do not seek to
create any new party, but to have all parties
accept our doctrine as the ultimate basis of
their activity. But at the same time there are
certain types of mind which are of more value
to us than others, and certain types which are
almost wholly useless. I have something to say

on this subject which I can best introduce by
a quotation from Lady Flora. I overheard her
the other day arguing with Astbury about that
hoary question—the proper definition of Whig
and Tory. And this was her conclusion. A
Whig is a man who is prepared to go to the
stake for his beliefs, but who will not send his
opponents there. A Tory is one who will not
only burn himself, but is quite prepared in the
last resort to burn those who differ from him.
I take that as a parable, and I am prepared to
defend the Tory attitude as the one which in
the future must triumph. We are many hun-
dred years removed from burning, but the point
of view remains the same. One man is very
much in earnest about his creed, but he will not
coerce his fellows into agreement. He must
justify himself to his own conscience, but he will
not take it upon himself to compel other con-
sciences to follow suit. Laissez-faire is his
motto and individualism his religion. A second
man has the same private depth of conviction, but
his conscience has a communal tinge in it. He
cannot conceive that that which deeply concerns
himself does not also concern the State. I do.
not mean that he is the crude propagandist.
That is a type that is common enough and
worthless enough to-day. Every human being

itches to make converts, whether it be to the-
osophy or to dry-fly fishing. I mean the serious
conviction that no man lives to himself alone,
and that we must settle our problems not only
for ourselves but for the State. A political
creed cannot be a private possession. If it is
true it is true for the whole race, and the type
of mind which I speak of is prepared to coerce
the world into accepting it. One man says, "I
think this or that, and I hope to find enough
like-minded people to give the view the support
of a majority.' Another says, "This is my
opinion, and since it is God's truth, the world
shall accept it." And it is the latter who must
conquer. The earth is not yet the heritage of
the meek, and the Kingdom of Heaven will
yield only to violence. That is what I mean
when I say that the natural ally of the Im-
perialist is the fanatic. We demand first of all
wisdom, but we believe that wisdom is a voice
in the desert, unless there is a power of con-
viction behind her to compel the market-place
to acknowledge her godhead.
"We have spoken of English conditions from
the party point of view, and we have found
that we can disregard conventional party dis-
tinctions. I would rather consider them under
a more organic division. We have still the

great threefold classification—the lower classes,
the middle, and the upper, or, as I should prefer
to put it, the classes which have wants, the
classes which are satisfied, and the classes which
have ambitions. Some men are so near the
margin of life that their horizon is bounded by
material wants—food, housing, security. Others
live on a plane where their desires are either less
self-regarding, or if self-regarding are less mate-
rial, and such desires I call ambitions. Between
these extremes lie the great contented classes,
the bourgeois in mind. They may have no
positive satisfaction in life, but they desire in
their dumb way the maintenance of things as
they are. They may clamour for this or that
reform, but they are not reformers at heart, for
their minds are asleep. I need scarcely say that
this distinction of classes does not correspond
with the conventional one. Some of our own
class are in my lower, and a vast number in my
middle class, while many of the lower class as
usually defined, and not a few of the middle,
would belong to what on my definition is the
aristocracy of ambition."
"How true !" said Mrs Wilbraham. "If we
had a spiritual Debrett prepared by a committee
of archangels what havoc it would make in
Society 1"

"I do not wish to disparage my middle
class," Lord Launceston continued. "It plays
a useful part and it has many virtues. As
some one has said, it is the 'force of social
persistence.' It has also, I believe, been likened
to a backbone."
"A most dangerous metaphor," said the
Duchess. "What warrant has a backbone to
make so much noise ? I always thought that
it was the duty of that valuable part of the
human frame to remain decently covered up with
flesh. An aggressive backbone is a contradic-
tion in terms. And yet there is no doubt that
we are governed by our middle, our stupidly
satisfied class."
"Yes. That is our danger, as it has been the
danger of all great civilisations. It does not
think, because it has no need to. The burdens
of citizenship mean nothing to it, because they
are not felt. The lives of its members are be-
yond the reach of ordinary want, they are secure
from attack, they have no reason to pester them-
selves about the problems of statecraft. Their
attitude to the poor is one of slightly contemp-
tuous patronage. Since their standards are
material they have little sympathy for those
who cannot command material success. Towards
the class with ambitions they feel an innate hos-

tility, save in so far as that class contains their
social superiors. I have no doubt such people
are kind friends, excellent husbands, and wise
fathers, but in no sense of the word are they
citizens. And yet by a paradox of fate they
govern. It is their votes that must be sought
before any policy can be realised. It is this
dull residuum who must be cajoled or persuaded
before one step forward is possible. They are
the support of traditionalism in all departments
of life, not from conviction, like the true Tory,
but from apathy.
"To such people we make no appeal. Im-
perialism, like all constructive policies, asks for
science, for ideas, for geist, above all for cour-
age. But it may act upon this inert mass
like fire upon ore, and sublimate it into some-
thing of value. The sense of citizenship comes
not from governing but from administering, and
till problems are translated into homely terms,
and the demands of the State hammer at
the doors of those self-satisfied homes, there
will be no salvation for their inmates. In the
meantime our appeal must be to the first and
the third of my classes. The third is obvious
enough. The aristocracy of ambition in what-
ever social rank they may be found are our
natural propagandists. We appeal to all who

can think clearly and feel cleanly and act whole-
heartedly—the
'patrician spirits that refine
Their flesh to fire and issue like a flame
On brave endeavours.'
But we appeal no less eagerly to the rising de-
mocracy, the men who are still preoccupied with
the elementary wants of life. These men know
that they can only make their power felt by
superior energy, by loyalty to their ideals, by
a relentless fidelity to facts. Like us they de-
mand that the rubbish be cleared away, like us
they clamour for a recognition of the needs of
things as they are. They may show signs of
hysteria and impatience, but never of stagna-
tion. Their attitude of mind is one with ours,
and we have sufficient faith to believe that the
same attitude will in time produce the same
creed.
"There is another side of the popular cry
which to my mind is most hopeful. Your labour
leader to-day wishes to bring the humblest citi-
zen into the life of the State. That is to say,
he would extend the opportunity of administrat-
ive experience by means of subordinate councils,
and with such an extension must come a growth
of the feeling of corporate responsibility. The
lower classes, if he had his will, should not

govern without administering. Now our appeal
is to practical statesmen, those who know the
difficulties of administration and who have
acquired from experience a wider view of public
interests than the merely selfish. At present, I
grant you, there is too much inclination in this
class to identify the interests of the State with
those of one section, but I am optimistic enough
to believe that a wider experience carries within
itself the cure.
"The first moral condition, then, which Im-
perialism demands is a quickened civic conscience
and a tireless intelligence. The second, for want
of a better phrase, I will call a wider patriotism.
The affection which with many is limited at
present to their birthplace must be extended
to the Empire. I do not mean that we should
forego old attachments. Just as no man will
ever love his fatherland in the same way as
he loves the village or parish where he was
born, so to the Englishman, the Canadian, and
the New Zealander, England and Canada and
New Zealand will always have more intimate
claims than any wider geographical area. But
Imperial patriotism will stand to national, as
national patriotism to-day stands to local affec-
tion. A man is not less of a patriot because
the "lone sheiling and the misty island' are

nearer his heart than the whole realm of Britain.
And a man may be a good Imperialist although
his country of origin has a larger share in his
interests than the Empire. There is a gradation
in patriotism, and one grade differs from another
in kind. If we have at one end the sentiment
for what is small and unique—the village, the
glen, the cottage—at the other we may have
a sentiment as genuine for what is omnipotent
and universal.
"This wider patriotism, as I understand it,
seems to me to harmonise with the nature of
our race. Our land no more than Hellas has
a paltry local unity. The English genius has
never regarded its civilisation as tied down to
the place of its birth. Its task has been to
absorb the unfamiliar and to lay bare the
unknown, admitting no terra incognita into
its scheme of things. There is always the
home country, the centre of memories, but
the working loyalties of life go to those lands
it has created. As every man loves the work
of his own hands, so any race must love what
comes from its own toil and adventure. Such
a love is no thin cosmopolitanism, but the
jealous affection for its own household, and
once the unity of the Empire is realised,
patriotism must embrace it as naturally as

family affection embraces each new inmate of
the home.
"These are platitudes which are scarcely
worth repeating, were they not so often for-
gotten. We need not greatly concern ourselves
with the by-products of empire. If the motive
force is there—the new attitude of mind and
all that is implied in it—we may safely trust
to natural laws to produce the secondary results
we desire. Our first business, then, is to have
the Empire accepted, not as a pious opinion or
a phrase of rhetoric, but as a living faith. It
must become an unconscious presupposition in
all our politics, otherwise it will not influence
our conduct of affairs. Remember that a truth
is only potent in English life when it has
become a truism. Our duty, as we all agree,
is first of all to create opinion,--to guide the
alert, and to compel the inert into a certain
attitude of mind.
"So far, I think, I carry Mr Wakefield with
me. But after that, he will ask, what next?
After that, I am afraid, he and I must agree
to differ. It is not a fundamental difference,
for it is only on methods, but the methods
seem to me so vital a matter that I fear it
is a real difference. Let me repeat some of
the conclusions we have reached in our dis-

cussion. We saw that while legislative federa-
tion was out of the question as things stand
to-day, some executive union was not only
urgently needed, but up to a point practicable.
Mr Wakefield himself, outlined a scheme which
promised to create gradually and without any
wild change a true Imperial executive. We
saw that the present theory of our Empire
was one of alliance, but that it must be
made a working alliance. We have a dozen
great common problems, and they are all ad-
ministrative—the control of subject races, the
development of the tropics, labour, defence,
emigration, commercial union. Our survey of
these has been very slight, but we have found
reason, I think, to believe that in all there is
a hope of a successful settlement on an Imperial
basis. But questions which concern all must be
answered by the co-operation of all. At present
our method is either to leave them unanswered
or to answer them ourselves after a make-
believe of consultation. This is bad enough,
but in my opinion it is less dangerous than
the other proposal which Mr Wakefield upholds.
That seeks to effect a union on a matter of im-
mense importance to each unit, while retaining
the old loose alliance system unchanged. I am

not dealing now with any economic doctrine.
I am perfectly content to see our traditional
faith revised if necessary, but that revision
must come from a body empowered to under-
take the task. To plunge the empire into a
wrangle on what is after all a detail, without
providing the machinery within which alone
that detail has any meaning, is to my mind
a gross blunder in statesmanship."
"As if," said Lord Appin dreamily, "a man
were to embark on a violent discussion about
the career of his eldest son before he had pro-
posed to the lady of his affections."
"Carey," said Mr Wakefield, "I thought that
subject had been forbidden. If it hasn't, I ought
to be allowed to state my case. In two words
it is this. I say that before you can have an
executive union you must create a desire for
it. The most vital of our common problems is
that of our commerce. If we once show the
different peoples in the empire that on this point
they can have a union to their mutual advan-
tage, why, union will follow as a matter of
course."
Lord Launceston laughed. "My dear Wake-
field, if that is all your case then I have no
quarrel with you. That is very different from

the 'high priori' line of most of your school.
Many of them are Imperialists only by accident.
They are insular at heart, and they stand like
Ruth 'in tears amid the alien corn' because
they lament the decline of England, not the
disintegration of the empire. If the creed of
a common commercial policy is only an argu-
ment for an imperial executive, then you have
my best wishes in your crusade. But remember
there are many other common needs, and that
to attempt to meet any one without the common
machinery will mean failure, utter and final,
and good-bye for many a day to all hope of
union. These discussions have left me with two
convictions intensified. One is that in the end
our creed must prevail. The other is that we
are dealing with fragile things and must go very
warily. We are not welding lifeless matter to-
gether, but coaxing into one growth a number
of separate forms of life. And since we are
handling life our touch must be delicate and sym-
pathetic, for one hint of coercion may snap the
vital link. I am one of those people who re-
joice in colonial nationalism. I would not have
it one jot weaker than it is to-day. When I
hear of Australia clamouring for a navy of her
own, and Canada asking for the treaty-making

power, I am honestly delighted. They may be
asking for the wrong things, but the fact that
they should want them is right—right—right.
I want to see every one of our daughter-peoples
grow into triumphant and self-conscious nation-
hood, for it is all contributory to the well-being
of the Empire. There is no value in the union
of weak things: we want the unity of strength,
the unity where every part has a vigorous self-
subsistent life out of which it contributes to the
common stock of imperial vitality.
"In our discussion we have insisted—rightly,
I think—less upon the material splendour which
our ideal involves than upon its spiritual great-
ness. Empire is a dream — on the brink of
realisation, it is true, but still a dream. Too
often these Imperial visions have a Byzantine
colouring. They dwell on size and numbers and
wealth, but not enough upon the new life which
is bound up in them. All my days the epic
of our future has sung itself in my ears, but as
I grow into late middle age I think less of the
pomp and pageantry and more of the grave
austerity at the heart of it. I can foresee an
empire where each part shall live to the full
its own life and develop an autochthonous
culture. But behind it all there will be the

great catholic tradition in thought and feeling,
in art and conduct, of which no one part, but
the empire itself, is the appointed guardian. In
that confraternity of peoples the new lands will
redress the balance of the old, and will gain
in return an inheritance of transmitted wisdom.
Men will not starve in crowded islands when
there are virgin spaces waiting for them, and
young nations will not be adventurers in far
lands, but children of a great household carrying
the fire from the ancestral hearth. Our art will
be quickened by a breath from a simpler and
cleaner world, and the fibre of our sons will be
strung to vigour by the glimpse of more spacious
horizons. And our English race will vindicate
to mankind that doctrine which is the noblest
of its traditions—that liberty is possible only
under the dominion of order and law, and that
unity is not incompatible with the amplest
freedom. We of the old countries shall give
and receive. Our Trojan manhood, our Trojan
Lares and Penates will be there, but so too
will Latium and the ancient Ausonian rites.
Do you remember how at the close of the
Æneid Juno asks from Jupiter that Italy may
remain herself in spite of foreign conquest?—
"Sit Latium, sint Albani per saecula reges,
Sit Romana potens Itala virtute propago."

And the King of the Gods replies:–
'Sermonem Ausonii patrium moresque tenebunt,
Utgue est nomen erit; commixti corpore tantum
Subsident Teucri. Morem ritusque sacrorum
Adjiciam faciamque omnes uno ore Latinos.
Hinc genus Ausonio mixtum quod sanguine surget
Supra homines, supra ire deos pietate videbis,
Nec gens ulla tuos aeque celebrabit honores."
I take these words as the best and simplest
statement of our faith. That idea has been the
master-passion of my life, and I ask no higher
task than to contribute my mite of effort to so
divine an end."
There was silence for a little as Lord Launces-
ton's quiet voice ceased. Then Carey from the
fireplace spoke.
"It is a religion," he said, "to me, and I
think to others. If you quarrel with the word,
I can only say that what any man desires with
his whole heart, what wakens all that is best
in him and curbs all that is worst, is a religion,
whatever else the term may mean. No man can
be religious who is not a fighter, who does not

let there be Alban kings I let the Roman stock be potent in Italian
valour. . . . Her ancient speech and ways shall Ausonia keep, and
as her name is, it shall be ; mingled into her blood shall the Trojan
sink. Law and holy rites will I add, and I will make Latins of all
with a single tongue. Thence thou wilt see a race arise tempered
of Ausonian blood, transcending men, yea, and gods in duty, and no
other folk will so nobly pay thee thy meed of worship."

know the odds which the world sets against him,
who has not suffered and struggled and tried
the temper of the human spirit against the iron
rigour of nature. Religion is not a comfortable
thing of easy prayers and ready thanksgivings,
but something as fierce and stubborn and con-
suming as life itself. How else is it to wither
the hosts of the enemy? I want my allies to
be fanatics. If my religion is not to include my
politics, then I am content to have none, for
to me the one as much as the other is an
attempt to subdue the material world of our
common sight into harmony with an unseen
world of the spirit."
The stillness which still reigned in the room
showed the Duchess that an atmosphere had been
created too emotional for her comfort. But in
spite of herself she had been impressed, and
the cool tones of her voice had an unwonted
feeling in them as she once more brought back
the discussion to what she considered a reason-
able level.
"It is a great creed, no doubt, and I am
not going to criticise. Some of it frightens
me a little, but then I am old-fashioned and
easily frightened. The merit of it all seems to
me to be that it allows for such ample differ-
ences among its disciples. You can add to and

subtract from it without altering its character.
I suppose, Bob, that you would say that that
is because it is a living thing, with all the
generous waste and superabundance of life."
Lord Appin rose and walked to the window,
where he stood for a little before he replied.
"Yes; it is alive, and in saying that we have
used the final word of commendation. There is
room within its shadow for all the policies which
can inspire the hearts of wise men to a keener
public duty. There is room for Carey's mysti-
cism, and Wakefield's practical good sense, and
Susan's Liberal principles, and Lady Amysfort's
Toryism —room, too, for the hard scientific
faith of young men like Astbury and Hugh ;
room even for Sir Edward's anarchic individual-
ism. It is still a far-away ideal, and there is a
long task before us till it has become a fact.
Few of us here will live to witness the realis-
ation, but we shall see the outworks passed, and
Flora's grandchildren perhaps may see the win-
ning of the fort. I have always been suspicious
of political fervour. To me there is something ill-
bred and irrational about a heart worn on the
sleeve of the shabby garments we use in public
life. But I hold the man in contempt who is
afraid to stake all on his ideal, and on this one
ultimate ideal I have never wavered. I am on

the verge of old age, and I can claim the privi-
lege of a life of candour and fair criticism and
permit myself once in a while to become an
enthusiast. So in all hope and in all humility
I would paraphrase the words of another con-
verted cynic and adopt them as my confession
of faith : "I shall see it, but not now : I shall
behold it, but not nigh."

CHAPTER XIV.
THE party wandered out to the verandah where
a young moon was beginning to climb the vast
arch of sky. So thin was its horn that it did not
diminish the brilliance of the stars. The great
trough beneath the house was lit by a stellar
glow, which caught a few outjutting headlands
in the sea of shadows, and outlined without
revealing the abysses around them. The air was
very quiet, cool without a hint of frost or wind;
and only the tinkle of falling water broke in
upon the stillness. The light from the drawing-
room filled half the verandah, but the edge near
the parapet was dark, and to one standing there
the great house, looming up against the sky,
was like a pharos in the wastes of night.
The Duchess with Lord Launceston and Mr
Carey walked slowly towards the edge of the
escarpment, their eyes caught by the magic of
the scene.
"This old earth," said Carey at last, lifting

his head from his breast,-''that is what we
have business with. How to shape her into
something more worthy of our best, and how
in the process to learn from her her mysterious
wisdom | That is our problem. We have been
too long away from her in barren cloudlands.
Our new precept is that the kingdom of God
is around us and within us."
Lord Launceston laughed as they stopped to
lean over the balustrade. "You have been an-
ticipated," he said, and he repeated:—
"This way have men come out of brutishness
To spell the letters of the sky and read
A reflex upon earth else meaningless.
With thee, O fount of the Untimed ! to lead;
Drink they of thee, thee eyeing, they unaged
Shall on through brave wars waged.
More gardens will they win than any lost;
The vile plucked out of them, the unlovely slain.
Not forfeiting the beast with which they are crossed,
To stature of the gods will they attain.
They shall uplift their Earth to meet her Lord,
Themselves the attuning chord!""
"To-morrow," said the Duchess, "we all go
home. I should not like Musuru to last for ever,
but it rather spoils one's satisfaction in any other
place. To-morrow we shall be crawling through
the bush in the Mombasa train, and beginning to

realise what a length of sea and land separates
this house from those in which we live our ordin-
ary lives. That is an allegory as well as a fact.
We have behaved rather nicely, I think, Francis.
Every one has been good-humoured and well-
mannered, and we have kept more or less in the
paths of sanity in spite of Barbara and you. I
know I have tried to do my duty and coax people
out of blank verse, and I have learned a great
deal in the process, and am half inclined to the
blank verse myself. Now, I suppose I must go
on explaining to dull people that the Empire is
something more than corrugated iron and an un-
pleasant accent, and that that something more is
not bloodshed to the strains of a brass band. It
will be very difficult for all of us to get back to
the right political groove. When we go home
the dear idiots who govern us, including George,
will probably be at each others' throats about
whether the school children are to be taught the
Church Catechism or the Sermon on the Mount.
Of course we shall have to take sides, for it is
the rule of the game: and yet how often I want
to cry 'A plague on both your Houses 1' Is it
possible that I am sickening for the disease of
'grandeur'?"
"No," said Carey, "it only means that you are
dropping some of your blue spectacles. You will

find them and wear them again, but it does the
eyes good to lose them for a little."
"At any rate we are going back to some kind
of work, and that is cheering. What happens to
you, Francis? Remember you are coming to us
for Christmas."
"I am always busy, and next week I have
to go to the States. Then I join Wakefield
in Canada, but I shall be home for Christmas.
There is only one thing that depresses me in
life, the amount to be done and the little time
left to do it in. After all, the great deeds are not
for the middle-aged. Our business is to inspire
the young, with whom the hope of the world
rests."
"And yet we middle-aged have been galvan-
ised into a surprising activity. Lord Launceston
is coming back to politics, and I believe that Bob
has some wild scheme of colonial travel. Most
discussions only leave one with a sense of the
futility of all things, but ours has made us
optimists. I suppose that is due to the nature
of our subject. If you talk much about some-
thing prosaic and practical, you remove it many
degrees from reality. But if it is something
which still lives only in the air, you may make
it shape itself into body and form. What may
have been only a mirage, becomes an authentic

country, far away, to be sure, but quite as real
as the ground we walk on. Let us go and find
the young people in whom Francis says our hope
lies. Hugh is probably composing sonnets to
Flora's eyebrows, and Mr Astbury sitting at
Marjory's feet, while Alastair and Sir Edward
console each other for going back by abusing
civilisation. How in the world am I to shepherd
them all home?" . . .
At the other end of the terrace those whilom
antagonists, Lord Appin and Mr Wakefield, were
walking arm in arm, their cigars glowing in the
darkness.
"I shall take your advice," the elder man was
saying. "After all, what business have I to
theorise about Empire when I have only studied
a little corner of it? I know English opinion;
I now want to know the way the different classes
in the colonies feel about the whole thing. You
cannot get that from newspapers, not even from
the men who come to see you in England. You
must go and live in the place if you want to
realise the true atmosphere of their thought. I
fancied that you and I should differ violently,
Wakefield, but I find we are nearer than we
dreamed of You emphasise parts of the ques-
tion with which I am unfamiliar, and perhaps I
should focus the details differently. But on the

essentials I believe we are at one. If you may
be taken to represent colonial opinion, I confess
myself surprised at its idealism and statesman-
ship."
"Excellent l" said Mr Wakefield. "And now
I shall return the compliment. I came here
prejudiced against what I called academic Im-
perialism and very particularly prejudiced against
you. With some of the things said here I have
disagreed. Some I thought wrong, some too
fantastic for practical politics. Parts of the
discussion I am not sure that I understood, parts
did not interest me, and if I had had my will
I should have arranged the whole conference on
a more businesslike system. But yet I have
learned so much that I go away a wiser, as
well as a much humbler, man. On the whole,
I have been astounded—yes, astounded—by our
common-sense."
