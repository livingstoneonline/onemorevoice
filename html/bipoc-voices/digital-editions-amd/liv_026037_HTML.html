  <h5 style="text-align: center">Henry Boston, African Native Pastor.</h5>
  <h6 style="text-align: center">Born 1830. Died 1874.</h6>
  <p>We announced in our last the death of the Rev. Henry Boston, Native Minister on the Bullom
    Shore, a low swampy country to the north of Sierra Leone. The following account of his life and
    death has been written at the request of our missionary, the Rev. L Nicholson, by his son, Mr.
    Nathaniel Henry Boston, who is a promising student at the C.M. College at Fourah Bay, Sierra
    Leone. As a further illustration of the blessing vouchsafed to the late pastor's labours, we may
    mention that Bishop Cheetham,on a recent visit, confirmed fifty of his people:&#8212;</p>
  <h6 style="text-align: center"><strong>A Brief Sketch of the Life and Death of the Late Rev. Henry
      Boston, First Native Minister of the Bullom Mission.</strong><br>B<small>Y HIS SON</small>.
  </h6>
  <p>It is indeed with many melancholy and painful efforts that I now
    accede to your request, and send you a short account of my late dear and
    much lamented father, the Rev. Henry Boston, of the Bullom Mission.
    He was born on the 8th April, 1830, at the village of Gloucester in Sierra
    Leone. His parents were John and Jane Boston, liberated Africans, the
    former of the Egba, and the latter of the Yoruba tribe. He had a sister
    named Maria, and after her a brother named John, who died in February, 1868.</p>
  <p>With his sister and brother he attended the day school of his little
    village, and after he had gone through the elementary course of education which that school
    supplied, he was removed by his parents, and
    apprenticed to a tailor in Freetown. By diligence and attention he soon
    acquired a good knowledge of his trade, and at the end of his apprenticeship he set up a shop in
    Freetown, and worked for himself as a master
    tailor. It was whilst he was thus engaged that the Lord in His good providence opened a way for
    him to leave his secular calling, to attend to the
    spiritual wants of men. For, on the return of the Rev. George Nicol
    (his townsman, and for whom he cherished a great affection and veneration) from England, he
    proposed to employ him as a bookseller; to this
    he readily agreed, and at once changed his occupation of tailoring for
    bookselling.</p>
  <p>On the 16th of December, 1850, he was admitted into the C.M.S.
    College of Fourah Bay, under the principalship of the Rev. E. Jones,
    M.A., through the recommendation of the Rev. G. Nicol, tutor of the
    College, and Rev. Nathaniel Denton, pastor of Regent.</p>
  <p>On April 13th, 1852, he was sent out of the College to the Society's
    field of labour by the C.M. Committee in Freetown, with the consent of
    the Principal. He laboured zealously and prayerfully as the village
    schoolmaster of Bathurst, till May, 1861, when he was promoted catechist, and sent over to
    reopen the Society's Mission on the Bullom shore.
    The difficulties and dangers which he had to encounter were of no
    ordinary nature, but he fought bravely and hard in attacking that stronghold of Satan, and
    therefore he was a successful instrument in the hand
    of God in turning many from darkness to light.</p>
  <p>On Trinity Sunday, May 22nd, 1864, he was admitted to deacon's
    orders, and on the 23rd December, 1866, he was ordained priest in St.
    George's Cathedral, by the Right Rev. E. H. Beckles, D.D., the then
    Lord Bishop of Sierra Leone.</p>
  <p>It is not for me to say how he discharged his duties, both pastoral and
    missionary; but it will be admitted on all hands that he performed his
    high trust with diligence, energy, faithfulness, and devotedness, to a
    degree well worthy of imitation. His labours were abundantly blessed;
    for that land, once a wilderness and a solitary place, has had abundant
    reason to be glad, and the desert to rejoice and blossom as the rose. He
    dearly loved his people, and endeavoured, as much as it was in his power,
    to promote both their temporal and eternal interests.</p>
  <p>The late Rev. G. R. Caiger, the then superintendent of the Bullom
    Mission, writes in the <em>Church Missionary Record</em> for January, 1864:&#8212;
    "The work in the Bullom is full of encouragement. I spent three or
    four days with our native agent, Mr. Boston, who is decidedly the right
    man to occupy that position. I had many opportunities of talking with
    him on the nature of the work, its difficulties, &amp;c., and it was apparent
    from everything I could see that he was labouring amongst the people as
    one who felt the responsibility of having souls committed to his care.
    His labour would seem to confirm his own statement to me: 'I have a
    large heart for the people.' I remained over one Sunday to administer
    the Communion, and I confess I was not prepared to see our church so
    crowded with attentive listeners," &amp;c.</p>
  <p>In all his successes he was wont to give all the glory to God, and to
    look upon himself as a mere unworthy instrument.</p>
  <p>In March last he was suddenly seized with a very strong attack of
    fever and pains in the back, which was thought to have been occasioned
    by his frequent exposure to wind and weather during his missionary
    itinerancies through the swamps and marshes of the Bullom country. He
    came over to Sierra Leone for a change, and spent about three weeks at
    the mountain village of Regent, which did him some good. At the end
    of this time he proposed to return to Bullom; many of his friends and
    relatives tried to dissuade him from returning so soon, as the change was
    too short to do him much good; but he determined to go, as he had just
    begun to rebuild his church at Yongro, and, as he said, "the progress of
    the work necessarily required his presence." When they saw that he would
    not be persuaded, like the disciples of C&#230;sarea, they ceased, saying, "the
    will of the Lord be done." Accordingly, on Friday, the 22nd of May,
    he left Freetown and returned to Bullom. He there continued gradually
    to recover, although he had now and then a relapse, until the two weeks
    previous to his death, when he grew worse, and suffered much. He
    breathed his last at noon of the 15th July.</p>
  <p>The corpse was brought that night in an open boat to Freetown, landed
    at Fourah Bay, and thence carried to Glouchester, his native village. At
    four o'clock in the afternoon of Thursday, the 16th of July, his remains
    were removed from his father's house to St. Andrew's Church, Gloucester;
    he was then carried to his grave, amidst the lamentations and weeping
    of a large company, from among his much-loved relatives and friends,
    and also of his flock of Bullom: who, nevertheless, sorrowed for him
    who now rests in Jesus, not as those who have no hope. He has left behind to mourn his loss, his
    beloved wife, aged parents, his six dear children, and many other relatives, and also his
    parishioners: many of these
    depended solely on him for their every human aid and support.</p>
  <p>But what is so much our loss in his eternal gain, as he has left unto
    us the firm assurance that he has only fallen asleep in the loving arms of
    Jesus. On the day of his death, having called his only sister to his bedside, he said, "I am
    going home to-day; I advise you to work while it is
    day, for when the night of death comes you will never be able to work."
    When asked, "Are you praying?" he replied, "O yes! that Saviour
    whom I have preached to others, that Jesus whom I have pointed out to
    others, on Him alone is my every hope and trust." He then called for
    bread and wine, but as wine could not be got there, he took water instead,
    and himself partook of a last memory of Christ's death. After this he
    said, "I want to go home, I am going home to-day. Come! Lord Jesus,
    come quickly, and take my spirit home." Having said this, without a
    struggle or a groan his immortal spirit left its earthly tenement, and
    winged its flight to the realms of the blest. "Blessed are the dead which
    die in the Lord, for they rest from their labours, and their works do follow
    them."</p>
  <p style="text-align: center"><small>
      "Thou art gone to thy grave; but we will not deplore thee,<br>
      Whose God was thy ransom, thy guardian and guide!<br>
      He gave thee, He took thee, and He will restore thee;<br>
      And death has no sting, for the Saviour has died."</small></p>
  <p>I only pray that a double portion of the spirit of Elijah may rest on
    Elisha; that I may be endued with a double portion of his missionary
    zeal and devotedness to the service of God, instrumental in my master's
    hand in turning many from darkness to light, and from the power of sin
    unto God. And as I close I cannot but hope that many of my country-
    men and others who may read this short but imperfect sketch of this
    departed man's laborious and zealous life, will be fired to greater
    diligence and missionary zeal for the futherance of the Redeemer's
    kingdom, and that we may all become "followers of them who through
    faith and patience are now inheriting the promises."</p>
