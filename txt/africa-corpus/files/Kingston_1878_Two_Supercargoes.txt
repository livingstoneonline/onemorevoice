PREFACE.
FRICA will probably continue for a generation or
more, as it has been from time immemorial, a land
of mystery, although the veil which has shrouded it from
the eyes of the civilised world is gradually being drawn
aside.
When the two young Supercargoes and their naval
companions visited it, excepting on the seaboard, it was
comparatively but little known. Whether or not their
adventures will be considered as thrilling and romantic
as those of Stanley and Cameron, I must leave my
readers to decide; but I shall be satisfied if the follow-
ing narrative induces any of my youthful friends to
take an interest in the long-neglected and fearfully
ill-treated inhabitants of that benighted land, and to
assist those who are so heroically labouring for their
amelioration with their contributions, if not by their
personal efforts. I would advise them also, when they
have finished the adventures of the Two Supercargoes,

to read the narratives of the above-mentioned explorers,
and they will see how judgment, courage, and perseverance
can conquer dangers and difficulties which might have
induced many a stout heart to turn back and abandon the
enterprises which they have successfully achieved.

HE 'Arrow' has come in, sir, from the Coast of Africa,
_L under charge of Mr. Godfrey Magor, the second mate,"
I heard Harry Bracewell, one of our shipping clerks, say, as I
was seated on a high stool, pen in hand, leaning over my desk in
the office of Messrs. Crank, Trunnion, & Swab, general merchants,
of Liverpool.
Harry addressed the senior partner, Mr. Peter Crank, who had
just then stepped out of his private room with a bundle of papers
in his hand into the counting-house, where I, with a dozen other
clerks, senior and junior, were driving our quills as fast as we
could move them over the paper, or adding up columns of figures,
or making calculations, as the case might be.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
As I turned my head slightly, I could see both Mr. Crank and
Harry. They afforded a strange contrast. Harry was tall, well-
built, had a handsome countenance, with a pleasant expression
which betokened his real character, for he was as kind, honest,
and generous a young fellow as ever lived—the only son of his
mother, the widow of a naval officer killed in action. She had
come to Liverpool for the sake of giving a home to Harry, who
had been for some time in the employment of the firm. The
difference between Mr. Crank and Harry was indeed most con-
spicuous in their personal appearance. Whereas Harry was tall,
Mr. Crank was short and stout; he had a bald head, shining as if
it had been carefully polished, a round face, with a florid com-
plexion, and a nose which was allowed by his warmest friends to
be a snub; but he had a good mouth, bright blue eyes, often
twinkling with humour, which seemed to look through and through
those he addressed, while his brow exhibited a considerable
amount of intellect. Had not he possessed that, he would not
have been at the head of the firm of Crank, Trunnion, & Swab.
"Brought home, did you say, by Godfrey Magor? What has
happened to Captain Rig and the first mate?"
"Both died from fever while up the Nunn, as did all hands
except himself and three others. So Mr. Magor told me; and
the survivors were all so weak, that he could not have brought the
vessel home had he not shipped six Kroomen. He had also a
narow escape from pirates, who actually boarded his vessel, when
a man-of-war heaving in sight, they made off without plundering
her or killing any one."
"Bless my heart! I'm sorry to hear about Captain Rig's death.
The poor man remained longer up the river than he should have
done, no doubt about that. I have over and over again charged
the masters of our vessels to be careful in that respect, but they
won't attend to what I say. Let me see! that makes the fifth
who has lost his life during the last two years. I'm thankful he
got clear of the pirates. Those rascals have long been the greatest

pests on that coast. It is time the British Government should
take effectual steps to put a stop to their depredations by sending
a squadron into those seas. Have you brought the manifest and
the other papers with you?"
"Yes, sir," answered Harry, producing them. "Mr. Magor
will be on shore himself in an hour or two, when he has seen the
vessel made snug, for he has no one to leave in charge; he him-
self is still suffering from the fever, and two of her white crew are
in their bunks."
Mr. Crank, taking the documents, retired with them into his
room, to run his eye over the list of articles brought by the
"Arrow," and to calculate their present market value. The result
I know was satisfactory. I had afterwards to note down the
prices which they fetched. Merchants who could make so large
a percentage on all their cargoes were certain to grow rich. It
was at the cost, however, of the lives of a great number of human
beings; but that was not my employers' look out, nor did they
allow the matter to trouble their consciences. They could always
obtain fresh masters to take charge of their vessels, and fresh
crews to man them.
In a short time Mr. Trunnion, who had heard on 'Change of
the arrival of the "Arrow," came in to learn what news she had
brought, expecting to find her master, who was wont, immediately
he came on shore, to put in an appearance at the office. Mr.
Trunnion expressed himself much shocked at Captain Rig's
death.
"Poor fellow! he used to boast that he was acclimatised, but
it is a proof of the old adage, 'that the pitcher which goes often
to the well gets broken at last.' We might have lost a worse
man;" and with this remark Mr. Trunnion passed into his room,
in which he sat to receive visitors on private business.
Mr. Trunnion, although the second partner, was the youngest
in the firm. He was a good-looking, urbane, well-mannered man,
who, if not always loved by those under him, was much liked and

respected in the social circle in which he moved, he being also
one of the magnates of Liverpool.
For my own part, I had reason to like and be grateful to Mr.
Swab, the junior member of the firm. He had formerly been a
clerk in the house, but by diligent attention to and a thorough
knowledge of business and strict honesty, he had some years
before been made a partner. To him I felt that I owed all the
knowledge I possessed of commercial affairs, as from my first
entrance into the office he took notice of me, and gave me the
instruction I so much required. My chief friend was Harry
Bracewell, who was also a favourite with Mr. Swab, and had re-
ceived the same instruction from him that I had obtained. Mr.
Swab was not at all ashamed of his origin. He used to tell us
that he had risen, not from the gutter, but from the mud, like other
strange animals, having obtained his livelihood in his early days by
hunting at low tide for whatever he could pick up along the shore,
thrown overboard from the lighters or similar vessels unloading at
the quays. At length it was his good fortune to pick a purse out
of the mud containing ten golden guineas, and, as he used to tell
us, being convinced that he should never have a find like it,
he resolved to quit his occupation, for which he had no parti-
cular fancy, and endeavour to obtain a situation where he might
have a prospect of rising in the world. Though he could neither
read nor write, he was well aware that those acquirements were
necessary for his advancement, as also that a decent suit of clothes
would greatly contribute to his obtaining a respectable place.
These objects were now within his reach. The most easily at-
tained was the suit of clothes, and these he bought, with a cap
and a good pair of shoes, at a slopseller's, including three shirts,
a necktie, and other articles of clothing, for the moderate sum of
j£2, 13s. 6d. He had taken good care not to let the slopseller
know of his wealth; indeed, that fact he kept locked in his own
bosom, as he did his purse in a place in which no one was likely
to discover it. The balance of the ten pounds into which he had

broken he expended in supporting himself while he acquired the
first rudiments of knowledge, with the aid of a friend, the keeper
of a second-hand bookstall, a broken-down schoolmaster, who,
strange to say, still retained a pleasure in imparting instruction to
the young. Nicholas Swab first bought a spelling-book, and then
confessed that he should find it of no use unless Mr. Vellum
would explain to him the meaning of the black marks on the
pages.
"Then you do not know your letters, my poor boy?" said the
old man in a tone of commiseration.
"No, sir, I don't j but I soon will, if you'll tell them to me,"
answered Nicholas in a confident tone.
"Sit down on that stool, and say them after me as I point
them out to you," said Mr. Vellum.
With great patience he went over the alphabet again and again.
"Now I want to put them together, sir," said Nicholas, not
content with the extent of the first lesson. All day long he sat
with the book before him, and then took it with him to his home.
That home, the abode of his mother, a widow, with a pension of
five shillings a week, which enabled her to live, although too
small to afford subsistence to her son, was in a small garret up a
dark stair in one of the poorest of the back streets of Liverpool.
Nicholas set working away by the flame of a farthing rushlight,
and at dawn he was up again poring over his book.
Old Vellum was so pleased with the progress made by his
pupil, that he continued to give him all the assistance in his power,
not only teaching him to read but to write. In a few weeks young
Nicholas could do both in a very creditable manner. Having
thus gained the knowledge he desired, dressed in a decent suit of
clothes, he went round to various offices in Liverpool offering to
fill any vacant situation for which he might be considered fit.
Although he met with numerous rebuffs, he persevered, and was
finally taken into the small counting-house of which Mr. Peter
Crank's father was the head. To the firm, through all its various

changes, he had remained attached, and though frequently offered
opportunities of bettering himself, had refused to leave it. "No,
no; I'll stick to my old friends," he always answered; "their
interests are mine, and although I am but a poor clerk, I believe
I can forward them."
From the first, during all his leisure moments, of which he had
not many, he continued to study hard, and to improve himself,
spending a portion of his wages in books, which he obtained from
Mr. Vellum, who allowed him also the run of his library. He
was raised from grade to grade until he became head clerk, and
during the illness of Mr. Crank and the absence of Mr. Trunnion,
he so well managed the affairs of the firm, that they felt bound to
offer him a partnership in the business, to the success of which
he had so greatly contributed. Notwithstanding his rise in the
social circle, Nicholas Swab continued to be the same unosten-
tatious, persevering, painstaking man which he had been from
the first—upright in all his dealings, and generous to those who
required a helping hand.
Some of the transactions of the firm would not, it must be con-
fessed, stand the test of the present code of morality. The slave
trade had, until lately, been lawful, and the firm had engaged in
it with as little hesitation as it would in any other mercantile
business. It had been in the habit of buying negroes in the
cheapest market, and disposing of them in the dearest, without
for a moment considering how they were obtained. When the
traffic was pronounced illegal, it withdrew its own vessels, but
still had no hesitation in supplying the means for fitting out others
which it knew were about to proceed to the African coast,
although no particular inquiries were made on the subject. It
was not very long before the time of which I speak that the fact
dawned on the minds of the partners that the traffic was hateful
in the sight of God, as well as in that of a large number of their
countrymen, and that it was the main cause of the cruel wars
and miseries unspeakable from which the dark-skinned children

of Africa had long suffered. Being really conscientious men,
they had agreed to abandon all connection with the traffic, and to
employ their vessels in carrying on a lawful trade on the coast.
To do this, however, was not at first so easy as might be supposed.
One of the vessels especially, which they had contributed to fit
out and to supply with goods, although not belonging to them,
was commanded by Mr. Trunnion's brother—a Captain Roderick
Trunnion, of whose character I had heard from time to time
mysterious hints thrown out not much to his credit. He occa-
sionally made his appearance at Liverpool. He seemed to me
to be a fine, bold, dashing fellow, ready to do and dare anything
he might think fit. He was like several privateer captains I had
met with, who set their own lives and those of their followers at
slight value, provided they could carry out their undertakings.
He gave, I believe, his brother, Mr. Thomas Trunnion, the
partner in our firm, considerable cause for anxiety and annoyance.
The last time he had been on shore, in order to recover his
brother's confidence he endeavoured to make himself agreeable to
the other partners. Mr. Swab, however, I know, did not trust
him, as he privately told Harry Bracewell on one occasion.
"And don't you," he added; "he is without principles; he always
did what he chose regardless of God or man. And he doesn't
believe in God, or that any man has a grain of honesty, nor does
he, except when it suits him, boast of having any himself."
Captain Trunnion, however, appeared to have insinuated him-
self into the good graces of our senior partner, at whose house
he was a frequent visitor. He had a strong attraction there; for
Lucy, Mr. Crank's, only child, was a sweet, amiable, pretty girl,
and Captain Trunnion believed that, could he win her, he should
not only obtain a charming wife, but become possessed, some day
or other, of Mr. Crank's property. Which influenced him most I
cannot say. All I know is, that he did not make any progress in
the affections of Miss Lucy, for a very good reason, which he was
not long in suspecting—that she had already given her heart to

some one else. That some one was my friend Harry Bracewell.
Captain Trunnion had, however, gone away without suspecting
who was his rival.
My father and mother resided in Chester, so that I was received
into the house, as a lodger, of Mrs. Bracewell; thus it was that I
became more intimate with Harry than I might otherwise have
been. I also had an opportunity of being constantly in the
society of the widow's only daughter, Mary—a charming little
unaffected girl, full of life and spirits, who treated me as her
brother's friend, almost like a brother. For a long time I also
thought only of her as a sister, although, somehow or other, I
began at last to entertain the hope that, when I had by steady
industry obtained the means of making her my wife, she would
not feel it necessary to refuse me; and as my family was a
respectable one, I had no reason to fear that any objection would
be raised by Mrs. Bracewell or Harry. Of my own family I need
not speak, except of one member—my brother Charley, who had
gone to sea before I entered the office, and was now a midship-
man of some years' standing. He had lately joined the " Rover"
frigate, employed on the African station. Charley and I had been
fast friends and companions, as brothers should be, when we were
together, and when separated we constantly corresponded with
each other. I cannot say that I had any special fondness for
mercantile pursuits, or at all events for the work of an office,
having to sit for ten or twelve hours of the day on a high stool at
a desk, but yet I was thoroughly impressed with the fact that I
must gain my own livelihood, and that by working hard alone
could I expect to do so. Had the choice been given me, I should
have preferred a life in the open air, with the opportunity of
travelling about and seeing the world; but my father did not wish
to have more than one son in the navy, and Charley had been
devoted as an offering to Neptune. I was, however, very happy
in my situation. Understanding what I was to do, I took a
pleasure in doing it well; and I spent my evenings happily in the

THE MATE OF THE "ARROW."

society of Mrs. Bracewell and her son and daughter. We
had generally music and singing, now and then two or three
visitors. Occasionally we went out to Mr. Crank's parties and
those of other friends, so that our lives were in no respects
dull.
I enter into these details in order that more interest may be
taken in the rest of my narrative than might otherwise have been
the case.
About an hour after Harry had reported the arrival of the vessel,
as I was engaged in Mr. Trunnion's private room in taking down
letters at his dictation, the mate of the " Arrow " was announced.
As Mr. Crank was out, Mr. Trunnion desired him to come in and
give an account of his voyage. As I was not desired to quit the
room, I continued transcribing the notes which I had taken down,
but I glanced round at the mate as he entered. His appearance
showed that he had suffered from the fever which had carried
off so many of his shipmates. His cheek was pale and hollow,
his eye dull, and his figure emaciated; even his voice sounded
weak and hollow.
"Sit down," said Mr. Trunnion in a kind voice, showing that
he was struck by the sickly look of the poor mate. "I should
like to hear full particulars of your voyage. It has been a success-
ful one judging by the manifest, which I have been looking over,
although fatal to so many long in our employment . You have
managed well, too, in bringing home the 'Arrow.' We are well
satisfied—I can tell you that at once."
The mate then began an account of the transactions connected
with the vessel from the time of her arrival on the Coast of Africa,
the number of places visited, and the trade transactions at each.
They were very interesting to me I know at the time, but I did
not note them. Mr. Magorthen described how one after the other
the captain and crew died, until he and three others were alone
left. "I doubted indeed whether I should have been able to
bring the vessel home," he continued. "We had a narrow escape

of being captured by a picarooning craft which swept alongside
us during a calm. A number of the crew, headed by their
captain, had actually made their way on board, and having bound
me and three of my men, were proceeding to get off the hatches to
take the cargo out of the hold, when a man-of-war, bringing up a
strong breeze from the south, hove in sight. The pirates on dis-
covering her hurried on board their own craft, carrying away two
of my Kroomen, and casting off the grapplings with which they had
made her fast alongside, got out their long sweeps and pulled
away for their lives. As soon as the remaining Kroomen had set
me and the other white men free, we ran out our guns and began
firing at her. She returned our shot; and as she had more guns
and heavier metal than ours, we judged it prudent not to follow
her. When the breeze came, which it did soon afterwards, she
stood away under all sail before the wind. She showed that she
was a fast craft, for she had almost got out of sight before the
man-of-war came up with us. The latter pursued her, but whether
she was overtaken or not I cannot say, as we continued our
voyage towards England, and I saw no more of either of them.
The pirates who had boarded us were of all nations, Spaniards,
Portugese, and French, and there were several Englishmen among
them. That their leader was one I could swear, for I heard him
speaking English to several of the villains; and what is more, as
he gave me a good opportunity of marking his features while I
was bound to the mainmast, I should remember him were I ever
to meet him again."
"I hope that you may never fall in with him again under simi-
lar circumstances," remarked Mr. Trunnion. "Should you do so,
he will probably make you walk the plank before he begins dis-
charging your cargo into his own craft."
While the mate was narrating his adventures I heard a strange
voice speaking in an authoritative tone in the outer office. Sud-
denly the door was burst open, and a tall powerful man, dressed
in riding-boots, his clothes bespattered with mud, yet having in.

AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.
II
other respects a nautical cut about him, entered the room. Mr.
Trunnion gazed on him without speaking.
"What, Tom ! don't you know me?" exclaimed the new-comer
advancing and putting out his hand. "My beard has grown, and
I have become somewhat sunburnt since we parted."
"Bless my heart! is it you, Roderick?" exclaimed Mr. Trun-
nion. "I own that I did not recognise you, and was surprised at
the intrusion of a stranger."
Roderick Trunnion, giving a laugh, threw himself into a chair
opposite his brother, who reassumed his usual cold and dignified
demeanour as he took his seat. From my desk I could observe
what was going forward. I saw the mate start and narrowly scan
the countenance of the new-comer with a look of extreme aston-
ishment, while the latter, who did not appear to remark him, leaned
forward and gazed at his brother, whose manner seemed to irri-
tate him.
"Where in the world have you come from, Roderick?" asked
Mr. Trunnion.
"From Falmouth last, where I left the 'Vulture' to refit. We
met with a somewhat heavy gale, in which she was fearfully
knocked about, and had we not kept the pumps going she would
have foundered to a certainty. As I wanted to see you and other
friends, I took horse and rode night and day to get here. The
business I have got to speak of brooks of no delay, and is such as
you and I can talk about best alone."
Turning round as he spoke, he cast a glance at Mr. Magor.
For a moment, it seemed to me that his eye appeared to quail,
but he quickly recovered himself.
•'Have you finished your business here?" he asked in a bold
tone, looking at the mate. "If so, you will leave me and your
employer alone—for I presume that you are the master of one of
his vessels. And that youngster—you do not wish him to take
down our conversation, I suppose," he added, first looking at me
then round at his brother.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"Really, Roderick, you have been so accustomed to command,
that you forget that you are not on your own quarter-deck," ob-
served Mr. Trunnion, who was evidently annoyed at the authori-
tative tone assumed by his brother.
The mate rose and looked first at Mr. Trunnion then at Captain
Roderick.
"I have met that man before," he said, "and it is my duty to
tell you when and how it was. It was not long ago, on the high
seas, when he boarded the 'Arrow' at the head of"
Mr. Trunnion, as the mate spoke, looked very much agitated,
and I naturally fancied that something extraordinary was about
to be said. Captain Roderick alone appeared perfectly cool.
Fixing his glance on the mate, he exclaimed in a loud tone, inter-
rupting him—
"You, my good fellow, may have met me half-a-dozen times
for what I know to the contrary, or half-a-dozen men whom you
may mistake for me, although I cannot say that I ever set eyes
on you before. However,"go on and tell Mr. Trunnion what I
did when you fancy that you saw me, and I shall then know
whether you are mistaken as to my identity."
The mate looked greatly confused.
"I can only hope that I am mistaken, and unless Mr. Trunnion
desires me, I shall decline at present slating where, as I believe,
I last saw you."
Mr. Trunnion was silent for a minute, and seemed lost in
thought. Suddenly looking up he said—
"You have been suffering from fever, Mr. Magor, and your
recollection of events, very naturally, is somewhat clouded. A
few weeks' quiet and rest will restore your health. I would advise
you not to repeat what you have just said. I'll send on board
and relieve you of charge of the brig as soon as possible, and you
can go to your friends in the country."
Mr. Magor, making a nautical bow to Mr. Trunnion, and
giving another glance towards Captain Roderick, left the room.

UNPLEASANT SUSPICIONS.
13
"Westerton," continued my employer, turning to me, "you
have heard all that has been said, and if it were repeated, although
the poor man is under an hallucination, it might be the cause of
disagreeable reports. You are discreet, I can trust you. Let
not a word on the subject escape your lips. You can now go
and finish those letters at your own desk."
I did as I was ordered, and gathering up the papers, followed
the mate out of the room, leaving the two brothers together.
What followed, I of course cannot say. For an hour or more they
were closeted together. At last Captain Roderick came out, and
returned to the inn where he had put up his horse. All I know
is, that Mr. Trunnion did not invite him to his house. It seemed
to me suspicious, and I could not help thinking about the matter,
and wished that I could have consulted Harry Bracewell. Two
evenings afterwards we went to a party at the house of Mr.
Crank. Shortly after we arrived, who should walk in but Captain
Roderick. By the way Mr. Crank and Lucy received him, I felt
convinced that Mr. Trunnion had said nothing to prejudice the
senior partner against him. He made himself at home as usual,
treating Miss Lucy with great deference, and it seemed to me that
he was gaining ground in her good graces.
His appearance was greatly improved since the day I had seen
him in the counting-house. His face was carefully shaved, and
his dress was such as to set off his well-made active figure. His
aim was evidently to play the agreeable, not only to the young
lady of the house, but to all the ladies present, and with some—
especially with the dowagers—he appeared to be as successful as
he could desire. He cast an indifferent glance now and then at
me, as if he had never set eyes on me before, and appeared
perfectly unconscious of the accusation—for such I considered
it—brought against him by Mr. Magor. When I observed his
apparent success with Lucy Crank, I felt a greater desire than
ever to tell Harry what I.had heard, and to advise him to warn
her and her father of what I believed to be the real character of

the man. His brother, I supposed, from fraternal affection or
family pride, had said nothing to his senior partner to warn him,
and, of course, even to Harry I could not venture to say what I
thought about Captain Trunnion. I could only hope that Lucy
would remain as indifferent to him as she had always before
appeared to be, and that he would quickly again return to the
"Vulture." I was surprised, indeed, that he had ventured to be
so long absent from his vessel, as his presence would be necessary
while she was refitting. Perhaps, after all, his statements about
her might not be true; she might not even be at Falmouth,
although his mud-bespattered appearance on his arrival showed
that he had ridden a long distance.

CHAPTER IL
Captain Trunnion appears openly at Liverpool—His attentions to Lucy
Crank—Her affection for Harry Bracewell—Captain Trunnion exhibits
his jealousy of Harry—Suspecting the Captain's evil intentions, I watch
over Harry—Godfrey Magor placed in command of the "Arrow"—
Harry and I appointed supercargoes—Attend to the stowage of the vessel
—Prepare for sailing—Farewell to loved ones—Voyage commenced.
TVTOTWITHSTANDING the very grave suspicion cast on
1 \ him by the mate of the "Arrow," Captain Roderick
Trunnion did not immediately quit Liverpool, as I supposed
he would have done. He was, as far as I could judge, not on
friendly terms with his brother, as he lived at an inn, although
there was ample room for him at Mr. Trunnion's house, where he
seldom went, nor did he again appear at the office. I met him,
however, frequently walking about Liverpool, dressed in shore-
going clothes, booted and spurred, and carrying a riding-whip in
his hand.
Notwithstanding, I should have known him at a glance to be
a seaman. I found also that he very frequently called at Mr.
Crank's residence at times when he well knew that the old gentle-
man would be at his counting-house. I did not suppose, however,
that he received any encouragement from Miss Lucy, but he
always had some excuse for paying a visit, either to show some
curiosity which he said he had brought from abroad, or to leave
a book or other articles which he had obtained for her. The
fact was, that he had got into the good graces of Miss Deborah

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Crank, Mr. Crank's maiden sister, who resided with him to look
after Miss Lucy and keep his house in order. I met the Captain
there at two or three evening parties to which the Bracewells and
I were invited, and on each occasion he was evidently paying
court to the young lady. When not with her, he was making
himself agreeable to Miss Deborah.
Harry appeared to be in no way jealous or unhappy, which he
would have been had he thought that Captain Roderick had the
slightest chance of success.
"We understand each other," he said, "and she has assured
me that she does not like him, though she cannot be rude to him
while her father and aunt invite him to the house."
I did not like to make Harry unhappy by saying that I was
not quite so certain about the matter as he was; at the same time
I jonged to be able to warn Miss Lucy of the character of the
man. What surprised me was that Mr. Trunnion should not
have spoken to Mr. Crank, or that the latter should not have
thought it strange that Captain Roderick never came to the
counting-house.
Probably Mr. Trunnion was influenced by fraternal feelings in
not warning his partner of his suspicions regarding his brother's
character. I did not, however, long entertain fears of Miss Lucy's
affection for Harry, from a circumstance which he told me. It
was a holiday, and he had arranged to accompany her and her
aunt on a visit to some friends in the country. The coach was
at the door waiting for Miss Deborah, who was upstairs, not yet
having finished her toilet, while Lucy, who had finished dressing,
was seated in the drawing-room with Harry by her side. Suddenly
the door opened, the young people expecting to see Miss Deborah
enter. What, therefore, wras their surprise when Captain Roderick
stalked into the room. He stood for a moment gazing fiercely
at Harry.
"What business have you here?" he exclaimed in a voice
hoarse with passion.

THE RIVALS.
17
Harry wisely did not answer him; but Lucy, looking up and
holding Harry's hand, said quietly—'
"Mr. Bracewell has come to escort my aunt and me into the
country, and I have good reason for the annoyance I feel at the
question you have put to him. My father is from home and will
not return for some time, so I cannot invite you to wait for him."
Captain Roderick was not a man to be abashed even by the
way Miss Lucy had addressed him. Taking a turn or two in the
room, he waited—so Harry thought—expecting Miss Deborah to
come down-stairs and invite him to accompany them. Lucy,
suspecting his purpose, took Harry's arm and whispered, "Let us
go down to the carriage."
Miss Deborah, happening to look out of her window, saw them
get in, and being just then ready, she joined them without going
into the drawing-room. Lucy, with much presence of mind, just
before the carriage drove off, desired the servant, in a low voice
which her aunt did not hear, to see Captain Roderick out of the
house.
Whatever Captain Roderick might before have supposed, he
now discovered to a certainty that Harry Bracewell was his
rival. When I heard the account just given, believing that the
mate was right in his suspicions, I felt sure that, should he have
an opportunity, he would revenge himself on my friend. I told
.Harry all I could to warn him. I said that I believed Captain
Roderick was a bad, unprincipled man, whom no fear of conse-
quences or any right feeling would restrain from committing an
act of violence if he thought that it would further his object.
Harry merely laughed, and observed, "When he finds that he has
no chance of cutting me out he'll take himself off. I should think
his brother, who is so strict and correct in his conduct, would be
very glad to get him away from Liverpool."
Knowing what dreadful deeds had been done by men of ill-
regulated minds influenced by jealousy, I felt seriously anxious
about Harry, lest Captain Roderick should find means to revenge

himself. Had I been able to explain the cause of the dread I
had of him I might have convinced Harry of his danger, and in-
duced him to be careful when going abroad at night; but I could
only tell him that I suspected the man, and that I did not like him.
Harry, however, though he had a true regard for me, either thought
that I was mistaken or needlessly alarmed.
Sometimes I thought of telling my fears to Mr. Trunnion, and
asking permission from him to warn Harry Bracewell; but I knew
that he would feel highly offended were I to speak on the subject
to him. I therefore, whenever Harry went out, made some excuse
for accompanying him, especially when he went to Mr. Crank's
house. On those occasions, instead of going in, I used to walk
about in the neighbourhood, or sit down in an archway where the
dark shadow concealed me from the view of passers-by. On two
different evenings I saw a person pass whom I felt sure by his
figure was Captain Roderick. The second time, when he stopped
before Mr. Crank's house, the light of the moon falling on his
face revealed his features to me, and convinced me that I was
not mistaken. He was dressed as I first saw him at the counting-
house, and he had a hanger by his side, and a brace of pistols in
his belt, with a pair of riding-boots on, as if prepared for a journey.
Fearing that Harry might come out, and that his rival might
attack him, I went up as if I was going to knock at the door; in-
stead of which I stood in the porch, where, concealed, I could
watch Captain Roderick. Perhaps he suspected that I had recog-
nised him ; for after waiting a minute, and looking up at the win-
dows, he moved away, and I lost sight of him. I waited until
Harry came out, and then taking his arm, I hurried him along
in an opposite direction to that which he would naturally have
followed as the shortest way home.
"Why are you going by this road?" he asked.
"I will tell you presently," I answered, continuing at a quick
pace. "Don't ask questions just now, for I really cannot answer
you."

THE CAPTAIN DISAPPEARS.
19
Harry did as I wished, and we therefore exchanged few words
until we reached home.
"Now," I said, "I will tell you. I am confident that Captain
Roderick was waylaying you, and would either have sought a quar-
rel, or perhaps have cut you down with his hanger, or shot you."
Harry was at length inclined to believe th at I was right, but
still he added, "Perhaps, after all, he may be going away, and only
came to take a last look at the house where Lucy lives; for,
from what she tells me he said to her, I cannot help thinking
that he must be desperately enamoured."
"If he does go, well and good; but if he remains, I tell you,
Harry, that I do not consider your life safe," I remarked. "I
must beg your mother and sister to lock you up, and not let you
go out at night until the fellow has gone. He is a villain!" I
repeated, in my eagerness almost revealing what I was bound to
keep secret.
After this I saw no more of Captain Roderick. Whether or not
he had left Liverpool I was uncertain, but I hoped he had
gone. A few days afterwards, Mr. Magor, the mate of the
"Arrow," came to the office, where he was received in a very
friendly way by Mr. Swab. He looked completely changed.
The sickly hue had left his cheek, and he was stout and hearty,
with the independent bearing of a seaman.
"I am glad to see you looking so well, Mr. Magor," said Mr.
Swab. "My partners and I have been talking the matter over;
and from the way you brought the 'Arrow' home, and the char-
acter you received from her late master, we are resolved to offer
you the command."
"Thank you, sir. I am proud of your approval; and I may ven-
ture to say, as far as navigating a vessel, or handling her in fine
weather or foul, I am as competent as most men. I cannot boast,
however, of my abilities as a trader, as I am no hand at keeping
accounts. In that respect, I do not think that I should do you
justice."


## p. 20 (#48) ##############################################

20
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"Well, well, Captain Magor; we cannot always expect to find
a man like Captain Rig, who combined both qualifications. We
must therefore send a supercargo, or perhaps two, to help you; and
I hope, with their assistance, that you will not be compelled to
remain long up any of the rivers, and run the risk of losing your
own life or of having your crew cut off by fever. You must try
and be away from the coast before the sickly season sets in. It
is by remaining up the rivers during the rains and hot weather
that so many people die."
"As to the hot weather, I don't know when it is not hot on
the coast," observed Captain Magor, for so in future I may call
him; "but I am ready to brave any season in your service. And
I again thank you, sir, for the offer you make me, which I gladly
accept, provided you supply me with the assistance you see I
require."
"We will try to do that," said Mr. Swab. "Now, without loss
of time, look out for a couple of good men as mates, and the
best crew you can obtain, and get the vessel fitted out without
delay. I will accompany you on board and place you in com-
mand."
This was said in the outer office, where Henry and I overheard it.
"I wonder to whom they will offer the berths," said Harry
to me. "If I thought that it would advance me in the house,
and enable me the sooner to speak to Mr. Crank, I for one
should be ready to accept an offer, although it would be a sore
trial to go away. I had never dreamed of doing so ; but yet, if I
was asked, I would not refuse, as, of course, it could not fail to
give one a lift; whereas, should I refuse, I should fall in the esti-
mation of the partners."
The very next day Mr. Crank desired Harry and me to come
into his inner room, and he then told us, what we already knew,
that the firm intended to send out two supercargoes, who might
assist each other, and asked if we would go, promising us each a
share in the profits of the voyage, and advancement in the house

WE RECEIVE OUR APPOINTMENTS. 21
on our return. "I do not hide from you that there is danger from
the climate, and in some places from the natives; but the vessel
will be well armed, and you must exert all the judgment and dis-
cretion you possess. You are both young and strong, and have
never tampered with your constitutions, so that you are less likely
to succumb to the climate than the generality of seamen." He
then entered fully into the subject, telling us how to act under
various circumstances, and giving us full directions for our guid-
ance.
We did not appear very elated at the offer, but accepted it>
provided Harry's mother and my parents did not object. "Tell
them all I have said," observed Mr. Crank, "and let me know
to-morrow, that should you refuse our offer I may look out for two
other young men who have no family ties to prevent them from going.
Our interests should, I think, be considered in the matter."
I judged by the tone of the senior partner's voice that he would
be offended should we refuse his offer, and we therefore made up
our minds to press the matter with those who had to decide for us.
Of course we talked it over as we walked home that ^vening.
We both fancied that we should be absent little more than five
months, and that we should come back with our purses well filled,
or, at all events, with the means of filling them.
Mrs. Bracewell and Mary were very unhappy when Harry
placed the state of the case before them; but they acknowledged
that he ought to act as the firm wished. My parents, to whom I
wrote, expressed themselves much in the same way, only entreat-
ing that I would come and pay them a visit before starting. As
soon as I received their letter I placed it in the hands of Mr.
Crank, who seemed well pleased.
"You will not have cause to regret going, as far as we are
concerned," he observed; "as for the rest, we must leave that to
Providence."
Harry and I had, of course, been very often on board vessels,
and made several trips down the Mersey, returning in the pilot-

boat, but neither of us had ever been at sex It was necessary
that we should both see the cargo stowed, and be acquainted
with the contents of every bale. As soon as it was stowed the
brig would sail. I therefore hastened over to the neighbourhood
of Chester to pay my promised visit to my family. "I shall be
gone only five or six months," I said cheerfully, fully believing
that such would be the case. "I will take good care of myself,
depend upon that. I won't trust the black fellows, and will never
sleep on shore."
On my return I found the vessel nearly ready to take in cargo.
Harry and I were employed from morning until night in the
warehouse, examining and noting the goods. We then both went
on board, one remaining on deck to book them as they were
hoisted in, the other going below to see them stowed away, so
that we might know where each bale and package was to be
found. Captain Magor was also on board assisting us, as were
his two mates, Tom Sherwin and Ned Capstick, both rough,
honest hands, as far as I could judge, who had been chosen by
the master simply because they were good seamen and bold
fellows in whom he could trust. While we stood by, notebooks
in hand, it was their business to stow away the various packages;
and as we were together many hours every day, we became pretty
well acquainted before we sailed. We had a few hours left after
the cargo was on board and the hatches fastened down.
I should have said I had made all the inquiries I could for
Captain Roderick, but could hear nothing of him, nor did he
ever come near Mr. Crank's house after he knew I saw him
waiting at the door. I had another reason for supposing that
he had gone. Mr. Trunnion had regained his usual spirits, and
looked as cheerful as he did before his brother's appearance.
"You have acted discreetly, Westerton," said Mr. Trunnion to
me one day when I was alone with him in his private room.
"Whether Captain Magor was right or not in the fearful accu-
sation he brought against that unhappy man, I know not. The

'Vulture' has, I trust, long since sailed. I wish you to under-
stand that, although she was once our vessel, she does not now
belong to us, and I need not say how I fear she is employed."
I was pleased to receive this commendation from my principal.
I merely replied that I hoped to be always able to give him satis-
faction in whatever way he might be pleased to employ me. He
shook hands with me warmly on parting. "You will receive full
written directions from the firm for your guidance while on the
coast, and I hope that we shall see you and Bracewell back again
well and hearty in a few months with a full cargo. I have great
confidence in Captain Magor, into whose character, since he
went to sea, we have made minute inquiries, and you will find
him a bold and sagacious seaman, and an obliging and agreeable
companion."
Before I left the counting-house, Mr. Swab called me into his
little den, into which he was wont to retire whenever he had any
private business to transact, although he generally sat in the outer
office, that he might keep an eye on the clerks and see that there
was no idling.
"My dear boy," he said in a kind tone, "I have had a talk
with Harry, and now I want to speak with you, and I'll say to
you what I said to him : Work together with a will; do not let
the slightest feeling of jealousy spring up between you, and give
and take. If he is right one time, you'll be ready to follow him
the next; while, if your opinion proves correct, he will be ready to
follow you. I am sure you will both act as you consider best for
the interest of the firm; and remember there is One above who
sees you, and you must do nothing which He disapproves of—
your conscience will tell you that . You are to be engaged in a
lawful traffic. If carried on fairly, it must of necessity tend to
advance the interest of the Africans. We did them harm enough
formerly when we were engaged in the slave trade, although I for
one didn't see it at the time, and was entirely ignorant of the
horrors it inflicted on the unfortunate natives. If I thought at

all, I thought they exchanged barbarism for civilisation; and what
are called the horrors of the middle passage were not so great in
those days as they are now, when the traffic has become unlawful.
We had roomy vessels, the slaves were well fed and looked after;
and the master had no fear of being chased by a man-of-war, so
that they could wait in harbour when the weather was threaten-
ing, and run across the Atlantic with a favourable breeze. You
will very likely see something of the business, and hear more of it
while you are up the rivers; but you must in no way interfere,
either to help a slaver by supplying her with goods, provisions,
or water, or by giving information to the man-of-war of her where-
abouts, unless the question is asked, and you will then tell the
truth. And now about your personal conduct. You must do
all you can to keep your health. Be strictly sober. Do not
expose yourself to the heat by day nor to the damp air by night,
which is, I understand, more likely to prove injurious than even
the sun's rays. Never lose your temper with the natives, or any
one else, for that matter; and, from what I can learn, you are often
likely to be tried. Many people fancy they show their spirit by
losing their temper; in reality they always give an opponent an
advantage over them, and the negroes are quick enough to
perceive that . Do not imagine them fools because they do not
understand your language. Indeed, I might say, as a golden rule,
never hold too cheap the person with whom you are bargaining
or an enemy with whom you are engaged in fighting. You will,
of course, be very exact in all your accounts, and endeavour to
obtain such information as you possibly can from all directions
likely to prove of further use to the firm. Now, my dear boy,
farewell. I pray that you and Harry may be protected from the
dangers to which you will be exposed."
The worthy man said much more to the same purpose. The
"Arrow" had, in the meantime, hauled out into the stream, and
Harry and I went on board that evening, as she was to sail at
daybreak, the tide being fair, the next morning. Mrs. Eracewell

and Mary accompanied us, very naturally wishing to see the last
of us ; and just as we were setting out, Lucy Crank arrived, greatly
to Harry's satisfaction.
"Papa did not object to my going, and I thought that Mrs.
Bracewell and Mary would require some one to cheer them up,"
she said.
Mrs. Bracewell smiled, for Lucy did not look as if she was very
well capable of doing that . She had evidently been crying,
although she had done her best to dry her tears.
Just as we were at the water's edge, Mr. Swab joined us, remark-
ing as he did so, " My partners are not able to come. I wanted
to have a few more words with Captain Magor, so that I shall
have the satisfaction of escorting you ladies back." I suspected
that, in the kindness of his heart, the latter was his chief object.
"Thank you," said Mrs. Bracewell; "we shall be glad of your
protection. We wish to see Harry's and Mr. Westerton's cabin,
and the brig, now that she is ready for sea, so that we may picture
them to ourselves when they are far away." •
The evening was serene, the water smooth as glass, the
slight breeze blowing down the river, being insufficient to enable
us to stem the flood tide, which had then begun to make up,
or we should at once have sailed. Boats were plying backwards
and forwards between the shore and the various vessels which
lay in that much-frequented river. Some, like the "Arrow," ready
for sea ; others only just arrived, or taking cargo on board from
lighters. They were either bound to or had come from all parts
of the world, the African traders perhaps predominating; but there
were not a few either going to or coming from the West Indies,
with which Liverpool had a considerable commerce. There were
South Sea whalers, high black vessels, with boats hoisted up on
either side, and fast-sailing craft running up the Mediterranean,
besides innumerable coasters. Indeed, Liverpool had become a
successful rival of Bristol, hitherto the chief commercial port of
the kingdom.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
The ladies were well pleased with our little berths off the main
cabin, for Captain Magor had done his best to make them com-
fortable. The cabin was well fitted, with a mahogany table, a
sofa at the upper end, and two easy-chairs. A swinging lamp
was suspended above us, while the bulkhead in the fore part was
ornamented with muskets, pistols, and cutlasses ranged in
symmetrical order. The brig carried seven guns, three on each
side, and one long gun, which could be trained fore or aft to serve
as a bow or stern chaser, while all told she had thirty hands,
besides Harry and me; so that we were well able to cope with
any ordinary enemy we were likely to meet with, either pirate or
Frenchman, Spaniard or Hollander. The captain had prepared
tea on board, or rather supper. Mr. Swab did his best to keep
up the spirits of the party—which poor Lucy certainly failed in
doing—by telling stories or cracking jokes, though he soon gave
up the attempt when he saw none of us responded. Indeed, I
must confess that both his jokes and stories were stale, and it
might-be added "flat and unprofitable." They did not flow
naturally from him. At length he discovered that the time was
passing on; the shades of evening were already stealing over the
broad surface of the magnificent stream. The boat belonging to
the firm had hauled up alongside, and Harry and I helped the
ladies into her, Mr. Swab following, and giving each of us a hearty
shake of the hand. As the boat rowed away they waved an
adieu with their handkerchiefs, which before they were out of
sight all three applied to their eyes, and even then I could dis-
tinguish Mr. Swab frequently blowing his nose with his scarlet
bandana.
Neither Harry nor I slept very soundly; we had too much to
think about to allow "nature's soft nurse," as the poet calls it, to
visit our eyelids.
The boatswain's call roused up all hands. Quickly dressing,
we were on deck. The dawn was just breaking in the eastern sky,
from which direction there came a gentle breeze. The pilot was

on board, the anchor hove up, the tide was making down, sail
after sail was set, and just as there was light sufficient to enable us
to see our way, the brig, under a cloud of white canvas, was stand-
ing down the Mersey.
"God bless you all! A prosperous voyage, and a safe and happy
return!" was uttered by the pilot, as, having seen us clear of the
sandbanks at the mouth of the river, he lowered himself into
his boat and paddled off to his cutter, which had accompanied us.
We were now left to our own resources, and before evening we
were standing down the Irish Channel with a brisk breeze on the
larboard tack.

HARRY and I socn got our sea-legs, for although when we
sailed the weather was fine, before we were well clear of
the Irish Channel it began to blow fresh, and a heavy sea ran,
which tumbled the vessel about not a little. We both quickly
made the acquaintance of the officers and crew, for we did not
consider it beneath our dignity as supercargoes to talk to our ship-
mates of lower rank. We were well repaid by the confidence
they bestowed upon us, and the histories of their lives and ad-
ventures which they narrated. Although rough in their ways, they
possessed many of the best qualities in human nature. The mates
were, as I before said, good steady men, fair navigators, who could
be trusted on all occasions, and had been chosen for these quali-
fications by Captain Magor, to whom they had long been known.
Our chief friend was Tom Tubbs, the boatswain. Tom would
have risen to a higher rank, but he was destitute of the accom-
plishments of reading and writing, though having to some purpose

studied the book of nature, he possessed more useful knowledge
than many of his fellow-men. He, like Tom Bowling, was the
darling of the crew; for although he wielded his authority with a
taut hand, he could be lenient when he thought it advisable, and
was ever ready to do a kind action to any of his shipmates. He
could always get them to do anything he wanted; for, instead of
swearing at them, he used endearing expressions, such as "My
loves," "Mydear boys," "Mycharminglads." Thus,"Mydarlings,"
he would sing out, "be smart in handling that foretop-gallant-
sail," or "Take down two reefs in the topsails, my cherubs," or
when setting studding-sails, he would sing out, " Haul away, my
angels," or again, when shortening sail, " Clew up—haul down, my
lovely dears." He varied his expressions, however, according to
the urgency of the case. If more speed was required, the more
endearing were his words. I won't undertake to say that he did
not sometimes rap out words of a very different signification, but
that was only in extreme cases, when all others seemed to fail, or
he had exhausted his vocabulary; but the men did not mind it a
bit, for it only showed them that they must exert all their strength
and activity if the masts were to be saved or the ship preserved
from capsizing, or any other catastrophe prevented. The men
were well aware of the motive which induced him to use strong
expressions. We had two black men, who, having long served on
board merchant vessels, spoke English pretty well. One of them,
called Quambo, acted as steward; the other, Sambo, being ship's
cook, spent a good portion of his time in the caboose, from
which he carried on a conversation on either side with the men
who happened to be congregated there. He, as well as Quambo,
had to do duty as a seaman, and active fellows they were, as good
hands as any of the crew. Sambo, besides his other accomplish-
ments, could play the fiddle, and in calm weather the merry tones
of his instrument would set all the crew dancing, making even
Tom Tubbs shuffle about out of sight of the officers; for it would
have been derogatory, he considered, to have been seen thus con-

ducting himself in public. We had an Irishman, a Scotchman,
three Fins, and a Portuguese, who was generally known as "Porting-
gall." The captain and the rest were Englishmen, two of whom
had seen better days. One had been a schoolmaster and the
other a lawyer's clerk. There was also a runaway from home of
gentle birth, but who had so long mixed with rough characters,
that not a trace of the good manners he once possessed remained
by him.
We had got into the latitude of the Cape de Verde islands, and
were looking out for the African coast, the wind being about east,
when about two hours after noon the lookout at the mast-
head shouted, "A sail in sight on the larboard bow."
On hearing this, the first mate, with a glass slung over his
shoulder, went aloft to have a look at the stranger. He was some-
time there, and when he returned on deck I thought by his coun-
tenance that he did not like her appearance.
"She's ship rigged, going free, and standing this way, sir," he
said to the captain; "and if we keep on our present course she
will be within hail of us within a couple of hours at furthest. She
may be a man-of-war cruiser, or an enemy's privateer, or an honest
trader j but were she that, I don't see why she should be standing
this way, unless she thinks the wind will shift, and she wishes to
get a good offing from Cape de Verde. Or else she may be
one of the picarooning craft which we have heard of on this
coast, although it has never been my ill luck to fall in with
them."
"But it has been mine; and though I had the good fortune to
get clear of the rascal, I never wish to meet with one of her class
again; and so, in case yonder craft should be of that character, or
an enemy's privateer, we shall do well to stand clear of her," said
Captain Magor; "and although we may lose a day or two, that
will be better than running the risk of being captured or sent to
the bottom. All hands make sail—up with the helm—square
away the yards. Rig out the studding-sail booms, Mr. Sher-

win," he added, addressing the first mate as soon as the ship was
before the wind.
The boatswain sounded his whistle. "Be smart there, my
sweet lads," he cried out. "Haul away, my lovely cherubs, on the
starboard studding-sail halyards. Belay all that, my charmers;"
and so he went on whistling and shouting, until we had studding-
sails extended below and aloft on either side, and both royals set,
and were running along at the rate of some seven or eight knots
an hour before a light breeze.
Harry and I on all occasions lent a hand when we thought
we could be of use, and Tom did not fail to bestow his approving
remarks upon us. The first mate now went aloft to ascertain
whether the stranger had again altered her course, or whether she
was standing on as before, in which case we hoped to run her out
of sight, when we could again haul on the wind. He remained
some time aloft . When he came down he looked even graver
than before.
"It is as I feared, sir. The fellow has clapped on all sail and
is standing after us. It is a question which has the fastest pair
of heels. If we can keep well ahead until nightfall, we may
then alter our course and get clear of her."
"Perhaps, after all, she is only a British man-of-war, which
takes us for a slaver, or perhaps for an enemy's cruiser; for the
'Arrow,' I flatter myself, doesn't look like an ordinary trader,"
observed Captain Magor.
"That may be, sir," answered the mate, "but we are doing the
wisest thing to keep out of her way; and, as you said, it's better to
do that and lose a day or two, than be snapped up by an enemy."
The captain ordered all hands to remain on deck at their
stations, ready to shorten sail at a moment's notice. I saw him
frequently look astern, not so much at the stranger as at the ap-
pearance of the clouds.
"Do you think she is coming up with us, Captain Magor?" I
asked.


## p. 32 (#62) ##############################################

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"No doubt about that, though she is carrying less sail than
we are. She has got a stronger breeze, and I am watching lest
the wind should come down on us harder than our sticks can
stand."
A few minutes afterwards, as I moved to the fore part of the
quarter-deck, where the boatswain was standing, the captain cried
out, "All hands shorten sail."
In an instant Tom's whistle was at his mouth, and didn't he
stamp and shout.
"In with the studding-sails, my lovely lads; let fly top-gallant
sheets, my sweet angels. Haul down, trice up, my pretty boys."
Though what between the orders issued by the captain and mates,
and repeated by him, with the howling of the wind and the
whistling of his shrill pipe, the rattling and creaking of the blocks,
and the fluttering of the sails, it was difficult for ears unnautical to
comprehend the actual words uttered. All to me seemed hubbub
and confusion. The men flew here and there, some going aloft,
while others came tramping along the deck with the ropes. Even
Captain Magor and the mates were pulling and hauling. Harry
and I caught hold of the ropes they gave us, and ran along with
them to gather in the fluttering canvas, which seemed as if it
would be blown to shreds before it could be secured. As it was,
a foreroyal was carried away and a studding-sail boom was snapt
off. Before we had time to stow the lighter canvas the squall
came down thick and strong on us. The order was given to clew
up the courses and take a reef in the topsails. The wind, though
coming off the land, quickly beat the ocean into wild tossing
waves, through which the brig dashed forward with lessened sail,
yet still with increased speed. A thick misty appearance, caused
by a fine impalpable sand brought off the land by the squall, soon
hid the stranger from sight.
"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good," observed the mate;
"and I hope we shall be in luck, and get out of the way of that
fellow; I don't like his looks, that I don't."

A HEAVY SQUALL.
33
What Captain Magor thought about the matter he did not say.
He kept the brig away, running as before, which showed that he
considered the stranger was still in pursuit of us. Harry and 1
looked out for her, but she was nowhere to be seen.
"Perhaps the squall took her unawares and carried away hei
masts; if so, and she is an enemy, we may thank the wind for
the service it has rendered us," observed the first mate.
"There's little chance of that, I fear," said Captain Magor.
"When it clears up again we shall see her all ataunto, or I am
much mistaken."
We all continued looking out anxiously over the tafTrail, while
the brig ploughed her way through the fast rising seas, which
hissed and foamed around her.
The captain paced the deck, now looking aft, now aloft, waiting
for the moment when he could venture to make sail again. The
men stood with their hands on the halyards, ready to hoist away
at the expected order, for all on board knew the importance of
keeping ahead of the stranger should she be what we suspected.
Still the atmosphere remained charged with dust off the coast,
which, as the rays of the sun fell upon it, assumed a yellowish
hije. At any moment, however, it might dissolve, and already it
had sunk lower than when it first came on. Before long we had
evidence that the captain's surmise was correct, for just over the
thick bank astern we caught sight through our glasses of a fine
perpendicular line against the sky, which he asserted were the
royal masts of the stranger, with the royals still furled. If he was
right—and of that there appeared little doubt—she must have
gained rapidly on us. The best we could hope for was that the
mist would continue until nightfall and shroud us from her sight.
The setting sun, it should be understood, cast its light upon her
masts, while ours were still in the shade. We were doomed, how-
ever, to disappointment; suddenly the mist cleared off, and the
bright rays of the sun exposed to view the topsails and courses
of our pursuer.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"We may still keep ahead of her, and when night comes on
give her the slip," observed Captain Magor ; " if not, we will fight
her. The men, I hope, will stand to their guns, and show that
they are British seamen. It will be a disgrace to knock under to
piratical villains, such as I fear are the crew of yonder craft."
"The men are staunch, I'll answer for that," observed Mr.
Serwin. "Tubbs has had a talk with them to try their tempers,
and he is as true a fellow as ever stepped."
"That he is ; and if you and I and the second mate should be
killed, he will fight the ship as long as a stick is standing," answered
the first mate, showing his appreciation of the boatswain's charac-
ter. Harry and I, as we walked the deck, agreed that we would
fight to the last, though we heartily wished that we might escape
the stern necessity. Before long the captain shouted—
"Shake out the reefs in the fore-topsail, my lads."
The topmen flew aloft and the sail was hoisted. Soon after-
wards the captain gave the order to set the foretop-gallant-
sail.
"We must get preventer braces on it," he observed to the first
mate; " it won't do to run the risk of carrying away the spar."
The additional ropes were quickly secured by the active crew.
As they stood aft watching the sail, it seemed as if at any moment
it would carry away the mast and spar, as, bulging out with the
strong breeze, it strained and tugged in its efforts to free itself,
but the sticks were tough and the ropes which held them sound,
and with increased speed the brig flew before the gale. Two of
the best hands were at the wheel, for any carelessness in steering
might in an instant have produced a serious disaster. The effects
of the additional sail were satisfactory, as the stranger was no
longer gaining on us, as she had hitherto done. Still, as I felt
the violent blows given by the seas, now on one quarter, now on
the other, the brig now pitching into a hollow ahead, now rising
rapidly over another sea, then rolling from side to side, I feared
that the masts must be jerked out of her. Harry and I found it

scarcely possible to walk the deck without being tossed about
like shuttlecocks, so that our only resource was to hold fast to
the stanchions, or, when we wanted to move, to catch hold of
the bulwarks. As night approached, however, the wind began to
decrease, and the sea, having no great distance to run, went down.
Whether this was likely to be an advantage to us or not was now
to be proved. As the last rays of the sun ere he set glanced
horizontally across the ocean, they fell on the stranger's canvas
down to the foot of her courses. Still our stout-hearted captain
did not despair.
"We will do what we can to give the fellow the go-by, and may
outwit him, clever as he thinks himself," he said, laughing. "Aloft
there, and set the fore-royal," he shouted; and this being done,
the foretopmast studding-sails were again rigged out, thus exhibit-
ing a broad sheet of canvas to the eyes of our pursuer, which
would probably make him suppose that we intended to continue
our course directly before the wind. The sun had now sunk, but
we could yet distinguish through the fast gathering gloom the
sail astern. Captain Magor now ordered the mainsail to be hauled
out, and the main-topsail and maintop-gallant-sail to. be set . By
the time this was done, not even the outlines of the stranger could
be perceived astern.
"Take in studdin'-sails," cried the captain.
These by the united efforts of the crew, wildly fluttering, were
hauled down without a spar being lost. The fore-royal was then
furled. "Starboard the helm," was the next order given. "Haul
on the starboard fore and main braces," he then sang out, and the
brig was brought to the wind on the larboard tack. No sooner
did she feel its power, as the yards were braced sharp up, the
tacks hauled down, and the braces and bowlines sheeted home,
than she heeled over to the force of the wind, which was still con-
siderable, although it did not appear so when we were running
before it
.
"If the stranger does not discover our change of course, she

will be well away to leeward before morning, and we shall see no
more of her," said Captain Magor, addressing Harry and me. "I
don't want to expose the lives of you young gentlemen to danger,
or to risk the loss of our cargo. I daresay you felt not a little
anxious, but you may turn in and sleep soundly, with the prospect
of making the coast of Africa in another day or two at furthest
.
We will have some food first though, for you have been on deck
ever since dinner; you'll be hungry. Quambo!" he shouted,
"let's have some supper on table as soon as possible."
"Him dare 'ready, captain," answered the black steward, " only
wait de young gen'lemen to cut him."
The captain, leaving the deck in charge of the first mate, de-
scended with us,and didample justice to the plentiful meal Quambo
had spread on the table. The captain, before going on deck again,
advised us to turn in. We were, however, too anxious to do so,
notwithstanding his assertions that all was likely to go well, and
we therefore soon joined him on deck. We found him looking
out over the larboard quarter, the direction in which the stranger
was most likely to be seen. Although we swept the ocean with
our glasses round two-thirds of the horizon, she was nowhere
visible. At length, trusting that the captain really was right, with
our minds tolerably relieved, we went below and turned into our
berths. Still, though I slept, I could not get the thought of the
pirate out of my mind. I dreamed that I was again on deck, and
that I saw our pursuer, like some monster of the deep, her canvas
towering high above our own towards the sky, close to us. Then
she poured forth her broadsides, her shot with a crashing, rending
sound passing across our deck. Still we remained unharmed, and
I heard the captain say, "Give it them again, my lads—give it
them again." Our crew sprung to their guns; but there came
another broadside from the enemy which carried away our masts
and spars, pierced our bulwarks, knocking our boats to pieces.
Still Harry and I stood on deck uninjured, and our crew appeared
as undaunted and active as before. I have often heard of people

THE STRANGER IN SIGHT AGAIN. 37
"fighting their battles o'er again;" but in this instance I fought
mine before it occurred. I was awakened by the stamping sound
of the feet of the watch overhead as they ran along with the hal-
yards; then came the cry, "All hands on deck." I jumped out of
my berth, and found Harry slipping into his clothes. No one else
was in the cabin., We hurried on deck, where the officers and the
watch below with the idlers had assembled. I was surprised to
find the brig once more before the wind and the crew engaged in
making all sail. The captain was standing aft issuing his orders,
while the mates and boatswain were aiding the men in pulling and
hauling. We joined them without asking questions. Some of the
crew were aloft setting the top-gallant-sails and royals. I wondered
why this was done, but there was no time to ask questions. At
last, all the sail the brig could carry was set. I then, having
nothing further to do, went aft and asked the captain the reason
of the change of course.
"If you look astern you will see it," he said.
Shading my eyes with my hand, I gazed into the darkness, and
there I at length discovered what the more practised eyes of the
captain had long seen—the shadowy form of the stranger coming
up under all sail towards us.
"You see now why we have kept away," observed the captain.
"Before the wind is our fastest point of sailing, and I wish that we
had kept on it from the first . That fellow out there must have
hauled his wind soon after we lost sight of him."
"Do you think she will come up with us? " I asked.
"There is a great likelihood that she will," answered the cap-
tain ; "but a stern chase is a long chase, as every one knows.
Perhaps we may fall in with a man-of-war cruiser, when the
tables will be turned; if not, as I said before, we must fight
her."
"With all my heart," I answered; and Harry echoed my words.
The stranger had by this time approached much nearer to us
than before, or we should have been unable to see her. We

could thus no longer hope for an opportunity of escaping by
altering our course.
"It is my duty to stand on as long as I can, to give ourselves
every chance of meeting with another craft, which may take a
part in the game," observed the captain. "At all events, it will
be daylight before we get within range of her guns, and you
young gentlemen may as well turn in in the meantime and finish
your night's rest."
Neither I nor Harry had any inclination, however, to do this.
The dream I had had still haunted my imagination, and I felt
pretty sure that were I to go to sleep it would come back as
vividly as before. Stepping into the waist, I found Mr. Tubbs,
the boatswain.
"Well, Tom, what do you think about the matter?" I asked.
"Shall we have a brush with yonder craft which seems so anxious
to make our acquaintance?"
"No doubt about it, Mr. Westerton, and more than a brush too,
I suspect. That ship out there is a big fellow, and will prove a
tough customer. We shall have to show the stuff we are made of,
and fight hard to beat him off. I don't say but that we shall do
it, but it will cost us dearly; for his people, we may be sure, know
how to handle their guns; and from the height of his canvas I
should say that he was twice our size, and probably carries double
as many guns as we do, and musters three or four times more
men."
"Then I'm afraid that we shall have but a poor chance of beat-
ing him off," I observed.
"There are always chances in war, and one of them may be in
our favour; so it is our business to fight hard to the end. A happy
shot may knock away his masts and render him helpless, or
enter his magazine and blow him up; or we may send half a
dozen of our pills between wind and water, and compel him to
keep all hands at the pumps, so that he will have no time to look
after us."

PROSPECT OF A BATTLE.

"But the same may happen to us," observed Harry.
"Granted; those belong to the chances of war," answered Tom.
* I was only speaking of those in our favour. We must not think
of the others; if the worst comes to the worst, we can but go to
the bottom with our colours flying, as many pretty men have had
to do before."
On the whole, Tom's remarks did not greatly increase our
spirits. Harry and I walked aft together.
"One of us may fall, Dick," said Harry to me in a grave tone.
"If I do, you will carry my last fond love to my mother and
sister and poor Lucy, and say that my last thoughts were about
them."
"That I will," I answered. "And should I fall and you escape,
you will see my parents, and tell your mother and sister Mary
how to the last moment of my life I thought of them—how grateful
I am for all their kindness to me."
The expressions we exchanged were but natural to young men
who were about to engage for the first time in their lives in a
desperate battle—for desperate we knew it must be, even should
we come off victorious, if the stranger astern was, as we supposed,
a pirate. We paced the deck together. The suspense we were
doomed to undergo was more trying than when we were engaged
in making or shortening sail, and the gale was blowing and the
vessel tumbling about
.
Now we were gliding calmly on, with nothing to do except
occasionally to take a look astern at our expected enemy. I
began to long for daylight, and wished even to see the stranger
come up within shot, so that we might ascertain to a certainty
her true character. At length a ruddy glow appeared beyond her
in the east, gradually increasing in depth and brightness until the
whole sky was suffused with an orange tint, and the sun, like a
vast ball of fire, rose rapidly above the horizon, forming a glowing
background to the sails of our pursuer, who came gliding along
over the shining ocean towards us. Already she was almost

within range of our long gun, which the captain now ordered to
be trained aft through one of the stern-ports. The gun was loaded
and run out.
"Shall I fire, sir?" asked Tom Tubbs, who acted as gunner as
well as boatswain, running his eye along the piece.
"Not until we can see her flag," answered the captain; "she
may, after all, be a man-of-war. If we fire she may take us for a
pirate, and we should get small credit for our bravery. We shall
see her colours presently if she yaws to fire at us. Wait until I give
the word."
In the meantime the magazine had been opened and powder
and shot brought up on deck; the guns were loaded and run
out, the arm-chest was also got up, and Harry and I, as did all
on board, girded hangers to our sides and thrust pistols into
our belts.
The captain shortly afterwards issued the order for all hands to
be ready to shorten sail as soon as no chance remained of escaping
without fighting. Even now there was a hope that we might get
away, or that the stranger might after all prove a friend instead
of a foe; every rope was therefore kept belayed. "Long Tom,"
as the boatswain called his gun, was run out, it should be under-
stood, under the poop on which Harry and I stood. The captain
had taken his post near the mizen rigging, so that he could see all
parts alike, and his voice could be heard by Tom and the crew of
the gun below him.
The mates were at their stations ready to shorten sail. I had
my spyglass turned towards our pursuer, endeavouring to get a
glimpse of her flag should she have hoisted one, which she very
certainly would have done were she a King's ship. As I watched
her, I could see that she was gaining upon us. Objects which at
first appeared indistinct were now clearly visible. I could make
out the men on the forecastle, but I saw no gun there with which
she could return the compliment our " Long Tom" was about to
pay her. So far this was satisfactory.

THE STRANGER FIRES AT US.
4*
"Were she a King's ship she would have fired a gun without
altering her course, as a signal for us to heave to," observed the
captain.
Scarcely had he spoken than the stranger yawed—a gun was
fired, and a shot came towards us, striking the water and sinking
close under our counter. At the same moment, raising my glass, I
caught sight of the British ensign flying from the end of the peak.
"Hurrah!" I exclaimed; "she's a King's ship, and we are all
right."
"We must not be too sure of that," observed Harry; "pirates
can hoist false colours. We want better proof of her honesty
before we heave to. Had she been well disposed, she would not
have sent that iron messenger after us."
For some time longer the "Arrow" stood on her course, while
the stranger, keeping directly astern, did not alter hers. I
expected every moment to hear our captain give the word to
fire, but he refrained from doing so. Suspicious as was the
behaviour of our pursuer, still I thought it possible that, after all,
she might be a King's ship, and had shown her proper colours.
Presently, however, she yawed, her studding-sails fluttering as she
did so, being almost taken back. Two spouts of flame, followed
quickly by a couple of round shot, issued from her bow-ports.
That the shot were fired with evil intent was evident, for one
struck our larboard quarter close below where I was standing,
and knocked away the carved work, while the other, flying high,
passed close above our heads, and fell into the water not a dozen
fathoms from the ship. Before her helm could again be put
up, Captain Magor shouted, "Give it them, Tubbs," and our
"Long Tom," with a loud roar, sending forth a spout of flame,
pitched a shot right through the fore part of her bulwarks,
and I could see the splinters fly as it struck them.
"Load and fire away as fast as you can," cried the captain;
"if that's a King's ship, she fired first, and' must take the conse-
quences."

42
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
I should have felt more satisfied had I been convinced that
the captain was right, but still I could not help fancying that she
was a royal cruiser, and that we might be committing a terrible
mistake. Shot after shot was now aimed at our pursuer. Tom
Tubbs and his men hauling in and loading the gun with a
rapidity which only well-trained hands could have done. Few
of our shots—as far as I could judge—appeared to be so success-
fully aimed as the first had been. Still I heard Captain Magor
shouting out, " Well done, my lads; never saw a gun better served.
Wing her if you can; knock away her foremast, and twenty golden
guineas shall be yours."
The stranger all this time did not return our fire, for she could
not bring her foremost guns to bear without yawing, and by doing
so she would have lost ground. She was still gaining on us,
and I observed at length that she had slightly altered her course,
so as to be creeping up on our starboard quarter, though so
slightly, that at first the alteration was not perceived. Captain
Magor took two or three short turns on the poop, then suddenly
stopping, he shouted, "In with the studding-sails, send down
the royals," and presently afterwards, when this was done,
"Furl top-gallant-sails." He had evidently made up his mind
that escape was impossible, and was determined to fight the
stranger should she prove an enemy. Active as were our
crew, some minutes passed before sail was shortened, by
which time the stranger had crept up on our quarter. She
had hitherto kept all her canvas standing. We were still
running before the wind. I saw the captain give a steady look
at her.
"I know her now. She is the 'Vulture,' and we can expect
no mercy if we are taken," he exclaimed, turning to Harry and
me, his countenance exhibiting the anxiety he felt in the dis-
covery, although the next moment he spoke in the same firm tone
as usual "The men stationed at the starboard guns be ready to
fire," he cried out . "Brace the yards to larboard."

THE ACTION COMMENCES.
43
Before, however, the words were out of his mouth, the
stranger's crew were seen swarming aloft. The yards and tops
were covered with men, and with a rapidity far excelling anything
we were capable of, the studding-sails were taken in, the royals
and top-gallant-sails furled, and just as our helm was put down,
and we were about to luff across her bow, she luffed up and
let fly a broadside of ten guns in return for our three. At the
same moment, as I looked aft, expecting still to see the ensign
of Old England flying from her peak, I beheld a black piratical
flag with the death's head and cross-bones, which had evidently
been hoisted to strike terror into the hearts of our crew. At
that instant I heard the same crashing, rending sounds which
had disturbed my slumbers, as the shot tore their way through
our bulwarks, some striking the masts, others cutting away the
shrouds and knocking a boat to pieces. I saw one man fall at
the after-guns, while two more were binding handkerchiefs
round their arms, showing that they had been struck either by
shot or splinters. Having missed the opportunity of raking the
enemy, we were now placed in a disadvantageous position to
leeward. Still Captain Magor was not the man to give in. He
ordered "Long Tom" to be dragged from its present position,
and run through the foremost port.
"If the enemy have more guns than we have, we must make
amends by firing ours twice as fast as she does," he cried out in
a cheerful tone. "Cheer up, my lads. Toss the pieces in, and
give the villains more than they bargain for."
Harry and 1 hastened to one of the guns, at which three of
the crew had already been killed or disabled, and we exerted
ourselves to the utmost. I confess that I have a somewhat
confused idea of what now occurred. I was thinking only of
how I could best help in loading and running out the gun at
which I had stationed myself. All my thoughts and energies
were concentrated on that; but I remember hearing the cries
and groans of my shipmates as they were shot down, the tearing

and crashing of the shot as they struck our devoted craft, the
blocks falling from aloft, the shouts of the officers, and the
occasional cheers of the men, and seeing the ropes hanging in
festoons, the sails in tatters, wreck and confusion around us,
with wreaths of smoke. Then I remember observing the pirate
ship, which had approached us closer and closer, come with a
louder crash than any previous sounds alongside. Grapplings
were thrown on to our bulwarks, then a score or more of ruffianly
looking fellows with hangers flashing leapt down on our decks.
We fired our pistols and drew our own blades, and for a few
minutes fought with desperation; then Harry and I, with Tom
Tubbs and the captain, were borne back towards the poop,
where, as we stood for a few seconds, keeping our enemies at
bay, we saw that, overwhelmed by numbers, all hope of successful
resistance was vain. Captain Magor shouted to us to sell our
lives dearly, but just then I heard a voice exclaim, "Drop youi
weapons and you shall have your lives, for you have fought like
brave fellows." Gazing at the speaker, whom I had not before
recognised among the boarders, I beheld one whose countenance
I knew. Yes! I had no doubt about the matter, he was
Captain Roderick Trunnion. At his heels followed a huge
mastiff, who growled fiercely as his master was addressing us.
Whether or not Captain Roderick recognised Harry or me, we
neither of us could tell.
"We had better make a virtue of necessity," said the captain,
dropping his sword; and I with the rest of the party did the same,
for we could not suppose that our captors intended afterwards to
slaughter us. One of the officers of the pirate, stepping up, took
our weapons, which we handed to him; and as our assailants now
separated, apparently to plunder the vessel, the fearful condition
of our deck was exposed to view. In every direction were our
poor fellows dead or wounded, including the two mates, one of
whom had his head knocked off, while the other was cut almost
in two by a round shot. Planks were torn up where the shot had

HORRIBLE STATE OF OUR DECK.
45
ploughed their way along them; blocks, entangled ropes, shat-
tered spars, fragments of the bulwarks and boats, and pieces of
sails, were scattered about amid large splashes of blood. The
pirates, now masters of the vessel, began at once to heave the
dead overboard, several still breathing, who might have recovered,
being treated in the same way. Every moment I expected that
the miscreants would compel us to walk the plank, but for a
wonder they appeared satisfied with their victory.
Captain Trunnion did not appear to recognise us, though he
fixed his eyes on Captain Magor in a very ominous way.
"I know you," he said, approaching him ; "you once did me
a good turn by picking me out of the water. I should probably
otherwise have served for a dinner to a hungry shark close at my
heels; but you counterbalanced that by the scurvy trick you
endeavoured to play me at Liverpool. However, as no harm
was done, except that my brother was not quite so affectionate
as he might have been, I'll overlook that, and I tell you I don't
wish to have your blood or that of any other man on my hands.
Now, listen to me, and if you are a sensible person, you will
accept my offer and save your life. I happen to have no one on
board whom I can spare capable of navigating the vessel. I
intend to put a prize-crew on board this craft, and leave you some
of your own men, and if you take her and them safe into the
Sherbro River, you shall have your liberty and go wherever you
like after the vessel has sailed. I must send a man on board to
act as mate who will stand no nonsense. If you prove true, he'll
be civil; but if not, you may expect to have your brains blown
out at a moment's notice. You understand me?"
• I watched Captain Magor's countenance, to judge whether he
would accept the offer or not. I hoped that he would do so, and
that we should be allowed to accompany him. He placed his
hand on his brow as he paced several times up and down the
deck.
"I accept your offer,"-he. said at length. He did not, I

remarked, address Captain Roderick by his proper name. "You
will, I hope, allow my two passengers to accompany me, and the
boatswain, who, although not a navigator, is a first-rate seaman,
and will be of great assistance to me."
"No, no, my friend. I intend these two young gentlemen,
who, by the way they fought, have shown themselves to be fine
spirited fellows, to accompany me; and the character you give
of the boatswain makes me wish to have him on board my craft,
where, to tell you the truth, I have not got too many able sea-
men. You may consider yourself very fortunate at being allowed
the privilege I offer you, so say no more about the matter."
These remarks destroyed the hopes Harry and I had enter-
tained that we might get free of the pirate and erelong obtain
our liberty. Poor Tubbs looked very much cast down. Knowing
him well, I was sure he was not a man who would join with the
pirates, although Captain Roderick might employ every means
to win him over. We were not long left in suspense as to our
fate.
"Now, my lads," exclaimed the pirate captain, addressing
Harry and me, "make your way on board my ship, and you
follow them," he added turning to Tubbs.
We had just time to shake hands with Captain Magor, whose
countenance showed the sorrow and anxiety he felt, when, at a
sign from Captain Roderick, several of his men seized us by the
shoulders, and hurried us on board the " Vulture." Tubbs then,
giving an involuntary shrug of his shoulders, as if resigned to his
fate, followed us; the savage growls of the dog making us dread
that he would seize one of us by the leg, and so I have no doubt
that he would have done at a sign from his master. The deck
of the pirate presented much the same scene as did that of the
"Arrow." Our shot had done no little damage to the hull and
rigging, while several of her crew were dead or dying. Their
shipmates were in the act of heaving the bodies overboard,
although they did not treat those who were still breathing as they

47
did our poor fellows. A few of them, more compassionate than
the rest, were endeavouring to staunch the blood flowing from
the limbs and sides of the wounded men. Harry, Tubbs, and I,
finding that no one interfered with us, knelt down beside three
of the men who were unable to move on the after part of the
deck. The wretched beings were crying out for help and mercy.
Two of them were evidently suffering fearfully from thirst
.
"I'll get some water; it will do them good," said Tubbs, and
making his way to a water-cask which stood on deck, from which
he filled a tin mug, he brought it back to the men. They all
drank eagerly, one of them, however, in the very act, fell back
and expired. The others cast a look at their shipmate. Such
might be their fate. "Take him away," groaned one of them. "I
cannot help casting my eyes on him, and he is terrible to look
upon." In truth, the man's countenance, distorted with pain, bore
a horrible expression. We dragged the body forward, that his
shipmates might dispose of it as they thought fit . We were so
eagerly engaged in attending to the wounded men, that we did
not observe that the vessels had been cast loose from each other,
and that Captain Roderick had returned on board. We were
aroused by hearing his voice issuing orders to his crew to make
sail. We cast a look over the bulwarks, where we saw the
"Arrow," from which we were greatly increasing our distance,
her people busily employed in repairing damages, knotting and
splicing the running rigging, getting fresh yards across, and bend-
ing new sails. The work was still going on when the "Vulture,"
having made sail and steering to the south-east, ran her out of
sight

of our having attended to the wounded.
"We have no doctor on board, and you and your friends may
look after those fellows, and try to patch them up," said the
pirate captain to me the day after the action. "1 cannot spare the
boatswain, as he is wanted to do duty as a seaman. Remember
that I might have clapped you down in the cable tier, or, had I
chosen, made you walk the plank, as many have done before ; but
I don't want to have the deaths of more men than I can help at
my door, even though I run the risk of losing my life in conse-
quence of my leniency."
"We will continue to look after the wounded as long as we
are able," I answered. I thought it prudent not to expend any
thanks on him, for which he would not have cared, nor to show
any very great satisfaction at being left at liberty, as he might have
suspected that we were contemplating plans for our escape, nor

49
would he have been far off the truth. Harry and I, when we
were certain that no one was listening, had discussed the matter,
intending to let Tom Tubbs into our plan, and invite him to join
us. At present, however, we had no means of holding communica-
tion with him. He was sent forward, while we remained either on
the quarter-deck, or in a sort of cockpit to which the wounded had
been carried. It was a dark, close place, its only advantage being
that it was out of the way of shot in action. In the course of a
few hours, death removed all but six of our patients and Harry
and I had enough to do to attend to them. They were groan-
ing and complaining all day long, and constantly calling out for
liquor, though, when we supplied them with water instead, they drank
it greedily, sometimes fancying that it was what they had asked for.
We kept them constantly supplied with liquid, which, although
often hot and tepid, appeared like nectar to their fevered lips.
No one interfered with us. How the poor fellows would have
fared had they been left to themselves I know not, but I suspect
that they would have been allowed to suffer with very little com-
miseration felt for them. Still all this time our position was far
from comfortable. I was doubtful how Captain Roderick might
treat Harry. I had no doubt that he knew who he was, though he
had never addressed him by name; indeed, after having spoken to
us about the wounded men, he took no further notice of us, allow-
ing us to take our food in the cockpit, and to sleep in a couple of
hammocks which were slung there, which had belonged to two of
the men who had been killed. We had to do everything for our-
selves, the seamen being either surly to us or rude. Harry and I
separately, on two different occasions, endeavoured to speak to
Tubbs, but a man immediately stepped up and asked us what we
wanted, he having, I suppose, been directed by the Captain to
watch us and Tubbs, to see that we held no communication, while
Growler—for so we found that the captain's dog was called—came
snuffing and growling round and round us, ready to fall to and
tear us to pieces at the word of command. We fortunately had

fine weather as we continued our voyage towards the Bight of
Biafara, for which we were bound. All this time we did not lose
the hope of falling in with a British man-of-war by which we might
be rescued. Day after day passed by, but not a sail hove in
sight. That Captain Roderick thought such might be the case
seemed probable, as he was constantly on the watch, and exercis-
ing his men both at the guns, and with small arms and cutlasses;
and I felt certain that, sooner than surrender, he would fight to the
last, and then blow up the ship. It appeared to me that he had
become more desperate than he had been when he last paid a visit
to Liverpool. Indeed, he must have known that he could never again
show his face there, should either Harry or I, or Captain Magor, or
the boatswain, find our way back. Probably, however, he counted
on our never doing so. It was not a pleasant feeling to know that
he might consider his interest advanced by effectually preventing
us from again seeing our native land. The wounded men made
fair progress towards recovery under our care, but when not
attending them, Harry and I found time hang very heavily on our
hands. We had no books, and were afraid of conversing except
on indifferent subjects, for fear of being overheard. Even the
men we were attending might betray us should we say anything
at which the captain might take offence. Our life was therefore, as
may be supposed, anything but a pleasant one. We went on deck
occasionally very early in the morning or after sunset, when the
shades of night prevented our being observed, and generally man-
aged to get a few turns together to stretch our legs and breathe
the fresh air; for had we always remained in the close hold,
I do not suppose that we could have retained our health. Our
chief amusement was endeavouring to win our way into the good
graces of Growler, and gradually we succeeded in doing so, though
we of course took good care not to let it be seen that we were on
friendly terms with him. We were very thankful when at length,
early one morning, we heard the cry from the look-out at the mast
head—


## p. 51 (#85) ##############################################

OFF THE BAR.
51
"Land, oh!"
Both Harry and I felt a strong impulse to run aloft and have
a look at it, but this we dared not do. It was some time, therefore,
before we saw the shore from the deck. We could then make
out a line of mangrove-trees, with blue hills rising to a consider-
able height in the distance. The mangrove-trees marked the
entrance of the river up which we were bound. We stood on
until within about four miles of the shore, when it fell a dead
calm. There the brig lay, rolling her sides in the smooth burnished
water on which she floated. We could now perceive, projecting
from among the mangrove bushes, a long spit of white sand, from
which to the opposite shore ran a line of foam, marking the bar
which we had to cross. The heat was intense, making the pitch
bubble up between the seams of the deck, while down below the
air was horribly stifling. It seemed surprising that the poor
wounded fellows could live in it; but they had got accustomed to
a close atmosphere, I suppose, and were, at all events, saved from
feeling the direct rays of the sun. The whites of the crew sought
shelter wherever a particle of shade existed, although the black
and brown men, of whom there were several, appeared indifferent
to the heat—the black cook and his mate actually sitting on the
top of the caboose and smoking their pipes, with the advantage
of a fire beneath them. I expected to see them begin to broil,
but they were evidently enjoying themselves. Thus it lasted for
a couple of hours, until the sea-breeze set in, when all sail was
instantly made, and the ship was headed up for the bar. The
breeze increased. As we got nearer we caught sight of a canoe
and half a dozen black fellows coming off to assist us. We accord-
ingly hove to, that they might be able to get up the side, when a
huge fellow in a broad-brimmed straw hat and a pair of trousers
with pink stripes came on deck, and walking up to the captain,
shook hands with him as with an old friend.
"Ah, massa cap'n, glad to see you 'gain. You take plenty
slavy—him dare all ready," and he pointed up the river.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"All right, Master Pogo. Take care that you don't put my ship
ashore though, as you did Captain Watman's. I wonder he did
not shoot you through the head for your carelessness. I wouldn't
scruple to do so, let me tell you."
Pogo grinned and shrugged his shoulders. "Me take good
care, cap'n," he answered; and stepping up to the break of the
poop, he took his post there that he might con the vessel. He
looked around him and then surveyed the shore.
"Starboard a little," he sung out. "Now steady, dat will do.
Now we go in like shot," he added, turning to the captain, who
significantly touched the butt of one of the pistols in his belt.
As the line of surf was approached, Pogo became more ener-
getic in his actions. He shouted to the crew, "Stand by the
braces, tacks, and sheets!" The wind began to fail, and he
knew well that a puff coming down the river might take the ship
aback, and drive her on shore before there was time to drop an
anchor. For an instant her sails fluttered. He began to dance
about and wring his hands, looking at the captain's belt as if he
expected every moment to see the pistol sticking in it pointed
at his head; but happily for him the sails again filled, and the
breeze increasing, the ship, after pitching three or four times,
glided on into smooth water. We were now free of all danger
for the present. There was nothing very attractive in the appear-
ance of the river. As far as the eye could reach, we could dis-
tinguish only mangrove bushes rising apparently out of the
water itself. Except a hut or two at the inner end of the sandy
point I have described, not a human habitation was to be per-
ceived, and scarcely a canoe dotted the broad expanse of the
river as we glided up it, stemming the current with the strong sea-
breeze which had now set in. As we got higher up, an occasional
opening in the mangrove bushes showed us a more attractive look-
ing country, with cocoa-nut, fig, and other trees, and native huts
nestled beneath them; but it was not until we had got about
twenty miles from the mouth of the river that any sign of a

53
numerous population appeared. At length we prepared to come
to an anchor off a village from which a wooden stage projected
into the river. Beyond it were several long sheds of considerable
extent, which were ere long discovered to be barracoons or sheds
for the reception of slaves brought down from the interior to be
embarked. The anchor was dropped, the sails were furled. What
now was to be our fate? The captain had interfered so little with
us, that we hoped he would allow us to go on shore, and that we
might be able from thence to make our way down the river, and
get on board a lawful trader or man-of-war. I proposed to Harry
that I should at once ask him. Just as I was about to do so, I
heard him order the wounded men to be brought up and placed
in a boat alongside. I thought that now was a good opportunity.
"I am afraid, sir, that these men are scarcely in a fit state to
be removed; unless they have some one to look after them, they
are very likely to lose their lives."
"You may accompany them," he said, "but remember that
you do not go beyond the village, or you will stand a chance of
being knocked on the head. The blacks are not very fond of
strange white men hereabouts."
Of course Harry and I did not consider ourselves bound to
follow his directions in this instance, nor had we given any
promise to do so. Before we left the ship, we found that the
crew were preparing her for the reception of slaves. Some were
hoisting up her cargo and placing it either on deck or in the after-
cabin ready for trade, and others were fixing in a slave-deck fore
and aft, while casks of water and bags of farina were being brought
on board in large quantities. I was thankful to see Tom Tubbs
in the boat which was to convey the wounded men on shore.
He gave us a wink as we went down the side, and I saw that he
took the stroke oar, so that he would have an opportunity of
speaking to us. The ship was some distance off the bank, for
there was not sufficient depth of water to enable her to come
nearer. It took us, therefore, nearly ten minutes to reach the
shore.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"I'll lend a hand to carry one of these poor fellows," observed
Tom, giving me a meaning look as he pulled away. "I suppose
Mr. Bracewell will help us?"
I turned to Harry, and of course he said "yes." Two of the
men were able to walk, but the other three were still too weak
to help themselves. The crew of the boat, therefore, took two ot
the latter up on their shoulders, and Tubbs, Harry, and I lifted
the third. Harry carried the man's feet; Tubbs and I supported
him by our arms and shoulders.
"We shall be here for more than a week, I suspect," said
Tubbs as we walked along. "I must come on shore to see how
these poor fellows are getting on, and may be you may fancy a
walk into the country, either up the river or down the river, as
you wish."
The habitation selected for the accommodation of the wounded
was far superior to what I expected to find. It was, indeed, the
house of a white slave-dealer and general trader, who, with his
clerks, was now away, and Captain Roderick had thought fit to
take possession of it. A large airy room in which eight hammocks
were slung, afforded quarters for our five patients and to Harry
and me.
"I wish that you could occupy the other," I said to Tubbs;
"we should be glad to have your assistance. Couldn't you ask
the captain's leave, and say that we want you to help us to look
after the wounded?"
The boatswain shook his head. "Not much chance of his
granting it; he would suspect that there was something in the
wind ; but I'll keep my weather eye open, and if I have a chance
I'll come on shore. If you determine to try and make your
escape, it must be just before the 'Vulture ' sails, or the captain
will be sending to look for you," he whispered. "Good-bye,
gentlemen," he added aloud; "glad to see you on board again."
We found a couple of blacks in the house—an old man and a
woman, servants of the owner,—left to look after it. They

appeared well disposed, and brought us food and everything
we required for ourselves and the wounded men. The latter—
ruffians as they may have been—were very grateful to us, and
one and all declared that they would not have received such
attention from their own shipmates.
"I should think you must be pretty well sick of the life you
have been leading," I ventured to say in a low voice to one of
them, who appeared to be of a better disposition than the rest.
"That indeed I am, sir," he answered, the tears coming into
his eyes. "I'd leave it to-morrow if I could, for I know a
sudden death or a bowline-knot will be my lot some day or
other."
"What do your wounded shipmates think about the subject?"
I asked.
"I cannot say positively; but my idea is that they would
be glad enough to get free if they had the chance," was the
answer.
I did not venture to make any remark in return, but the
thought then occurred to me that we might possibly all escape
together. If we could procure arms, we should form a pretty
strong party, and might fight our way in any direction in which
it might be advisable to go. The French had a settlement on
that part of the coast, so had the Portuguese further south; but
the English had none except a long way to the north. Still, as
ships of war and traders occasionally appeared off the coast, could
we once reach it, we might make signals and be taken on board.
I do not mean to say that Harry or I had much hope of thus
escaping, still it was possible, and that assisted to keep up our
spirits.
Captain Trunnion appeared much disappointed at not finding
the number of slaves he had expected in the barracoons, as it
would compel him to wait until they could be obtained from the
interior, and his crew he knew were as liable to coast fever as
that of any other vessel.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Next to the house in which we lived was a large store where
the cargo of the "Vulture" was stored when landed. At a short
distance off were several barracoons. I may as well describe one
of them. It was a shed composed of heavy piles driven deep
into the earth, lashed together with bamboos, and thatched with
palm-leaves. Down the centre was another row of piles, along
which was a chain. In this, at intervals of about every two feet,
was a large neck-link, which, being placed round the necks of the
slaves, was padlocked. When I looked in, the barracoon con-
tained only about twenty slaves. Some of them were fine athletic
looking men, and were shackled three together, the strongest being
placed between two others, and heavily ironed. The walls of the
building were about six feet in height, and between them and the
roof was an opening of about four feet to allow the free circula-
tion of air. The floor was planked, not, as I found, from any
regard for the comfort of the slaves, but because a small insect,
a species of chigoe, which is in the soil, might get into the flesh
of the poor creatures, and produce a disease which might ulti-
mately kill them. Half a dozen armed men, two being mulattoes,
the others blacks, were guarding the barracoon and watching the
slaves, so that any attempt to free themselves from their irons
was impossible. These slaves were the property of a dealer with
whom the captain now commenced bargaining. As there was
time to spare, he chose to select each one separately, lest any
sick or injured people might be forced upon him, as is often the
case where slaves are shipped in a hurry. He and the trader
stood at a dignified distance, while their subordinates carried on
the active part of the business, a half naked black acting for the
trader, while the captain was represented by a mulatto, who felt
the arms and legs of each man, and struck him on the chest and
back to ascertain that he was sound in wind, before he consented
to pay over his price in goods. Another slave was then sum-
moned, and, if found satisfactory, passed at a fixed price; but
otherwise, a less sum was offered, or the slave was sent back

A SLAVE SHIP.

to await the arrival of some other slaver likely to be less parti-
cular. Women and children were treated in the same way, but
there were comparatively few of them in the lot now offered for
sale.
I had to return on board the "Vulture" to obtain some
medicines for our wounded men, and also to get some articles
belonging to Harry and myself which we had left on board.
Great alterations had taken place in the fitting of the ship
between decks. Huge casks called leaguers had been placed
in the hold; in these were stowed the provisions, wood for fuel,
and other stores; above them was fitted a slave-deck, between
which and the upper deck there was a space of about four feet.
On this the slaves were to sit with shackles on their feet, and
secured to iron bars running from side to side. They were
divided in gangs, about a dozen in each, over which was a head
man, who arranged the place each slave was to occupy. The
largest slaves were made to sit down amidships, or the furthest
from the ship's side, or from any position in which their strength
could avail them to secure a larger space than their neighbours.
As I was to see more of the system, I need not now describe it.
On my return on shore, I looked into the barracoon hired by
Captain Trunnion, in which I saw from forty to fifty slaves
assembled, and even more heavily ironed and secured than they
had been before. They were mostly sitting with their heads
between their knees, bowed down with blank despair. Having
seen the ship which was to convey them from their native land
to a region they knew nothing of, and observed the savage counte-
nances of the men who were to be their masters during the voyage,
all hope of escape had fled. Every day after this, fresh batches
of slaves arrived, their hands secured behind their backs, and
walking in a long line fastened together by a rope, strictly guarded
by blacks with muskets in their hands and swords by their sides,
with which they occasionally gave a prod to any of the laggards.
The wretched beings were marched, in the first instance, to the

trader's barracoons, where they could be sorted and regain some
of their strength. Harry and I were paying all the attention
we could to the wounded men, who, enjoying the advantage of
fresh provisions, were quickly recovering their health. Caspar
Caper, the man who seemed to be the most grateful to Harry
and me, was quite himself again, and was certainly fit to return
on board, but he begged hard that we would not inform the
captain.
"If I had my will, sir, I'd never go back to that craft; nor
would you if you knew the dreadful deeds which have been done
on board her or by her crew."
"I have no wish to go back, you may be sure of that," I
answered; "but what do your companions say?"
"Well, sir, three of them are pretty well agreed with me; but
there is one, Herman Jansen, the Dutchman, who has a fancy for
the buccaneering life we have led, and I don't like to trust him."
This showed me that the man to whom I was speaking,
Caspar Caper, had thought the subject over, and was himself
fully prepared to try and escape from the pirates. I told him to
speak to his shipmates while Harry and I were out of the way,
and not to say that we entertained the idea, but simply to state
his belief that we would accompany them if they made up their
minds to run off from the slave village. Before doing anything,
I was very anxious to see Tubbs; but he was so busily employed
on board that he could not manage to come on shore. It was
very probable, I thought, that the captain would, not give him
leave, and that he must come at night if he came at all. I
thought again of all sorts of excuses for visiting the ship, although
I feared, if I did so, that I might be detained on board. Several
days passed; the "Vulture " was ready for sea, but a sufficient
number of slaves to form her cargo had not yet arrived; others,
however, were coming in, sometimes twenty or thirty at a time.
It would not take more than a couple of hours to stow them all
away on board. Although by this time all the wounded men

59
had recovered, they pretended to be too weak to get out of their
cots. Once or twice the captain looked in to see how they were
getting on, when they all groaned and spoke in feeble tones, as if
they were very little better.
"I can't say much for your doctoring, young sirs," he observed,
turning to Harry and me. "I believe if you had left the men
alone they would have got well of themselves. I never have had
a surgeon on board my ship, and never intend to have one.
Nature is the best surgeon, and if she can't cure a man he must
die."
"I don't know what you would say if you were wounded,
captain, and there was no one to extract the ball," observed
Harry.
"I should have to take my chance with the rest," answered
the captain in a tone which showed, however, that he did not
like the remark. "But, whether cured or not, these fellows must
come on board and try and do their duty," he exclaimed as he
left the house.
"I must get some stronger medicines then," I said, the thought
suddenly striking me that this would be the best excuse for
visiting the ship; for although the captain spoke in the way he
did, he had a medicine-chest on board well stored with drugs,
with a book of directions for their use.
"I thought that you before took enough physic on shore to
cure a dozen fellows," he remarked.
"And so I did, sir, but I remember seeing on the last visit a
mixture, the name of which I forget, for restoring strength to
people who have been brought down, and that's just what these
men want."
I spoke the truth in regard to the drugs, the only question
was how much the men required of them. As the captain
did not forbid me, as soon as he was out of sight I hurried
down to the beach, and got a black fellow to paddle me on
board in his canoe. I soon found a big bottle, and made up

the mixture according to the recipe, which I took good care to
keep in my hand, so that anybody could see what I had been
about. I looked round for Tubbs, and when I returned on deck,
much to my satisfaction I found him working at the mizen rigging
with no one else near. I hastened up to him, and in a low voice
said—
"The rest are ready. Will you come to-night or to-morrow
night? although I fear if we put it off till to-morrow you may be
too late. We will, however, wait for you if you will come."
"Yes," he answered, "wait! I will be on shore an hour before
midnight. By that time the black fellows will have turned in.
Tell the negro who brought you off that there will be a couple of
doubloons for him if he comes alongside at the hour I name. If
he fails me, I must swim on shore, although there is a risk of
being snapt up by a shark or a stray crocodile. However, I may
find another chance before that of getting on shore. Now you'd
better be off, for it won't do for you to be seen lingering about
talking with me."
I followed his advice, and got into the canoe. As the black
paddled me on shore, I asked him if he would like to obtain a
doubloon. I knew very well what would be his answer. Being
a discreet personage, he asked no further questions, but promised
to be alongside at the hour I named.
On landing, I hurried to the house, which was some way up the
beach, and told Harry of the arrangements I had made. I then
explained more clearly to Caspar Caper than I had hitherto
done the plan Harry and I proposed, which was to direct our
course to the southward, and then to strike directly for the coast,
where we might hope to be taken off, or to find a canoe or craft
of some sort, in which to make our way to one of the European
settlements. The means of subsistence we hoped to find in the
forest if we could obtain firearms. As I had been going about
the house one day, I had seen a couple of fowling-pieces, with
powder-horns and shot-belts, hanging against the wall. Harry

PREPARE FOR ESCAPING.
61
doubted whether we had a right to take them; but necessity has
no law, and in this case we came to the conclusion that we were
justified in taking possession of them. Our associates had no
scruples on the subject. Caspar fully agreed to carry out the
plan we proposed, and now told us that his shipmates were per-
fectly ready to escape, and try for the future to lead peaceable
lives. We did not inquire too minutely into their motives, but
I suspected that these arose not so much from their hatred of
piracy, as from being compelled constantly to fight with the fear
of a rope's end before their eyes. I told the two old blacks that
the wounded men required as much food as they could obtain,
and they brought us an abundant supply. We accordingly had a
hearty supper, but we were to make a scurvy return to them for
their kindness. As soon as it was dark, the men got up and
dressed themselves. Harry and I groped our way to the room
where we had seen the fowling-pieces, which, with the ammunition,
were at once secured.
"There's more to be found in the house than those things,"
observed Jansen. "We shall want a fresh rig out. What say you,
mates? Besides which, if old Dobbo and his wife hear us mov-
ing about, they will give the alarm, so we must settle them first."
Saying this, he took up the lamp, and, followed by the rest, quitted
the room, leaving Harry and me in darkness. Soon afterwards
we heard a slight scream, then all was silent. We waited a
quarter of an hour or more. The time was approaching when
we expected to see Tubbs. Presently we heard a knock at the
shutter of the room. Of course there was no glass. I opened it,
and Tubbs sprang in. We knew him by his figure, though there
was not light sufficient to see his countenance.
"Are you alone?" he whispered.
"Yes," answered Harry; "the others have gone to see what
they can find in the house likely to be useful on the journey.
We secured some fowling-pieces; we could not defend our lives
without them."

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"And I have brought off a brace of pistols and a hanger,"
said the boatswain.
"We shall do very well then; but I almost wish that we had
attempted to escape without those other fellows—they are
likely to bring us into trouble by their lawless ways," said
Harry.
This was indeed too probable. While we were speaking they
returned. They had sense enough to suppress their voices, and
as Caspar, who carried the light, entered, I saw that they were all
rigged out in the trader's clothes, which they had appropriated.
One had got a musket, another a sword, and others richly
ornamented pistols, while the legs of another were encased in high
boots, and he had on a handsomely embroidered coat, used by the
owner on grand occasions.
"The old people will not follow us or give the alarm," said
Jansen. "We have gagged and bound them, for we heard them
moving about in the next room, and if we hadn't been quick about
it they would have given the alarm, and the whole village would
soon have been awake."
The men had not returned empty handed. Some had brought
in a further supply of provisions which they had found in the
house, and several articles they had picked up.
Having made a hearty supper, " Now, my lads," I said, "it is
time to start. The people in the village must be fast asleep,
and the further off we get, the better chance we shall have of
keeping ahead of our pursuers. One of us must act as leader.
Who will do so?"
The men at once unanimously chose Tom Tubbs. Harry and
I were glad of this, as we felt sure that he was the best person for
the post.
"Well, my lads, if you will obey me, I'll do what I can to lead
you well," he said. "Now, the first thing I have to charge you is
to keep silence. Follow me!" He noiselessly opened the door
and looked carefully about . Neither seeing nor hearing any one,

OUR FLIGHT.
63
he gave us the signal to move on. Harry and I went next, and
the other men followed in single file. They knew that the
slightest noise would betray them. For what they could tell, the
captain himself might be on shore; and should we be caught, he
would certainly visit us with severe punishment. We treaded
our way silently through the village, keeping at a distance from
the barracoons, the guards at which would otherwise have dis-
covered us. The country was sufficiently open to enable us to
see the stars overhead, by which we guided our course to the
southward. When we approached any huts, we turned aside,
taking care not to go through any plantations, where, by breaking
down the stalks, we should leave traces of our passage.
After going some distance we stopped to listen. We could
hear two or three dogs barking, one replying to the other, but no
human voices. This made us hope, at all events, that we were
not discovered. Again we went on at a pretty quick rate, con-
sidering that five of our party had not been on their feet for several
weeks. At last the men called a halt.
"We had better not stop yet, lads," said Tom Tubbs; "we
must put a good many miles between us and the village before we
are safe. Your skipper is not the man to let any of his crew get
away without an effort to bring them back."
A short time, however, served to restore our companion's
strength, and we once more set off as fast as our legs could carry us,
breaking into a run whenever the ground was sufficiently level for
the purpose. We had made good, I calculated, fully twenty miles
when morning broke. It was a distance, I hoped, which would
prevent the pirates from successfully pursuing us, but it would not
do to rest here, for as soon as it was discovered that we had fled,
Captain Roderick would be informed of it, and he would certainly
send a party after us.
"If he does, I hope that he'll send some of his white crew, for
they'll soon get tired and give up the chase," observed Harry.
"I am afraid, sir, he won't trust them," remarked Tubbs;

64
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"he'll get a band of black fellows, who will keep on through the
heat of day. I would advise that we should go forward during
the cool of the morning, and try and find a place to conceal our-
selves."
To this proposal Harry and I agreed, so did our other com-
panions, though they would have preferred resting where they
were. After a short halt by the side of a stream to take some
food and quench our thirst, we again pushed on, the vegetation
in many places being so dense that it was not without difficulty
that we could force our way through it. The worst of this was,
that while we were thus delayed we should form a road for
our pursuers. However, that was not to be avoided should they
get upon our track.
We had made good nearly a dozen miles, I should think, when
we came upon a broad river, flowing, as we supposed, into the sea.
"If we can find a canoe, or a craft of some sort, we may easily
reach the coast, and save ourselves a good deal of fatigue,"
observed Tubbs.
The rest of the men, who were pretty well knocked up, seemed
highly pleased at the proposal. Instead of attempting to cross
the stream, we proceeded down it. Harry suggested that we
should form a raft if we could not find a canoe, and should a
party be sent in pursuit, they would thus be puzzled to know
what had become of us. I proposed that, before commencing our
voyage down the stream, we should cross to the opposite bank,
and there trample down the grass, and make other marks as if we
had continued our course to the southward. We had not gone far
when we saw a smoke ascending from amid trees on the banks of
the river.
"Some native traders or white men are encamped there," ob-
served Tubbs. "They are probably proceeding up the river, and
will tell us what sort of people we are likely to meet with on the
passage down. If they are traders, they are likely to prove friendly,
and we may consider ourselves fortunate in falling in with them."

MEET FRENCH TRADERS.
65
"But suppose they are not traders, suppose they are not
friendly, what are we to do then ?" asked Harry.
"We muster eight white men with arms in our hands, and are
not likely to be uncivilly treated," observed Jansen, flourishing
his weapon. "I'll go forward, and see who these people are, and
we'll soon settle whether we are to be friends or foes."
As there was no time to be lost, he hurried forward, while we
halted to await his return. In a few minutes he reappeared.
"Friends! come on," he exclaimed; and once more moving
forward, we reached an open space near the bank of the river,
where we saw a tent pitched and two white men and a party of
six blacks, two of whom were cooking at a fire, while the rest
were seated in the shade. They rose to greet us.
The white men were French traders, they told us. They spoke
a little English, and we understood enough of their language to
be able to carry on a conversation. As they were inclined to be
friendly, and appeared to be honest, we told them that we were
escaping from a piratical slave craft, which we described. They
appeared to know her well, and seemed greatly to commiserate
us. They informed us that they were proceeding up the river to
trade with the natives; that one of their number had fallen ill and
was now suffering from fever inside the tent. They hoped by
spending a day or two where they were that he would recover
sufficiently to enable them to continue their voyage. They told
us that we were nearly two hundred miles from the sea, and a
much greater distance following the course of the river; but still
it would be the safest plan to descend it in the way we proposed,
until we reached a village where canoes were to be obtained.
Though Harry and I and Tubbs were anxious at once to set
to work and build a raft, our companions declared that they were
too tired to do anything more until they had had a long rest.
Our new friends, who had plenty of provisions, kindly bestowed
some upon them, and invited us to join them in their repast,
giving us some wine, which we found very refreshing. The
£

Frenchmen, hearing how far we had come, expressed their opinion
that the pirates would not attempt to follow us, and that we were
perfectly safe from pursuit. We ourselves were glad to get some
rest, and lay down in the shade to wait until evening, when we
proposed building the raft. The Frenchmen had several axes
amongst their goods, and furnished us with three, so that we
might cut down any small trees we required for the framework
of the raft. After a sleep of some hours we got up much
refreshed. Harry, Tubbs, and I immediately began to select
trees for our purpose. The other men, whom Tubbs roused up,
however, showed no inclination to assist, declaring that they
were too tired, and must wait until the next day. Tubbs went
back two or three times to speak to them, but without success.
At last, on his return to us he said—
"I am afraid these fellows intend to play the Frenchmen some
scurvy trick. Their idea is to carry off the canoe, and if you and
Mr. Bracewell won't go, to leave you behind."
"We must defeat their treachery," I observed. "I will tell
the Frenchmen and put them on their guard; I will at once
do so."
Our friends, at first, would scarcely believe that the fellows
would be guilty of so abominable a trick, but when I reminded
them of the lawless lives they had led, they saw that it was too
probable, and promised to keep a guard on their canoe. We
laboured away until nightfall, our companions either sleeping or
pretending to be asleep all the time. They got up, however, to
eat some supper which the Frenchmen had prepared for us. Our
hosts then produced some bottles of liquor, looking significantly
at each other as they did so. I guessed their object, but said
nothing. The seamen fell into the trap, but Harry and I took
very little of the spirits, and Tubbs followed our example. The
Frenchmen having plied the pirates with more and more liquor,
they soon appeared to forget all about their previous intentions;
they talked, laughed, and sang, and clapped their entertainers on

ON WATCH AT NIGHT.
67
the back, vowing that they were thorough good fellows. They
then became very uproarious, and seemed disposed to quarrel
amongst each other, but by degrees they became quiet again, and
ultimately crawling to the bank of the river, lay down to sleep,
entirely thoughtless of the risk they ran of being snapped up by
alligators.
"They will do us no harm at present, at all events," said one
of the Frenchmen, "and to-morrow I hope that our companion
will be well enough to enable us to continue our voyage. We
are much obliged to you for your timely warning, and we would
advise you to part company from such lawless associates as soon
as possible."
Harry and I assured him that such was our purpose, although
we would gladly have enabled the men to escape from the pirates,
hoping that they would take to a better course of life. We sat
up talking with our friends for some time, and were then glad
to lie down outside their hut, having agreed to keep watch with
them during the night. We drew lots as to who should keep the
watches. Harry had the first, from eight to ten; Tubbs the
r.cxt two hours; I from midnight until two o'clock, and the
Frenchmen the morning watch. Tubbs roused me up and said
that all was quiet, and that the ex-pirates were sleeping soundly.
I paced up and down between the tent and the boat, in which
some of the black crew were sleeping, while the rest were near
their master's tent . Frequently I stopped to listen for any
distant sounds. I could hear occasionally the cries of wild
beasts far away to the eastward, and the shrieks of night
birds, the chirping of crickets or other insects, and the croaking
of frogs; but no human voice reached my ears. I trusted that
we should be able to finish our raft early the next day, and begin
the voyage down the river. With this hope, having called up
one of the Frenchmen, I lay down to sleep, feeling more drowsy
than usual. I had just opened my eyes and discovered that it
was dawn, when I was startled by the most fearful yell I had ever

heard, and the next instant a hundred dark forms, flashing huge
daggers in their hands, leapt out from among the bushes on every
side. Harry and Tubbs, who were sleeping next to me, sprang
to their feet. Our first impulse was to run to the trunk of a large
tree and place our backs against it, so that we might defend
ourselves to the last. As the unfortunate Frenchmen were
crawling out of their tent, the savages were upon them, while
others seized upon the drunken and still helpless seamen, and a
fearful scene of slaughter ensued. Three of them we saw killed,
while some of the crew of the canoe were also mercilessly put to
death. Two of the seamen, however, Herman Jansen and
Caspar Caper, seizing their weapons, fought their way out from
among the savages, and, we concluded, took to flight, for we saw
a party of blacks start off in pursuit. Our enemy, seeing us
well armed, had not hitherto attacked us. We expected them to
do so every moment. In a few minutes the whole of the party
except the two men who had taken to flight and ourselves, were
massacred.
"We must fight to the last if we are attacked," said
Harry; "but don't fire first. Perhaps the savages, when
they see the bold front we show, will think it wiser to let us
alone."
Our hopes, however, were soon dashed to the ground; for
the negroes, seeing only our small force opposed to them, after
shouting and shrieking, and making significant signs, advanced
towards us. Although we might have shot down three of them,
we should inevitably have been overpowered. Still we would
not yield without striking a blow, and we were on the point
of firing when a white man appeared, followed by a fresh
party of blacks, and as he advanced from the shadow of
the wood, I recognised Mr Pikehead, the first mate of the
"Vulture." On seeing only Harry, Tubbs, and me together, he
exclaimed—
"Put down your arms and your lives are safe. The other

fellows have met the fate they deserved," and he kicked the body
of one of the pirates. "They were deserters; but you had a
perfect right to make your escape if you could. You have,
however, failed, and must come back with me. Our captain will
decide what is to be done with you."
"We'll not yield until you call these fellows off," answered
Harry; "we shall then be able to treat with you."
The pirate laughed, for he fancied that he had us in his
power.
"What shall we do ?" asked Harry, addressing Tubbs and
me.
"We had better give in, sir," said Tubbs. "The odds against
us are too great, and although we might shoot that fellow and
a couple of the blacks, we should be certain to lose our lives. If
he promises to carry us safe on board the schooner, scoundrel
though he is, he will keep his word, and we may have another
opportunity of escaping."
"We must make a virtue of necessity," I observed, "and I
agree with Tubbs."
In the meantime the mate was shouting to the blacks to fall
back, allowing him space to approach us.
"I again promise you your lives, my men," he said, as he
stopped a few paces off, still holding a blunderbuss in his hand,
pointed towards us. "You are plucky fellows, and I wish to do
you no harm, although you have given me a long tramp which
I would gladly have avoided."
I felt convinced from his tone that he spoke the truth, and we
all three accordingly lowered our weapons. By this time two of
the pirate crew and several of the blacks whom we had seen at
the village appeared, and by the mate's directions we delivered
our arms to them.
"I'll not bind you," he said, " but you must give me your word
that -you will not run away."
This, of course, as we could not help ourselves, we did. While

the mate was engaged with us, the rest of the blacks had been
employed in plundering the cargo of the French trader's canoe,
over which they soon commenced quarrelling, flourishing their
daggers and gesticulating furiously at each other. For some time
the mate did not interfere, but I heard him direct his own party
to take possession of any provisions they could find : " Leave the
rest to the black fellows," he added.
¦ We were not sorry to see some cases of preserved meat, a
box of biscuits, and a bag of flour brought up, with a case of tea,
some sugar, and other eatables. The fire was quickly lighted,
and one of the white men with two of the blacks set to work to
prepare breakfast.
By degrees the tumult of the blacks, who had been quarrelling
over their booty, subsided; they had apparently come to some
arrangement among themselves without the interference of the
mate, and each of them now appeared habited in the various
articles they had appropriated—some with pieces of coloured
calico round their loins, others in the form of turbans round their
heads or over their shoulders, evidently supposing that the
appearance they presented was very distinguished. Shortly after-
wards, however, the return of the party who had gone in chase
of the two pirates, irritated at having failed to overtake them,
created a fresh disturbance, each one among them claiming some
of the booty.
On this occasion, bloodshed would certainly have ensued, had
not the mate interfered, and insisted on the portions claimed
being given up. As he and his followers had firearms, and the
blacks had only their long knives, they were afraid of disobey-
ing him, and order was again restored.
Notwithstanding the unfortunate termination of our adventure,
we all ate heartily of the food placed before us. The remainder
of the provisions was done up into packages, so that each of us
might carry enough to last until we reached the village.
Mr. Pikehead had certainly no wish to be in the company of

71
his black allies, whom he had instigated to attack the camp, for
making them a speech in their own tongue, he sent them off in
a different direction to that we were about to follow. He then
directed each man to take up his package, gave the word to
inarch, and we set off.

We are marched back to the village—Carried on board the "Vulture"—Sent
down below—Tubbs refuses to turn pirate—An unpleasant night—The
ship under weigh—Crossing the bar—Allowed to go on deck—At sea—
Another night—Attempt to escape a pursuer—Sounds of a fight reach

We stop him and make him prisoner—A party from the frigate on board

a pirate—Trusts the crew—A pleasant supper—Unpleasantly aroused
from sleep by seeing the Lieutenant and Charley in the hands of the
pirates—A trick to deceive the frigate—The pirate makes sail and escapes
from the frigate.
HARRY and I trudged along side by side, feeling dreadfully
out of spirits at the ill success of our attempt to escape,
as also at the thought of the sad fate which had befallen the
good-natured Frenchmen. We also could not help considering
ourselves in a degree guilty of the death of the three men
we had induced to desert, as well as of that of our friends and
their attendants. Tubbs tried to cheer us up.
"Maybe the blacks would have attacked the Frenchmen
whether we had been with them or not," he observed; "and as
for the rest, it is the fortune of war. We tried to escape but failed;
better luck next time, say I."
This, however, was but poor consolation, as we could only
expect the harshest treatment at the hands of Captain Roderick,
even if he did not put us to death. Whether he would do that
or not was doubtful. The mate, however, did not seem inclined

REACH THE VILLAGE.
73
to ill-treat us, except that we each had to cany a heavy load,
while a dozen men were placed behind and on each side of us;
but we were allowed to march as we liked, and to converse freely
together. Though we had slept the previous night, we were
pretty well tired out when a halt was called and preparations
made to bivouac. Supper was prepared by the cooks, and we
were allowed as large a share as we required. The mate then
told us to lie down together, a couple of black fellows with
arms in their hands being placed over us.
"You'll not attempt to run," observed the mate. "I have
given orders to these fellows to shoot you if you do; so the con-
sequences be on your own heads."
"No fear of that," answered Harry. "We'll promise to sleep
as soundly as we can until we are called in the morning."
"One good thing, we've not got to keep watch," observed
Tom Tubbs; "and I hope our black guards will keep a look-out
for any snake, leopard, or lion who may chance to poke his nose
into the camp; although I wish that Mr. Pikehead had left us
our arms to defend ourselves."
We were too tired to talk much, and I believe we all slept
soundly until morning, when we were roused up to breakfast and
resume our march. It was late in the day when we reached the
village. Fortunately for us, the owner of the house we had
formerly occupied was still absent, and the theft committed by
the pirates was not discovered. Soon after we arrived Captain
Roderick made his appearance, a sardonic smile on his counte-
nance.
"You thought to escape me," he said. "You acted foolishly,
and must take the consequences. Had you been shot, your
blood would have been on your heads, not on mine. I intend to
take good care that you shall not play the same trick again.
You will now come on board the "Vulture," and it is your own
fault that you will not be treated with the same leniency that
you were before. My crew will see that I do not allow such

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
tricks to be played with impunity. Lash their hands behind
them, Pikehead, and bring them along."
The mate, with the aid of three seamen, immediately secured
our hands behind our backs, and we were led down, amid the hoots
and derisive laughter of the population, to the boat which con-
veyed us on board the "Vulture." Having been allowed to stand
for some minutes in that condition exposed to the view of the
crew, we were ordered down below. As we passed near the main
hatchway, we saw that the slave-deck was already crowded with
blacks, seated literally like herrings in a tub, as close as they
could be packed side by side, with shackles round their necks
and legs. Our destination was, however, lower down by the after
hatchway. As soon as we were below the deck, our arms were
released, and we were able to help ourselves down the narrow ladder
which led into the cable-tier. Here, in a space which allowed us
room only to sit with our knees together, without being able to
stand up or walk about, the mate told us we were to remain.
"You may consider yourselves very fortunate, my fine fellows,
that worse has not happened to you," he said. "How you'll like
it if it comes on to blow, and the hatches are battened down, is
more than I can say. You'll get your food though, for the cap-
tain doesn't want to take your lives—he has some scruples about
that—nor do I. Indeed, you might have escaped as far as I was
concerned, although it was fortunate for you I came up when I
did, or those Ashingo savages would have put you to death as
they did your companions."
"We are grateful for the leniency with which we have been
treated, but may I ask what the captain intends doing with us?"
I said.
"Why, I suppose that he intends to sell you two young gentle-
men as slaves in the Brazils. He will give your faces and bodies
a coating of black, and put you with the rest of the negroes," an-
swered the mate. "And as for you," he exclaimed, turning to
Tubbs, "you might have been treated as a deserter; and if you

75
don't sign articles and join us, you will probably have to walk
the plank. I say this as a hint to you. If you act wisely, you'll
be set at liberty as soon as we get into blue water."
"You reckon wrongly if you think I'll join this craft or any
other like her," answered Tubbs stoutly. "I'm ready to take
the consequences, for turn pirate I won't; so you have my
answer."
The mate laughed.
"Many a fine fellow has said that and changed his tone when
he has seen the plank rigged or the yard-arm with a running
bowline from it. However, I must not waste words on you. I'll
send you down your suppers, and you must manage to stow
yourselves away in the best manner you can think of for sleep.
One of you must needs sit up, and he'll have plenty to do in
keeping off the rats and cockroaches, for you'll be somewhat
troubled by them, I suspect."
We thanked the mate for the promise of sending us some
supper, and wished him good night; and I really believe that, as far
as his brutalised nature would allow, he intended to be kind to us.
Cramped as we were in the hot stifHing hold, it was a long time
before any one of us could go to sleep. We were, I should have
said, left in total darkness; not the slightest gleam of light
descending into the part of the hold in which we were confined.
At length VI was awakened from a tolerable sleep by a noise
which betokened that the ship was getting under weigh. I did
not like to arouse my companions; but Tubbs, who had been
sitting on a locker, started up exclaiming—
"Ay, ay! I'll be on deck in a twinkling." The blow
he gave his head against the beam above him, roused him up.
"Bless my heart! I forgot where I was," he said. "Yes, the
ship's under weigh, no doubt about that, and we shall be out
at sea in the course of a few hours if we have the tide and
wind with us, and don't ground on the bar and get knocked to
pieces."

76 THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
After some time Harry awoke. I told him that the ship was
running down the river.
"Our chance of escape for the present is over, then," he said
with a deep sigh.
He had naturally been thinking of home and Lucy and his
blighted prospects; so indeed had I. Tubbs, as before, tried to
cheer us up by talking on various subjects.
"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip," he observed.
"Although the captain fancies his craft faster than anything afloat,
he may catch a tartar in the shape of a British man-of-war before
we cross the Atlantic. As to selling us into slavery, I don't
believe he'll attempt it. He must know that before long we would
find means of communicating with a British consul or some other
authority, and make our cases known. If he had talked of
selling us to the Moors or Turks, the case would have been
different. Once among those fellows, we should have found it a
hard matter to escape."
"Still he may sell us," observed Harry; "and perhaps months
and years will pass before we can let our friends know where
we are."
"Well, well, that'll be better than having to walk the plank or
being run up at the yard-arm," said Tubbs. "We must not cry
out until we are hurt, although I'll own that I'd rather have more
room to stretch my legs in than this place affords. I hope
Master Pikehead won't forget to send us the food he promised;
I'm getting rather sharp set already."
Harry and I confessed that we were also feeling very hungry.
Even the talking about food gave a new turn to our thoughts.
At last we heard the hatch above our heads lifted, and the black
steward came down with a bowl of farina and a jug of water. It
was the same food the slaves were fed on, but we thought it wise
to make no complaint.
"It shows that the captain has no intention to starve us,"
observed Harry. "However, this is better than mouldy biscuit

UNPLEASANT QUARTERS.
77
and rancid pork, such as I have heard say seamen are too often
fed upon."
"You've heard say the truth, sir," observed Tubbs. "Often and
often I've known the whole ship's company get no better fare
than that, with little better than bilge water to drink. If we get
enough stuff like this, we shall grow fat, at all events."
The steward, leaving the bowl between us, quickly disappeared
up the hatchway. The only light we had was from a bull's-eye
overhead, which enabled us, as Tubbs said, "barely to see the
way to our mouths ;" we could not, at all events, distinguish each
other's features. Although we could not see, we felt the claws of
numerous visitors crawling over us, and smelt them too, and now
and then were sensible that a big rat was nibbling at our toes,
although, by kicking and stamping, at the risk of hitting each
other's shins, we kept them at bay. Notwithstanding this, we
managed to sleep pretty soundly at intervals.
Tubbs assured us that the ship was gliding on, although it
might be some time before she reached the bar, as it was im-
possible to judge at what rate she was sailing. Now and then
we felt her heel over slightly to starboard, showing that the wind
was more abeam, or rather that we were passing along a reach
running to the southward; then, when she came up again on an
even keel, we knew that we were standing directly to the west-
ward. At last we felt her bows lift, then down she glided, to rise
again almost immediately afterwards, while the increased sound
of the water dashing on her sides showed us that we were crossing
the bar.
"There is some sea on, I guess, and I know what it is with
these African rivers. Should the wind suddenly shift southward,
we may be driven on a rock or sandbank, and we and all on
board will have a squeak for life," observed Tubbs.
"I hope not, although anything might be better than being
carried into slavery," observed Harry. "But we ought not to
despair. I have been thinking and praying over the matter, and

know that God can deliver us if He thinks fit. We must trust
Him; I'm sure that's the only thing to be done in all the
troubles and trials of life. At all times we must do our duty, and,
as I say, trust Him; even when bound hand and foot as we are
at present, all we can do is still to trust Him."
I heartily responded to Harry's remark, and so I believe did
Tubbs, who, although nothing of a theologian, not even knowing
the meaning of the word, was a pious man in his rough way.
"Ay, ay, sir," he said. "I know that God made us, and He
has a right to our service; and if we don't run away from Him
and hide ourselves, He'll look after us a precious deal better
than we can look after ourselves. That's my religion, and it's my
opinion it's the sum total of all the parsons can tell us."
"Not quite," said Harry, "although it goes a long way. We
are sinners in God's sight, whatever we are in the sight of men;
and if God in His mercy hadn't given us a way by which we can
be made friends to Him and saved from punishment, we should
be in a bad condition."
"You are right, sir," answered Tubbs ; " but to my idea that's
all included in what I said."
We sat listening in silence.
"We are pretty well over the bar now, and I don't think we
shall be cast away this time," he observed a few minutes after-
wards.
That he was right we were convinced by the more regular
movement of the vessel, as she slowly rose and fell, moved by
the undulations which rolled in towards the coast. We could
judge that she was making good way, and Tubbs was of opinion
that all sail was set, and that we were standing to the westward.
At the time the slaves were fed, we had a bowl of farina brought
us, but the man put it down and disappeared again without saying
a word. Soon afterwards the mate came down, and told me that
I might come on deck for a quarter of an hour to stretch my
legs. I was thankful to breathe the fresh air, although there was

THE "VULTURE" AT SEA.
79
but little of it, and the ship was almost becalmed. I glanced
astern, and could distinguish the shore, although I could no longer
make out the mouth of the river. We had, at all events, got a safe
offing. When my time was up I was sent below and Harry took
my place, and he was succeeded by Tubbs. We were treated,
however, with no more consideration than was afforded to the
slaves, who were brought up on deck at intervals in the same
fashion. The hold felt doubly close and oppressive after the
mouthful of fresh air we had enjoyed.
The second night of our captivity was even more trying than
the first, for the atmosphere of the hold, into which the horrible
odour from the slave-deck penetrated, was becoming every hour
more and more unendurable. I feared that should we be kept
below during the voyage, I, at all events, would sink under
it, for I already felt sick almost to death, and my spirits were at
a lower ebb than they had ever before reached. Harry was
almost in as bad a condition as I was. Tubbs, who had been
well seasoned in the close air of forecastles, held out better than
we did.
"Don't give way, young gentlemen, whatever you do," he
said very frequently to us. "Cheer up, cheer up! When we get
a breeze, some of it will find its way down here perhaps; and if
not, I'll ask the skipper if he wishes to kill us by inches, and I'll
tell him he'll never land either of us if we are kept shut up in
this hold and treated worse than the negroes. They are born to
it, as it were, and we are not, and have been accustomed to pure
air all our lives."
I did not quite agree with Tubbs as to negroes being born to
be shut up in the hold of a slave-ship, but I did not just then
contradict him. By a faint gleam, like the light of a glow-worm,
which came down from overhead, we knew that it was morning,
and soon afterwards we felt the ship heel over to larboard, or port
as it is now called. In a short time the increasing motion also
showed us that the sea had got up. We heard sounds which

So

indicated that sail was being shortened. We stood on, it might
have been an hour, on the same tack, when the ship was put
about, and now she heeled over more often, and pitched and
tumbled about in a way which showed that it was blowing fresh.
The cries of the wretched slaves, unaccustomed to the motion,
reached our ears, while the tossing stirred up the bilge water and
almost stifled us. Two or three hours passed, when the ship
became somewhat steadier. Tubbs averred that the helm had
been put up, and that we were running before the wind.
"There's something taking place, although I cannot make out
just what it is to a certainty; but I've a notion that there is some
craft in sight which the 'Vulture' wants to escape; and if so, I
hope she won't."
"So do I, indeed," murmured Harry. "I shall die if we remain
here much longer."
Another hour of suffering and anxiety passed, when Tubbs
roused Harry and me—for we had dropped off in a kind 01
stupor—by exclaiming—
"Holloa! What was that? A shot, or I'm a Dutchman."
As he spoke I distinctly heard the sound of a gun, though
it seemed to be at a great distance. We listened with bated
breath. Again there came a faint boom, and at the same instant
a crash, which told us that the shot had struck the ship.
"Hurrah! I thought so," cried Tom; "there's a man-of-war
in chase of us, and it is pretty evident that the 'Vulture' has no
wish to engage her, or she would not have been trying to get
away, as she has been for some hours past."
We waited now with intense anxiety. We knew that the
"Vulture" was a fast craft, and that it was too likely she had
just passed within range of her pursuer's guns, but might escape
notwithstanding. Except by the motion of the vessel, we could
not possibly judge how we were steering. In spite of the
stifling atmosphere, our senses were wide awake. Again there
came the sound of a gun. Although the shot did not strike the

THE "VULTURE" OVERTAKEN.
81
ship, yet it seemed to us that our pursuer must be nearer.
Another and another shot followed. The "Vulture's " guns were
now fired, although I was surprised to find how little noise they
appeared to make, and could scarcely believe that they were
fired from our deck, had not Tubbs assured us of the fact.
Then there came a lull, and we heard a whole broadside fired,
the crashing and rending sound showing that the shot had torn
through the bulwarks and sides of the ship. The fearful shrieks
which rose from the hold made us fear that the miserable slaves
had suffered, though perhaps their cries rose from terror as much
as from the injuries they had received. A fearful uproar ensued,
the roar of the great guns, the rattle of musketry, the shouts of
the slaver's crew, the shrieks and cries of the slaves, the groans of
the wounded, the rending and crashing of planks mingled, were
well-nigh deafening even to us. Presently there came a crash.
The ship seemed to real, a shudder passed through her whole
frame.
"They've run us aboard," cried Tubbs, " and maybe the ship
with all hands will be sent to the bottom. We must get out of
this somehow to try and save our lives. There will be no one
on the look-out to stop us."
The boatswain's exclamations made us fear that probably our
last moments were at hand.
"We must try and find something to help us to force our way
out," cried Tubbs. "If we cannot get the hatch off, we must
make our way through this bulkhead. Hurrah! here's an iron
bar."
As he spoke, Harry and I laid hold of it to be sure that
he was not mistaken. How it came there, of course we could
not tell.
"Now, keep behind me, that I may have room to use it," he
exclaimed.
We obeyed and he commenced a furious attack on the bulk-
head. The crash which followed showed that he had succeeded
F

in driving in some of the planking. He worked away with the
fury of despair, fully believing that erelong the ship would be
sent to the bottom. The noise he made prevented our hearing
what was going forward on deck; indeed, all sounds were undis-
tinguishable by this time.
"There is room to pass now," he cried.
He led the way through an opening he had formed. We fol-
lowed him, but still found that there was another bulkhead before
us. He quickly attacked that, and in a few seconds had demolished
a sufficient portion to enable us to creep through. We found a
ladder, which led, we judged, into the captain's cabin. We climbed
up it, and were just on the point of springing through a skylight
which would have led us on to the poop-deck, when we saw Cap-
tain Roderick himself enter, a pistol in his right hand and a sword
in the other, his countenance exhibiting rage and despair. He did
not observe us. Several casks of powder, which had been brought
up to be more ready at hand, were piled in one corner of the
cabin. He pointed his pistol, his intention was evidently to blow
up the ship and all on board. In another moment his desperate
purpose would have been effected. As if moved by one impulse,
we all three sprang upon him, Tubbs grasping his right wrist
and turning the pistol away, the bullet striking the deck above.
Mercifully none of the sparks fell on the powder. Tubbs, grasp-
ing him by the throat, and throwing himself with his whole force
upon him, brought him to the deck, while Harry and I each
seized an arm and knelt upon his body to prevent him from
rising. Although we exerted all our strength, it was with the
greatest difficulty we could keep him down. He seemed more
like a wild beast than a human being. He gnashed his teeth
and glared fiercely at us.
"Be quiet, captain, won't you?" exclaimed Tubbs. "We have
saved you and ourselves from being blown into the air, and you
ought to thank us."
The captain made no answer. I looked round for a piece of

THE CAPTAIN OVERPOWERED.
rope or some means of securing him; for had he been set loose,
he would probably have accomplished his purpose, and we, of
course, were eager to get on deck and try and save our lives, for
we fully believed that the "Vulture " was on the point of sinking.
The guns, however, had ceased firing, although there was a
stamping overhead, the clashing of hangers, and the occasional
sounds of pistols at the further end of the ship.
"The man-of-war's men have gained the after part, and have
driven the pirates forward," observed Tubbs; "we shall soon have
some of our people here to help us."
Again the captain gnashed his teeth and made an effort to free
himself.
"It's all of no use, captain," said Tubbs. "I don't want to
take your life, but if you don't keep quiet, I shall be obliged to
draw my knife across your windpipe."
The captain evidently fully believed that the boatswain intended
to do what he threatened.
"You've treated us with less severity than we might have
expected, Captain Roderick," said Harry. "Will you give us your
word that you will not again attempt to destroy the ship, or to
attack any of the people who have captured her, and we will
conduct you into a cabin where you must remain until to-morrow,
or until you are set at liberty?"
Captain Roderick made no reply.
All this time the ship, I should have said, had been rolling and
pitching, and it was very evident that she had broken loose from
the man-of-war. It might possibly be that the pirates had gained
the upper-hand, but the appearance of Captain Roderick below
convinced us to the contrary. At length the sounds I have
described ceased, although there was a continuous tramping of
feet overhead, and the rattling of blocks and yards.
"They are shortening sail," observed Tubbs; "we shall soon
have some one below to relieve us of this gentleman, and I'm
thankful to say I don't believe the ship's going down just yet. If

try and blow her up."
We could see Captain Roderick's eyes glaring at us, but Tubbs
held him too tight by the throat to allow him to speak. So
violent were his struggles, however, that he nearly got one of his
arms loose, on which Tom tightened his grip until the pirate
captain was nearly black in the face. In spite of this, giving a
sudden jerk, he freed the arm Harry was holding clown, when
three persons appeared at the door. One was, I saw, a naval
officer, by his uniform—the other two, seamen. I shouted to them
to come to my assistance, and seeing what we were about, they
sprang forward.
"Get some rope and lash this man; he is mad, I believe," I
cried out.
"Go and get it," said the officer. One of the sailors sprang on
deck, while the two new-comers assisted us in keeping down the in-
furiated pirate. He was, I fully believed, from the almost super-
natural strength he exhibited, mad.
The seaman quickly returned with a coil of rope, with which
the officer and his men, aided by Tubbs, soon lashed Captain
Roderick's arms and legs in a way which prevented him from
moving until he was secured to the mizenmast, which came
through the cabin, when we felt that we were safe from his attacks.
I had not hitherto looked into the countenance of the officer, nor
he into mine. What was my surprise, then, to see a face I well
knew.
"Charley !" I exclaimed.
"Dick!" was the answer. "Can it be you ?" and my brother
and I grasped each other's hands. He had grown into a tall
young man, and certainly I should not have recognised him by
his figure. I was also greatly altered ; besides he would not have
recognised me in my present condition—my countenance pale, my
dress begrimed with dirt, torn, and travel-stained. I introduced
Harry and Tubbs to him, and he shook hands with them both.

MY BROTHER CHARLEY APPEARS.

There was no time for talking. He told us that the frigate had
sighted the slaver, which had refused to heave to, and had had the
audacity to fire at his Majesty's ship. A gale coming on, as the
only means of securing her, the frigate had run the slaver on board,
when he with a lieutenant and eight men had leapt down on her
deck, expecting to be followed by more of the crew, but, before
they had time to spring on board, the ships parted. The slaver's
crew, as he called them, had made a desperate resistance, but
a considerable number having been killed and more badly
wounded, the survivors had been driven forward and yielded.
"Having ceased to resist, the slaver's crew," he said, " had pro-
mised to assist in shortening sail, and apparently in good faith,
having yielded up their arms, set about doing so. We have now
got under snug canvas. There is too heavy a sea running to allow
of a boat with more hands being sent to our assistance. However,
as we have complete mastery of the people, we can do very well
without them. Mr. Hallton, the second lieutenant of the' Rover,'
our frigate, was inquiring for the captain of this craft, when he
was told that he must either have been killed or fallen overboard,
but one of his crew suggested that he might have gone below.
Another then owned that he had heard the captain say, that
sooner than fall into the hands of an enemy, he would blow the
ship up. On hearing this, Mr. Hallton sent me down below to
search for him."
"You would have been too late had we not providentially
prevented him from executing his mad scheme," I observed; and
I then told him how we had discovered the captain in the very
act of attempting to blow up the ship. "But you mistake the
character of this craft," I said; and I briefly told him how she had
captured the "Arrow," and how we had been treated since we fell
into Captain Roderick's hands.
"That greatly alters the aspect of affairs," he observed, looking
grave. "If you will come on deck with me, we will inform Mr.
Hallton. Perhaps he is inclined to treat the crew rather leniently,

and to put more confidence in their promises than he would do
if he were aware of her real character."
Harry on this desired Tubbs to watch the pirate.
"I should be glad to do it, sir, but I should like a sniff of the
sea-breeze," answered Tom. "I want just to pump out all the
foul air I've got down my throat."
"Well," said Charley, laughing, "one of my men shall remain
instead of you. Noakes, stand by this man, and shoot him through
the head if any one approaches to set him free or he manages
to cast off the lashings, although he'll not do that in a hurry, I
suspect."
On going on deck, we found Mr. Hallton, the second lieutenant
of the "Rover," standing aft, giving directions to heave the dead
bodies overboard and to collect the wounded, to attend to
whom he summoned several of the most respectable-looking of
their shipmates. The "Vulture" had not suffered much in her
rigging, and was now hove to under a closely-reefed main-topsail.
She rode so easily that I was not aware until then that a heavy
sea was running, and had been surprised at Charley telling me
that the two ships could not communicate. Charley introduced
me to Mr. Hallton, and briefly ran over the events of which I
had given him an account.
"A pirate, do you say she is?" exclaimed the lieutenant. "I
must really beg leave to doubt that. She is full of slaves, in the
first place, and the captain and his crew very naturally fought to
defend their property. But you say, Westerton, that you have
found the captain. I will examine him and ascertain the state of
the case."
"But my brother here, sir, and Mr. Bracewell, and the boats-
swain of the 'Arrow,' aver that they were taken out of their vessel
and detained by force on board this ship, and there can be no
doubt of her piratical character."
"I beg that you will wait to give your opinion until you are
asked for it, Mr. Westerton," answered the lieutenant in a gruff

87
tone. "I say that she's a slaver, and, as such, being taken full
of slaves, we will condemn her. With regard to her piratical
character, that has to be proved."
I was very much surprised at the way in which the lieutenant
spoke. Charley told me that the report on board was that he
himself had served on board a slaver, if not a pirate, in his
younger days, and that he was stubborn and ill-tempered in the
extreme. "Whether or not he has found any of his old
associates on board the craft I cannot say, but I know that the
crew gave in very soon when they saw him leading the boarders
across the deck. To be sure he fought like a tiger, and cut down
several fellows, so that I cannot suppose that he has any great
love for them, at all events."
The cries and groans which ascended from the slave-deck soon
drew our attention towards it, and Mr. Hallton sent Charley
with four hands down to ascertain their condition. I accompanied
him, having procured a brace of pistols and a hanger, without
which I should not have liked to venture among them. A
dreadful sight met our eyes. Three or four of the frigate's shot had
entered and swept right across the deck, taking off the heads of
not less than eight men in one row, and wounding others on the
further side of the ship in another row as if it had gone through
diagonally; while the legs of a still greater number had been
shot away. Most of the badly wounded were dead, but others
were still writhing in agony. I need not picture all the horrors
we witnessed. Charley told me to go on deck and obtain assist-
ance. The lieutenant replied that I might take some of the
slaver's crew, but that he could not spare his own men. I went
forward to where they were collected, but found only three, to
whom Harry and I had rendered some service in dressing their
wounds, willing to give themselves any trouble in performing the
task. They, however, got tackles rigged, and we hoisted up
three and sometimes four bodies together, all dripping with gore,
a terrible sight, and then swung them overboard. Even this took

some time. The wounded thought that they were to be treated
in the same manner, and we had great difficulty in persuading
them that we intended to do them no harm, but rather to attend
to their hurts. Altogether, fifty men had been killed, or had died
from fright, or succumbed directly they were lifted on deck from
their wour.ds. Charley proposed having the survivors up, so that
the slave-deck might be washed and cleaned from the mass of
gore and filth collected upon it, but Mr. Hallton replied that it
was perfectly unnecessary, and that if the slaves should break
loose, we might have to kill them all, or be ourselves overpowered.
This I thought very likely to happen, though I felt that a few
might safely be brought up while the part of the deck they had
sat upon was cleansed. Harry and I, however, did our best to
attend to their wants. We carried down water and supplied a
cup to each. They mostly received the water scarcely casting a
glance of gratitude towards us; but one man exhibited a marked
contrast to this behaviour, and, as I handed him the cup, he
exclaimed before drinking it—" Tankee, massa, tankee, massa,"
and then quaffed it eagerly, showing how much his parched throat
required the refreshing fluid.
"Do you understand English?" I asked, thinking perhaps
that these were the only words he could speak.
"Yes, massa; him talky English, him serve board English
ship."
I inquired his name. He told me it was Aboh. I found,
however, that although he might understand me, his vocabulary
was very limited. I should have liked to have given him another
cup of water, but as I knew that the rest of the slaves would
consider themselves ill-treated if I favoured one more than
another, I refrained from doing so, but I promised to remember
him. I then begged that he would speak to his companions,
and advise them to be quiet, telling them that we would do
everything in our power for their benefit. I heard him shout out
what appeared to me to be perfect gibberish, but it had the

THE CAPTAIN BECOMES CALM. 89
desired effect, and they at once became far more tranquil than
they had hitherto been.
Night was now rapidly coming on; the frigate was hove to
about half a mile to windward, and, as Tubbs observed to me,
both ships appeared to be making very fine weather of it con-
sidering the heavy gale blowing. The frigate showed signal lights,
and the lieutenant ordered ours to be hoisted in return.
Captain Roderick had hitherto remained lashed to the mast,
but he could not, without cruelty, be left there all night, and it
was necessary to decide what should be done with him. Lieu-
tenant Hallton considered that it would be sufficient to shut him
up in one of the cabins and place a sentry over him. Charley
suggested that his wrists, at all events, should be placed in irons,
as in his savage mood it was impossible to say what he might do.
The lieutenant was obstinate.
"The man was only acting as he believed right in defending
his own ship, and I'm not one to tyrannise over a fallen enemy,"
he answered in somewhat a scornful tone.
Charley could say no more. The lieutenant went below to look
out for a suitable cabin in which to place Captain Roderick—
Tubbs, Harry, and I, with three men, accompanied him. To our
surprise, we found the pirate quiet enough. His mad fit had
apparently passed away.
"I am sorry to give you all this trouble," he said quite calmly.
"You young gentlemen will, I hope, return good for evil, and I
shall be grateful."
We were, however, not to be deceived by such an address.
Charley replied that his orders were to place him in his cabin by
himself, and that was better treatment than he might have
expected.
"Certainly," answered Captain Roderick, looking quite pleased;
"it is a favour I should not have ventured to ask for. If my
steward has escaped, I'll trouble you to tell him I should like
some food. He is a good cook, and if you order him, he will

prepare supper for you, gentlemen. He knows where all the
provisions are stowed and will speedily carry out your direc-
tions."
On this being reported to Mr. Hallton, he immediately ordered
supper to be prepared in the chief cabin.
As I moved across the deck, the only difference I could see
between the man-of-war's men and the pirates was, that the
former were armed and that the latter were not; but as they stiil
numbered more men than the party from the " Rover," it struck
me that they might easily possess themselves of the means of
offence and master their captors. During daylight it was not
likely that they would venture to do this, as the frigate would
quickly have retaken the ship. I clearly remember this idea
passing through my mind. As Harry and I had had nothing but
farina for the past three days, and for several hours we had been
without food, we were very glad when we were summoned into
the cabin. Here we found a really handsome repast spread out,
everything secured by " fiddles " and "puddings," for the ship was
tumbling about too much to allow the plates and glasses other-
wise to have remained on the table.
As Tubbs was a respectable man in his appearance, the
lieutenant, with more politeness than might have been expected,
invited him to supper. It may be supposed that we all did
justice to the meal placed before us. Charley had to go on deck
until the lieutenant had finished supper; when he had done so,
he went up saying that he would send my brother down to have
some food.
Charley, however, had to hurry again on deck, as he said Mr.
Hallton wanted him to keep a look-out. The lieutenant had,
considering the time he had been occupied, imbibed no small
amount of liquor, though it did not appear to have affected his
head.
Harry, Tubbs, and I ate our suppers more leisurely. As may
be supposed, having obtained but a few winks of sleep the two

THE TABLES TURNED.

previous nights, we soon became drowsy. Harry proposed
turning in.
"If we do, we must keep one eye open and our hangers by
our sides," observed Tubbs. "I don't quite like the freedom of
the lieutenant with these buccaneering fellows. If we hadn't got
the King's ship close to us, they would be playing us some scurvy
trick, depend upon that."
As Harry and I could be of no use on deck at night, and
Tubbs really required rest, we all lay down, Harry and I each
taking a sofa at the further end of the cabin, while Tubbs stowed
himself away in a berth which had been occupied by one of the
mates who had been killed in the late action. I was just drop-
ping off to sleep when I heard a scuffle, and on looking up, what
was my dismay to see two seamen grasping the arms of the
lieutenant, who had just before entered the cabin, while two
others were hauling Charley along. The sentry, instead of
attempting to assist Mr. Hallton, presented his musket at us,
exclaiming—
"If you interfere, gentlemen, I am ordered to shoot you."
As we saw several other men at the entrance of the cabin with
muskets in their hands, we knew that resistance was useless. I
was indeed too much astonished and confused, suddenly awakened
as I had been out of my sleep, to say or do anything. I fancied
for some seconds that I was dreaming. Here were the tables
turned, and that with a vengeance. It was very evident that the
pirates had tampered with the man-of-war's men, who were pro-
bably a bad lot, as was too often the case on board King's ships
in those days, and that thus they had easily been won over. Mr.
Hallton's folly and obstinacy had also greatly contributed to
enable the pirates to carry out their project. I should have been
less surprised had Captain Roderick been at liberty, but, as far
as I could then see, he had had no hand in the business. I had
good reason to dread the way he would serve us when he once
more found himself in command of the ship and that we were in

his power, when he would, I feared, wreak his vengeance on our
heads for the way we had treated him.
These thoughts passed rapidly through my mind. Harry and
Tubbs, who had been fast asleep, were awakened by the entrance
of the party, and now sat up rubbing their eyes, as much aston-
ished as I had been.
Tubbs, who was but partly awake, sprang to his feet and made
a step forward as if to interfere, but seeing the sentry pointing his
musket at his head, he sat down again.
"Well, this is a pretty go," he exclaimed. "Who commands
this ship I should like to know, and then I can settle whether I'll
do duty or turn in and go to sleep again?"
"Belay your jaw-tackle, master." growled out one of the
pirates who had advanced into the cabin. "You're mighty too
free with your tongue, fine fellow as you think yourself. A better
man than you commands her, and he'll soon show you whose
master."
I must own I cared very little about Mr. Hallton, but I felt
the deepest anxiety as to how Charley might be treated. I feared
the pirates less than I did the " Rover's " men, who had thus
turned traitors to their King an! country, for they were too likely
to add crime upon crime, and to murder their officers. Had Mr.
Hallton and Charley been armed, we might have made an effort
to release them, but they had both been deprived of their swords
and I felt sure that Harry, Tubbs, and I would be unsuccessful,
and only make matters worse.
The seamen, having now bound the arms of the two officers
behind them, led them into an inner cabin, where, shutting the
door, they locked and bolted it
.
"Now, you three, go on deck and help work the ship," said
one of the men, whom I recognised as the third officer of the
"Vulture," but who had slipped into sailor's clothes, probably to
deceive his captors.
I could scarcely suppose that all this time Captain Roderick

THE PIRATE'S CUNNING TRICK.
93
had any hand in the mutiny, for, to the best of my belief, he
had been shut up in the cabin, and was still there. The mate
seemed to be of the same opinion, for he bade the sentry open
the door. He did so, when Captain Roderick was seen stretched
on his couch. At the first glance I thought he was dead,
but he was only in a deep sleep, so deep that all the noise
outside had not aroused him. The mate shook him by the arm,
but it had no effect. I was thankful for this, for I dreaded
that, should he awake and find us in his power, he might
commit some act of violence. Lest he should be awakened,
Harry, Tubbs, and I gladly made our escape on deck. I prayed
that no harm would be done to Charley, for I felt more anxious
about him than about myself. On reaching the deck, I looked
out for the frigate, I could just see her light away to windward,
but it seemed to me much further off than before. The gale had
abated somewhat, but both ships were still hove to. The mate
speedily followed us up, and gave orders to the men to bring
some long spars to the quarter-deck. He then got a grating, to
which he fixed the spars upright, so as to form a cone-shaped
structure; then turning it over, he secured some rather shorter
spars in the same way, fixing a shot at the point where they
united. Inside the points of the upper end, a ship's lantern was
securely hung, when the machine was carefully lowered overboard,
the light we had hitherto carried being extinguished. Immedi-
ately this was done, the order was given to put the helm up, and
the foresail being squared away, we ran before the gale, leaving
the light burning at the spot where we had been. There was no
doubt about its object; it was to deceive the man-of-war, so that,
until the trick was discovered, it was not likely that we should
be chased. The hope that I had hitherto entertained that we
might, after all, be quickly recaptured, now vanished. The mate
assumed the command—the crew seemed willing to obey him.
Whether he intended to retain it or not I could not tell, but I
thought that he certainly would should he find that Captain

Roderick remained as mad as I was convinced he was when he
attempted to blow up the ship.
As the gale slightly decreased, more sail was made, and before
morning the " Vulture" had as much canvas packed on her as
she could carry. We were kept on deck pulling and hauling
until our arms ached. When dawn broke I looked astern. The
frigate was nowhere to be seen.

AS the day advanced the wind decreased, and the ship close-
hauled was headed up towards the coast. How far off we
were I could not tell, but Tubbs told me he should not consider
that we were less than a hundred miles, perhaps more.
"So far that's satisfactory. It is possible that the 1 Rover'
may overtake us," I observed.
"If she finds out the course we have steered, sir; but we had
run seventy or eighty miles at least before she was likely to
discover the trick the pirates played her. Besides, to tell you
the truth, I'd rather she didn't overtake us. The fellows on
board would fight with ropes round their necks, and they would
not give in as long as a plank held together, and then we should

have to go down with them. I would rather run the chance of
getting on shore and making our escape afterwards."
I at once agreed with him, and we made up our minds that
it would be well for us to get out of the ship without the risk
of another battle. The mate, I observed, remained on deck,
issuing all the necessary orders; the boatswain of the " Vulture"
and one of the man-of-war's men, with one of the mutineers,
acting as his subordinates. He ordered Harry and me about,
treating us like the common seamen, and if we were not as smart as
he wished us to be, he sent the boatswain or the mutineer from
the " Rover " with a rope's end to start us. Tubbs at once fell
into his ordinary duty of boatswain. The mate, it appeared to
me, wished to win him over, and always spoke civilly to him,
although he was not very particular in regard to his language
when he addressed us. The evening was drawing in, we had
been on deck all day. I was, of course, very anxious to know
how it fared with poor Charley, who was kept a prisoner below.
Whenever Harry or I attempted to leave the deck, the mate
called us back and told us to attend to our duty. We got some
food, however, for the cook, a good-natured black fellow, gave
us some at the caboose, or we should have starved. Still, it was
much better than being shut up in the dark hold, and, of course,
we wished to avoid being sent below to our former place of
confinement. I saw some messes of soup and porridge being
cooked and carried into the cabin, and I concluded, therefore,
that Lieutenant Hallton and Charley would be fed. Harry and
I agreed that it would be wiser for us to obey the orders of the
mate as long as he thought fit to issue them.
"I shall go and lie down in the cabin," said Harry to me. "I
can but be sent up again, and I have no fancy to go and sleep
among the men."
Accordingly, as soon as it grew dark, while the mate was
looking another way, we slipped into the cabin, and coiled our-
selves up on the sofas we had before occupied. Tired as I was,

CHARLEY AND THE LIEUTENANT IN DANGER. 97
however, the heat and the cockroaches and the thoughts of
our dangerous position kept me awake, although I tried hard
to go to sleep. A lamp hung from the deck above, but
the part of the cabin where we were was in perfect shade.
I had not lain long when I saw the door of Captain
Roderick's cabin open, and out he stepped, looking round
him as if trying to recover his scattered senses. Presently he
advanced across the cabin, when, by the light which fell upon
him, I saw that he held a pistol in his hand; what he was about
to do with it I could not tell. To my horror, he opened the
door of the cabin in which the lieutenant and Charley were con-
fined. Although he had looked unusually calm as the light fell
on his countenance, the moment I saw his movements I felt con-
vinced that he had some evil intention. Springing up, I grasped
Harry by the arm, and rushed towards the open door. I could
see the lieutenant and Charley standing upright close together,
with their arms bound behind them against the opposite bulk-
head.
"Oh, oh!" exclaimed the captain, fixing his eyes on the lieutenant;
"you thought to capture me and hang me at your yard-arm; but
the yarn's not spun nor the bullet cast which is to take my life.
I might order you on deck and run you up to the yard-arm before
five minutes are over; but I intend to have the satisfaction of
shooting you myself."
Lieutenant Hallton, unprincipled man as I believe he was,
stood calm and unmoved. Charley was endeavouring to draw
his arms out of the ropes which bound them. Twice Captain
Roderick lowered his pistol as if he had changed his mind, but
still he went on taunting the unfortunate officer. It would have
been prudent in the latter to have held his tongue, but instead he
went on answering taunt for taunt, rather than endeavouring to
calm the rage of the pirate captain, which increased till I feared
every instant that he would pull the trigger.
Harry and I stood ready to spring upon him, but I saw that in
G

doing so we might run the risk of making him fire the pistol, and
bring about the very catastrophe we desired to prevent. Charley
in the meantime caught sight of us. I made a sign to Harry to
get out his knife. I knew that to cut the ropes which bound my
brother's hands would be the work of a moment, and I hoped,
by the suddenness of the attack we were about to make, to keep
Captain Roderick down until that object was effected. We should
then be three to one, or four to one if we saved the lieutenant's
life.
Harry understood perfectly what he was to do. One bound
would carry him to where the pirate stood. The moment came;
I sprang forward, and throwing my arms round his neck, kicked
him violently behind the knees. Although I was so much lighter,
the effect was what I expected. Down he fell, and his pistol went
off, the ball grazing the lieutenant's forehead. The lashings which
held Charley were cut, and he immediately came to my assistance,
while Harry performed the same office for the lieutenant without
difficulty. The sound of the pistol would, I feared, bring some
of the crew down upon us. Fortunately at that moment a strong
breeze had struck the ship. The officers were issuing their orders,
so that we had hopes we might be undisturbed. No time, how-
ever, was to be lost. We quickly lashed the pirate's arms and
legs, and crammed a handkerchief into his mouth. Lieutenant
Hallton proposed to throw him overboard, and then, rushing
together on deck, to master the officers, and try to recall the crew
back to their duty. To the first part of the proposal none of us
agreed, but we forthwith dragged the unhappy man back to his
cot and lifted him in. He appeared to me to be insensible.
At all events, when Charley took the handkerchief out of his
mouth, he did not cry out or utter a word, although his eyes
glared at us.
"We might have put you to death," said Charley, "but you
are safe if you will remain quiet, and not attempt to summon any
one to set you free."

WE SECURE THE CAPTAIN.
99
The pirate did not reply, and I was doubtful if he understood
what was said to him. He must indeed have been surprised at
finding himself again a prisoner at the very moment he supposed
that he had regained his authority. We had now to decide what
to do. We might certainly master one or two officers, but it
was a question if the men from the "Rover" would return to
their duty, and still less likely that the pirates would yield to our
authority. Lieutenant Hallton then suggested that we should
drag the pirate up on deck, and, holding a pistol to his head,
threaten to shoot him if he did not order the crew to obey us.
To this I for one strongly objected.
Charley thought that Captain Roderick was perfectly mad, and
I also was very unwilling to injure a brother of Mr. Trunnion's,
villain as he was.
"If he is really mad, he will not know what has happened,"
said Charley. "The best thing you can do is to return on deck,
and try and negotiate yourself with the mate, who has now the
command, and will probably wish to keep it. Tell him that I am
your brother, and as he has no one on board who understands navi-
gation, that I shall be happy to assist him in navigating the ship;
that we have no wish to inform against him and his men if we
obtain our liberty, and that all we request is that he will set us
on shore at the first place we touch at."
This seemed the only feasible plan, and Harry and I set off to try
and find Tubbs and consult him, while Charley and the lieutenant
returned to the cabin in which they had been confined. Harry
and I, as agreed on, went on deck.
Our absence had not been discovered. Slowly groping now
on one side, now on the other, we at length discovered Tubbs.
Taking him by the arm, I led him away apart from where any one
was standing.
"To my mind, sir, the mate will be very much obliged to you
for what you have done. He has no wish to give up the command,
I can see that; and if you can persuade Captain Roderick—should

he come to his senses—that such is the case, we should have
him on our side. I suspect, also, that there are two or three
of the 'Rover's' men who are sorry for their conduct, and
would join us. The truth is, I believe, when Captain Roderick
is in his right mind, that he wishes he had a better calling, but
when the mad fit comes over him, he goes back to his bad
ways."
"That may be true," I could not help remarking, "but it is no
excuse for him; he must have an evilly disposed mind to have taken
to such a calling; he should seek for strength from Heaven to over-
come his wicked propensities. Even the worst men at times
regret the harm they have done on account of the inconvenience
and suffering it has caused them, but the next time temptation
is presented they commit the same crime, and so it goes on to
the end."
It was settled, therefore, that the next day Harry and I should
go boldly up to the mate and speak to him as agreed on, while
we were to see that no one in the meantime came down to set
the captain at liberty, though, as Tubbs observed, "The mate
would take very good care of that."
Soon after this a fresh watch was set, and as we were supposed
to be in the first watch, we took the opportunity, accompanied by
Tubbs, of again slipping down below. Scarcely had we stowed
ourselves away out of sight, than the mate came down and looked
into the captain's cabin. As not a word was spoken by either,
we concluded that he had not discovered the state of things; for,
locking the door and taking away the key, he returned to his own
cabin, which was further forward on the opposite side. Altogether,
as must be seen, affairs were in a curious state on board that
ship. I at length dropped off to sleep. How long it was
after I closed my eyes I know not, when I heard a sound like
that of a cable running out . Tubbs started up at the same
moment
.
"Why, we have just come to an anchor," he exclaimed.

AT ANCHOR.
IOI
"We must have been closer in with the land than we sup-
posed."
Harry being awakened, we both stole quietly on deck. The
crew had furled sails, the night was perfectly calm, the stars
shone brightly overhead. Looking over the larboard side, we
saw the shore, a high land with a point running from it, off
which we lay. By the ripple of the water against the bows, I
knew that a strong current was running, which accounted for the
ship having been brought up. Looking forward, I saw that a
bright light was burning at the bowsprit end, and presently it
was answered by a rocket fired from the shore, which rose high
in the air, scattering its drops as it fell. Exclamations of satis-
faction escaped the mate and several of the crew who were on
deck.
"Lower the starboard quarter-boat," shouted the mate.
"She's well-nigh knocked to pieces, and can't swim," was the
answer.
"Lower the larboard boat."
This was done, and several of the crew jumped into her, but
most of them as quickly hauled themselves on board again.
She sank beneath their feet, as she too had been injured by the
frigate's shot. The boat getting adrift, one of the men, before he
could spring up the side, was drifted away in her, the current of
which I have spoken carrying him rapidly astern. The long-
boat amidships was in a worse condition, being riddled with
shot.
"I hope that the people on shore will send off to us," observed
the mate ; "it's very certain we cannot get to them until the boats
are repaired."
"They'll not do that in a hurry; for, as it happens, the carpenter
and his crew are all killed, and there is not a man on board able
to do the work," I heard Tubbs observe.
In the meantime, the cries of the poor fellow in the sinking
boat reached our ears, but it was impossible to render him any

assistance. Farther and farther he drifted at a rapid rate, until
he and the boat were lost sight of, although, we could hear his
shouts every minute becoming fainter and fainter. At last there
arose a dreadful shriek, which, although from a distance, was
piercingly clear.
"Poor fellow ! Jack shark has got him," said Tubbs. "There
are plenty of those creatures about here, and I was sure that it
wouldn't be long before they had hold of him."
I have not mentioned the poor slaves all this time. The
wounded were suffering dreadfully, and since they had again
been sent down to the hot slave-deck, several had died. The
mate, while waiting for the expected boat, ordered some hands
below to overhaul them. Six dead bodies were brought up, which
were without ceremony thrown overboard, as if they were so
many rotten sheep, and the men reported several more not
likely to live out the night. The mate, hardened villain as he was,
did not order them to be got rid of, as was sometimes done by
slavers to save themselves trouble, and to economise the food
the poor creatures might have consumed. He became im-
patient when, after waiting some time, no boat appeared.
The weather, too, although so fine and calm when we brought
up, gave indications of a change. The sky was overcast, and
heavy undulations began to roll in towards the shore. Though
as yet the wind had not increased, our position was becoming
dangerous, and I for one wished that we were miles off the
coast.
"If there's no harbour into which we can run, we shall be
in a bad way," said Tubbs. "I suspect that the mate doesn't
know of one, or we should have steered in for it at once."
"What had we better do?" I asked.
"Do, sir! Why, there's nothing we can do but ask God to
take care of us. If it comes on to blow, as I believe it will, ten
to one but that the ship is driven on shore, and with the heavy
surf there will be, before many hours are over, breaking on the

A GALE SPRINGS UP.
103
coast, and the sharks waiting for us outside, there won't be many
who will reach the shore alive. The best swimmers could not
help themselves, and that's all I can say."
I was convinced of the truth of what Tubbs said. That he
was right with respect to a gale approaching was soon proved,
the wind, bursting suddenly on us, striking the ship, and, although
all her sails were furled, making her heel over before it, and at
the same time the rollers which came in from the offing increased
in height, and we could hear their roar as they broke on the
shore to leeward. The ship pitched fearfully into them, and
every moment I expected to see the cable part. Should such be
the case, I was very sure that not many minutes afterwards all
on board would be struggling for their lives. I thought of my
brother and the lieutenant, and of the unhappy captain. I
intended, should the cable part, immediately to rush below and
set them all at liberty. Although the captain had so cruelly
ill-treated us, I could not reconcile it to my conscience to allow
him to perish without a chance of escaping, which he would do
were he left bound hand and foot. I told Harry what I thought
of doing.
"No doubt," he said. "Should the captain escape, he would
scarcely fail to be grateful to us for saving his life; and if he is
drowned notwithstanding, we have done our duty."
The mate, who had been below, now came on deck. He
evidently did not like the look of things. Two or three times
he went forward and examined the cable, at which the ship
seemed to be tugging with all her might as she rose on the
summits of the heavy foaming swells. He then got another cable
ranged to let go should the first part.
"If I were him, I'd get ready to make sail. The sky looks to
me as if the wind were coming more to the south'ard ; and if so, we
may chance to stand off shore should the ship cast the right
way."
"I would not hesitate to tell him so," I observed; "when

his life may depend upon it, he may perhaps take your advice,
although he will not follow that of any other man."
"At all events, I'll try it," said Tubbs; and going up to the
mate, he told him what he thought. I had very little hope,
however, that the mate would listen to him.
"You think yourself a better seaman than I am. Just go and
attend to your duty," was the answer. Not two minutes had
elapsed, however, before the mate ordered the crew to stand
by the halyards. Presently he shouted, "All hands make
sail."
The boatswain went forward, axe in hand, to cut the cable.
The topsails, closely reefed, were let fall, the fore-staysail and jib
hoisted.
"Cut!" shouted the mate.
The ship cast the right way to starboard, the helm was put to
port, and she begun to stand off from the shore.
"She'll do it, and we shall have a new lease of life," observed
Tubbs when he rejoined Harry and me; "that is to say, if the
wind holds as it is ; but if not, the chances of our hauling off the
shore are doubtful."
For some minutes the ship stood on with her head to the north-
west, all hands anxiously watching the sails, and casting a look every
now and then towards the dark outline of the shore, which could
be distinguished through the gloom. The current was all this
time drifting us to the northward, but it appeared to me that we
were getting no farther from the coast. Of that, however, it was
difficult to judge by the rate at which we were sailing, as although
she might be moving fast through the water, she might really be
making but little way over the ground. Tubbs several times
went aft to the binnacle.
"She has fallen off two points, I'm sorry to say," he observed;
"still it is possible that we may beat off, as the wind may shift
again; but I wish that it had kept steady, and we should have
done it."


## p. 105 (#151) ############################################

A DANGEROUS POSITION.
IOS
Scarcely, however, had he spoken, when the sails gave a loud
flap.
"No higher!" shouted the mate to the man at the helm, "or
you'll have her aback."
The helm was put up in time to prevent this danger.
On looking over the starboard side, we now saw that the land
was broad on the beam, and that we were thus standing almost
parallel with the coast, towards which it was too evident that the
heavy rollers were gradually setting us. Still it was possible, as
Tubbs thought, to keep off the shore until daylight, when the
mouth of a river might be discovered and we might run into it;
or the wind might again shift, and we should, once more, be able
to stand off, and get to a safe distance from the hungry breakers,
which we could hear roaring under our lee. I was struck by the
change which had come over the crew. Generally, when on
deck together, they were shouting and swearing, and exchanging
rough jokes or laughing loudly. Now scarcely a man spoke,
all stood at their stations turning their gaze towards the shore.
It was evident they were fully aware of the dangerous position
in which the ship was placed. I asked Tubbs how long he
thought the ship could be kept off the land, standing as she was
now.
"Oh, maybe for half an hour, maybe for less," he answered.
"The current is sending her along at the rate of two or three
knots an hour, and we may fall in with some headland which we
are unable to weather, or we may find ourselves standing across
a wide bay which will lengthen the time before she drives on
shore."
"At all events, I will tell my brother and Mr. Hallton. It
will be wrong to let them remain longer in ignorance of the
danger we are in. Perhaps we ought to set the captain at
liberty."
"No, no, sir; let him stay until the last, we don't know what
mad things he will do if he comes on deck. Perhaps he will be

shooting the mate or one of us. It will be time enough to let
him out of the cabin when all chance of saving the ship is
gone."
I saw at once the prudence of this, and settled to act accord-
ingly. Taking an opportunity, I slipped below, and found Charley
and Mr. Hallton asleep. Having roused them up, " I have not
got very pleasant information to give you," I said; and I then
told them that Tubbs considered the ship would drive on shore
in less than half an hour.
Mr. Hallton, though supposed to be a brave man, was much
more agitated than was Charley.
"The ship cast on this abominable coast in less than half an
hour !" he exclaimed. "Why, even down here, the sound of the
breakers reaches us."
"Well, Dick, if the worst comes to the worst, we must have a
struggle for life," said my brother calmly. "You stick to me, and
I'll do my best to help you. I am well accustomed to the sort of
work we shall have to go through, and I hope that we shall manage
somehow or other to get on shore." Of course, they were both
unwilling to remain longer below, and as neither the mate nor the
crew were likely to interfere, they made up their minds to come on
deck with me. I had some hopes that Mr. Hallton, who was a
first-rate seaman, might devise some means for escaping. I first
consulted Charley about setting the captain at liberty, but he
thought that it would not be prudent to do so until the last moment,
when it would be right to give him a chance of saving his life with
the rest of us. We soon gained the deck. Whether Charley or
the lieutenant were observed, I could not tell. I waited anxiously
to hear what opinion Mr. Hallton might offer as to the state of
affairs-.
"If we get much nearer the shore, we must bring up, and
perhaps the anchor will hold until the wind moderates. It
is the only chance we have of saving the ship. If we were
to go about now, we might miss stays, and there is not room

THE SHIP CLOSE TO THE BREAKERS.
107
to wear without getting perilously close to the breakers," he
observed.
At the rate we were sailing, we must have gone over thirty or
forty miles from the point where we exchanged signals with the
shore, and as most probably the country was inhabited by a
different tribe, who might be at enmity with the white men,
those of us who might reach the shore would run a great
chance of being slaughtered or carried off into slavery. I said
as much to Harry and Charley. The same idea had occurred
to them.
"It may be the case, but we may fall among friends, and we
will hope for the best," observed Charley.
Dawn was at length approaching, but there was no abate-
ment of the gale, while it was too clear that we were drifting
nearer and nearer to the coast . Every moment I expected to
hear the mate give the word to furl'the sails and let go the
anchor. I suggested to Tubbs that he should advise him to
do so.
'' He would not listen to me; although he may know it is the
best thing to be done, he'll just put off doing it until it's too
late," he answered.
Gradually the coast became more and more distinct, and
we could make out the white line of breakers as they burst
upon it. We stood watching it with straining eyes, the minutes
turned into hours, the ship all the time rushing through the
water at a furious rate. Presently a headland appeared on the
starboard bow. It seemed impossible that we could weather
it. Still the mate issued no order except to the man at the
helm.
"Luff all you can," he shouted out; "we don't want to cast
the ship away on that point if we can help it."
In a few minutes—how many I cannot say—we saw the breakers
close under our lee, the ship was almost among them, but on she
stood. Again the land appeared to recede.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"Can there be a harbour in anywhere here?" I asked of
Tubbs.
"The mate doesn't think so, or we should be running into it,"
was the answer.
It was only a small bay across which we were passing. Not a
quarter of an hour afterwards another point appeared. As we
had succeeded in weathering the first, the mate evidently expected
to pass this in the same way.
Mr. Hallton, convinced that we could not do so, shouted out,
"Down with the helm—shorten sail—let go the anchor—let fly
everything."
"Who dares give orders on board this ship?" cried the
mate.
The crew, however, were convinced that the first order was the
wisest. The tacks, sheets, and halyards were let go, the stoppers
of the cable cut, the helm put down to bring her up to the wind.
She pitched into the seas, but the anchor held. The crew
now flew aloft to try and gather in the canvas, fluttering wildly in
the gale.
"In three minutes more we should have been knocking to
pieces on the rocks," observed Mr. Hallton. "It is a question
whether the anchor will hold now; if it doesn't, we sha'n't be
much better off."
Scarcely had he spoken when a loud report was heard. "The
cable has parted !" shouted several voices.
"Let go the last hope."
The anchor so called was let go, and although it brought the
ship up in a couple of minutes, it also parted, and the helpless
ship now drifted rapidly towards the breakers, which could be
seen curling up along the shores of the bay into which we had
driven.
"Come aft," said Charley to Harry and me. "The moment
the ship strikes the masts will go, and we shall chance to be
crushed as they fall."

THE SHIP STRIKES.
I09
"The time has come to set Captain Trunnion at liberty," I
said.
Charley and I hurried below and burst open the door of the
cabin. The unhappy man was still sleeping, with his dog Growler
at his feet. Surly as the animal was to others, he was faithful to
his master, and he seemed to understand that we had come with
no evil intentions, for though he uttered a low bark, he did not
attempt to fly at us. By the light of the lamp we saw that the
captain had no arms near him. To cut the ropes which bound
his limbs was the work of a moment.
"Captain Trunnion," I exclaimed, "we have come to warn
you that the ship will be in the midst of the breakers in the course
of a minute or two. If you wish to save your life you must come
upon deck."
Not, however, until Harry and Charley had shaken him well
did he wake up. He gazed around him with a bewildered
look.
"What is that you say?" he asked.
In a few sentences I told him.
"Then it is time to look out to save our lives," he said spring-
ing up, apparently quite himself. He looked as cool and com-
posed as he had ever been. We were about to return on deck,
when there came a fearful crash overhead, followed by several
others. The ship had struck and the masts had all gone together
by the board. Shrieks and cries arose, but many of the voices
were speedily silenced, as the sea, breaking over the ship, washed
several men from the deck into the seething cauldron into which
she had been driven. The captain, followed by Growler, sprang up
the companion ladder, and we saw no more of them. The cries
of the helpless slaves below, uniting in one fearful chorus, over-
whelmed the voices of the white crew.
"We must set these poor wretches at liberty. It would be a
fearful subject of thought if we were to leave them to perish,"
observed Charley. "There is a hatch, I know, which leads

from the main cabin to the slave-deck, although it is kept
closed."
"Ay, ay, sir! But we can't do it without the instruments,"
said Tubbs. Hunting about, he discovered some irons used for
the purpose, with which we each supplied ourselves. With this
means we soon opened the hatch.
There was great risk in the merciful task we were about to
perform, but Charley, setting the example, we quickly knocked
off the manacles of Aboh and the slaves nearest to us, and, with
the assistance of the former, made them understand that they
were to perform the same operation to their fellow-captives.
Some obeyed, but others rushed immediately on deck. How-
ever, we persevered, and, faster than I could have believed it
possible, we contrived to set all the slaves free. Many of the
poor wretches enjoyed their liberty but for a few seconds, for
they were quickly washed off the deck, or were drowned in a vain
attempt to reach the shore by swimming. All the time the sea
was striking with terrific force against the sides of the ship. The
loud crashing sound overhead showed us that her bowsprit and
bulwarks and everything on deck was being rapidly carried
away.
While we were thus engaged daylight appeared, and when we
Teached the deck we saw that the wind had greatly gone down.
Although there were rocks on either side of us, there was a clear
piece of sand, on which, could a raft be formed, those who could not
swim might land. The blacks were mostly clustered aft, the part
least exposed to the fury of the seas. Several persons were in the
water, some swimming, others floating apparently lifeless. The
greater portion of the crew had disappeared; many had been
crushed by the falling masts, others washed overboard, and a few
on pieces of wreck were trying to reach the beach. One thing
was certain, there was no time to be lost, as the ship could not
long hold together, lashed as she was by the fury of the seas
which rolled in from the ocean. The surviving blacks recognised

111
us when we appeared as the persons who had set them at liberty,
and we made them understand that if they would remain quiet,
we would endeavour to provide the means for enabling them to
reach the shore. I thought that among the people clinging to
pieces of wreck I saw Captain Trunnion, but I was not certain.
The mate had disappeared, and had, I concluded, been washed
overboard, and, as far as we could learn, Mr. Hallton had shared
the same fate. We had reason to be thankful that we had been
below, or we also might have lost our lives. We immediately set
about forming the raft from some spars which still remained
lashed to ring bolts on the deck and from fragments of the bul-
warks. Every instant the wind was going down, rendering our
task less difficult. The tide too was falling, and as it did so rocks
rose out of the water, which further protected us from the fury of
the breakers. When the blacks saw what we were about, some
of the more intelligent among them offered to assist us. At
length a raft capable of holding a dozen people at one time was
constructed. We also obtained a rope of sufficient length to
reach the shore, so that we might haul it backwards and for-
wards. This we made the blacks understand that we intended to
do, and that we could only take off a certain number at a time.
The head men, who had all along held an authority over the rest
of their fellow-slaves, now came forward to maintain discipline.
By this means only the number which the raft could carry were
allowed to descend at a time. As soon as we had a cargo we
commenced our passage to the shore, and happily landed all
those we had taken on board, who at once squatted down on the
beach waiting for their companions. We immediately put back
and took in another cargo, and thus we continued going back-
wards and forwards until we had placed the whole of the slaves
on shore.
"We must look out for ourselves now," observed Charley. "I
saw some firearms in the cabin; we must secure them, as well

as some ammunition, clothes, and provisions. It will not do to
trust those black fellows when they at once find themselves at
liberty."
Of course we all agreed to Charley's proposal, and climbing up
the side, made our way into the cabin. We each got a fowling-
piece or musket, a brace of pistols, and a good supply of
ammunition. We also found some dollars, which we stowed
away in our pockets.
"The money may not be of much use while we are among the
savages, but it will come in very handy when we get into a more
civilised region," said Charley. "Hurrah! here are some things
which will be of immediate use," and he produced a boxful of
strings of beads of various colours.
We each stowed away as many of them as we could carry.
Under the circumstances in which we were likely to be placed,
they would prove of the greatest value.
As the ship it appeared probable would hold together for some
time, we hunted about until we found as many things as we
could carry likely to be of use. Among others, were a pocket
compass, a knife apiece, and other things. Tubbs produced a
cooked ham and a box of biscuits, which were divided and put
into some canvas bags well suited for the purpose. We were
still engaged in our search, when a loud crashing sound reached
our ears. We rushed on deck, and found that the sea had made
a breach clean through the ship. Fortunately the raft was secured
to the after part. We quickly lowered ourselves down on it, and
shoved off in time to escape another sea, which came rolling in,
and committed further damage, sending fragments of the wreck
floating about in the comparatively smooth water between us and
the shore. We had great difficulty in avoiding the pieces of
timber which were driven towards our frail raft. Every moment
it seemed as if we were about to be overwhelmed. On looking
towards the beach, we found that the blacks had disappeared,

with the exception of one man, who stood ready to assist us
in getting on shore. A few more hauls on the raft, and we,
with our packs, were able to spring on the sand, the black
seizing our hands as we did so, one after the other, and
dragging us up out of the seething water, which came foaming
up around us.

CHAPTER VII.
The black Aboh remains with our party—The march towards the forest—
Charley chosen leader—Sufferings from thirst—We find traces of the
blacks—An enemy at hand—Battle between the natives—Flight and pur-
suit of the beaten party—Fear of being captured—We conceal ourselves—
I and Aboh attempt to succour the wounded—We rejoin our friends and
push forward—Our thirst becomes intense —I am on the point of sinking
—Encouraged by Harry, I struggle on—Water discovered—Aboh's duck-
hunting—Napping on guard—The big snake—We decide on the route to
be taken—Making hats.
OUR first impulse on reaching dry ground was to kneel
down and thank Heaven for having mercifully preserved
our lives, the black standing by and watching us with a wonder-
ing look as we did so. We rose to our feet.
"Where are the rest?" I asked of the friendly negro, whom
I recognised to be Aboh, the man to whom I had given water in
the slaver's hold, and whom I had just set at liberty.
He pointed over his shoulder, signifying that they had gone
inland.
"And you wish to remain with us?" I asked, at once seeing
that it would be of importance to have a native with us who
might act as our guide and interpreter.
"Yes, massa; me like white man. Once serve board man-
of-war; cappen kind, sailors kind; but me went on shore to see
me fadder, modder, me brodder, me sister; but dey all get
catchee, an* all de oder people run 'way, an' dey take me for
slavee."

## p. 115 (#161) ############################################

WE CONSULT WHAT TO DO.
The beach, which was here of some height, prevented us at first
from seeing what had become of the people; but climbing up
the bank of fine sand to the summit, we caught sight of some
of them making their way towards the forest, about half a
mile off.
"They have gone there, poor fellows, to look for food, or perhaps
some of them think that they are not far from home, and expect
to get back again," observed Tubbs.
This appeared very likely. Before, however, we set off to
join our companions in misfortune, we searched about for any
of the white men who might have been cast by the surf on the
beach. We found several dead bodies, but not a single living
person could we discover. On looking eastward, we observed
numerous rocks, stretching out to a considerable distance, which,
now that the tide had fallen, appeared above water. It was a
mercy that the "Vulture" escaped striking on any of them, for,
had she done so, she must have been knocked to pieces at a
distance from the shore, and probably not one of us would have
escaped alive.
We now sat down on the beach and consulted what to do.
As it was not likely that any ship, trader, or man-of-war, or even
slaver, would willingly come near that part of the coast, we resolved
to travel either to the north or the south, hoping to reach one of
the French settlements, which existed at the mouths of two or
three of the rivers running into the ocean in that region. On
looking along the shore on both hands, we saw a wide extent
of sand.
"It will never do to attempt travelling over that, gentlemen,"
said Tubbs. "We shall certainly find no shade, and probably
not a drop of water, without which we cannot get along. If
you'll take my advice, you'll follow the blacks to the forest.
It's water, to a certainty, they've gone to look after; they're
thirsty beings, and their instinct has told them where they can
find it."

Il6 THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Aboh, who had been listening all the time, evidently under-
stood what was said, and nodded his head. We, that is, Charley,
Harry, and I, agreed to do as Tubbs had proposed, and we all
accordingly set off eastward, accompanied by the black. The
forest appeared much further away than we supposed, or per-
haps the soft sand, into which our feet sank at every step, made
us think the distance longer than it really was. The sun, which
was now high in the heavens, beat down with terrific force upon
our heads, and as we had on only our sea-caps, which afforded
little or no protection, we felt the heat greatly. We found some
comfort, however, by shifting our packs on to our heads. Aboh,
who saw how much we suffered, offered to relieve us of them.
He carried my pack and his own on his head, and another on
his shoulders, with perfect ease. I bethought me of a handker-
chief which I had in my pocket, and fastened it like a turban
over my cap; Harry imitated my example. Charley and Tom,
who were stronger than either of us, continued to carry their
packs with comparative ease on their heads. We had lost sight
of the blacks, the last of whom had disappeared before we
commenced our march. At length we reached the outskirts of
the forest, and were thankful to sit down and rest under the
shade of a tree.
"I have been thinking," said Harry, "that we ought to have
a leader who should decide what we should do. It will save a
good deal of trouble and discussion."
"You are right, Mr. Bracewell," said Tom, "that's what I've
been thinking too; and I propose that we at once elect Mr.
Westerton, Mr. Harry's brother. Although I'm older than any of
you, he's a naval officer, and I for one shall be ready to obey
him."
Of course Harry and I agreed to this, and Aboh, who under-
stood almost everything we said, nodded his head, just to show
that he also consented to the proposal.
"I will do my best, my friends," said Charley, "although,

had you chosen Mr. Tubbs, I should have been willing to
follow him, for I feel convinced that he is a man of courage and
judgment."
"Thank you, sir, for your good opinion," said Tom. "You
have been more accustomed to command than I have, although
I shall be happy to give you any advice whenever you ask it,
to the best of my power."
"Well, then," said Charley, "the first use I will make of my
authority is to select a northerly route. I have been trying to
recall the map of the country, which I frequently studied on
board the 'Rover,' and I think we shall, by proceeding as I pro-
pose, fall in with the Gaboon River, at the mouth of which there
is a French settlement . I remember that three days before the
frigate captured the pirate we sighted Cape Lopez, some way to
the south of which I calculate we now are, in what I think is
called the Pongo country."
"I believe you are right, sir," said Tom. "We shall have to
make a pretty long march though, I suspect; but if we can manage
to keep near the coast, we may sight a ship, and by making signals,
get her to send a boat on shore to take us off; always provided
there happens to be no great amount of surf."
"Well then, friends, if you are all rested, we will commence
our march," said Charley. "We will first, however, try to overtake
the blacks, who, as Mr. Tubbs observes, have been led by their
instinct, or rather their knowledge of the country, in the direction
where water is to be found; and I daresay you all feel as I do—
very thirsty."
"That I do, sir," said Tom. "I feel for all the world as if my
mouth was a dusthole, and that a bucketful of hot cinders had
been thrown into it."
We confessed that our sensations were very similar to those
Tom described. We accordingly all got up and shouldered our
packs, for neither Harry nor I would allow Aboh to carry ours
any longer; not that we thought he would attempt to run

away with them. We told him, however, when we camped in the
evening, that we would divide them, so as to give him a separate
package, and thus we should all have an equal load to carry.
Aboh pointed out the direction in which, from the appearance of
the trees, he believed we should find water, and eagerly led the
way.
It was farther inland than we had intended to go, but from
his description we made out that there was a lake or pond fed
by a stream coming down from the mountains of the interior,
and which afterwards lost itself in the sand. We had gone some
distance when Aboh made a sign for us to note that the ground
had been trampled down by many feet, and that the people who
had passed that way had broken off a number of young saplings,
probably to form spears, and had also torn down the boughs
to serve as other weapons of offence or defence. After going a
short distance farther, the sound of voices reached our ears.
Aboh shook his head. "No good, no good," he muttered, and
made us understand that we must advance cautiously.
Presently he again stopped, and advised us by signs to con-
ceal ourselves. He then crept forward, crouching down beneath
the bushes, so that he could not be perceived by any persons
in front.
"I'll go forward and try and learn what his object is," I whis-
pered to my companions; and Charley not forbidding me, I
imitated Aboh's example and quickly overtook him. He turned
on hearing my footsteps, and seeing that I was resolved to accom-
pany him, made a sign to me to be cautious. We had not gone
far when the sounds we had before heard became so loud that I
knew we must be close upon the people who were uttering them.
After advancing a few paces farther, on looking through the
bushes I saw a large party of blacks encamped in an open spot
surrounded by tall trees. They were evidently in an excited state,
looking up the glade as if they expected some one to approach.
They were mostly employed in sharpening the ends of long poles

in several fires they had lighted. I at once recognised them as
the blacks whom we had assisted to escape from the wreck.
They numbered, however, fewer than those who had landed, and
I concluded, therefore, that some had deserted their companions in
misfortune. Those who had gone away probably belonged to a
tribe in the neighbourhood, and were endeavouring to reach their
own people.
We were not long left in doubt as to the cause of their
excitement. Some distance off we caught sight of another large
party of negrqes advancing with threatening gestures, many of
them being armed with muskets and bayonets. On seeing this,
Aboh, seizing me by the arm, dragged me back, and motioned
me to climb into a large tree the lower branches of which we
could reach without much difficulty, he setting me the example and
assisting me up. We soon gained a place where we were com-
pletely concealed and protected by the thick boughs. Scarcely
were we seated than we saw the slaves advancing towards the new-
comers, flourishing the spears they had made and shouting savagely,
as if not aware that their opponents had firearms, or fearless of
their effects. They soon, however, discovered their mistake. The
enemy fired a volley which brought several of them to the
ground.
Notwithstanding this they rushed forward, and a fierce hand-to-
hand conflict ensued. The slaves greatly outnumbered their oppo-
nents, of whom there were probably not more than fifty or sixty, but
nearly all these had muskets. Some of the firearms, I observed,
did not go off, probably because they had no locks, or it may
have been that their powder was bad. The parties were indeed
more evenly matched than at first appeared to have been the
case. They fought with the greatest desperation. Those who
had muskets which would go off kept at a distance firing at the
slaves, while their comrades either charged with their bayonets,
or holding the barrels in their hands, used their weapons as
clubs.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Several on both sides had fallen, when a fresh party of armed
negroes appeared in the direction from whence the others had
come. On seeing them, the slaves, who had hitherto fought so
bravely, were seized with a panic. The greater number took to
flight, making their way westward towards the coast, though they
must have looked in vain for succour in that direction. I was
afraid that some of them, flying in other directions, might pass by
the spot where we had left our friends, who would run a great risk
of being killed either by them or their pursuers. Aboh and I were
so well concealed that there was not much danger of our being
discovered. As may be supposed, we crouched down among the
thick leaves, much in the same way that Charles the Second did
in the oak after the fight of Worcester. The tide of battle swept
by beneath our feet, and a more fearful din of shouts and shrieks
and cries I had never heard. Those of the slaves who had
been engaged in the front rank, deserted by their companions,
were mostly bayoneted or shot down or knocked on the head,
but the courageous way in which they fought enabled the rest
to get to some distance before their rear ranks were over-
taken by their pursuers. At length not a combatant was to be
seen, but the ground was strewn with the dead and dying.
As I was anxious to rejoin my friends, I immediately descended.
Had I possessed a drop of water I would have taken it to
the poor wretches, whose moans as they lay expiring reached
my ears.
"Do you think we could help some of them i" I said to Aboh,
pointing to the wounded men.
"No good," he said, and made a sign that they would soon be
dead. I went up to three or four, and was convinced from the
nature of their hurts that I could do nothing for them; indeed,
the spirits of most of them fled while I stood by. Aboh then,
seizing my arm, hurried me away.
I found Charley and Harry very anxious about me, for hearing
the firing, they supposed that I must have been in the thick of it,

IN SEARCH OF WATER.
121
and by my not coming back they thought that I was either killed
or taken prisoner.
"One thing is certain, we must not remain here a moment
longer. The negroes will very likely pass this way, and either kill
us all or carry us off into captivity," observed Charley. "I have
heard that the black people in this part of the country are among
the most savage of the African tribes, and that some—the Fans—
are cannibals. I don't know to what tribe Aboh belongs, but I
hope he is not a Fan."
"Maybe he is, and intends to deliver us to his country-
men, to serve as a feast given to celebrate his safe return to the
bosom of his family," said Tom, in a tone half in joke half in
earnest.
"He has hitherto shown only good feelings, and we will trust
him, at all events," said Charley.
He made signs to Aboh that we wished to move on, and
being anxious to find water, we begged that he would lead us to
it as soon as possible. He nodded, and pointed to the east.
We were too thirsty to hesitate about going in that direction,
although we should thus be led farther than we wished from
the coast.
We accordingly once more set off, Aboh hurrying us along as fast
as we could make our way through the thick forest, stopping at
first every now and then to listen as the sound of distant firing
was heard, and then apparently to ascertain whether any of the
blacks were coming towards us. Aboh's object was evidently
to avoid both parties. It was most likely that the slaves whom
he had deserted would murder him for having left them, while
the people of the other tribe were probably hereditary enemies
of his, and would without ceremony have put him to death. We
were by this time very hungry as well as thirsty, but our thirst
prevented us from eating, and we urged Aboh to endeavour to
find water without delay. He merely pointed eastward, and
nodded his head as before.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"Well, keep moving, my black angel; whatever you do, keep
moving, and lead us to the water," said Tubbs, patting him on
the back.
We marched chiefly under the shade of the forest trees, where
we found it tolerably cool; at the same time, as Tom observed—
"In the opening the sun was hot enough to roast an ox."
At last I felt that I could go on no longer. I threw myself
down at the roots of a large tree. Harry, who was marching
with me, while the rest were ahead, endeavoured to rouse
me up.
"No, no," I said ; "go on. If you find water, bring me some,
though I doubt if I shall be alive by that time;" and I spoke
as I felt.
"Nonsense I" cried Harry. "You are the last person of the
party I should have expected to give in. I'll stay by you until
you are rested, and then we will hurry on after our friends."
"Perhaps we shall lose them if we are separated," I an-
swered.
The thought made me arouse myself, and rising to my feet, I
staggered on. Harry shouted to Charley and Tom, and they
came back to give me their assistance. We had not gone far
after this, when Aboh shouted out—
"Dere water, water!"
We caught sight of a bright gleam shining through the trees.
Though we were in Africa, we knew that it was no mirage, which
only appears on dry and sandy deserts. We all hurried on,
knowing that our burning thirst would soon be relieved. As
we drew nearer, we saw a lake stretching out before us, on the
banks of which appeared numberless birds. There were long-
legged storks, cranes, pelicans, pink-winged flamingoes, ibises,
and similar waterfowl of various descriptions. As we appeared,
those nearest to us took to flight, the beautiful flamingoes rising
in the air with their long legs stretched out behind them. One
thought, however, occupied our minds. How to get to the

123
water, for we feared that we should find muddy banks, which
might prove impassable. Aboh's quick eye, however, detected a
small inlet into which a rivulet fell. He led us down to a hard,
gravelly bank, where the water ran as clear as that of an English
trout-stream.
We did not stop to consider whether alligators lurked be-
neath the lilies which floated on the surface, or huge snakes
were concealed near at hand waiting for their prey, but kneel-
ing down, we plunged in our heads, and drank huge draughts of
the cooling liquid. Cooling it was to us, although probably it
would have been thought somewhat tepid in a colder climate. In
an instant I was revived, and my companions felt the same sensa-
tions.
We could now sit down and enjoy a few mouthfuls of the
food we had brought from the wreck, which we took to stay
our appetites. We intended, before many minutes were over, to
have some of the waterfowl flying round us cooking before the
fire. Charley and Harry, being tolerable shots, agreed at once
to try and knock over a sufficient number for our wants, while
Tom and I collected sticks for a fire. Aboh, seeing them set
off, started by himself in an opposite direction.
"We're not likely to starve on our journey, Mr. Westerton, if
we are fortunate enough to fall in with as many birds as we see
around us just now," said Tom.
"I am afraid that we cannot expect always to camp on the
borders of a lake or river," I answered. "It will be plenty one
day, and starvation the next. However, if we are prudent, I
hope that we shall get along without much suffering. There are
probably wildfowl to be found, and then we may fall in with
friendly tribes, of whom we can purchase food. At all events,
don't let us expect misfortunes until they come."
"That's what I never have done, and never intend to do,"
answered Tom. "I've always held that there's 'a sweet little
cherub who sits up aloft, to take care of the life of poor Jack;'

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
and although that may sound like a heathen song, there's truth
in it notwithstanding."
We were talking thus while engaged in collecting sticks, cutting
some with our axes, and picking up others, until we had made
a large pile, sufficient, Tom averred, to roast an ox, when we
saw our friends coming back, each loaded with half a dozen
ducks. Directly afterwards Aboh appeared, carrying a still
greater number, which he gave us to understand that he had
captured by swimming out into the lake, his head concealed by
a cap of rushes, towards a flock floating unsuspicious of danger
near the margin, and that, getting close to them, he had pulled
them down under water by the legs. As the slight repast we
had eaten had only just taken off the edge of our appetites, we
eagerly plucked a bird apiece, and had them spitted in a few
minutes before the fire.
"If we only had some pepper and salt, we should do well,"
said Harry.
"Here they are, sir," said Tom, producing from his knapsack
a bag of each.
"We are greatly indebted to you, Mr. Tubbs, for your fore-
thought," observed Charley; "but remember, we must husband
these treasures, for it may be a long time before we are able to
replenish them."
By the time we had finished our repast, the sun had sunk
behind the trees of the forest we had passed through, and as we
could not go farther that night, we agreed to camp where we
were. It was important to keep up the fire, as we might other-
wise receive an unwelcome visit from a lion, elephant, or leopard,
or perhaps from a huge species of ape, numbers of which we
had reason to supect were in the neighbourhood, though we had
not as yet seen any. It was, of course, settled that we should
keep watch, each one of us taking it in turns. Not knowing how
far Aboh might be trusted, we did not ask him. Before sitting
down we collected a further supply of fuel, and cut down some

boughs, with which we constructed a rude arbour to shelter our
heads and bodies from the night dew, although it would have
been of little service in case of a fall of tropical rain. Tom
suggested that, as Charley was leader, he ought not to keep
watch."
"No, no," said Charley. "I will share with you all in that
respect;" and he offered to keep the first watch. Harry took
the second, Tom the third, and I the morning watch.
Tom called me, saying that he had been listening to the
mutterings and roars of lions, the occasional cries of deer as
they were pounced on by some savage beasts, and the shrieks
and other strange noises of night birds. "But you mustn't mind
that, sir," he said; "you'll soon get accustomed to them. If you
see anything suspicious, don't mind rousing me up, although
you may not wish to awaken the whole party."
I promised to do this, and began to walk about in front of the
fire. However, feeling very tired, I sat down, placing my rifle
by my side. While thus seated, I confess that, unexpectedly, my
eyes closed. It appeared to me but for a moment, although when
I opened them daylight had broken, and a bright gleam cast from
the orange-tinted sky was thrown over the lake. I was about to
spring to my feet and stoop to pick up my rifle, when I found it
had gone. On looking round, I saw Aboh holding it in his hand
and moving cautiously away from the camp, while he presented
it at some object of which he had caught sight a little distance
off, and on which his eye was intently fixed. He did not appear
to hear me as I followed, when what was my horror to see an
enormous serpent, its neck rising in the air, its mouth extended
as if about to spring. Aboh stepped behind a small tree, which
afforded him some protection, and resting the barrel of the rifle
against the trunk, fixed his eye on the creature. It seemed to
me about to make its fatal spring, when he, and perhaps my
companions and I as well, might have been destroyed. The
serpent rose in the air, Aboh fired, its head instantly dropped,

although the body continued to writhe and twist along the
ground.
The report aroused the rest of the party, who sprang to
their feet. They looked greatly astonished when they found it
was Aboh and not I who had fired. This, I may say, was the first
of many dangers we escaped from the huge monsters of that
region. On measuring the snake, we found it full thirty feet in
length, with a girth as large as the body of a stout man. Indeed,
we agreed that the creature could have swallowed any of us, or
all of us in succession, had he been so disposed.
"Good eat," said Aboh, as he cut off the creature's head.
While we cooked the ducks, he roasted a piece of the snake's
flesh at the fire, and ate it in preference to them.
We had now to decide what course to pursue, whether to take
the eastern or western side of the lake. Charley was disposed to
think that we should find the western very marshy, for, looking
in that direction, the ground appeared to be covered with tall
reeds, while the distance round the eastern side would evidently
be much longer. On consulting Aboh, he gave the preference
to the eastern side, intimating that the people we had seen, who
had attacked the slaves, resided between the lake and the sea,
and that probably they would not allow us to pass through their
territory without depriving us of everything we possessed, even
should we escape with our lives.
"If you'll take my advice, gentlemen, before we start, you'll
make some hats to keep the sun off your heads; it won't take us
long, and depend upon it, we shall find it very hot along the
borders of the lake. Mr. Westerton, I daresay, knows how to
make a straw hat as well as I do."
Charley said he did, and he and Tom quickly procured a
quantity of dried palm leaves, which, splitting up, they formed
into wide rough plaits. Harry and I imitated their example. In
a few minutes they had enough plaited to form a hat, when,
with some large thorns for needles, and fibre for thread, they

127
stitched the plaiting together as quickly as they made it.
Harry and I were longer about our task, for we managed to
make only one hat while they put together two, but in less than
an hour we were each provided with a very fair straw hat.
Some handkerchiefs, which we had brought from on board
served to line them, and make them more impervious to the
sun.
Our task completed, strapping our knapsacks on our backs
and shouldering our rifles, we commenced our march along the
shores of the lake.

A CCORDING to Aboh's advice we proceeded eastward, with
jtx. the lake on one side and the vast trees of the forest rising
up to an immense height on our right. Frequently the indenta-
tions in the shores of the lake compelled us to keep away from
the water, when we trudged on completely surrounded by trees.
Even at mid-day it was dark and gloomy, not a ray of the sun
penetrating to the ground which we trod. Sometimes the silence
was profound, when suddenly it was broken by the shrill scream
of a parrot, or the chatter of a monkey as he caught sight of us
from his leafy covert.
We saw no other animals, though we discovered elephant
tracks and other marks on the ground. Aboh, on examining
them, said that they were made by leopards, those savage animals
abounding in the forest through which we were passing. On the
shore of the lake, however, we caught sight of numerous croco-

diles, some poking their ugly snouts above the surface of the
water, others basking on sandbanks, or on the points projecting
out into the water.
Once, as we were keeping along the shore, the head of a
huge monster rose not ten feet from us. Aboh shouted,
"Run, massa, run." His warning came only just in time.
Charley, who was farthest from the water, instantly brought his
rifle to his shoulder as he saw the crocodile making a dash at Tom,
who was nearest to him. Aboh shouted and shrieked to scare
the creature. Its jaws were within a foot of Tom's legs, when
Charley, knowing that our companion's life depended upon the
correctness of his aim pulled the trigger and the ball entered the
monster's head through the eye. Tom gave a desperate leap on
one side, the crocodile still moved on, and I fancied that Charley
must have missed. Harry and I, imitating Tom's example,
sprang out of its way. It had not run five yards on dry ground,
however, before it stopped, then rolling on its side, began to kick
violently. Harry quickly had his rifle ready, and firing down its
throat, put an end to its struggles. Aboh proposed cutting some
slices out of its body for dinner, but we declined joining him
in the repast, as we hoped to catch as many birds and monkeys
as we might require. The narrow escape we had had taught us
that we must in future avoid marching close to the water, and
that it would be prudent to keep a1 bright look out when near
the shores of the lake not to run the risk of being snapped up by
a crocodile.
We were disappointed in consequence of this at not being able
to sleep securely, as we had expected, close down to the water, so
that we might have only one side of our camp to defend. From
the experience we had obtained we now saw that we should run a
greater chance of being carried off by crocodiles than even by
lions or leopards.
We had marched on for about an hour after the occurrence I

have described, when finding that we could cut off a point by
proceeding straight on, we had of necessity to leave the shore of
the lake, the water of which we had hitherto always had in sight.
We had made good some distance, often having to cut away the
creepers which impeded our path, and were expecting soon again
to catch sight of the water, when loud trumpeting sounds reached
our ears.
We stopped to listen, and were soon convinced that the
sounds we heard were uttered by elephants, and, moreover, that
they were for some cause or other excited by rage. However,
as the animals were, we judged, still at some distance on our
right hand, we agreed to continue our course, hoping that they
would not discover us. In case they should do so, and we
should have to defend ourselves, we put bullets into our rifles.
The evening was approaching, and it was necessary to look
out for a spot sufficiently open to enable us to light the fire,
and at the same time not in too dangerous proximity to the lake.
That we might have a better chance of finding the spot we
were in search of, we separated, Tubbs and Charley going on
ahead, while Harry, Aboh, and I searched round on either side
of where we then were. We found that we were at no great dis-
tance from the lake, the shining water of which we saw between
the trees.
"Here's a spot just suitable for us," cried Harry, "but we
shall have to cut down the grass that the fire may not spread,
otherwise we may create a blaze which would prove very
inconvenient."
Just as he spoke the trumpeting sounds we had before heard
again reached our ears, but very much nearer. Aboh stopped
in an attitude of listening. Presently there came a noise
as of the crashing of branches and the tramping of heavy feet
on the ground.
"Elephant come dis way," exclaimed Aboh; "run, massa,


## p. 131 (#181) ############################################

ESCAPE FROM ELEPHANTS.
run;" and he set off in the direction of the lake, pointing to a
large tree at no great distance from us.
Harry and I followed his example, hoping that Charley and
Tubbs would hear the sounds in time to make their escape.
The trumpeting and crashing sounds drew nearer. Presently
we caught sight of several huge trunks lifted in the air, with
gleaming tusks below them, and the huge heads of the savage
monsters among the leaves.
"Here, massa, here, get up!" exclaimed Aboh, reaching the
foot of the tree.
As he spoke, seizing a bough, he swung himself up with
the agility of a monkey on to a lower branch. I cast my
eye behind me, when what was my horror to see Charley
coming along with three or four elephants dashing at full
speed not thirty yards behind him. It seemed scarcely pos-
sible that he could reach a place of safety before he was over-
taken. All my thoughts were now turned on Charley, and I
regretted that I had not managed to hand my rifle to Aboh
before climbing up myself. Charley had dropped his, and came
bounding along, the elephants, however, gaining on him. He
saw us, and made towards the tree. Aboh and I stooped down
to catch his hands and help him up. He was within twenty
yards of us, when his foot caught in one of the treacherous vines
which crept in snakelike coils over the ground and hung from
numberless branches, and he fell. He was instantly, however,
again on his feet, and came rushing on as before; but the delay
had enabled the leading elephant to gain on him. We shrieked
and shouted to encourage him, or perhaps impelled to do so
by our fears. He reached the foot of the tree. In another
instant the elephant would have seized him with its trunk or
trampled him under its feet. Had he not possessed unusual
activity his destruction would have been certain. He grasped
the bough nearest him. Aboh sprang down and got him by one

hand. I seized him by the other. The elephant's trunk was
already touching his leg, which would the next moment have
been encircled in its fatal embrace. We tugged and hauled;
the animal caught his shoe, which happily gave way, and Charley
was out of its reach. We now breathed more freely, for the tree
was far too stout to enable the elephants to tear it down. The
beast which had so nearly caught Charley stood trumpeting with
rage beneath our feet, lifting up his trunk in a vain attempt to
reach us.
We, as may be supposed, climbed higher up, so as to be well
out of his way. In a few seconds the remainder of the herd
came up, surrounding the tree and all trumpeting together.
It was a sound sufficient to make our hearts quail. Had we
possessed our rifles, we might have quickly put an end to the
animals, mighty as they seemed. Fortunately, in their rage they
did not discover them, as they were concealed in the tall grass
and leaves between the roots. We dreaded, however, every
instant that their feet would come down and crush them,
when they, in all probability, would have been rendered per-
fectly useless.
Our thoughts were now turned towards Tom. Charley said
that he had lost sight of him just before he saw the elephants,
but that he trusted he had sought safety in a tree as we had
done. We shouted out, hoping that he would hear us; but
the trumpeting of the elephants drowned our voices. However,
although we did not get any answer, we still hoped that he might
have escaped.
"I wish that I had not lost my rifle," said Charley, "although
I think I should be able to find it again if the beasts did not
trample upon it, and I don't think they did, for I threw it as far
from me as I could into a thick bush."
"If you hadn't thrown it away, both you and it would have
been crushed to pieces," answered Harry. "I think it is for-

tunate that you had presence of mind to get rid of it. But, I
say, I wonder whether these beasts are going to lay siege to us
all night . I'm getting very hungry. If they don't go away we
shall be starved."
"Perhaps the best thing we can do is to climb up higher and
hide ourselves, and then, when they don't see us, their rage may
abate, and they will go away," I remarked. "They are not likely
to remain here all night, and will probably go to the lake to
drink, and give us time, at all events, to get down and recover
our rifles."
"What does Aboh think about the matter?" asked Charley.
I inquired of the black, making the usual signs by means of
which we carried on a conversation with him, and using such
simple words as he was likely to understand. He evidently com-
prehended what I said, and highly approved of our plan of hid-
ing ourselves,-setting the example by climbing up and concealing
himself from the elephants below. We three did the same,
though I managed still to watch them by peeping through the
leaves of the bough on which I had perched myself. The crea-
tures in a short time ceased their trumpeting, but still remained
walking slowly round and round the tree, looking up in a sagacious
fashion to ascertain what had become of us. At last they ap-
peared either to forget us, or to fancy that we were birds, and
had flown away. The biggest elephant, which had so
nearly caught Charley, then led the way down to the lake, the
rest following him. It was with infinite satisfaction that we saw
them go.
"Now, quick, quick! let us get our rifles, at all events, before
they come back," whispered Charley.
Aboh, seeing me about to descend, made a sign that he would
go himself, and, with wonderful agility, he slipped down the
tree, while Charley descended to the lowest bough to reach the
rifles as he handed them up. I followed, keeping a little above

my brother, that I might pass them on to Harry. I felt very
thankful when Aboh handed up my rifle to Charley, who giving
it to me, I passed it on to Harry. Aboh then, again slipping
down, handed up Harry's. To our infinite relief neither of
them were injured, though the feet of the elephants must have
trampled the ground on either side.
"Him go get massa officer's rifle," said Aboh, who was delighted
to make use of some of the words with which he was best ac-
quainted; and without waiting to obtain our sanction, he darted
off in the direction from which Charley came.
"See if you can find Tom anywhere," I shouted.
Aboh turned and made a sign to us to be silent, pointing at the
same time towards the lake, where the elephants were drinking.
I regretted having cried out, lest my voice should have attracted
the creatures' attention, and might cause them to return and
look for us. Although Aboh probably thought that Tom
was concealed somewhere in the neighbourhood, yet, knowing
the importance of silence, he did not cry out to ascertain his
position.
We watched him anxiously, for we feared that at any moment
the elephants might come back before he could discover the rifle,
which might take some time to find. We saw him hunting about,
but Charley said that he thought the spot where he had thrown it
away was much farther off. At length he was altogether hidden
from our sight by the thick foliage.
"Harry, do you climb up and keep a look-out for the elephants,
and Dick and I will stand by to help up Aboh when he conies
back. If you see the beasts coming, send a shot into the head
of the leader; if you don't kill him, it will probably bring him to
a standstill or turn him aside, and give the black more time to
climb up the tree," said Charley.
"Ay, ay !" answered Harry, taking his rifle; "I'll do my best
to stop the brutes coming this way, at all events."

AN ELEPHANT KILLED.
Charley and I waited on the lower branches, my brother being
beneath me, watching for the return of Aboh. At last we saw
him coming along with Charley's rifle in his hand. At the same
instant Harry shouted out—
"Here come the elephants with their trunks turned up, but
they are walking leisurely along, as if they had forgotten all
about us."
"Don't fire, then, unless they come close to the tree," answered
Charley, while he made signs to Aboh to hasten his steps, point-
ing as he did so towards the lake. Aboh sprang forward, but
the quick ears and quick sight of the elephants had detected
him, and sticking out their trunks, they begun trumpeting and
moving rapidly forward. I scarcely thought it possible that Aboh
could escape them. Just then we heard the report of Harry's
rifle over our heads. A shriek of rage escaped the leading elephant,
and he had, we concluded, been hit. At the same moment
Aboh stopped, and levelling his rifle, fired. The ball struck the
animal, which, however, still came on, although at a slower pace
than before, and Aboh, grasping the rifle, darted up the tree hold-
ing it above his head, so that Charley could stoop down and seize
it by the barrel. Handing it to me, he was able to assist Aboh,
who nimbly scrambled up.
We all then retreated to our former resting-places, out of
the reach of the elephants' trunks. The whole herd came
on, the leader bleeding but still trumpeting furiously. We,
however, had him in our power, and felt pretty sure that
his trumpetings would soon be over. My weapon was still
loaded, Charley asked me to let him have it, as he was in a
better position for firing than I was. I handed it to him, and
as the elephants came near he took aim at the leader, wait-
ing until in his circuit round the tree his head presented a fair
mark. He fired, the huge monster immediately sank down, and
almost without a struggle was dead. We could not resist

joining Aboh in the loud shout of triumph he raised as we saw
our enemy destroyed. On the fall of their leader, the other
elephants became alarmed, and uttering a few trumpetings, more
of fear than anger, rushed off together into the forest, crushing
down the shrubs and young trees as they went, making a good
pathway towards the southward, which would have saved us
much trouble to have followed had we wished to go in that
direction. We now, feeling sure that they would not return,
descended. Our first care on reaching the ground was to reload
our rifles.
"I wish that we could carry off the tusks," said Harry. "I'm
sure they would be worth no small number of dollars if they
were safe on board."
"It is very certain that we cannot get them down to the sea at
present, and probably before we can return to fetch them some
other hunters will have carried them off," observed Charley.
While we were discussing the subject, Aboh had got out his
knife and was working away at one of the animal's feet, which he
succeeded in cleverly amputating.
"Him good eat," said the black pointing to the foot he had
just cut off.
Although we certainly could not agree with him, we did not
contradict his assertion. He then cut some slices out of the back,
which had not a more attractive appearance than the foot. The
black, however, seemed to think that we had now an ample
supply of food. We should have camped on the spot, as the
shades of evening were already coming on, had we not been
anxious to discover Tom.
"We must find him before nightfall," I observed; "for even
although the creatures may not have killed him, he may be injured
and unable to rejoin us."
"Certainly, unless he has got to a considerable distance, he
must have heard our shouts," remarked Harry.

TOM TUBBS FOUND.
137
Charley agreed with us, and we accordingly proceeded in the
direction of the spot where Charley had left our companion. As
we went on we shouted out his name, while we looked carefully
on either side, dreading at any moment to discover his mangled
remains. Aboh hunted about with great care, but for some
distance the ground was so trampled by the elephants' feet,
and the trees and shrubs so torn, that any footsteps of a human
being must effectually have been obliterated. Presently, how-
ever, we crossed the path formed by the herd as they had
made their way towards us, and all traces of them ceased. A
short time afterwards we saw Aboh examining the ground, then
he pointed ahead and went on at a rapid rate, we following his
footsteps. Again he stopped, and stooping down picked up
a rifle. We recognised it as Tom's. What had become of its
owner? Still Aboh went on.
By this time the forest was so shrouded in the gloom of
approaching night that we could with difficulty see anything
before us. Again Aboh stopped and cried out, " Him here ! him
here!" We hurried forward. There was our poor friend stretched
on the ground, his leg caught in a vine below a tall tree with
branches coming close to the ground. The dreadful thought
seized me that he was dead.
"Tom, Mr. Tubbs, speak to me," I cried out.
I heard a groan. At all events, he was alive. Stooping down,
I rested his head on my knee. Charley and Harry quickly
came up. We soon released poor Tom's foot. On examining
it, we feared that it was dislocated, or at all events severely
sprained, and that probably he had fainted from the pain.
Having water in our flasks, we poured some down his throat.
By wetting his hands and chafing his arms we in a short
time brought him to. He looked round him, evidently very
much astonished.
"Where am I, mates? What has happened?" he asked at

length. "I was dreaming that a shark or a tiger or some beast or
other had bitten off my foot."
"Not so bad as that," said Charley, "although you have hurt
it considerably, I fear."
"Ah, now I recollect all about it . I was afraid, Mr. Westerton,
that you were caught by the elephants, and I was expecting to
share the same fate. As I could not help you, I thought the
wisest thing I could do was to run for my life. I confess it, I
never was in such a fright before. I somehow dropped my gun,
and then, just as I was about to climb up into that tree overhead,
I found myself caught with a round turn about my leg, and down
I came. The honest truth is, I don't remember anything more
of what happened after that."
It would have been unjust to blame poor Tom for the very
natural panic which had seized him on finding himself alone
in the forest, and, as he supposed, with his companions
killed. He had acted as most people would have done under
similar circumstances, and endeavoured to save his life. We
fortunately found not far off just such an open space
as we were searching for. Our first business was to light
a fire in the centre of it, after having cut away the surrounding
grass.
"We must keep up a good blaze, or we may have some unwell
come visits from wild beasts," said Charley. "It will be
necessary to keep an eye towards the lake, or one of those
horrid crocodiles may be crawling up in search of some
supper when the odour of the roasted elephant-meat reaches
his nose."
While Charley and I attended to poor Tom, Harry and Aboh
made up the fire as proposed. We had brought an iron sauce-
pan, with which Aboh intimated that he would go down to the
lake to get some water, making a sign to Harry to accompany
him with his gun.

WE BANDAGE TOM'S ANKLE.
139
"If big ting come out of de water, fire at Trim head," he said,
showing that he was fully alive to the danger of approaching the
lake, especially of an evening, when the crocodiles are more
active than at other times during the day.
We kept the fire blazing up brightly, so that it might scare
any wild beasts prowling round about us. However, not trusting
to that alone, Charley and I kept our rifles by our sides and our
eyes about us, lest a lion or leopard might spring upon us
unawares. Having got off Tom's boot and sock, we examined
Iris ankle. It looked blue and swollen, and when we touched it
he complained that it pained him much. Still, as far as we could
judge, no bone was broken.
"The only thing I can think of is to bind it up in a wet
handkerchief," observed Charley; "the inflammation may thus
be allayed."
While we were speaking we heard a shot from Harry's gun,
showing that we must not expect to obtain even a saucepan
of water without trouble. Shortly afterwards Aboh returned
with the water. Charley asked for some of it, and saturating
a handkerchief, which he fortunately had in his pocket,
he bound up Tom's ankle. Harry told us that scarcely had
Aboh dipped the saucepan into the water, than a crocodile
poked its ugly head above the surface and made a dash at
him.
"I was too quick, however, and firing, hit the creature in the
throat, when it slid off again into deep water," he added, " whether
killed or not I cannot say, as it sank immediately."
"You have done so well that we must get you to make
another trip as soon as we have eaten our soup, which, I sup-
pose, Aboh intends to make out of the elephant-meat, for I
doubt if it will be palatable cooked in any other way," said
Charley.
We found that the black had brought several stones from the

shores of the lake. He now, having placed them in the fire, dug
a hole near at hand, into which he scraped some of the ashes,
and then put in the stones with the elephant's foot on the top cf
them. Above this having placed some thick leaves, he quickly
filled up the hole.
u Him soon good eat," he said.
Harry had in the meantime cut up some pieces of elephant-
meat, which he put into the saucepan. Having placed it on
the fire, he stuck some other slices on forked sticks as close as
they could be placed to the flames.
"We shall have the opportunity of trying the comparative
excellencies of three styles of cooking," he observed, laughing.
I have no great faith in Aboh's mode of proceeding," re-
marked Charley.
"Nor have I, except to produce any especially excellent
soap," said Harry.
Our patience was to be severely exercised. We were all
so hnncry that Charley consented to serve out a small
piece of biscuit to each of us, just to stay our appetites; but
that produced a very transient effect . At first I saw him
turhtening his waist-belt; then I had to tighten mine, as Harry

A SNAKE IN THE GRASS.
We all cut off little bits, hunger making us in no way par-
ticular; but it was a difficult business to get down a mouthful.
At last I took to scraping it with my knife, by which means I
was able to swallow more than I otherwise could have done.
We next tried the soup. The warm liquid could at all events
be swallowed, and it appeared to do good to poor Tom, to whom
we gave several cupfuls. The meat, however, was scarcely an
improvement upon the steaks. Aboh had been watching us all
the time while he munched his share without showing a sign of
dissatisfaction.
"As we shall want some more water for poor Tom's foot, I
wish you would go down, Harry, to the lake and fill the sauce-
pan," said Charley.
"I will go with Aboh willingly enough, provided he carries a
torch, for otherwise the chances are that we shall not get off as
easily as we did before," answered Harry.
Aboh understood what was proposed, and taking a brand
from the fire in one hand, and the saucepan in the other, he set
off, Harry accompanying him with his rifle ready for instant use.
Charley and I, in the meantime, got up and examined the forest
around us. Strange noises were issuing from it; but our ears
being unaccustomed to the sounds of an African wilderness, we
could not distinguish either the animals or birds which produced
them. Here and there we picked up sticks, which we carried to
the heap prepared for keeping up the fire during the night. I
was stooping down, expecting to take up a thin stick, when I saw
it glide away. I had nearly caught hold of a snake by the body.
It might have been harmless, but if venomous, I should have
probably been fatally bitten. I sprang back, as may be sup-
posed, and was very cautious after this to feel with the pole I
carried in my hand before I picked up any other sticks. In a
short time Harry and Aboh came back with the saucepan of
water, from which we filled our mugs, for the tough elephant-

meat made us thirsty. We were all suffering from hunger, and as
we expected to find Aboh's dish as unpalatable as ours, we had
made up our minds to lie down, if not exactly supperless, as
hungry almost as before.
"Now, massa, him 'tink foot ready," said Aboh, and without
more ado, he opened the hole and produced the foot hot and
steaming. Just taking off the top, as if it had been a piece of pie-
crust, what was our surprise and very great satisfaction to find
the interior full of a rich glutinous substance. We eagerly
hooked it out with our knives, and it was pronounced excellent
jelly, although somewhat strong tasted. The single foot con-
tained more than we altogether could eat, although Aboh got
through twice as much as either of the rest of us. We regretted
that we had not brought along more of the elephant's feet.
Instead of going supperless to bed, we thus had a more ample
meal than we had eaten since we landed. As it was important
that Tom should have a night's rest, Charley, Harry, and I
agreed to keep watch in turns. We did not ask Aboh, though
he would, we felt sure, have proved trustworthy. I had the
middle watch. As I walked round and round the camp, my ears
were saluted by distant mutterings and the occasional roar of
lions, the trumpetings of elephants, or the shrill agonised cry of
some hapless deer on which a stealthy leopard had pounced,
the shrieks of night birds, the chirp of insects, and the croakbj
of frogs. Every moment I expected to see some monster -
its nose out amid the dark foliage; but if any came near,
prevented them from springing on us. I occasional'

MAHOGANY TREES.

Harry and I, as soon as we were on foot, took our guns, accom-
panied by Aboh, in search of game for breakfast. We soon
came upon a number of ducks, and were fortunate in killing
half a dozen in three shots, two being brought to the ground
each time we fired. We did not forget the crocodiles, nor did
Aboh, who was very wary when picking up the birds. As we
made our way through the forest, I was especially struck by the
variety and luxuriance of the trees and shrubs, the number of
vines which hung from the branches in wreaths and festoons,
the length of the leaves, some rising from the ground, others
forming crowns on the summits of tall trees, surmounted by
flowers of bright red or yellow or blue.
"Dere, massa, what you 'tink dat?" said Aboh, throwing
himself on the ground as if to contemplate at his ease the
magnificent tree before which we stood. "Him 'board ship
worth many tusks."
"What tree is it ?" I asked.
It was certainly one of the finest and most graceful trees we
had yet met with in the African forest. Its leaves were long,
sharp-pointed, and dark green, hanging in large clusters. Its bark
was also a dark green and very smooth. The trunk rose straight
and clean to the height of sixty feet or more, from whence
large leafy branches projected to a considerable distance. Aboh
pointed to his own skin and then laughed.
"He means that it's an ebony tree, and so I'm sure it is,"
said Harry. "It is one of those articles we were to have pro-
cured."
On examining the tree we found that it was hollow, and Aboh
made us understand that the branches also were hollow. On
cutting through the bark we came to some white wood, which at
first puzzled us. We expected to have found it black, but Aboh
made signs that we were to cut deeper into it, and we thus
ascertained that the white wood was simply sap wood, and that

farther in the wood was perfectly black. We found several
others of the same description growing around; and we agreed
that if we could fall in with some friendly natives, we would
advise them to cut the trees down, and should any navigable
river exist running out of the lake, to convey them to its mouth,
where they could be embarked. We, however, had to hurry
back to cook our ducks for breakfast.
We continued keeping our poor companion's ankle constantly
wetted, but, to our disappointment, even the next day he was
unable to do more than stand up. The moment he attempted to
walk, the pain returned, and we had to make up our minds for
a longer stay. Charley proposed that we should cut down a
tree and scoop out a canoe in which to cross the lake. When he
explained his intentions, however, to Aboh, the black replied
that it would take us several weeks, if not months, to construct a
canoe, and that we should get round the lake much faster by
land.
"That may be the case," said Charley; "but suppose Tom's
ankle is broken, or so injured that he is unable to walk, we shall
have no alternative. We cannot leave him behind us in this wild
forest, and we must try to find a village of friendly natives, where
he can remain until he is recovered."
"I'm sorry to keep you back, gentlemen, and if it was a
matter of life or death, I'd say go on and leave me behind, but
it would be a terrible thing if that were necessary; so I would
rather say, let us build a canoe, or, if we cannot, a raft on which
we can cross the lake. I don't think it would take as long as
Aboh supposes, if we could find a soft tree. He do**Bfc know
what our sharp axes can do; besides, we can c' it the

opinion the other way. We told Aboh we wished he would
hunt about to find a big tree of soft wood.
Aboh agreed to do as we wished, at the same time he shook
his head, saying, " Too long, too long."
"No, no," answered Tom; "we will build a handsome short
craft with plenty of beam, so that we may turn her about in any
of the narrow streams through which we may have to make our
way."

my brother, that I might pass them on to Harry. I felt very
thankful when Aboh handed up my rifle to Charley, who giving
it to me, I passed it on to Harry. Aboh then, again slipping
down, handed up Harry's. To our infinite relief neither of
them were injured, though the feet of the elephants must have

to make use of some of the words with which he was best ac-
quainted; and without waiting to obtain our sanction, he darted
off in the direction from which Charley came.

Aboh turned and made a sign to us to be silent, pointing at the
same time towards the lake, where the elephants were drinking.
I regretted having cried out, lest my voice should have attracted
the creatures' attention, and might cause them to return and
look for us. Although Aboh probably thought that Tom
was concealed somewhere in the neighbourhood, yet, knowing
the importance of silence, he did not cry out to ascertain his

the elephants might come back before he could discover the rifle,
which might take some time to find. We saw him hunting about,
but Charley said that he thought the spot where he had thrown it

back. If you see the beasts coming, send a shot into the head
of the leader; if you don't kill him, it will probably bring him to
a standstill or turn him aside, and give the black more time to
climb up the tree," said Charley.
"Ay, ay !" answered Harry, taking his rifle; "I'll do my best
to stop the brutes coming this way, at all events."

him coming along with Charley's rifle in his hand. At the same
instant Harry shouted out—
"Here come the elephants with their trunks turned up, but

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Several on both sides had fallen, when a fresh party of armed
negroes appeared in the direction from whence the others had
come. On seeing them, the slaves, who had hitherto fought so
bravely, were seized with a panic. The greater number took to
flight, making their way westward towards the coast, though they
must have looked in vain for succour in that direction. I was
afraid that some of them, flying in other directions, might pass by
the spot where we had left our friends, who would run a great risk
of being killed either by them or their pursuers. Aboh and I were
so well concealed that there was not much danger of our being
discovered. As may be supposed, we crouched down among the
thick leaves, much in the same way that Charles the Second did
in the oak after the fight of Worcester. The tide of battle swept
by beneath our feet, and a more fearful din of shouts and shrieks
and cries I had never heard. Those of the slaves who had
been engaged in the front rank, deserted by their companions,
were mostly bayoneted or shot down or knocked on the head,
but the courageous way in which they fought enabled the rest
to get to some distance before their rear ranks were over-
taken by their pursuers. At length not a combatant was to be
seen, but the ground was strewn with the dead and dying.
As I was anxious to rejoin my friends, I immediately descended.
Had I possessed a drop of water I would have taken it to
the poor wretches, whose moans as they lay expiring reached
my ears.
"Do you think we could help some of them ?" I said to Aboh,
pointing to the wounded men.
"No good," he said, and made a sign that they would soon be
dead. I went up to three or four, and was convinced from the
nature of their hurts that I could do nothing for them; indeed,
the spirits of most of them fled while I stood by. Aboh then,
seizing my arm, hurried me away.
I found Charley and Harry very anxious about me, for hearing
the firing, they supposed that I must have been in the thick of it,

121
and by my not coming back they thought that I was either killed
or taken prisoner.
"One thing is certain, we must not remain here a moment
longer. The negroes will very likely pass this way, and either kill
us all or carry us off into captivity," observed Charley. "I have
heard that the black people in this part of the country are among
the most savage of the African tribes, and that some—the Fans—
are cannibals. I don't know to what tribe Aboh belongs, but I
hope he is not a Fan."
"Maybe he is, and intends to deliver us to his country-
men, to serve as a feast given to celebrate his safe return to the
bosom of his family," said Tom, in a tone half in joke half in
earnest.
"He has hitherto shown only good feelings, and we will trust
him, at all events," said Charley.
He made signs to Aboh that we wished to move on, and
being anxious to find water, we begged that he would lead us to
it as soon as possible. He nodded, and pointed to the east.
We were too thirsty to hesitate about going in that direction,
although we should thus be led farther than we wished from
the coast.
We accordingly once more set off, Aboh hurrying us along as fast
as we could make our way through the thick forest, stopping at
first every now and then to listen as the sound of distant firing
was heard, and then apparently to ascertain whether any of the
blacks were coming towards us. Aboh's object was evidently
to avoid both parties. It was most likely that the slaves whom
he had deserted would murder him for having left them, while
the people of the other tribe were probably hereditary enemies
of his, and would without ceremony have put him to death. We
were by this time very hungry as well as thirsty, but our thirst
prevented us from eating, and we urged Aboh to endeavour to
find water without delay. He merely pointed eastward, and
nodded his head as before.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"Well, keep moving, my black angel; whatever you do, keep
moving, and lead us to the water," said Tubbs, patting him on
the back.
We marched chiefly under the shade of the forest trees, where
we found it tolerably cool; at the same time, as Tom observed—
"In the opening the sun was hot enough to roast an ox."
At last I felt that I could go on no longer. I threw myself
down at the roots of a large tree. Harry, who was marching
with me, while the rest were ahead, endeavoured to rouse
me up.
"No, no," I said ; "go on. If you find water, bring me some,
though I doubt if I shall be alive by that time;" and I spoke
as I felt.
"Nonsense !" cried Harry. "You are the last person of the
party I should have expected to give in. I'll stay by you until
you are rested, and then we will hurry on after our friends."
"Perhaps we shall lose them if we are separated," I an-
swered.
The thought made me arouse myself, and rising to my feet, I
staggered on. Harry shouted to Charley and Tom, and they
came back to give me their assistance. We had not gone far
after this, when Aboh shouted out—
"Dere water, water!"
We caught sight of a bright gleam shining through the trees.
Though we were in Africa, we knew that it was no mirage, which
only appears on dry and sandy deserts. We all hurried on,
knowing that our burning thirst would soon be relieved. As
we drew nearer, we saw a lake stretching out before us, on the
banks of which appeared numberless birds. There were long-
legged storks, cranes, pelicans, pink-winged flamingoes, ibises,
and similar waterfowl of various descriptions. As we appeared,
those nearest to us took to flight, the beautiful flamingoes rising
in the air with their long legs stretched out behind them. One
thought, however, occupied our minds. How to get to the

123
water, for we feared that we should find muddy banks, which
might prove impassable. Aboh's quick eye, however, detected a
small inlet into which a rivulet fell. He led us down to a hard,
gravelly bank, where the water ran as clear as that of an English
trout-stream.
We did not stop to consider whether alligators lurked be-
neath the lilies which floated on the surface, or huge snakes
were concealed near at hand waiting for their prey, but kneel-
ing down, we plunged in our heads, and drank huge draughts of
the cooling liquid. Cooling it was to us, although probably it
would have been thought somewhat tepid in a colder climate. In
an instant I was revived, and my companions felt the same sensa-
tions.
We could now sit down and enjoy a few mouthfuls of the
food we had brought from the wreck, which we took to stay
our appetites. We intended, before many minutes were over, to
have some of the waterfowl flying round us cooking before the
fire. Charley and Harry, being tolerable shots, agreed at once
to try and knock over a sufficient number for our wants, while
Tom and I collected sticks for a fire. Aboh, seeing them set
off, started by himself in an opposite direction.
"We're not likely to starve on our journey, Mr. Westerton, if
we are fortunate enough to fall in with as many birds as we see
around us just now," said Tom.
"I am afraid that we cannot expect always to camp on the
borders of a lake or river," I answered. "It will be plenty one
day, and starvation the next. However, if we are prudent, I
hope that we shall get along without much suffering. There are
probably wildfowl to be found, and then we may fall in with
friendly tribes, of whom we can purchase food. At all events,
don't let us expect misfortunes until they come."
"That's what I never have done, and never intend to do,"
answered Tom. "I've always held that there's 'a sweet little
cherub who sits up aloft, to take care of the life of poor Jack;'

and although that may sound like a heathen song, there's truth
in it notwithstanding."
We were talking thus while engaged in collecting sticks, cutting
some with our axes, and picking up others, until we had made
a large pile, sufficient, Tom averred, to roast an ox, when we
saw our friends coming back, each loaded with half a dozen
ducks. Directly afterwards Aboh appeared, carrying a still
greater number, which he gave us to understand that he had
captured by swimming out into the lake, his head concealed by
a cap of rushes, towards a flock floating unsuspicious of danger
near the margin, and that, getting close to them, he had pulled
them down under water by the legs. As the slight repast we
had eaten had only just taken off the edge of our appetites, we
eagerly plucked a bird apiece, and had them spitted in a few
minutes before the fire.
"If we only had some pepper and salt, we should do well,"
said Harry.
"Here they are, sir," said Tom, producing from his knapsack
a bag of each.
"We are greatly indebted to you, Mr. Tubbs, for your fore-
thought," observed Charley; "but remember, we must husband
these treasures, for it may be a long time before we are able to
replenish them."
By the time we had finished our repast, the sun had sunk
behind the trees of the forest we had passed through, and as we
could not go farther that night, we agreed to camp where we
were. It was important to keep up the fire, as we might other-
wise receive an unwelcome visit from a lion, elephant, or leopard,
or perhaps from a huge species of ape, numbers of which we
had reason to supect were in the neighbourhood, though we had
not as yet seen any. It was, of course, settled that we should
keep watch, each one of us taking it in turns. Not knowing how
far Aboh might be trusted, we did not ask him. Before sitting
down we collected a further supply of fuel, and cut down some

boughs, with which we constructed a rude arbour to shelter our
heads and bodies from the night dew, although it would have
been of little service in case of a fall of tropical rain. Tom
suggested that, as Charley was leader, he ought not to keep
watch."
"No, no," said Charley. "I will share with you all in that
respect;" and he offered to keep the first watch. Harry took
the second, Tom the third, and I the morning watch.
Tom called me, saying that he had been listening to the
mutterings and roars of lions, the occasional cries of deer as
they were pounced on by some savage beasts, and the shrieks
and other strange noises of night birds. "But you mustn't mind
that, sir," he said; "you'll soon get accustomed to them. If you
see anything suspicious, don't mind rousing me up, although
you may not wish to awaken the whole party."
I promised to do this, and began to walk about in front of the
fire. However, feeling very tired, I sat down, placing my rifle
by my side. While thus seated, I confess that, unexpectedly, my
eyes closed. It appeared to me but for a moment, although when
I opened them daylight had broken, and a bright gleam cast from
the orange-tinted sky was thrown over the lake. I was about to
spring to my feet and stoop to pick up my rifle, when I found it
had gone. On looking round, I saw Aboh holding it in his hand
and moving cautiously away from the camp, while he presented
it at some object of which he had caught sight a little distance
off, and on which his eye was intently fixed. He did not appear
to hear me as I followed, when what was my horror to see an
enormous serpent, its neck rising in the air, its mouth extended
as if about to spring. Aboh stepped behind a small tree, which
afforded him some protection, and resting the barrel of the rifle
against the trunk, fixed his eye on the creature. It seemed to
me about to make its fatal spring, when he, and perhaps my
companions and I as well, might have been destroyed. The
serpent rose in the air, Aboh fired, its head instantly dropped,

although the body continued to writhe and twist along the
ground.
The report aroused the rest of the party, who sprang to
their feet. They looked greatly astonished when they found it
was Aboh and not I who had fired. This, I may say, was the first
of many dangers we escaped from the huge monsters of that
region. On measuring the snake, we found it full thirty feet in
length, with a girth as large as the body of a stout man. Indeed,
we agreed that the creature could have swallowed any of us, or
all of us in succession, had he been so disposed.
"Good eat," said Aboh, as he cut off the creature's head.
While we cooked the ducks, he roasted a piece of the snake's
flesh at the fire, and ate it in preference to them.
We had now to decide what course to pursue, whether to take
the eastern or western side of the lake. Charley was disposed to
think that we should find the western very marshy, for, looking
in that direction, the ground appeared to be covered with tall
reeds, while the distance round the eastern side would evidently
be much longer. On consulting Aboh, he gave the preference
to the eastern side, intimating that the people we had seen, who
had attacked the slaves, resided between the lake and the sea,
and that probably they would not allow us to pass through their
territory without depriving us of everything we possessed, even
should we escape with our lives.
"If you'll take my advice, gentlemen, before we start, you'll
make some hats to keep the sun off your heads; it won't take us
long, and depend upon it, we shall find it very hot along the
borders of the lake. Mr. Westerton, I daresay, knows how to
make a straw hat as well as I do."
Charley said he did, and he and Tom quickly procured a
quantity of dried palm leaves, which, splitting up, they formed
into wide rough plaits. Harry and I imitated their example. In
a few minutes they had enough plaited to form a hat, when,
with some large thorns for needles, and fibre for thread, they

127
stitched the plaiting together as quickly as they made it.
Harry and I were longer about our task, for we managed to
make only one hat while they put together two, but in less than
an hour we were each provided with a very fair straw hat.
Some handkerchiefs, which we had brought from on board
served to line them, and make them more impervious to the
sun.
Our task completed, strapping our knapsacks on our backs
and shouldering our rifles, we commenced our march along the
shores of the lake.

A CCORDING to Aboh's advice we proceeded eastward, with
jLX. the lake on one side and the vast trees of the forest rising
up to an immense height on our right. Frequently the indenta-
tions in the shores of the lake compelled us to keep away from
the water, when we trudged on completely surrounded by trees.
Even at mid-day it was dark and gloomy, not a ray of the sun
penetrating to the ground which we trod. Sometimes the silence
was profound, when suddenly it was broken by the shrill scream
of a parrot, or the chatter of a monkey as he caught sight of us
from his leafy covert.
We saw no other animals, though we discovered elephant
tracks and other marks on the ground. Aboh, on examining
them, said that they were made by leopards, those savage animals
abounding in the forest through which we were passing. On the
shore of the lake, however, we caught sight of numerous croco-

129
diles, some poking their ugly snouts above the surface of the
water, others basking on sandbanks, or on the points projecting
out into the water.
Once, as we were keeping along the shore, the head of a
huge monster rose not ten feet from us. Aboh shouted,
"Run, massa, run." His warning came only just in time.
Charley, who was farthest from the water, instantly brought his
rifle to his shoulder as he saw the crocodile making a dash at Tom,
who was nearest to him. Aboh shouted and shrieked to scare
the creature. Its jaws were within a foot of Tom's legs, when
Charley, knowing that our companion's life depended upon the
correctness of his aim pulled the trigger and the ball entered the
monster's head through the eye. Tom gave a desperate leap on
one side, the crocodile still moved on, and I fancied that Charley
must have missed. Harry and I, imitating Tom's example,
sprang out of its way. It had not run five yards on dry ground,
however, before it stopped, then rolling on its side, began to kick
violently. Harry quickly had his rifle ready, and firing down its
throat, put an end to its struggles. Aboh proposed cutting some
slices out of its body for dinner, but we declined joining him
in the repast, as we hoped to catch as many birds and monkeys
as we might require. The narrow escape we had had taught us
that we must in future avoid marching close to the water, and
that it would be prudent to kee"p a; bright look out when near
the shores of the lake not to run the risk of being snapped up by
a crocodile.
We were disappointed in consequence of this at not being able
to sleep securely, as we had expected, close down to the water, so
that we might have only one side of our camp to defend. From
the experience we had obtained we now saw that we should run a
greater chance of being carried off by crocodiles than even by
lions or leopards.
We had marched on for about an hour after the occurrence I

have described, when finding that we could cut off a point by
proceeding straight on, we had of necessity to leave the shore of
the lake, the water of which we had hitherto always had in sight.
We had made good some distance, often having to cut away the
creepers which impeded our path, and were expecting soon again
to catch sight of the water, when loud trumpeting sounds reached
our ears.
We stopped to listen, and were soon convinced that the
sounds we heard were uttered by elephants, and, moreover, that
they were for some cause or other excited by rage. However,
as the animals were, we judged, still at some distance on our
right hand, we agreed to continue our course, hoping that they
would not discover us. In case they should do so, and we
should have to defend ourselves, we put bullets into our rifles.
The evening was approaching, and it was necessary to look
out for a spot sufficiently open to enable us to light the fire,
and at the same time not in too dangerous proximity to the lake.
That we might have a better chance of finding the spot we
were in search of, we separated, Tubbs and Charley going on
ahead, while Harry, Aboh, and I searched round on either side
of where we then were. We found that we were at no great dis-
tance from the lake, the shining water of which we saw between
the trees.
"Here's a spot just suitable for us," cried Harry, "but we
shall have to cut down the grass that the fire may not spread,
otherwise we may create a blaze which would prove very
inconvenient."
Just as he spoke the trumpeting sounds we had before heard
again reached our ears, but very much nearer. Aboh stopped
in an attitude of listening. Presently there came a noise
as of the crashing of branches and the tramping of heavy feet
on the ground.
"Elephant come dis way," exclaimed Aboh; "run, massa,


## p. 145 (#213) ############################################

ESCAPE FROM ELEPHANTS.
run;" and he set off in the direction of the lake, pointing to a
large tree at no great distance from us.
Harry and I followed his example, hoping that Charley and
Tubbs would hear the sounds in time to make their escape.
The trumpeting and crashing sounds drew nearer. Presently
we caught sight of several huge trunks lifted in the air, with
gleaming tusks below them, and the huge heads of the savage
monsters among the leaves.
"Here, massa, here, get up I" exclaimed Aboh, reaching the
foot of the tree.
As he spoke, seizing a bough, he swung himself up with
the agility of a monkey on to a lower branch. I cast my
eye behind me, when what was my horror to see Charley
coming along with three or four elephants dashing at full
speed not thirty yards behind him. It seemed scarcely pos-
sible that he could reach a place of safety before he was over-
taken. All my thoughts were now turned on Charley, and I
regretted that I had not managed to hand my rifle to Aboh
before climbing up myself. Charley had dropped his, and came
bounding along, the elephants, however, gaining on him. He
saw us, and made towards the tree. Aboh and I stooped down
to catch his hands and help him up. He was within twenty
yards of us, when his foot caught in one of the treacherous vines
which crept in snakelike coils over the ground and hung from
numberless branches, and he fell. He was instantly, however,
again on his feet, and came rushing on as before; but the delay
had enabled the leading elephant to gain on him. We shrieked
and shouted to encourage him, or perhaps impelled to do so
by our fears. He reached the foot of the tree. In another
instant the elephant would have seized him with its trunk or
trampled him under its feet. Had he not possessed unusual
activity his destruction would have been certain. He grasped
the bough nearest him. Aboh sprang down and got him by one

hand. I seized him by the other. The elephant's trunk was
already touching his leg, which would the next moment have
been encircled in its fatal embrace. We tugged and hauled;
the animal caught his shoe, which happily gave way, and Charley
was out of its reach. We now breathed more freely, for the tree
was far too stout to enable the elephants to tear it down. The
beast which had so nearly caught Charley stood trumpeting with
rage beneath our feet, lifting up his trunk in a vain attempt to
reach us.
We, as may be supposed, climbed higher up, so as to be well
out of his way. In a few seconds the remainder of the herd
came up, surrounding the tree and all trumpeting together.
It was a sound sufficient to make our hearts quail. Had we
possessed our rifles, we might have quickly put an end to the
animals, mighty as they seemed. Fortunately, in their rage they
did not discover them, as they were concealed in the tall grass
and leaves between the roots. We dreaded, however, every
instant that their feet would come down and crush them,
when they, in all probability, would have been rendered per-
fectly useless.
Our thoughts were now turned towards Tom. Charley said
that he had lost sight of him just before he saw the elephants,
but that he trusted he had sought safety in a tree as we had
done. We shouted out, hoping that he would hear us; but
the trumpeting of the elephants drowned our voices. However,
although we did not get any answer, we still hoped that he might
have escaped.
"I wish that I had not lost my rifle," said Charley, "although
I think I should be able to find it again if the beasts did not
trample upon it, and I don't think they did, for I threw it as far
from me as I could into a thick bush."
"If you hadn't thrown it away, both you and it would have
been crushed to pieces," answered Harry. "I think it is for-

133
tunate that you had presence of mind to get rid of it. But, I
say, I wonder whether these beasts are going to lay siege to us
all night . I'm getting very hungry. If they don't go away we
shall be starved."
"Perhaps the best thing we can do is to climb up higher and
hide ourselves, and then, when they don't see us, their rage may
abate, and they will go away," I remarked. "They are not likely
to remain here all night, and will probably go to the lake to
drink, and give us time, at all events, to get down and recover
our rifles."
"What does Aboh think about the matter?" asked Charley.
I inquired of the black, making the usual signs by means of
which we carried on a conversation with him, and using such
simple words as he was likely to understand. He evidently com-
prehended what I said, and highly approved of our plan of hid-
ing ourselves,-setting the example by climbing up and concealing
himself from the elephants below. We three did the same,
though I managed still to watch them by peeping through the
leaves of the bough on which I had perched myself. The crea-
tures in a short time ceased their trumpeting, but still remained
walking slowly round and round the tree, looking up in a sagacious
fashion to ascertain what had become of us. At last they ap-
peared either to forget us, or to fancy that we were birds, and
had flown away. The biggest elephant, which had so
nearly caught Charley, then led the way down to the lake, the
rest following him. It was with infinite satisfaction that we saw
them go.
"Now, quick, quick! let us get our rifles, at all events, before
they come back," whispered Charley.
Aboh, seeing me about to descend, made a sign that he would
go himself, and, with wonderful agility, he slipped down the
tree, while Charley descended to the lowest bough to reach the
rifles as he handed them up. I followed, keeping a little above

my brother, that I might pass them on to Harry. I felt very
thankful when Aboh handed up my rifle to Charley, who giving
it to me, I passed it on to Harry. Aboh then, again slipping
down, handed up Harry's. To our infinite relief neither of
them were injured, though the feet of the elephants must have
trampled the ground on either side.
"Him go get massa officer's rifle," said Aboh, who was delighted
to make use of some of the words with which he was best ac-
quainted; and without waiting to obtain our sanction, he darted
off in the direction from which Charley came.
"See if you can find Tom anywhere," I shouted.
Aboh turned and made a sign to us to be silent, pointing at the
same time towards the lake, where the elephants were drinking.
I regretted having cried out, lest my voice should have attracted
the creatures' attention, and might cause them to return and
look for us. Although Aboh probably thought that Tom
was concealed somewhere in the neighbourhood, yet, knowing
the importance of silence, he did not cry out to ascertain his
position.
We watched him anxiously, for we feared that at any moment
the elephants might come back before he could discover the rifle,
which might take some time to find. We saw him hunting about,
but Charley said that he thought the spot where he had thrown it
away was much farther off. At length he was altogether hidden
from our sight by the thick foliage.
"Harry, do you climb up and keep a look-out for the elephants,
and Dick and I will stand by to help up Aboh when he conies
back. If you see the beasts coming, send a shot into the head
of the leader; if you don't kill him, it will probably bring him to
a standstill or turn him aside, and give the black more time to
climb up the tree," said Charley.
"Ay, ay !" answered Harry, taking his rifle; "I'll do my best
to stop the brutes coming this way, at all events."


## p. 145 (#217) ############################################

AN ELEPHANT KILLED.
135
Charley and I waited on the lower branches, my brother being
beneath me, watching for the return of Aboh. At last we saw
him coming along with Charley's rifle in his hand. At the same
instant Harry shouted out—
"Here come the elephants with their trunks turned up, but
they are walking leisurely along, as if they had forgotten all
about us."
"Don't fire, then, unless they come close to the tree," answered
Charley, while he made signs to Aboh to hasten his steps, point-
ing as he did so towards the lake. Aboh sprang forward, but
the quick ears and quick sight of the elephants had detected
him, and sticking out their trunks, they begun trumpeting and
moving rapidly forward. I scarcely thought it possible that Aboh
could escape them. Just then we heard the report of Harry's
rifle over our heads. A shriek of rage escaped the leading elephant,
and he had, we concluded, been hit. At the same moment
Aboh stopped, and levelling his rifle, fired. The ball struck the
animal, which, however, still came on, although at a slower pace
than before, and Aboh, grasping the rifle, darted up the tree hold-
ing it above his head, so that Charley could stoop down and seize
it by the barrel. Handing it to me, he was able to assist Aboh,
who nimbly scrambled up.
We all then retreated to our former resting-places, out of
the reach of the elephants' trunks. The whole herd came
on, the leader bleeding but still trumpeting furiously. We,
however, had him in our power, and felt pretty sure that
his trumpetings would soon be over. My weapon was still
loaded, Charley asked me to let him have it, as he was in a
better position for firing than I was. I handed it to him, and
as the elephants came near he took aim at the leader, wait-
ing until in his circuit round the tree his head presented a fair
mark. He fired, the huge monster immediately sank down, and
almost without a struggle was dead. We could not resist

joining Aboh in the loud shout of triumph he raised as we saw
our enemy destroyed. On the fall of their leader, the other
elephants became alarmed, and uttering a few trumpetings, more
of fear than anger, rushed off together into the forest, crushing
down the shrubs and young trees as they went, making a good
pathway towards the southward, which would have saved us
much trouble to have followed had we wished to go in that
direction. We now, feeling sure that they would not return,
descended. Our first care on reaching the ground was to reload
our rifles.
"I wish that we could carry off the tusks," said Harry. "I'm
sure they would be worth no small number of dollars if they
were safe on board."
"It is very certain that we cannot get them down to the sea at
present, and probably before we can return to fetch them some
other hunters will have carried them off," observed Charley.
While we were discussing the subject, Aboh had got out his
knife and was working away at one of the animal's feet, which he
succeeded in cleverly amputating.
"Him good eat," said the black pointing to the foot he had
just cut off.
Although we certainly could not agree with him, we did not
contradict his assertion. He then cut some slices out of the back,
which had not a more attractive appearance than the foot. The
black, however, seemed to think that we had now an ample
supply of food. We should have camped on the spot, as the
shades of evening were already coming on, had we not been
anxious to discover Tom.
"We must find him before nightfall," I observed; "for even
although the creatures may not have killed him, he may be injured
and unable to rejoin us."
"Certainly, unless he has got to a considerable distance, he
must have heard our shouts," remarked Harry.

Charley agreed with us, and we accordingly proceeded in the
direction of the spot where Charley had left our companion. As
we went on we shouted out his name, while we looked carefully
on either side, dreading at any moment to discover his mangled
remains. Aboh hunted about with great care, but for some
distance the ground was so trampled by the elephants' feet,
and the trees and shrubs so torn, that any footsteps of a human
being must effectually have been obliterated. Presently, how-
ever, we crossed the path formed by the herd as they had
made their way towards us, and all traces of them ceased. A
short time afterwards we saw Aboh examining the ground, then
he pointed ahead and went on at a rapid rate, we following his
footsteps. Again he stopped, and stooping down picked up
a rifle. We recognised it as Tom's. What had become of its
owner? Still Aboh went on.
By this time the forest was so shrouded in the gloom of
approaching night that we could with difficulty see anything
before us. Again Aboh stopped and cried out, " Him here ! him
here!" We hurried forward. There was our poor friend stretched
on the ground, his leg caught in a vine below a tall tree with
branches coming close to the ground. The dreadful thought
seized me that he was dead.
"Tom, Mr. Tubbs, speak to me," I cried out.
I heard a groan. At all events, he was alive. Stooping down,
I rested his head on my knee. Charley and Harry quickly
came up. We soon released poor Tom's foot. On examining
it, we feared that it was dislocated, or at all events severely
sprained, and that probably he had fainted from the pain.
Having water in our flasks, we poured some down his throat.
By wetting his hands and chafing his arms we in a short
time brought him to. He looked round him, evidently very
much astonished.
"Where am I, mates? What has happened?" he asked at

length. "I was dreaming that a shark or a tiger or some beast or
other had bitten off my foot."
"Not so bad as that," said Charley, "although you have hurt
it considerably, I fear."
"Ah, now I recollect all about it . I was afraid, Mr. Westerton,
that you were caught by the elephants, and I was expecting to
share the same fate. As I could not help you, I thought the
wisest thing I could do was to run for my life. I confess it, I
never was in such a fright before. I somehow dropped my gun,
and then, just as I was about to climb up into that tree overhead,
I found myself caught with a round turn about my leg, and down
I came. The honest truth is, I don't remember anything more
of what happened after that."
It would have been unjust to blame poor Tom for the very
natural panic which had seized him on finding himself alone
in the forest, and, as he supposed, with his companions
killed. He had acted as most people would have done under
similar circumstances, and endeavoured to save his life. We
fortunately found not far off just such an open space
as we were searching for. Our first business was to light
a fire in the centre of it, after having cut away the surrounding
grass.
"We must keep up a good blaze, or we may have some unwell
come visits from wild beasts," said Charley. "It will be
necessary to keep an eye towards the lake, or one of those
horrid crocodiles may be crawling up in search of some
supper when the odour of the roasted elephant-meat reaches
his nose."
While Charley and I attended to poor Tom, Harry and Aboh
made up the fire as proposed. We had brought an iron sauce-
pan, with which Aboh intimated that he would go down to the
lake to get some water, making a sign to Harry to accompany
him with his gun.

WE BANDAGE TOM'S ANKLE.
139
"If big ting come out of de water, fire at him head," he said,
showing that he was fully alive to the danger of approaching the
lake, especially of an evening, when the crocodiles are more
active than at other times during the day.
We kept the fire blazing up brightly, so that it might scare
any wild beasts prowling round about us. However, not trusting
to that alone, Charley and I kept our rifles by our sides and our
eyes about us, lest a lion or leopard might spring upon us
unawares. Having got off Tom's boot and sock, we examined
his ankle. It looked blue and swollen, and when we touched it
he complained that it pained him much. Still, as far as we could
judge, no bone was broken.
"The only thing I can think of is to bind it up in a wet
handkerchief," observed Charley; "the inflammation may thus
be allayed."
While we were speaking we heard a shot from Harry's gun,
showing that we must not expect to obtain even a saucepan
of water without trouble. Shortly afterwards Aboh returned
with the water. Charley asked for some of it, and saturating
a handkerchief, which he fortunately had in his pocket,
he bound up Tom's ankle. Harry told us that scarcely had
Aboh dipped the saucepan into the water, than a crocodile
poked its ugly head above the surface and made a dash at
him.
"I was too quick, however, and firing, hit the creature in the
throat, when it slid off again into deep water," he added, " whether
killed or not I cannot say, as it sank immediately."
"You have done so well that we must get you to make
another trip as soon as we have eaten our soup, which, I sup-
pose, Aboh intends to make out of the elephant-meat, for I
doubt if it will be palatable cooked in any other way," said
Charley.
We found that the black had brought several stones from the

shores of the lake. He now, having placed them in the fire, dug
a hole near at hand, into which he scraped some of the ashes,
and then put in the stones with the elephant's foot on the top of
them. Above this having placed some thick leaves, he quickly
filled up the hole.
"Him soon good eat," he said.
Harry had in the meantime cut up some pieces of elephant-
meat, which he put into the saucepan. Having placed it on
the fire, he stuck some other slices on forked sticks as close as
they could be placed to the flames.
"We shall have the opportunity of trying the comparative
excellencies of three styles of cooking," he observed, laughing.
"I have no great faith in Aboh's mode of proceeding," re-
marked Charley.
"Nor have I, except to produce any especially excellent
soup," said Harry.
Our patience was to be severely exercised. We were all
so hungry that Charley consented to serve out a small
piece of biscuit to each of us, just to stay our appetites; but
that produced a very transient effect. At first I saw him
tightening his waist-belt; then I had to tighten mine, as Harry
did his. Poor Tom was suffering too much pain to care about
eating, and Aboh was well accustomed to endure long hours of
fasting.
"When is that mess of yours likely to be ready?" Charley and
I kept crying out to Harry.
"I think that it is done to a turn now," said Harry, and he
produced five pieces of black-looking stuff.
"A very long turn," said Charley as he took his share.
"Why, it's as hard and dry as shoe-leather, and quite as tough, I
suspect."
"Chew it, man, chew it," answered Charley, laughing; "it's
better than that in the soup."


## p. 145 (#223) ############################################

A SNAKE IN THE GRASS.
We all cut off little bits, hunger making us in no way par-
ticular; but it was a difficult business to get down a mouthful.
At last I took to scraping it with my knife, by which means I
was able to swallow more than I otherwise could have done.
We next tried the soup. The warm liquid could at all events
be swallowed, and it appeared to do good to poor Tom, to whom
we gave several cupfuls. The meat, however, was scarcely an
improvement upon the steaks. Aboh had been watching us all
the time while he munched his share without showing a sign of
dissatisfaction.
"As we shall want some more water for poor Tom's foot, I
wish you would go down, Harry, to the lake and fill the sauce-
pan," said Charley.
"I will go with Aboh willingly enough, provided he carries a
torch, for otherwise the chances are that we shall not get off as
easily as we did before," answered Harry.
Aboh understood what was proposed, and taking a brand
from the fire in one hand, and the saucepan in the other, he set
off, Harry accompanying him with his rifle ready for instant use.
Charley and I, in the meantime, got up and examined the forest
around us. Strange noises were issuing from it; but our ears
being unaccustomed to the sounds of an African wilderness, we
could not distinguish either the animals or birds which produced
them. Here and there we picked up sticks, which we carried to
the heap prepared for keeping up the fire during the night. I
was stooping down, expecting to take up a thin stick, when I saw
it glide away. I had nearly caught hold of a snake by the body.
It might have been harmless, but if venomous, I should have
probably been fatally bitten. I sprang back, as may be sup-
posed, and was very cautious after this to feel with the pole I
carried in my hand before I picked up any other sticks. In a
short time Harry and Aboh came back with the saucepan of
water, from which we filled our mugs, for the tough elephant-

meat made us thirsty. We were all suffering from hunger, and as
we expected to find Aboh's dish as unpalatable as ours, we had
made up our minds to lie down, if not exactly supperless, as
hungry almost as before.
"Now, massa, him 'tink foot ready," said Aboh, and without
more ado, he opened the hole and produced the foot hot and
steaming. Just taking off the top, as if it had been a piece of pie-
crust, what was our surprise and very great satisfaction to find
the interior full of a rich glutinous substance. We eagerly
hooked it out with our knives, and it was pronounced excellent
jelly, although somewhat strong tasted. The single foot con-
tained more than we altogether could eat, although Aboh got
through twice as much as either of the rest of us. We regretted
that we had not brought along more of the elephant's feet.
Instead of going supperless to bed, we thus had a more ample
meal than we had eaten since we landed. As it was important
that Tom should have a night's rest, Charley, Harry, and I
agreed to keep watch in turns. We did not ask Aboh, though
he would, we felt sure, have proved trustworthy. I had the
middle watch. As I walked round and round the camp, my ears
were saluted by distant mutterings and the occasional roar of
lions, the trumpetings of elephants, or the shrill agonised cry of
some hapless deer on which a stealthy leopard had pounced,
the shrieks of night birds, the chirp of insects, and the croaking
of frogs. Every moment I expected to see some monster shove
its nose out amid the dark foliage; but if any came near, the fire
prevented them from springing on us. I occasionally stooped
down and wetted Tom's bandage, so that his leg was kept cool
all the night. Charging Harry to do. the same, I at length lay
down, and in a moment was fast asleep. Next morning we found
Tom better, but utterly unable to proceed. We, therefore, had
to make up our minds to camp for another day at least, unless
we could manage to find a canoe in which to cross the lake.

MAHOGANY TREES.
143
Harry and I, as soon as we were on foot, took our guns, accom-
panied by Aboh, in search of game for breakfast. We soon
came upon a number of ducks, and were fortunate in killing
half a dozen in three shots, two being brought to the ground
each time we fired. We did not forget the crocodiles, nor did
Aboh, who was very wary when picking up the birds. As we
made our way through the forest, I was especially struck by the
variety and luxuriance of the trees and shrubs, the number of
vines which hung from the branches in wreaths and festoons,
the length of the leaves, some rising from the ground, others
forming crowns on the summits of tall trees, surmounted by
flowers of bright red or yellow or blue.
"Dere, massa, what you 'tink dat?" said Aboh, throwing
himself on the ground as if to contemplate at his ease the
magnificent tree before which we stood. "Him 'board ship
worth many tusks."
"What tree is it?" I asked.
It was certainly one of the finest and most graceful trees we
had yet met with in the African forest. Its leaves were long,
sharp-pointed, and dark green, hanging in large clusters. Its bark
was also a dark green and very smooth. The trunk rose straight
and clean to the height of sixty feet or more, from whence
large leafy branches projected to a considerable distance. Aboh
pointed to his own skin and then laughed.
"He means that it's an ebony tree, and so I'm sure it is,"
said Harry. "It is one of those articles we were to have pro-
cured."
On examining the tree we found that it was hollow, and Aboh
made us understand that the branches also were hollow. On
cutting through the bark we came to some white wood, which at
first puzzled us. We expected to have found it black, but Aboh
made signs that we were to cut deeper into it, and we thus
ascertained that the white wood was simply sap wood, and that

farther in the wood was perfectly black. We found several
others of the same description growing around; and we agreed
that if we could fall in with some friendly natives, we would
advise them to cut the trees down, and should any navigable
river exist running out of the lake, to convey them to its mouth,
where they could be embarked. We, however, had to hurry
back to cook our ducks for breakfast.
We continued keeping our poor companion's ankle constantly
wetted, but, to our disappointment, even the next day he was
unable to do more than stand up. The moment he attempted to
walk, the pain returned, and we had to make up our minds for
a longer stay. Charley proposed that we should cut down a
tree and scoop out a canoe in which to cross the lake. When he
explained his intentions, however, to Aboh, the black replied
that it would take us several weeks, if not months, to construct a
canoe, and that we should get round the lake much faster by
land.
"That maybe the case," said Charley; "but suppose Tom's
ankle is broken, or so injured that he is unable to walk, we shall
have no alternative. We cannot leave him behind us in this wild
forest, and we must try to find a village of friendly natives, where
he can remain until he is recovered."
"I'm sorry to keep you back, gentlemen, and if it was a
matter of life or death, I'd say go on and leave me behind, but
it would be a terrible thing if that were necessary; so I would
rather say, let us build a canoe, or, if we cannot, a raft on which
we can cross the lake. I don't think it would take as long as
Aboh supposes, if we could find a soft tree. He doesn't know
what our sharp axes can do; besides, we can clear out the
inside with fire. Even if I hadn't sprained my ankle, I again
say, provided that we can find the right tree, let us build a
canoe."
Charley agreed with Tubbs, and Harry and I had no strong

opinion the other way. We told Aboh we wished he would
hunt about to find a big tree of soft wood.
Aboh agreed to do as we wished, at the same time he shook
his head, saying, " Too long, too long."
"No, no," answered Tom; "we will build a handsome short
craft with plenty of beam, so that we may turn her about in any
of the narrow streams through which we may have to make our
way."

'I "HE very evening on which we had determined to form a
_L canoe, we commenced our search for a tree suitable for
the purpose. In vain, however, we hunted in the neighbourhood
of the lake. Aboh pointed to the south. "Find him dere," he
said.
We were, however, unwilling to go to a distance from our com-
panion, for we knew not to what dangers he might be exposed
should he be left alone, even although he was able to sit up and
handle his rifle, and might perhaps have hobbled to a short dis-
tance. Still he would have to do that at the risk of again injuring
his ankle.
"I will remain with him if you and Charley like to set off
with Aboh as a guide," said Harry. "If you can find a tree at

147
no great distance, you can cut it down and shape it where it
falls, so that it will not give us much trouble to transport it to
the lake."
"More than you suspect, unless we can find a level path down
to the water," observed Charley.
Though I agreed with my brother, we notwithstanding made
up our minds to start early the following morning, and should we
find a tree suitable for a canoe within a mile or so, to cut it
down; but if not, to give up the undertaking. We had cooked
overnight some waterfowl for provisions, and Aboh, I should
have said, had found some fruits, which were highly acceptable.
We rose at daybreak, summoned by Harry, who had kept the
morning watch, and at once set off, having determined not to
wait for breakfast, as we wished to have the whole day before us.
Charley and I directed our course to the shore of the lake, to
which we had discovered a path, formed probably by elephants,
leading directly to the water.
Just as we were approaching the lake, we caught sight through
the bushes of a canoe paddled by a single rower skimming lightly
over the surface towards us. Wishing to open a communication
with the man in the canoe in order to obtain information from
him as to the best course we could take to get to the north-
ward, or perhaps to induce him to ferry us across, we hid behind
the bushes. The stranger, by his movements, appeared not to
be aware that any one was in the neighbourhood, and came on
without hesitation to the shore, close to the spot where we were
hid.
Aboh had remained behind to assist Tom in gathering sticks
and lighting the fire, while Harry had settled to come a short
distance with us. The black had on no other garment but the
usual white cloth, showing that he belonged to one of the wild
tribes to the west.
He ran his canoe right up on the bank, and then without
hesitation stepped out, carrying a spear in one hand, a quiver of

arrows on his back, and a bow in the other. We allowed him to
advance some distance, until suddenly he came in sight of Tom
and Aboh engaged in making up the fire. Immediately stopping,
he was about to fix an arrow in his bow, when Charley and I
showed ourselves. On seeing us he retreated a few paces,
and then fell to the ground overcome by terror. Charley and
I, wishing to reassure him, advanced as Harry came up to
him.
The black, seizing his foot, placed it on his neck in token of
submission. So sudden was the movement that Harry, who
could not prevent him from doing this, was nearly upset, and
would have been so had not he supported himself by his rifle.
On this I turned round and shouted to Aboh to come and inter-
pret for us. As Aboh approached, Charley and I stooped down
and lifted up the negro, who was still trembling with alarm, though
we endeavoured by the tone of our voices and our gestures to
reassure him.
"Come, Aboh, come ; let him know that we are friends," cried
my brother.
Aboh hurried up. As he got near he stopped, gazing with
astonished looks at the stranger, uttering a few words unintel-
ligible to us. The stranger answered in the same language. Soon
they began to speak more rapidly, stepping towards each other;
then suddenly with loud exclamations of delight they sprang for-
ward, and throwing themselves into each other's arms, burst out
into tears.
"Brodder! him brodder!" shouted out Aboh, turning round to
us to signify that he had found a relative.
This was indeed satisfactory, as the stranger would be able to
render us all the assistance we required. His canoe, however,
was but a small one, and certainly would not convey all the party
across the lake.
"We shall still have to build one, unless our friend here can
find us another," said Charley.

TOM AGREES TO ACCOMPANY THE BLACKS. 149
"I think a better plan would be to get Aboh and his brother
to ferry Tom across the lake while we march round and find our
way to his village."
On explaining our proposal to Aboh, he had a long palaver
with his brother. The result was not satisfactory.
"Bad man dere," he said, pointing to the eastern end of the
lake.
"What do you advise, then ?" asked Charley.
"Stay here; Shimbo him go and bring back big canoe," was
the answer. When we suggested that Aboh and Shimbo should
take Tom across, they at once agreed to do so, Aboh observing
that Shimbo's canoe would easily carry three people, but that it
would require two canoes of similar size to paddle us all across.
Tom had no objection to accompany the blacks, and we were
anxious that he should get under shelter as soon as possible. We
ourselves proposed remaining where we were and hunting, so that
we might carry a good supply of game with us as a present to our
friends' tribe.
Instead, therefore, of starting off to look for a tree to make a
canoe as we had intended, we,all repaired to the fire which Tom
had been blowing into a blaze, and soon had a number of wild-
fowl roasting before it. As soon as he saw our pot on the fire,
Shimbo ran off to his canoe and brought back some plantains,
which he set to work to peel; he then carefully washed them,
and cutting them in several pieces, put them into the sauce-
pan. Then he half filled it with water and covered it over with
leaves, on the top of which he placed the banana peelings.
The vegetables were boiled by the time the ducks were roasted.
He also roasted a few ground-nuts, both of which were very
acceptable to us after not having tasted vegetables for so long a
time. We thought the boiled plantains were rather insipid, until
Shimbo produced a bag full of cayenne pepper, with which he
sprinkled them as he hooked them out of the pot, and placed
them on some broad leaves to serve as plates. Altogether, we

had not had so satisfactory a meal for some time. We told
Aboh that we hoped to have plenty of game for his friends, and
urged him to come back as soon as possible. Tom looked
rather grave as we lifted him into the canoe. Perhaps he was
not so confident as we were that he would receive a friendly
reception.
While watching the canoe as she skimmed over the calm
surface of the lake urged by Aboh's and Shimbo's paddles, we
could just see the blue outline of the opposite shore, with here
and there what we supposed to be tall trees rising above those of
the usual forest growth, but they might be hills or hillocks, so
wide was the lake. It would evidently have taken us many
a day's march to get round the way we proposed. Then we
might have been stopped by the bad people of whom Aboh
spoke.
Our meditations on the subject were interrupted by the appear-
ance of the snout of a crocodile, who, swimming by, had taken
a fancy to have one of us for his lunch. We shouted loudly; he
beat a retreat, looking out, while passing slowly on, for any
unwary duck or other wildfowl floating calmly on the smooth
water.
"We must keep our promise and get as many birds as we
can," said Charley; "so come along. It will be as well, however,
not to separate, for we may fall in with a lion or leopard, or a
herd of elephants. We ought to be ready to support each
other."
Harry and I of course agreed to this. We were very success-
ful, and in the course of a couple of hours had shot three dozen
ducks. Our difficulty, however, was to preserve them. Even
though we hung them up on the boughs of trees, the ants would
manage to get at them, or birds of prey were likely to carry them
off, or, unless they were placed at a considerable distance from
the ground, a leopard or other wild animal might do so; while
it was necessary to look out for a shady spot, or they would have

151
become uneatable before the following day. We accordingly set
to work and made some baskets of vines, interwoven with thick
leaves, which would protect them from all other creatures with
the exception of the ants. This occupied us two hours or
more, and we agreed that it would be useless to expend a
further amount of powder. We then cooked a duck apiece,
and the remainder of the roots and nuts which Shimbo had
left us.
After dinner we went down to the lake to look out for the
canoes, thinking that by this time Aboh might be returning; but
none were to be seen as far as our eyes could reach over the
surface of the water. We, therefore, walked along under the
shade of the trees, though at a safe distance to avoid danger
from the sudden rush of a crocodile. After we had gone some
way, we caught sight of a beautiful deer gazing into the waters of
the lake, apparently admiring itself, and occasionally stooping
down to draw up a mouthful. Retiring behind the trees, we
advanced cautiously, hoping to get a shot, and to add the creature
to our larder. I was ahead, and having got well within distance,
had just raised my rifle, and was on the point of drawing my
trigger, when I was startled by seeing a huge crocodile literally
leap out of the water, and then, like a flash of lightning, spring
back again, holding the unfortunate deer struggling violently
in its tremendous jaws. I fired, but my bullet glanced off the
side of the scaly monster, which disappeared with its victim.
It was much the same to the deer whether it was eaten by us
or the crocodile, but we were greatly disappointed at losing
it . However, the occurrence made us look out more care-
fully for deer, as we might hope to catch one or two, and veni-
son we calculated would be highly prized by our friends.
Besides which, we ourselves were getting somewhat tired of duck
every day.
As we thought it very likely that another deer would come down
during the afternoon to drink at the lake, we formed a screen of

boughs, which served as a favourable look-out. While two of
us kept watch for the deer, the third guarded the rear of our
ambush lest a wild beast might carry off one of us for his supper,
instead of our supping off deer as we hoped to do. It was very
fortunate that we took these precautions. We had not occupied
our posts more than a quarter of an hour when Harry, who was
on the look-out, whispered—
"There's a creature crawling along not a hundred yards*
off."
Charley took a glance round. "It's a leopard, and it evi-
dently sees us; we must be ready to fire," he whispered.
"But if we do, we shall frighten the deer; so don't pull a
trigger unless it comes nearer," I observed.
The leopard slowly crept by, being apparently itself in search
of prey. It soon disappeared, and although we kept a bright
look-out, it did not return. After this we waited patiently for
nearly an hour, when we saw a small herd of deer coming down
the glade. So anxious were we, that we scarcely dared breathe
lest we should alarm them. I remembered the leopard, and
thought that it might possibly be on the look-out for the deer,
and might put them to flight before they could come within shot.
On they trotted, however, as if thoughtless of danger. We
allowed the leader to reach the water. Charley signed to me to
point out the one at which I intended to aim. We each selected
one.
The cracks of our three rifles were heard almost at the same
moment. Two of the deer fell killed. The third, at which
Harry had aimed, attempted to escape, while the rest, looking
about them with a startled glance, bounded off. Scarcely, how-
ever, had the leader gone a dozen yards than a leopard sprang
out, and seizing the creature in its powerful jaws, carried it off
through the forest.
"Load, quickly, load," cried Charley.
We did so, and then rushed out to secure the deer we had

KILLING A SCORPION.
153
killed, fearing that another leopard might have a feast off it.
We were not, however, molested, and with infinite satisfaction
we dragged the animals one by one up to the neighbourhood of
our camp, where we commenced cutting them up, although, I
must confess, we were not expert in that part of the huntsman's
art. By the time we had finished our task, and hung up the
deer as near to our fire as possible, the sun had sunk below the
horizon.
We again went down to the lake, and were much disappointed
at not seeing the canoe Aboh had promised to bring us. As it was
not likely, therefore, that he would arrive that night, we made
up our minds to camp at the same spot as before. There was
no time to lose, and so, collecting firewood, we prepared to pass
the night . It might seem an easy task to get a supply of sticks,
but it was a dangerous one. Not only did we run the risk of
disturbing some venomous snake, but were nearly certain to
find scorpions almost as deadly among the dried wood. Our
plan, therefore, was to scrape together the sticks with a long
staff, and turn them over before attempting to bind them up into
faggots for conveying to the camp. I had not long been thus
employed, when a big scorpion crept out from a mass of bark; I
laid my stick, which it bit severely, on its back, striking its
sting into the wood before I crushed it to death. Having
collected a sufficient amount of fuel to last for the night, we put
up a lean-to, under which we could shelter ourselves from the
night dew, though it would afford but a slight protection against
any hungry animal which might venture near, as leopards and
lions might occasionally do. We filled our saucepan with water,
and made every preparation for the night, not forgetting to
cook as much venison as we could possibly eat. Having taken
a plentiful supper we were about to lie down, when Charley said
that he would first take a look round the camp. Not far off
was the huge trunk of a fallen tree, over which bushes had
already begun to grow. I saw Charley suddenly sink down

behind it, and as I was following him, he made a sign to me to
creep along under its shelter. I did so, and presently caught
sight of a huge animal advancing in a stealthy fashion along the
open ground. I at once knew it to be a leopard. Charley put
up his hand, signing me to be cautious. The leopard
approached, attracted, I have no doubt, by the smell of the
venison, or by the remainder of the carcasses of the deer, which
were not far off.
Whether or not it was the same leopard we had seen in
the afternoon, I could not tell. The creature moved on in its
cat-like fashion, looking cautiously around. Charley and I
kept ourselves well concealed, still it apparently suspected
that an enemy was near. It got directly in front of us. If
Charley missed I must, I knew, take care to bring it down, for
if not, it would make nothing of a bound over the tree, and
would carry one of us off. Charley levelled his rifle; a sharp
crack was heard ringing through the night air, answered by the
chattering of numberless monkeys and the shrieks of flocks of
parrots and other birds. The smoke for a moment prevented
me seeing the leopard; the next instant, what was my horror
to observe it approaching. In another instant it would have
been upon us. I fired; it leapt high in the air, and rolled over
close to the trunk of the tree.
"Well done, Dick!" cried Charley. "I hit it, but my bullet
missed the vital part."
The leopard was perfectly dead. We easily found the two
bullet-holes. Charley's bullet had struck the edge of a bone, and
been slightly deflected. Had he been alone, the result might have
been fatal to him. How thankful I felt that he had escaped! It
was a lesson to us never to go out hunting singly, and we agreed
that we would keep to that rule.
The leopard had fallen just under the bough of a tree, and as
we were anxious to preserve its skin, and yet did not wish to
spend time in flaying the animal that night, we resolved to try

and hoist it up to the bough, where it would remain safe till the
morning. We accordingly cut a number of vines which grew
near, and under Charley's directions formed a series of tackles,
by means of which we succeeded, all hoisting together, in lifting
it several feet off the ground. This done, we returned to our
camp. While we had been thus engaged, we had run the risk,
I suspect, of being attacked by another wild beast, either a
leopard or lion, as when I was on watch I heard the mutterings
of the last-named savage brutes in the distance. As I walked
up and down in front of our fire while my brother and Harry
were asleep, I watched the body of the leopard swinging in the
air a few feet off, and kept my gun on the cock ready to fire
should a lion approach, as I thought would very likely be the
case, although I had no particular wish to have another battle
that night. However, it so happened that we were left at
rest.
At early dawn we let down the carcase, and at once flayed it.
Our object in doing so was to present the skin to the chief of
the village we expected to visit, as we guessed it would be
highly prized; besides which, the fact that we had killed the
creature being known, would raise us in the estimation of the
people. Having hung up the skin to dry, Harry and I went
down to the lake, hoping to see the canoe of our friend, but
we were again disappointed. Charley had, in the meantime, been
preparing breakfast, roasting some more ducks, and the re-
mainder of the ground-nuts left us by Shimbo. After this, we
employed our time in scraping the inside of the leopard's skin,
which gave us enough to do; we then made a sort of lye from
the ashes of our fire, which would have, we hoped, some effect
in preserving the skin, though we were aware that the process
we adopted was very rude and imperfect . As several hours
had passed since Tubbs and the two blacks had left us, we
became somewhat anxious about them. If the natives had
proved treacherous, Tom would very likely be put to death or

kept a prisoner, and we should see nothing more of him. About
noon, Harry and I had gone down to the lake to get a sauce-
pan of water, when we remarked a tiny speck on the broad
shining expanse of the lake, where nothing previously had been
visible.
"Hurrah! that must be the canoe at last," he exclaimed.
I was of the same opinion. "If Charley were to have a look
at it, he would be more certain about the matter," I observed;
and running back, I called my brother.
"Yes, there's no doubt about it; that must be the canoe," he
said, after he had watched it attentively.
We now hoped that we should at length get away from the
spot where we had spent so much time. After watching for
several minutes, though it was still at a great distance, and
appeared to be approaching very slowly, we could distinctly
make out the canoe. We had gone back to eat our dinners,
as we had become hungry, when Harry said that he would go
down to the lake to see if the canoe was near the shore. Just
as he reached the water, we heard him cry out, "Here they are!
here they are!" Charley and I ran down to join him. The
next minute Aboh and Shimbo, with two other blacks, stepped
out of a good-sized canoe, capable of carrying us three in
addition. It was formed very much like the one we had
intended to make out of the trunk of a tree. Aboh seemed as
delighted to see us as if he had been away for several weeks.
Why he had not returned sooner, we could not exactly make
out, but we understood that the king of the village, Quagomolo,
was very ill, and as the only large canoes belonged to him, Aboh
could not see him to obtain the one he wished for. Our friends
had brought a supply of plantains and several other things—
manioc, sugar-cane, and squashes. There were provisions
enough for us and themselves for several days. Before com-
mencing the return voyage, they insisted we should cook them
and have a feast.


## p. 157 (#245) ############################################

WE LEAVE OUR CAMP.
157
"We have already had our dinner," said Charley.
"Bery good! but we,—we empty stomach. No good go sea
without eat," answered Aboh.
By which he let us understand that he and his companions
required food, and were not entirely disinterested in pressing us
to have a feast on the provisions they had brought. On seeing
the deer and the ducks we had shot, their eyes brightened.
Aboh and Shimbo were both very good cooks, and immediately
set to work to dress both the venison and the vegetables. Their
only regret was, that we had not some rum to give them, the
taste of which they had acquired from the white traders who
occasionally came up to their village. I should have said that
Aboh gave us a good report of Tom, who was being well treated
by the inhabitants of the village, by whom we also expected to
be received in a friendly manner. Aboh and Shimbo were so
long in preparing the viands, that by the time they announced
that all were sufficiently cooked, we were perfectly ready to fall
to. We enjoyed our meal, and as soon as it was over, Charley
proposed that we should start without delay.
The ducks and the venison were carried down to the canoe,
as well as the leopard skin. By the time we had taken our seats,
it appeared to us greatly overloaded; still our black friends
were unwilling to leave any provisions behind. Aboh, pointing
to the leopard skin, exclaimed, "King, him like much;" so
that we hoped our gift would be acceptable to his sable majesty.
The day was pretty well advanced, but we hoped to get across
the lake before nightfall. All being ready, our black crew
seizing their paddles, the canoe began to glide across the lake.
Charley took a fifth paddle with which to steer, but he soon
found that the blacks could manage the canoe perfectly well
without his assistance. The heat was so great on the water that
we were all thankful to avoid any unnecessary exertion. The
blacks as they paddled sang a low monotonous song, more like
a dirge. What it was about we could not tell. By looking

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
back we saw that we had got some distance from the land,
although we appeared not to have approached nearer the
opposite shore, which still remained as indistinct as before.
After some time the blacks ceased their song, and I saw them
gazing round at the sky, the appearance of which was rapidly
changing. The sun suddenly disappeared behind a dark bank
of cloud coming up from the west, and a leaden hue overspread
the hitherto sparkling water, at the same time that a strong wind
began to blow. This soon broke the hitherto tranquil lake into
hissing wavelets, which continually toppled over into the canoe.
Aboh, turning round, handed to each of us a bason formed from
a gourd, and made signs that we should bale out the water as it
came in. He and his companions then redoubled their efforts.
I caught a glimpse of his countenance as he turned round;
it showed that he was far from satisfied with the appearance
of the weather. I asked Charley what he thought about the
matter.
"I'm afraid that we are going to have a gale; and if so, a nasty
sea will get up, and we shall be obliged to heave our cargo over-
board, although we will not do so until it becomes absolutely
necessary."
Every instant the wind increased, and the blacks paddled
harder and harder. At present it was on our beam, although,
should it come ahead, we should make but little progress, or
perhaps be compelled to run back to the place we had left.
Notwithstanding the threatening aspect of the weather, Aboh
and his companions seemed determined to continue their course.
The water kept tumbling on board, but we continued baling it
out as fast as we could.
"I'm afraid that we must heave the birds and venison over-
board," said Charley.
I made Aboh understand what we proposed doing.
"No, no," was the answer; "dat all right."
He and his companions paddled on bravely for another half

A STORM ON THE LAKE.
hour. By this time it had become perfectly dark, and we could
not discover the land ahead, but the black fellows seemed to
guide their course by instinct, for I could see no welcoming
beacon on the shore. To our satisfaction the wind did not
increase, though the canoe tumbled about a good deal, and not
for a moment were we able to cease baling. The blacks paddled
on bravely through the pitchy darkness. Suddenly a flash of
lightning burst from the clouds, followed by a tremendous roar
of thunder. I could see the flame dancing along over the
water, mercifully avoiding our canoe, leaving all in darkness
beyond. The blacks for a moment ceased paddling.
"Go on, go on," I cried out to Aboh; "this is no time to
stop; the sooner we reach the shore the sooner we shall be in
safety."
Aboh repeated what I had said to his companions, and, thus
encouraged, all hands paddled away as before. As no land was
in sight, I could not make out how they managed to steer a
straight course, but they seemed perfectly satisfied that they
were going right. Probably they were guided by the wind on one
side. Had it shifted, they would have been thrown out. This I
greatly feared would be the case; and after all, might we be
paddling up the lake instead of across it. Charley got out his
pocket compass, but the wind prevented us striking a light, and
it was consequently of no use. He kept it before him, however,
in case another flash of lightning should enable him to see it.
He had not long to wait. A vivid flash darted directly across
the canoe.
"Hurrah !" he exclaimed; "we are all right; we are steering
due north."
We had no longer, after this, any doubt about the judgment of
our African friends. The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed,
and we continued to bale away as the water washed into the
canoe. For some moments the lightning ceased, and we hoped
the storm was over; but we were mistaken. Another flash

darted from the sky, more vivid than its predecessors, with a loud
hissing, crackling sound.
"Hurrah! I caught sight of some trees and a hut," exclaimed
Charley.
He was not mistaken, in less than a quarter of an hour after
this, the canoe ran alongside the bank in a little bay, and our
crew, jumping out, welcomed us on shore.
Their loud shouts brought a number of people out of the
neighbouring huts, who quickly unloaded the canoe; while we
were conducted by Aboh and Shimbo to a hut which they said
was prepared for our reception. Within we found Tom seated on
a couch formed of bamboos.
"Glad to see you, gentlemen, that I am," he exclaimed. "To
say the truth, I had begun to fear that you would never come
at all, as I have had some doubts about the intentions of our
friends here. They were very kind, howsomever, for they fed me
well and tried their skill at doctoring my foot, but I cannot say
that they have done it any good; so I hope, Mr. Westerton, that
you will again take me in hand."
We were thankful to find that Tom was in such good spirits.
Charley, on looking at his foot, said he hoped, as the swelling had
greatly gone down, that in a few days it would be as strong as ever.
As it was so late at night, we expected to go supperless to bed,
but we had not been long in the hut when a bevy of damsels
arrived carrying baskets on their heads, containing cooked
provisions enough, including some of our venison, to feed a
dozen people. We were not sorry to partake of them, as we
had become very hungry; but as we had had but little rest the
previous night, we begged our entertainers to leave us in quiet,
which they did not appear disposed to do. At length Aboh and
Shimbo making their appearance, at our request turned all our
guests out and allowed us to sleep in quiet.
Next morning we were awakened by great shouting, and on
inquiring the cause, ascertained that a famous doctor had come

A "FAMOUS" DOCTOR.
to cure the king, Quagomolo, of his disease, though what that
was we could not ascertain. We went out to see this important
personage, who presented a most fantastic appearance. His head
was adorned with feathers, birds' beaks, and claws of leopards,
hyenas, and other savage brutes; half his body was painted red,
the other half white, while his face was daubed with streaks of
alternate black, white, and red. Round his neck he wore
numerous chains and charms, which tinkled and rattled as he
moved about.
After having paraded himself through the village to be ad-
mired by the inhabitants, he was introduced to the hut of the
king, whom he had not yet seen. Finding no one to stop us,
we shortly afterwards followed, when we saw the doctor seated
on a low stool before a large earthenware pot, into which he was
looking intently. This done, having seized a lighted torch
smouldering by his side, he whirled it about his head till it burst
into a flame. He then waved it over the pot, muttering some
mysterious words. He continued this and similar performances
for so long a time that we were getting weary of witnessing them,
when suddenly a person rose from a couch at the further
end of the room, whom we rightly supposed to be King
Quagomolo.
"Sit down, your majesty, sit down," exclaimed the doctor.
"I'll soon say what's the matter with you."
The king obeyed. Again the doctor waved his torch and
gazed into the pot, and then declared that his majesty was
bewitched.
"Who are the people who have bewitched me?" asked the
king in a trembling voice.
"They are some men and women in your own kingdom, and
not far off from this," answered the doctor in a deep bass voice
which could be heard outside the hut, where a number of persons
were collected.
There was a general howl of alarm, for no one could tell who

would be fixed on. The king, on hearing this, announced that
the persons implicated must drink the poisoned water, usually
given on such occasions. So we learned from Aboh, who had
crept into the hut and squatted down beside us.
"We must try to defeat the old rascal," whispered Charley.
"Show us where the poison is to be concocted?"
The doctor had now a drum brought him by an attendant, on
which he began to beat vehemently, when the king again sank
down on his couch. We on this quietly made our exit, and, led
by Aboh, entered another hut, where, by the light of a single torch,
some old women were concocting the mysterious beverage. We
watched them until they had finished, when, leaving the bowl
covered up by a piece of matting, they crept out one by one,
holding up their hands, taking long, slow strides, and looking
truly like witches themselves, and, as Harry observed, "Very bad
specimens too."
As soon as they were gone, finding a jug of pure water near at
hand, Charley poured out the mixture into a corner, and filled up
the bowl again with the harmless liquid. Fortunately, we found
a basketful of what was evidently colouring matter, and having
mixed some of it in the water, we covered the bowl up again and
left the hut. We then went back to our hut. Finding that the
king, in spite of the lateness of the hour, was ready to receive us,
taking our two black friends, Aboh to act as interpreter, we
carried with us the leopard skin, some venison, and three strings
of beads of various colours. His majesty was a tall, ungainly
looking man, with as hideous a countenance as can well be
imagined. His appearance was not improved by the glare
of the torchlight and the terror under which he was suffering.
Having presented the leopard skin and venison, Charley,
who acted as spokesman, threw the string of beads round his
neck.
"Tell him," he said to Aboh, "that those are powerful charms,
and will quickly restore him to health."


## p. 163 (#251) ############################################

WE OUTWIT THE SORCERER.
After a short palaver we begged leave to retire, assuring his
majesty that he would be quite well in the morning, and that we
were very sure that none of his subjects had bewitched him, as
would then be proved."
"If we succeed we shall have performed a very good work,"
said Charley, laughing, as we returned to our hut.
Next morning the whole tribe was collected, and the accused
persons brought forward. The bowl was handed round among
them. No one to whom it was offered dared refuse to drink
from it, although the distortions of their countenances showed
the alarm under which they laboured. The king, who had been
brought out to witness the ceremony on a litter, sat by watching
them, and expecting, perhaps, to see some of them drop down
dead.
To our surprise three or four of them appeared greatly agitated,
writhing about and making hideous faces, but we felt very sure
that this was the result of imagination; and even these soon re-
covered, while the rest remained standing, and doing their best to
smile and convince the king and their friends of their innocence.
The effect on King Quagomolo was almost instantaneous, and
before evening he declared himself perfectly recovered. To
prove this, he summoned his liege subjects to attend a dance in
honour of the event. No great preparations were required, and
that very evening was fixed for the event. The king's wives, of
whom he had no small number, and all the dames and damsels
from far and wide, came trooping in, and arranged themselves in
the large open space in the centre of the village. The men sat
on the opposite side, with a line of musicians in front. These were
mostly drummers, who beat their huge tomtoms with right good
will, making the most fearful and deafening din. Others had
brass kettles, and others hollow pieces of wood, which assisted
greatly in the uproar; while at the same time both men and
women sang, shouted, and shrieked, until we, who stood at a
little distance off, could scarcely hear each other's voices. The

barbarous overture being brought to a conclusion, the king, who
had been seated amongst his wives, rose, and springing into the
centre of the circle, began snapping his fingers, twisting and turn-
ing in all sorts of attitudes, leaping from the ground, kicking up
one leg, then another, and throwing his arms round until it ap-
peared that he would swing them off.
"Here am I, my friends," he shouted. "Once I was ill, now I
am well; and if our white friends here will stay with us, I never
expect to be ill again."
He danced and shouted until we thought he would have
dropped. Presently he managed to spring back, exhibiting the
utmost agility to the last, until he sat down again in the midst of
his better halves, who had been amongst the most demonstrative
of his applauders. Several of his chiefs then followed his example,
but took good care not to surpass the king either in the time they
danced or the activity they displayed. Before they sat down,
several women sprang up, who, not being influenced by the same
motives as the courtiers, contrived to twist and turn themselves
in a way which was neither creditable to their modesty, nor
pleasant to look at. We had good reason to be satisfied with
this commencement of our intercourse. with King Quagomolo.
He presented us with abundance of food, and the hut built for
our accommodation was clean and comfortable.
In a short time, by careful treatment, Tom's ankle completely
regained its strength, and he declared himself ready to continue
the journey to the northward. We arranged, therefore, to start
immediately, but we calculated without our host. When we told
Aboh of our intentions, and asked him to accompany us, he made
a long face, and shaking his head, said, " King no let go, want
fight;" by which we understood that Quagomolo intended to
detain us in order that we might assist him in some predatory
excursion he was meditating against a neighbouring tribe, we
having firearms in good order, while he and his people had
among them only a few old muskets, many of which were desti-

tute of locks, and could only be fired by means of matches
applied to the touch-holes. On obtaining this information, we
agreed that it would not be wise to show any mistrust of the
king, but quietly to take our departure, with or without his
leave, whenever it might suit us to do so.
As we were well treated, we were in no hurry to get away,
besides which we had abundance of sport in the neighbourhood,
and seldom went out without bringing back eight or ten brace
of ducks and other wildfowl. However, at length we thought it
time to tell the king that we must be going.
We took the opportunity when he was in a good humour, having
just quaffed a few bowls of a sort of palm-wine of which he was
especially fond.
"Stay, my dear friends, stay a few days longer, and you shall
go forth with honour, and each of you shall take a wife with you
and a hundred attendants."
Charley assured his majesty that we must decline the wives, and
that our own rifles were the best attendants we desired, with the
exception of one or two intelligent men to act as guides.
"You shall have your will, you shall have your will," answered
the king, "but stay one day longer, just one day."
We accordingly, hoping to have no obstruction offered to our
departure, agreed to stay, but when the evening' arrived the king
sent a messenger to say he wished to see us.
"What, my friends," he began as we entered his hut—" do
you want to go and leave nie all forlorn, stay another day, stay
another day."
Such was the tenor of his address which Aboh translated to
us.
"Tell him that to-morrow we must go," said Charley.
The king smiled benignantly, so Harry declared, although he
appeared to me to make a very hideous grimace.
The next day, early in the morning, we all four loaded our
muskets, and asked Aboh if he was ready to accompany us."


## p. 164 (#256) ############################################

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"King, he give him leave, him go at once," he answered.
No sooner did we quit our hut than we saw all the men of the
village, fully armed, collected at the outlets, evidently resolved to
stop us by force. Although we might have fought our way through
them, we could not have done so without bloodshed. Again we
resolved to make a virtue of necessity, and remain until we could
find a favourable opportunity of escaping.
Several days passed by, and every morning, when we were pre-
pared to set out, we found the village guarded as before. When,
however, we left our packs behind us, we were allowed to ramble
at perfect freedom. Besides Aboh and Shimbo we found a party
always ready to accompany us and act as beaters.
Not wishing it to be supposed that we intended to leave that
morning, we quietly returned to our hut, and undoing our knap-
sacks again went out, simply with our rifles in our hands, as if we
intended to have a little shooting before breakfast. We had not
gone far when we saw a woman near the shore of the lake
apparently hunting about and calling out to some one in tones
of distress.
"Who is she? and what is it all about? " I asked Aboh.
"She king's wife. Go bathe, lose piccannany."
We hurried on until we met the poor woman. She then ex-
plained that while she was bathing in a sheltered pool she had
left her little boy on the bank of the lake to play about and
amuse himself, but when she came out of the water she could
nowhere find him. Of course it at once occurred to us that a
crocodile must have carried him off, but Aboh averred that if
such was the case the mother would have heard him cry out . He
might have slipped into the water and have been drowned, but
that he might possibly be hiding from her, for the sake of playing
a trick.
"In that case she will soon find him, I hope," I observed.
Scarcely had I spoken than I saw a huge crocodile crawling
out of the bank not twenty yards from us. The next instant,

167
stooping down its head, it lifted up a little black boy by one of
his legs.
At the sight the mother shrieked out, "My son, my son!"
The fate of the child seemed certain. As the huge creature
turned to run, I saw that its neck was exposed. Fortunately,
having loaded my rifle with ball, I fired. By a miracle it seemed,
the crocodile let the child drop, and after making a faint attempt
to recover it, gave a few convulsive struggles, and rolled off the
bank perfectly dead, for we could see it lying on its back in
shallow water.
The poor mother rushed forward and picked up the little boy,
who, although fearfully bitten about the leg, was still alive. It
had not before uttered a sound, but now it began to cry as it saw
the blood streaming from the wounded limb. As far as I could
judge, no vital part had been touched, and I told Aboh to say to
the mother, that if she would let us doctor it we would do so, as
I had hopes of its recovery. Having washed it then and there
in cold water, we stopped the blood, bound up the wounds, and
gave it to the mother to carry back. Quagomolo was, we found,
especially fond of the child. It was six or seven years old, and,
being in a healthy condition, by the evening appeared no worse,
At the end of three days, as lock-jaw had not set in, and the
wounds looked healthy, we assured the king of our belief that
his son would in time get well. Quagomolo and his wife both
appeared very grateful.
"Whatever you shall ask you shall have," he said; "half my
kingdom, half of my wives, or half of my children, or half of my
people for slaves."
"Tell his majesty that we are much obliged to him," answered
Charley; "but the only favour we ask is the loan of a couple of
his faithful subjects, and permission to proceed on our journey to
the northward, where we expect to fall in with some of our
countrymen. We are friends to Africa and the Africans, and

wish to do the people all the good we can, but that if he keeps
us here, our plans will be defeated."
The king replied "that he would consider the matter, but that
perhaps he knew what was for our good as well as we did our-
selves, and that if we wished to benefit the Africans we should
remain and exercise our skill on him and his people."
This answer was anything but satisfactory. We had accord-
ingly, as before, to shrug our shoulders and submit for the present,
not intending, however, much longer to comply with the fancies
of the sable monarch.

DAY after day passed by, and still King Quagomolo made
some excuse for not allowing us to proceed on our
journey. He could well afford to support us, for, savage as were
he and his people in most respects, they possessed an unusually
large plantation of plantains, on a piece of level ground a short
distance from the lake. He took special pride in it, and invited
us to pay it a visit. We could not calculate how many trees
there were, though there must have been upwards of twenty
thousand. The trees stood about five feet apart, and the bunches
of plantains which each tree produced weighed from thirty to fifty
pounds, those from some of the larger trees much more. There
were several varieties even in the same grove. The king in-
formed us that some of these trees bear fruit six or seven months
after the sprouts are planted, others, again, take two or three
months longer before they bear fruit; and what we may consider

170 THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
the finer species do not begin to bear until about eighteen
months after the sprouts are put into the ground, but these
last bear by far the larger bunches. This plantain grove was
one of the pleasantest sights we had witnessed since we had
landed on the shores of Africa. No cereal on the same space of i
ground, however highly cultivated, could afford the same amount
of food.
We complimented the king, through Aboh, on the beauty and
size of his plantation, and the fruit it contained.
"Very good for eat, but no good for trade," was the answer.
His majesty had, it was evident, an eye to commerce, and we dis-
covered that the article which he could obtain with the least diffi-
culty, and sell at the highest price, were elephants' tusks. His
hunters, we found, frequently went in chase of the monsters for a
twofold purpose,—to obtain ivory, and to keep them at a distance
from the plantain grove, among which two or three elephants in a
few hours might have committed immense damage. He had
arranged a grand elephant hunt, not having taken part in one since
his illness. He had made up his mind that we should accom-
pany him, believing that our rifles would be the means of securing
more ivory than could his own people with their darts and spears.
We hoped that if we complied with his wishes, he would be more
ready to allow us to take our departure. We accordingly agreed
to accompany him. Tom wished to go also, but, although he
was able to walk, Charley advised him not to run the risk of
again spraining his ankle, feeling sure that great activity would
be required from the experience we had already had in getting
out of the way of elephants.
"But I've been thinking, sir, that we might have a chance of
making our escape while we are out hunting. We could easily
slip away from the natives, and push on fast in the direction we
want to go."
"There are two objections to that," answered Charley. "In
the first place, the natives can travel through the forest faster

than we can, and would soon overtake us; then, as we could not
go out hunting with our packs, we should have to leave them be-
hind us; besides which, I would rather leave the king who has.
treated us so hospitably, in an open fashion, with his goodwill,
instead of stealing off like deserters."
"I dare say you are right, sir," answered Tom, "but we shall
look very foolish if the king, after all, insists on our stopping
with him."
"Should such be the case, we can but take up our packs and
march off, and should any attempt be made to stop us, fight
the black fellows."
"That's the sort of plain sailing I like," said Tom.
We were surprised next morning at the extent of the prepara-
tions made for the hunt. We found nearly four hundred men,
armed with spears and javelins, assembled in the great square of
the village, a large number having come from the. neighbouring
hamlets. The king soon came out of his palace—for so I may
call it, although it was but a rude hut, thickly thatched with palm
leaves. He was dressed far more elaborately than we had
hitherto seen him, with a circle of feathers on his head, and a kilt
of long-grass round his waist secured by a belt, to which hung a
number of fetiches or charms. The skin of a leopard hung over his
shoulder, to which was suspended a gun, while he carried also a
long spear, ornamented with a tuft of hair at the end. The rest
of the huntsmen were attired as usual, in nothing but the waist
cloth, which is worn by the most savage tribes.
The king divided his force into six different parties and desired
us to accompany the one commanded by himself. He then
gave the order to march. We all set out. Before long we reached
the forest, through which we proceeded for several hours, occa-
sionally having to cut our way where the thick vines which hung
from all the trees impeded our progress. Towards evening we
arrived at the spot where the king had determined to halt . His
people immediately set about forming the camp, by collecting wood

and putting up shelters, which consisted of lean-to's. Two poles
with forked ends were stuck in the ground, on the top of which
rested an horizontal pole; against this a number of others were
placed, when large palm or other leaves were secured above them,
so that the hardest rain was turned off, the roof, of course, being
placed on the side against which the wind blew. A large one
was built for the king, who invited us to share it with him. It
was of the same construction as that of the rest. In front a
large fire was kindled. We had no reason to complain of our
entertainment, for the king had brought an ample supply of veni-
son as well as plantains, and other vegetables and food. We also
slept securely, as we knew that the hunters would keep a look-out
during the night for any savage animals which might come prowl-
ing round the camp.
At early dawn we were on foot, and the king marshalling his
forces, sent them off in different directions, so that they might
form a large circle and drive in any elephants to a common
centre, where we were given to understand some pits had been
dug especially for the purpose of entrapping them or any other
wild beasts. In that part of the forest there also grew a vast
number of strong climbing plants or vines, some extending to the
very tops of the tallest trees, twisting and turning among the
branches. With these also the natives formed traps for elephants,
by weaving them in and out among the trunks in such a way
that should an elephant once get in he would be unable to extri-
cate himself before the hunters were upon him.
"Now," said his majesty to us, through Aboh, who was kept by
his side to act as interpreter, "we will start and show you what
real sport is." I don't mean to say that Aboh used those very
words, but he said something to that effect. We looked to our
rifles and commenced our march, keeping close behind the sable
monarch, whose spirits seemed to rise as he found himself once
more in the midst of the wilds in which he had achieved renown
as a hunter. No one uttered a word for fear of giving warning

AN ELEPHANT TRAPPED.
173
to any elephants who might be feeding near at hand, and who
would break away should they hear our voices. Before long,
however, we came upon traces of several animals 5 young sap-
lings being trampled underfoot, bows torn down, and hanging
vines dragged away. The king made a sign to us to proceed
even more cautiously than before. We expected every moment
to be in sight of a herd of the huge animals. Presently we heard
a loud trumpeting, not fifty yards away from us.
"Be on the look-out, Dick," cried Charley, "the beasts will be
coming this way perhaps. Get up a tree, but don't attempt to
run."
He remembered how very nearly he had been caught, indeed,
Harry and I had not forgotten the fright the beasts had given us.
The blacks, however, by their movements did not seem to expect
the elephants to come that way, but advanced at a more rapid
pace than before in the direction whence the sounds pro-
ceeded.
"Why, that trumpeting seems to be coming out of the earth,"
cried Harry.
Just then the chief gave a flourish with his spear and rushed on.
Presently we saw him dart his weapon with all his force, as it
appeared to us, into the ground. On nearing the spot, we saw that
he had hurled it into a pit at a huge elephant whose trunk was
seen waving above the surface of the ground. The blacks now
rushed on, each man holding a javelin in his hand, which he
plunged into the back or side of the animal, now screaming with
pain. Dart after dart was buried in its flesh. It was in a pit
cleverly formed in the side of a hill, towards which it had been
apparently making its way, the upper side much higher than it
could reach even with its trunk, while the lower was of sufficient
depth to prevent it scrambling out again—it was thus com-
pletely in the hunters' power. The pit had been covered over
with light branches and grass, so that the animal, as it rushed
along, had not seen it
.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
As the savages came up they continued hurling their javelins or
spears into the poor beast, which was soon covered over almost
to resemble a huge porcupine. As the creature's death was cer-
tain, we did not think it wise to spend powder and ball on it,
indeed, we were likely to offend our fellow-hunters, as they had
evidently gained a victory.
As we stood near the pit, keeping at a sufficient distance to
avoid tumbling in, we watched the poor creature in its hopeless
efforts to escape. While it continued on its feet, the savages in
succession came rushing up and throwing their darts, each man
of them seeming anxious to have a hand in its slaughter.
At length, much to our satisfaction, it sunk down on its knees,
and soon afterwards rolled over on its side, dead. The blacks
immediately jumped down, and began pulling out the darts, to be
ready to attack a fresh elephant . We soon had an opportunity
of seeing another way in which these monsters are caught.
Leaving for the present the carcase of the animal we had taken,
we advanced further into the forest; presently one of the scouts
who had been sent ahead, came hurrying back, saying that there
were three elephants not far off. The blacks now began to steal
forward, keeping as much as possible under cover, and sometimes
advancing on their hands and knees. We kept, by the king's
desire, a short distance behind. Presently we heard a tremen-
dous shout, and we saw two elephants before us. They looked
round evidently much frightened, and then dashed forward
towards one of the barriers, which had been prepared in the
neighbourhood. The natives advanced rapidly, until the ele-
phants were suddenly entrapped in a network of vines. The
terrified creatures endeavoured to tear them away with their
trunks and feet, but the greater their efforts, the more fatally
they surrounded themselves with the tough vines. From every
side the natives now appeared, completely surrounding the
struggling creatures, which they plied unceasingly with their

175
spears. Some climbed up the neighbouring trees, an example
which we followed, for it seemed to us that at any moment the
beasts might break away and trample us to death before we
could possibly escape. The poor creatures found the darts
showered down on them from above, and from every side. The
more daring hunters would occasionally rush in close behind
them, and dart their spears deep into their flesh. While they
were thus engaged, a third elephant, followed by another party
of hunters, who had already wounded him, came tearing along.
He, too, was caught in the meshes of the network. Several
darts were hurled into him, but suddenly turning round, he broke
away from them, and trumpeting fiercely, rushed towards a score
of natives, who were still at a little distance. They endeavoured
to fly on every side, but so unexpected was the attack of the
beast, that all had not time to do so. Two unfortunate men
were caught; in an instant they were beneath the elephant's
feet, who stamped upon them with all his mighty force. In
another moment they were crushed, their skulls and all the
bones in their bodies being broken, then seizing one in his trunk,
the monster hurled it into the air, and rushed forward in an
endeavour to make his escape. The whole party, on seeing
this, excited by rage, pursued the animal, shouting and shrieking,
grinding their teeth, and darting their spears and javelins with all
their might. I saw that the elephant had not a chance of
escape, indeed, in a short time, mighty as was his strength, he
sank down exhausted, with the blood flowing from a hundred
wounds, and after a few struggles was dead. On this the natives
rushed forward, and began cutting away at the creature with their
knives, uttering curses on it for having killed their friends. The
noise they had made had scared away all the other elephants—
however, they appeared pretty well satisfied with the four they
had killed. They now assembled round the last elephant which
had fallen, while one of their fetich-men, or priests, approached

and cut off a portion which was carefully stowed away in a
basket; this was intended, we understood, for an offering to
their idols. A dance was now commenced, and was as savage
as could well be imagined. They shrieked, they leaped, they
whirled their lances above their heads, and twisted and turned
their bodies about in the most fantastic manner, making at the
same time the most hideous faces, until, exhausted with their
exertions, they all squatted down on the ground. Once more
at a sign they rose, when they repeated the same dance round
the fetich basket
.
We were in hopes that the king would return home the next
day, but the hunters brought word that there were still more ele-
phants a short distance off, which had come to feed on the leaves
of certain trees of which they are very fond. We tried to get off
attending his majesty, and Charley suggested that if he made
no objection we should return to the village, where, having
rejoined Tom, and taken our packs, we might endeavour to
make our way northward. Our friend, however, suspected the
trick we intended to play him.
"King say 'No good,'" observed Aboh, while his majesty
put on a knowing look; and we had to yield to circum-
stances.
Next day it rained, and we were compelled to keep beneath
the shelter of our lean-to's, with nothing to do except to listen
to the unintelligible jokes of the king, many of them we sus-
pected at our expense, although Aboh was too polite to say
so. It cleared up in the evening, but it was then too late to
start.
In the morning we proceeded, after a plentiful breakfast, to
the north-east. We observed that the hunters advanced in a
more cautious way than before, and we soon discovered that we
were entering the territory of another sable monarch, who was
not likely, should he discover it, to be well pleased with our

proceeding. Having advanced all the day, we at length en-
camped, much in the same manner as before. Fires were lighted,
and huge pieces of elephant flesh placed to cook before them.
A party of carriers had followed us, bringing more delicate
provisions, and among them some jugs of palm wine, with which,
after the feast, the king and his more special favourites regaled
themselves.
We each of us had brought some tobacco, which we thought
this a favourable occasion to produce, and great was the delight
of the king and his courtiers when they observed it. Pipes
were brought forth, which we filled as they were handed to us.
All those thus favoured collected round one fire. There are
few things an African hunter delights in more than sitting round
a blazing fire at night with a pipe in his mouth, and narrating
for the hundredth time, perhaps, his vario'us exploits. We regretted
not having a sufficient knowledge of the language to make out
what was said, but, from the shouts of laughter uttered by our
black friends, the yarns were highly amusing to themselves, if
not edifying to us. The shades of evening were approaching, a
few rays of the setting sun penetrating amid the trees, cast a
bright light on the boughs above us. A portion of the hunters
were engaged in collecting wood, and bringing in bundles in
order to keep up the fires during the night . The king having
imbibed a good quantity of palm wine, waxed valiant, and seiz-
ing his spear, advanced in front of the camp, flourishing' his
weapon, and addressing in stentorian tones some fetich or spirit
of the air in the forest. We of course could not make out what
he said, nor would Aboh enlighten us. Perhaps he was merely
praying for a successful hunt the following day. After the king
had thus given vent to his feelings, whatever they were, he re-
turned and seated himself near us at the fire, when he ordered
another jug of palm wine to be brought. One of the courtiers
suggested that his majesty was taking a little too much, on
M

which the king, who was now certainly beyond the point at which
discretion is retained, told him to mind his own business, and
looking in his face, swallowed down another cup. He then
insisted that we should join him, wishing to show us the highest
possible mark of honour; we, to please him, took the bowls in
our hands, but the moment his eyes were averted, we handed
them to some of his courtiers, who had no objection to drink
instead of us.
Night had now come on, but still the revels of the king
and his courtiers continued. We had retired to a lean-to, hoping
to find some rest, for we were all really tired after our day's
excursion.
"It seems strange that the king, who ought to remember
that we are in the country of one of his enemies, should not take
more care to guard against a surprise," observed Charley. "I
think we ought to keep watch, for very likely these African fellows
will forget to do so, and even if they are not attacked by their
enemies, a leopard may steal into the camp and carry one ormore
of them off."
Harry and I fully agreed with this; and we drew lots, as we
always did on such occasions, to settle the order in which we
should keep watch. The first lot fell to me. I was on the point
of arousing Harry, who was to keep the second watch, when
I was startled by the most fearful shrieks bursting from every side
around the camp. The next instant the whole space was filled
with warriors, who leaped down into the midst of the sleeping
hunters, clubbing some, piercing others with their lances, and
throwing cords round the arms of others. There was no
necessity to rouse up my companions, for they had started to
their feet.
"Where shall we go? We are not going to fight for these
drunken fellows," cried Harry.
"Into the bush then behind us," answered Charley.

Harry and I followed him as he sprung round our leafy bower;
but we had not gone many yards when we found ourselves in the
presence of a dozen or more savages. The light of the fire
falling upon us, revealed to them that we were white men, and
instead of knocking us over with their clubs, they leaped forward
and grasped our arms. We literally had not a moment to defend
ourselves—indeed, from the number of our enemies, we could
scarcely have hoped to have fought our way through them. If
we had done so without food, and with only a limited supply of
ammunition, we could not have made our way far through the
country. What became of the king and his courtiers, whether
they escaped or were knocked on the head, we could not tell.
We were at once unceremoniously hurried off by our captors,
who seemed to consider us rich prizes. As we were led off we
witnessed a horrible scene. One of our unfortunate companions
had been struck down, but still breathed; when, a number of the
savages rushing towards him, some seized his arms and legs,
and others, drawing their long knives, plunged them in his
body, taking care apparently to avoid wounding any vital
part.
Several women who appeared on the scene were encouraging
the men in their atrocious proceedings. The cries of the poor
wretch reached our ears for some time afterwards, till, becoming
fainter and fainter, they altogether ceased, and we were thankful
to believe that his sufferings were over. They did not, however,
deprive us of our rifles, nor were we in any way ill-treated,
except that we were compelled to hurry on at a much faster
rate than we liked. After travelling for several miles we saw
lights ahead, and found that we were approaching the camp of
the people who had captured us. Our guards uttered loud
shouts, and a number of people came forth from a collection of
leafy huts, which, it was evident from their slight structure, were
mere temporary erections. The principal person of the crowd was

a savage-looking fellow, about as ugly as King Quagomolo, and
dressed much in the same fashion. His majesty, although so
ugly, did not appear to have any evil intentions regarding us,
but was evidently satisfied at having got us into his power. He
invited us to join him at his camp-fire, and at once ordered
some of his slaves to bring us food, of which we thought it
prudent to partake, although we were not in reality very hungry.
We had not been seated long before parties arrived, carrying
the tusks of the elephants we had killed; and others followed,
dragging along about thirty prisoners, among whom we recog-
nised our friend Aboh. As soon as he saw us he shouted out to
the king, who at once ordered him to be released, when he came
up to us.
"Me say talkee for you," he observed, by which we under-
stood that he had informed the king that he was our interpreter.
He then had a long palaver with his majesty, who seemed well
satisfied with what he heard. The intentions of the king were,
we found out from what Aboh said, to make us useful to fight
his battles, to assist him in governing the country, and to per-
form any service which he considered white men capable of
doing better than his own subjects. He, by some means or
other, had been informed of our being in the country, and had
made the attack on Quagomolo's camp, expressly for the purpose
of getting possession of us.
"What has become of your king and the rest of your people?"
we asked of Aboh.
"Him no killee, me tinke run 'way," he answered.
"Things are not so bad as they might have been, so we ought
to be thankful," observed Charley; "but still I am afraid that we
are as little likely as before to be allowed to continue our journey."
Our chief anxiety was about Tom Tubbs. We feared that
King Quagomolo was not likely to set him at liberty, nor was it
probable that he would deliver up our knapsacks, even should

A CONSULTATION WITH ABOH. l8l
we send for them, for though he had hitherto behaved honestly
towards us, we could scarcely expect that he would withstand the
temptation of appropriating their contents under the uncertainty
of our fate. Our first object then was to get Tom to rejoin us,
and by some means or other to regain our property. Our knap-
sacks contained powder and shot, beads and trinkets, with which
to.pay our way, an extra pair of boots, and numerous other
articles of the greatest value to us. We were already more than
three days' journey from King Quagomolo's village, and so much
on our way to the north. Before lying down to sleep, we con-
sulted Aboh on the subject.
"Berry bad, berry bad," he answered, shaking his head, which
he always did when he found a knotty point difficult to unravel.
"Me say de King Sanga Tanga—me go get odder white man and
him goods. Suppose let me go, what say King Quagomolo?
when him come, cut off him head me tinkee."
"We don't want you to run that risk, Aboh," said Charley;
"but still we wish you to find some other way."
"Me tinkee, me tinkee, now go sleep," answered Aboh, by
which we understood that he would consider the matter and let
us know the result of his cogitations in the morning. We
accordingly, as he advised, wrapt ourselves in our cloaks which
we had on when we were captured, and, taking our positions as
near the fire as we could, tried to sleep. I observed that our
captors kept a far more watchful look-out than had our former
friends—indeed, from the little I had seen of them, they appeared
to me to be a far more sagacious and keen-witted set than those
we had left. They had good reason also to be on the watch,
for they might at any moment be attacked by the followers of
King Quagomolo, the larger number of whom had escaped, and
who would very likely rally and attempt to recover their friends
and us, and revenge themselves for the sudden and unprovoked
assault made on their camp. Charley expressed a hope that


## p. 182 (#280) ############################################

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
such might be the case, and that we should then regain our
liberty.
"I should be sorry for the bloodshed which would ensue, for
our captors would probably fight desperately to detain us, and
many on both sides would be killed," said Harry, who was always
more anxious to^obtain an object by peaceable means than by
force.
"There is no use talking about the matter," said Charley,
"let us go to sleep and be prepared for whatever may occur.
I'll sleep with one eye open, and be ready to rouse you up
should there be a chance of our escaping, only take care that the
black fellows do not steal our rifles, which perhaps they may
attempt to do while we sleep, although they evidently look
upon them with awe, or they would have taken them from us
before."
Following Charley's advice, we placed our guns by our sides,
between us, with our hands upon them, so that we should be
awakened should any one try to draw them away. I at length
fell asleep, but I was continually fancying that something was
going to occur; the camp, however, remained perfectly quiet, the
only sounds heard within it being the snoring of the sleepers, and
occasionally the shouts of the sentries as they called to each
other.
Next morning at daybreak the whole camp was roused up
by King Sanga Tanga, and the cooks set to work to dress the
plantains which they had brought with them, and the elephant-
meat which they had captured. A liberal portion was brought to
us in a basket, but as the meat was already tainted, we preferred
breakfasting on the plantains sprinkled with red pepper. We
observed a dozen men or more with drawn swords standing
near us as a guard to prevent our escape, though we were
in no way molested. We looked about for Aboh, but he
was nowhere to be seen, and without his aid we could not

hope to make the king understand our wishes. I began to be
afraid that he must have been removed from us, and carried
away with the men of his village into slavery, or perhaps put
to death.
"I don't think there's a chance of their killing him or any of
the prisoners, when they can, by sending them down to the coast,
obtain a good price for them," observed Charley. "If the king
wants to make use of us, he will not wish to deprive us of our
interpreter."
The king now shouted out to his followers, and they began to
make preparations for the march, still Aboh did not appear.
The farther off we got from King Quagomolo's village, the less
chance we should have, we thought, of recovering our property
and getting Tom to rejoin us. Charley, therefore, eagerly
addressed the king, who passed near where we were sitting, and
tried to make him understand by signs what we wanted. He
scratched his head, but evidently did not understand either our
signs or words. At last he spoke to one of his attendants, who
hurried off and soon returned with Aboh, dragging him along by
a rope fastened round his wrists. Poor Aboh looked very
downcast
.
"What's the matter?" asked Charley.
"Me try run 'way, and king bind him hands with odder
prisoners."
"I'm sorry to hear that," said Charley, "it would have been
better not to have attempted it. Now, we want you to ask the
king to let us go back and get our knapsacks, and our com-
panion and we will faithfully return to him as soon as we have
done so."
"Me tinkee king no trust him," answered Aboh.
"What! not trust an officer in the navy, and two other
English gentlemen," exclaimed Charley indignantly. "Tell
him then, that one of us will remain with him, while the other

two, with a sufficient guard, go back, and say that we will
return as soon as possible."
"But 'spose King Quagomolo no let go," suggested
Aboh.
"Then let King Sanga Tanga say, that if we are detained, he
will march a large army to liberate us."
Aboh fully understood our wishes. He forthwith held a long
palaver with the king. The result was more satisfactory even
than we had expected. He consented to send back Charley
and me with twenty men as a guard, keeping Harry as a host-
age, allowing Aboh to accompany us, under the promise, how-
ever, of returning.
Thanking the king for agreeing to our proposal we begged that
we might set out immediately.
"Good-bye," said Harry, "I wish that we could have all gone
together, but I know you will come back for me, and 1 do not
see how it otherwise could have been arranged."
We forthwith commenced our march. The party was under
the command of Prince Ombay, the king's son, a good-natured,
merry fellow, with whom Aboh seemed on very good terms.
Charley and I were by this time well innured to fatigue, and our
companions lightly clad were able to perform long distances each
day. We met with no very interesting adventures, although I
shot a deer, and Charley was fortunate enough to kill a buffalo
which afforded a supply of meat to our companions, and raised
us greatly in their estimation. At length we reached the
neighbourhood of King Quagomolo's village, when Prince
Ombay proposed encamping, and allowing Charley and me with
Aboh to go forward and complete our negotiations with King
Quagomolo.
We had done our best to impress upon Aboh that he must not
attempt any act of treachery, and that everything must be carried
on in a peaceable manner: to this he agreed, and we hoped that

I85
we could trust him. When we entered the village the people
gazed at us in astonishment. Aboh did not think fit to enlighten
them as to the cause of our return. We went straight to the
residence of the king.
"There he is," exclaimed Charley, as we approached the
house, and we found him sleeping in the shade of the rude
veranda in front of it. As we were anxious to ascertain
how it fared with Tom, leaving the king to finish his nap, we
hurried off to our own house. Tom saw us and hastened out to
greet us.
"I had given you up for lost, gentlemen, it does my
heart good to see you. What has become of Mr. Harry?"
he asked.
We told him in a few words the object of our visit.
"I think the chances are the king will listen to you," he
answered; "he came back very much out of spirits at being
taken by surprise, and at the loss of so many of his people. I
don't think he has any stomach for a war with the other black
king."
This was satisfactory. Accompanied by Tom we went back
to Quagomolo's house. His majesty was rubbing his eyes and
stretching himself after his nap. He looked greatly astonished
at seeing us stand before him.
"Now tell him what we want," said Charley to Aboh; "just
hint that if he doesn't agree to King Sanga Tanga's demands he
may expect to have his plantain groves cut down, and his village
burned, and himself and his people carried off and sold to the
slave traders."
"Berry good reason for not saying No," observed Aboh.
He forthwith addressed the king in due form. His majesty
scratched his head and sides and all parts of his body with much
vehemence—a sign of great agitation within, if not irritation with-
out, and replied in a long speech.
-¦

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Aboh briefly translated it.
"Him no want fight, him say go when you like, but him ask before you away."
"Tell the king we are very much obliged to him for so readily
yielding to our request, and we will certainly give him a present,
and if we get safe home we will send him another, as our means
at present are limited."
Whether Aboh understood this or not, I am not sure, but what-
ever he said made the king's countenance brighten up. As we
wished to rejoin Prince Ombay as soon as possible, and put him
out of suspense, we begged Tom to get ready to march at once.
Returning to our house, we took out four necklaces of beads,
one as a present from each of us, and also some knives and
trinkets which we presented to his majesty, telling Aboh to
thank him again for the kind way in which he had treated
us, though he had as a mark of his favour detained us longer
than we desired.
We then, shouldering our packs, and taking our rifles in our
hands, bade the king good-bye, and saluting the people as we
passed through the streets of the village, hastened to "the spot
where we had left Prince Ombay and his party. No one had
discovered them, and as he thought it prudent not to remain
longer than necessary in the neighbourhood, we immediately
commenced our march to the north-east.
Our success had been far greater than we expected. Our bold
bearing and the authoritative tone we had used, had, no doubt,
considerable influence in inducing the black king to yield to our
demands.
Prince Ombay was in high spirits at seeing us, and gave a
hearty welcome to Tom. He proposed immediately to set out
for his father's town.
"We shall now conquer all our enemies; we shall succeed in
all we undertake; with four good guns what enemy can stand

I87
against us? The wild beasts in the forest must succumb," we
shall have game in plenty, and food. What feasts we shall
enjoy, what bowls of palm wine."
It was very evident from this that- although the prince wished
to treat us kindly, he fully intended to keep us well employed in
his father's service. By this time we had picked up a good many
words of the language of the people, and Aboh had also greatly
improved in English, so that we were much better able to under-
stand what was said. Prince Ombay was constantly describing
to us the curious creatures of the country, and among others he
mentioned some huge apes which he said were like wild men,
and built houses for themselves in the trees, and were almost as
big as men.
When I expressed doubt on the subject, Ombay said
he would show us the houses, and the apes also. He
called the animal "Nshiego." They did not live in tribes,
but generally in pairs, and that the male built a house for
himself, and the female for herself, close on a neighbour-
ing tree.
Next day as we were travelling along, through a thick part of
the forest, we came upon some shrubs bearing a pretty sort of
wild berry. Prince Ombay at once said we should find some
Nshiegoes not far off. By going a short distance from the
travelling path, he pointed out what looked like a huge umbrella
fixed on a large bough, about twenty feet from the ground,
and close to it another of similar character, both the trees
being so far removed from each other that the boughs did not
touch.
"There are the houses," said the Prince. "But the Nshiegoes
have either gone out hunting, or hearing us coming have hidden
themselves, you see what wise fellows they are. No leopard or
other savage beast can get up to them, nor could a serpent
climb the trunk of that tree, as it is too large to be encircled by

its body, while no boughs can fall from any neighbouring trees
on their heads."
Charley, who was very anxious to examine the roof, managed
to throw some stout vines over the bough, above which it was
placed, by this means we climbed up. No human beings could
have made the roof more neatly. It was constructed of thick
leafy branches, secured together by vines, so formed that it was
capable of completely throwing off the rain. Ombay told us
that the male is the actual builder, while the female gathers the
boughs and vines, and brings them to him; and that he builds
her nest as well as his own.
As we were soon after this to pitch our camp, Ombay pro-
mised to show us some of these apes at home. We gladly
accepted his offer. As soon as we had pitched our camp and
had had supper, Charley and I with Aboh accompanied Ombay
and two of his best hunters, set off, and after going a short distance
in the woods, they told us if we would remain quiet, we should
certainly see a couple of Nshiegoes under their nests in two
trees close at hand. We kept perfectly quiet, scarcely daring
to breathe for nearly an hour, it seemed much longer, when out
of the forest came a creature which in the gloom looked almost
as big as a man; presently it began to cry out "hew, hew," when
another creature appeared of the same description. The first
of these climbed up into one of the trees, where he sat with an
arm clasped round the stem, while his feet rested on the lower
branch, and his head reached quite up into the dome of the
roof, so that it served as a night cap at the same time. The
other Nshiego followed his example, and got into her abode,
when, after exchanging a few cries, which seemed as if they were
wishing good-night to each other, they both went to sleep. It
seemed barbarous to interrupt so much domestic felicity, but the
natives would have thought very little of us if we had not killed
the Nshiegoes.

KILLING APES.
Accordingly Charley taking one, and I the other, we both
fired, and both the animals fell at the same time, and the
blacks taking them up, carried them back to the camp, where,
by the light of the fire, we had an opportunity of examin-
ing them. We found them just about four feet high, with black
skins. The back and shoulders had black hair two or three
inches long, while the rest of the body was covered with short,
thin, bluish hair, the top of the head being completely bald, the
nose was flat, and ears remarkably large; the chin was somewhat
round, some thin short hairs growing on it. As soon as we had
done examining the creatures, our black escort cut them up,
although, I must have been very hard pressed before I would
have eaten any of the flesh.
"You think those big apes," observed Ombay, as we were
marching along. "If we keep a look-out, we may see some
much larger. I must warn you if you do see them to keep out
of their way, for they can kill a man in a moment."
As our escort were in no hurry, having once reached their
own country, we made but short journeys each day. Having
hurried over our supper, we set out as we had done the previous
evening. Charley advised that we should try and kill as much
game as possible, to please our black companions, as well as to
supply ourselves with food. I had kept on the extreme right of
the party, Charley on the left, and Tom in the centre, so that
we could communicate with each other. We had gone a mile or
so from the camp, when I caught sight of a beautiful little deer
bounding away up a glade. I followed without calling to my
companions, expecting almost immediately to come up with it.
It went trotting on, and feeding, and then bounding away in a
playful manner, just keeping beyond the range of my gun. Now
I lost sight of it, but soon again saw it before me. Thus I was
led on further than I should have wished. How many turns I
had made, I could not tell, but I fancied that I had gone in a

straight line. After all, just as I was about to fire, the deer
took flight, either at me, or something else, and bounded
away.
Much disappointed, I turned to rejoin my companions. Before
long, however, I made the pleasing discovery that I had lost
myself. I listened, expecting to hear their shouts, but no sound
reached my ears. I had gone on, some way thinking that it
was in the direction where I was most likely to find my friends,
when I heard voices in the distance coming through the forest.
I at once endeavoured to make my way towards the spot from
whence they appeared to proceed. As I advanced they sounded
more strange. I kept on cautiously. They might be savages of
a different tribe, for Ombay had told me of many strange people
inhabiting that region. The shades of evening were already
coming on. I caught the glimmer of a fire in an open glade
before me, and what was my surprise on pushing aside the
boughs, to see two enormous apes seated on the ground, and a
couple of young ones near them.
One seated in a sort of arbour, formed by the thick foliage
above the roots of the tree, appeared to be a patriarch, while just
outside sat his wife caressing the youngest one, while in the front
of her lay the other, warming himself before the fire. I could see
the two adults were enormous creatures, as large—they appeared
to me—as any ordinary human being, with huge chests and long
arms. Had there been but one alone I should have felt very ner-
vous lest he should attack me, but what would be my fate were
both the creatures, aided by their infant progeny, to set upon me.
I feared almost to breathe lest I should be discovered. Should I
tread on a rotten branch, or brush by a bough too roughly, the
noise might attract them, and they might come in chase of me.
Before moving I examined my gun to see that it was ready for
instant use. My hope was that I might kill one of the terrible
creatures and so frighten the others and obtain time to reload.

LOST IN THE FOREST.

Even the young ones were no contemptible opponents, should
they fly at my legs or seize me by the arms while I was engaged
with their parents. This, however, they were not likely to do
unless endowed with more sagacity than the ape tribe are generally
supposed to possess. Still if their wisdom was in proportion to
their size, they might attack me in a way which would give me
very little chance of escaping in spite of my gun. I, however,
felt much more confidence with that in my hand than I should
have done without it. Never did thief creep away more carefully
out of a house than did I from the bower of those terrific apes.
I had not believed that such enormous creatures existed. Night
was rapidly coming on, for what I could tell there might be others
in the neighbourhood. To spend a night by myself in those
wilds was anything but pleasant to contemplate. As soon as I
could venture to move fast, without the risk of being heard by
the huge apes, I retreated rapidly. I was not aware at the time
that I had fallen in with a family of the largest existing speci-
mens of the ape tribe since known as the terrible gorilla,
although at that time I was ignorant of its name. I was only
too soon to become in a terrible way better acquainted with the
creature.
As I have described I was endeavouring to get as far off as
possible from the fearful monsters, when the sun having set, it
became almost immediately dark. The thick foliage overhead
hid the stars from my sight so that I could not tell in what direc-
tion I was going, whether to the north or south, and although I
occasionally got a glimpse of one amid the boughs, it could not
thus seen serve as a guide to me. I pictured to myself the danger
of thus wandering through the forest by myself, for although I
might grope my way amid the trees, yet I might be pursued by a
leopard or lion, or I might tread on some venomous snake or get
into the presence unexpectedly of a herd of elephants. For some
time I was afraid of shouting or firing my rifle, lest I might attract

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
the attention of those monster apes. At length, thinking I had
got sufficiently far off not to bring them down upon me, and that
I might after all be in the neighbourhood of my friends, I began
to exercise my lungs. After I had shouted several times, I fancied
that I heard an answer, but still could not be certain that the
cries which reached my ears were not uttered by the monster apes
or some other creatures. Then I fired off my gun. Forthwith
there came a loud chattering and shrieking from out of the forest,
uttered by troops of monkeys and flights of parrots. I was afraid
if I fired often I might exhaust my stock of powder, which I
should require for my defence if attacked either by huge apes or
four-footed monsters.
Finding no answer to any of my signals, I judged that I had
got a long way off from my friends; I therefore thought it prudent
at once to climb a tree, hoping not to find it occupied by any
arboreous ape or other creature. I therefore threw a vine over
one of the lower boughs, by which means I was able to climb on
to the branch. I then drew up the vine, so that I might be toler-
ably secure. There was still sufficient light from the sky to enable
me to find my way to a part of the tree where several boughs
branched off; here I could lie down with my gun by my side,
without any fear of falling to the ground. Before going to sleep,
however, I thought it would be as well to give another shout,
hoping that, perhaps, from my lofty position, my voice would
reach my friends. I listened for an answer. Silence reigned
through the forest, broken now and then by a roar so terrific, so
superhuman, that I involuntarily trembled. It was not like that of
a wild beast, nor of that proceeding from any human throat. It
seemed to come from a spot at no great distance off. What if the
creature should discover me and be able to climb the tree in which
I had taken shelter! What hope would there be for me then?
I regretted having shouted; it would have been more prudent
had I kept silence. I could only pray that the creature might not

193
find me out, if creature it was. I did not believe that evil spirits
in bodily form walked the earth, or I might have supposed that
the voice I heard was that of one, so awe-inspiring was it . I now
peered down from among the boughs towards the ground near the
trunk of the tree, dreading every instant to see the creature
approach.
At length I saw a dark form moving along, but it went on
all fours. Could it be the creature that had uttered the sound?
Presently it approached a small tree and then reared itself, and I
saw what looked like a man of gigantic form, with a huge head,
and prodigiously long arms, holding on to the tree. He seemed
to look about him as if to examine the surrounding trees; should
he discover me, he evidently could with ease climb the tree on
which I sat. I was afraid of moving, and yet I felt convinced
that he might, with his sharp eyes, discover me looking through
the boughs at him. I fortunately had the muzzle of my gun
turned towards him, and could at any moment bring the butt to
my shoulder. I could not expect to get a better mark than he
now presented to me, but then, so human looked the creature,
seen through the gloom of night, that I asked myself whether I
was justified in shooting him. While these thoughts were passing
through my mind, he let go the stem of the tree, and once more
sank down, moving forward as before on his hands and feet. At
first I thought he was coming up my tree. To my relief he turned
aside, apparently satisfied that the being which had uttered the,
to him, strange sounds, was not concealed among its branches. I
breathed more freely. I was thankful that I had not fired, for I
might only have wounded the creature, and he would then, inspired
by rage, have climbed the tree to attack me. I waited, watching
for an hour or more; at length, finding sleep overcoming me, I
replaced my gun by my side, and stretched myself almost at my
length, for which there was ample room. My eyes closed, possibly
I might have been surprised by apes, snakes, or any other tree-

climbing creatures without having time to rouse myself sufficiently
to offer the slightest resistance, so sound was my sleep; and yet
it was not untroubled, for all night long that fearful cry occasionally
rang in my ears, and I heard other shrieks and noises. Whether
they were really uttered by the denizen of the forest, or created
by my imagination, is more than I can possibly say.

ABRIGHT light streamed into my eyes—it was the sun,
just rising, sending his rays darting through the boughs.
I felt very unwilling to get up, and when I began to move I
discovered that my limbs were somewhat stiff from the hardness
of my couch. At length I rose, and, kneeling down, thanked
Heaven for the protection which had been afforded me. I now
began to feel the sensations of hunger. I hoped, however, that
I might be able to find something with which to satisfy my ap-
petite, and enable me to continue my search for my friends. It
was important to lose no time; I accordingly descended, letting
myself down by the vine. I could now, guided by the sun, steer
a tolerably straight course. I judged that if I proceeded to the
north-east I should in time, though I might miss my travelling
companions, at all events reach King Sanga Tanga's village.
I looked about me, half expecting to see the monster who had
passed by in the evening, walk out from behind some thick
bushes which grew around. I stood close to the very tree by
which I had seen the creature supporting itself, and although I

hoped that it had gone on to a distance, I felt a disinclination to
camp at that spot. I had, fortunately, some matches and a
tinder-box in my pocket, so that I could light a lire as soon as I
had something to cook at it. I had not gone far when a chorus
of loud screams announced the approach of a flock of grey
parrots, which were issuing forth from their resting-places in
search of berries and nuts. Crouching down behind a bush, I
allowed them to come so close to me that I shot a couple, and
knocked down a third with the barrel of my gun before it had
time to fly off. Slinging them over my shoulder, I trudged on
until I came to the bank of a small stream. Going along it I
found an open spot, in the centre of which I could kindle a fire
without the risk of setting light to the neighbouring trees. I
quickly had two of my parrots plucked, and by means of the
usual wooden spit, soon had them roasting. Before sitting down,
I looked carefully around to ascertain that no monster ape was
near, likely to invite himself to the repast. I must own it, I was
seized with a sort of horror of the monster apes, and as I went
along I could not help every now and then looking over my
shoulder, expecting to see one following. I dreaded the thought
of an encounter with one of the creatures far more than I did
with a leopard or lion. I hurried over my breakfast, and having
taken a good draught from the bright stream, filled up my
water bottle, and stowed a portion of the cooked parrot in my
wallet that I might not be delayed by having to cook a mid-day
meal, I pushed on. The forest in many places was more open
than I expected to find it, and I made good progress.
I did not wish to expend my ammunition by firing signals, but
I occasionally shouted at the top of my voice, hoping that my
friends would hear me. I was disappointed, however, and
another evening found me still in the forest. I was certain,
by the course of the sun, which I had carefully noted, that
I had kept a tolerably correct course, and I calculated that by

197
the end of a couple of days at most, I should reach King Sanga
Tanga's town. My chief regret was, that my non-appearance
would cause anxiety, and that Charley and Harry would be
delayed in searching for me—still that could not be helped.
Had I gone in any other direction, I might naturally have lost
my way, whereas I now felt sure that they must ultimately come
up with me. I have not described the various animals I met
wfth. Now and then a buffalo passed at a distance, and several
species of antelopes. Once I saw a leopard stealing by, but he
did not see me, having some other game in view. There were
also hyenas, but I had no reason to be afraid of them, as they
seldom attack a human being unless they find them asleep.
There were numerous small .monkeys, as well as big apes of
several species. The most curious monkey was a small frolic-
some little animal which, whenever seen, indicated that water
was not far off, as they have an especial fondness for water.
They are great friends with a pretty bird, which is constantly
found in their company. They are often seen playing together,
whether it is that they are attracted by the same object, or
really have a mutual affection, I am unable positively to deter-
mine.
The country teeming with animal life, and'producing numerous
berries as well as large fruits, I had no fear of suffering from
hunger, provided my stock of ammunition should hold out.
Without it, in the midst of abundance, I might have starved.
Although I determined, as on the previous night, to sleep up a
tree; I lit a big fire, at which I could cook my supper, on the
ground near at hand. While the birds were roasting, I threw a
vine over the bough, by climbing up which I could gain a
place of safety. The birds I had shot being cooked, I was
discussing my supper, washing it down with draughts from my
water bottle, when looking up, I saw the shadow of a creature
moving some fifty yards off; a second glance convinced me that

it was a leopard. The fire kept him at bay, but he stood gazing
at me, and probably scenting the odour of the roasted birds from
afar. I saw him creep nearer and nearer. I might have shot
him, but might have missed, so considering discretion the better
part of valour, I caught hold of one of the birds by the leg, and
holding it in my mouth, I swarmed up to the bough, where I
was in perfect safety. I had before this fixed on a spot where
I could rest for the night, and at once made my way to it, in-
tending to start at daybreak the next morning. However, I
could not resist the temptation of watching the leopard. He
walked round and round my fire, but as long as it blazed up
was afraid of approaching. As, however, the flames sank down,
and only the bright embers remained, he made a dash at the
portion of the birds I had left behind, and gobbled them up in a
moment. I then threw him the bones of the one which I had
been gnawing. He looked up very much surprised, wondering
where it came from. I was greatly inclined to shoot him, but
there was no object in doing so, as I should very likely only
have wounded him, and sent him off to die miserably. At last,
finding there was nothing more to be got, and possibly forgetting
all about me, the leopard took his departure. I slept as soundly
up the tree as I did the previous night, and coming down in the
morning, immediately pushed forward in the direction I had
before been travelling. I was able to make good some eight or
ten miles before the air had become heated with the sun.
Another day passed so like the former, that I could scarcely
distinguish one from the other. Another evening was coming
on. I fully expected by this time to have reached my destina-
tion, but I had met with no plantations, or any other signs
to show that I was approaching an inhabited spot, I therefore
supposed that I must be still some way off.
I was travelling along when I heard the sound of voices—they
were those of females, several with baskets on their heads,

A GIRL CAUGHT BY AN APE.

while others were busily employed in plucking wild fruits, which
grew in abundance in an open glade in the forest. Some thick
bushes sheltered me from view. I was thankful to see them, as
I hoped that they belonged to the village of Sanga Tanga, and .
that my long solitary journey was now nearly over. Still I
thought that should I appear among them suddenly I might
alarm them—I was, therefore, determined to remain concealed,
and to follow them when they should return homeward, being
sure that they would lead me, if not to the village of which
I was in search, to another where I might hope to be well
received. The girls were all scattered about, plucking the fruit
from the bushes, when I heard a fearful scream, and looking in
the direction from whence it came, I saw one of those dreadful
monsters which had for days haunted my imagination, approach-
ing two of the girls. The creature was too far off to allow me to
fire with a certainty of killing him, and should I merely wound
him, I should probably only make him more savage; I therefore
crept forward as rapidly as I could, hoping to get close enough
to shoot him before he could seize either of the girls. One,
overcome by terror, seemed scarcely able to fly, or make an
effort to escape, the others fled shrieking away. Before I
could get sufficiently close to make sure of my aim, the hideous
monster seized the hapless girl round the waist with one of his
long arms, and immediately began to make his way towards a
neighbouring tree. I dashed forward. Should he once get to
any height up the branches, nothing could save the girl, for even
should I shoot him she might be killed by the fall. I knew
that by firing I ran the risk of shooting her, but that risk must
be run, her death was certain should he escape with her. He
had reached the first branch of a tree, scarcely more than twelve
feet from the ground, when I brought my rifle to bear on him.
I fired, aiming at his breast.
As the bullet struck him he uttered a terrific roar ; but at the

same moment opening his left arm, which had encircled the girl,
he let her fall, fortunately on a bed of leaves. She was senseless.
I was afraid that the monster would fall upon her, and if so in
his struggles he might tear her with his teeth and claws, but he
held fast to the bough, roaring loudly and striking his breast.
Under other circumstances I think that I should have put a con-
siderable distance between myself and the beast, but the life of a
fellow-creature was at stake. Summoning all the coolness I could
command, I reloaded and then shouted to the other girls to come
back and take their companion away. They all seemed to dread
approaching the monster. I was afraid that, should I go under
the bough, he might spring on me, and that the only safe mode
of proceeding was to keep him covered by my rifle, so that, should
he make any movement, I might again shoot. Presently I saw
him swaying backwards and forwards as if his strength was leaving
him ; still he growled as fiercely as before. I moved slightly, so
as to get a better aim at him. He thought, perhaps, that I was
about to fly, for he stepped on to another bough.
Now was my opportunity; I fired, and down he came with a
crash, breaking away several rotten boughs, until he reached
a quantity of dead wood, where he struggled in vain to rise.
Having reloaded, I dashed forward, and, lifting the girl in
my arms, bore her towards a party of her friends, who had
stopped, gazing horror-stricken at what was taking place.
They received her with loud cries of grief, supposing her
to be dead. She, in a short time, began to breathe, and, open-
ing her eyes, gazed round with a scared and terrified look,
then she clung to her companion, shrieking out, as she caught
sight of me standing by—" Save me, save me!" Apparently she
for a moment supposed that I was the being who had carried her off.
Her friends, however, were apparently doing their best to re-
assure her; and at length, pointing to me, they made her under-
stand that I was the person who had saved her from the grasp of

the monster ape, which they pointed out lying dead beneath the
tree. They then all came round me, and I had no doubt from the
signs they made and their looks, that they were expressing their
gratitude for the service I had rendered them in saving the young
girL
I tried in return to make them understand how glad I was
that I had done so. I was now able more particularly to
remark the appearance of the damsel. She was young, and for
a negress remarkably pretty. As she recovered she took my
hand and placed it on her head as a sign, I supposed, that
she was much obliged to me for saving her. I tried to make
out whether the girls belonged to King Sanga Tanga's village.
When I mentioned his name they all clapped their hands and
pointed to the girl whom they called Iguma. In consequence
of this action I began to hope that she was in some way re-
lated to him, perhaps his daughter, in which case my friends and
I were likely to be better treated than we could otherwise have
expected.
As far as I could judge from the signs the girls made, I under-
stood that the village was not far off. Having picked up the baskets
and refilled them with the fruit which had been strewn on the
ground, they prepared to return. Four of them carried Iguma,
who placed her arms round the necks of two, while the others
supported her legs. Before setting off I was anxious to secure
the skin of the huge ape—if ape it was, for it looked to me, as it
lay stretched on the ground, more like some savage human being
of the forest. I pointed it out to the girls, who, I believe,
fancied that the creature had made its escape into the wood. As
soon as they saw it and knew from the signs I made that it was
dead, they began to advance cautiously in the direction where it
lay. I went first, with my knife drawn ready to flay it. They
now crept forward, two or three of the bolder ones in front of the
rest, when they would stop and gaze at the creature, talking to

each other, even now apparently having some doubt whether it
was dead or not. Then, as I got nearer to it and at last gave it
a kick or two with ray foot, they came crowding around with
more confidence, crying out loudly and chattering away to each
other. I was about to begin to flay it when it struck me that
they would perhaps be unwilling to carry the skin, and I certainly
had no wish to bear it on my own shoulders all the way to the
village, even although the distance might not be great. I tried
to make them understand that if they would send some young
men I should be very much obliged. They, after a little time,
took in my meaning, and two of them, handing their baskets to
their companions, set off running.
As I was not particularly anxious to skin the creature my-
self, remembering that if I did so I should not be in a very fit
state to be presented to the king and the inhabitants of the
village, I accepted the invitation of the girls to accompany
them at once.
Leaving the dead ape to any fate which might befall it, I set
off with my new friends, who now surrounding me, formed them-
selves into a sort of triumphal procession. First went Iguma
and her supporters, then followed four of my attendants, then
I came with two on either hand, the rest bringing up the rear, all
shouting and singing impromptu verses in praise of me, for I
could tell by certain words that such was the case. The words
were to this effect—
"The king's daughter with her maidens went out to pick
berries, then came a huge ape, and they fled with fright . The
monster seized the maiden, the pride of her father's heart, and
bore her off to a cruel death. Already he had reached a tree,
the cries of her companions availed her not. In another moment
she would have been beyond our reach, when a pale-faced
stranger appeared with a wonderful thunder maker in his hand.
He made thunder, and the ape, huge as it was, fell dead at his

feet. The beautiful Iguma was saved. He who had saved her
has won our hearts, we will do him honour, we will do all he asks
of us. The king will rejoice, he will weep with joy over his child,
and he will give her to the young stranger as a reward. He will
become our prince and live with us, and lead our young men to
battle. We will serve him gladly."
As the meaning of these last expressions dawned upon me, I
began to feel somewhat uncomfortable. I was very happy to
have saved the young lady, but had no wish whatever to become
the husband of a black beauty, however charming she might be
in the eyes of her countrymen. I was puzzled to think how I
might get out of the difficulty without offending her or her
father, or her female companions, who had so unreservedly
bestowed her on me without being asked. I could only hope
that the maidens were indulging in poetical license, and that
they did not really mean that I should marry their mistress.
At all events, I determined to put the best face on the matter
I could, hoping that they might not insist on the event coming
off immediately.
At last I caught sight of some magnificent palm trees, rising in
the midst of a number of houses. In a short time we entered a
broad street which led into the square, and in the middle were
the palm trees I had just before observed. It struck me as an
exceedingly picturesque place, and very neat. On each side of
the square two other streets branched off. Every house had a
veranda in front of it, and an open space between it and the
road. I should have said as we approached we met a party of
young men running at full speed, who, after exchanging a few
words with the girls, hastened on in the direction whence we had
come. On entering the town we saw a number of persons
approaching, several playing on tomtoms and various musical
instruments, and others shouting and singing. In their midst
walked their king in full costume, which I suspect he had put on

in a hurry, for his head dress was rather awry. Coming forward,
he embraced his daughter, tears falling from his eyes as a mark
of his paternal affection ; then he came up to me, and saluted me
in the same fashion, a ceremony I would gladly have avoided.
He then poured out expressions which I took to signify how
deeply grateful he was to me for saving his daughter from the
huge ape. He then asked me what had become of my com-
panions, and how it was that I was there all alone. I may have
been wrong, but this, I believe, was what he said to me. I tried
to explain by signs rather than words, how I had been separated
from them while out hunting, that I had looked for them in vain,
and then made my way towards his village, where I fortunately
arrived in time to do the happy deed which I trusted would guild
my humble name in the eyes of his majesty and his subjects. I
do not know whether the king understood what I said, but as I
put my hand to my heart and looked very much pleased, I was
sure that he understood, at all events, that I wished to say some-
thing civil. From what I heard the girls say, I confess that I
was somewhat afraid that his majesty would propose bestowing
his daugtheron me at once, and was greatly relieved when I found
he had not in any way alluded to the subject. Having seen her
carried into one of the huts by her attendants, the king took my
hand and led me towards another hut on the opposite side of
the square. It was a very well-constructed building, of fair size
and height and look, remarkably neat and clean. Behind it was
a plantain grove; a garden with lime and other trees, and shrubs of
beautiful foliage, with an enclosure in which were a number of
goats and fowls.
Many of the inhabitants were clothed in robes of bongo, a
species of cloth made from the delicate cuticle of palm leaflets,
which are stripped off and ornamented with feathers. These
are woven very neatly, many of them are striped, and some
made even with check pattern. The pieces of cloth are then

THE DEAD APE BROUGHT.

stitched together in a regular way with needles, also manu-
factured by the natives. I saw in the town a number of men
sitting at looms in the middle of a hut with a wood fire burning
near them. The weavers were smoking their long pipes, the
bowls of which rested on the ground, and shouting to each
other as they worked merrily away. Some of the king's atten-
dants brought in cushions and mats, which they placed on
the floor. He then, begging me to be seated, placed himself
by my side, and tried to enter into conversation, but I must
confess that I had great difficulty in making out what he said.
I tried, however, to look very wise, lest his majesty might
lose patience, for there was something in his countenance which
showed me that he might be apt to do so, as is often the case with
persons who have been accustomed to have their own way.
We were still carrying on this somewhat unintelligible con-
versation, when loud shouts were heard, and the king and
I going to the door of the hut saw the young men who
had been sent to bring in the dead ape, four carrying the
skin, with the head stuck on a pole, and the arms stretched
out, and the rest bearing the body, cut up into portions.
From the way the king licked his lips, I suspected that he
intended to enjoy a feast on the flesh of the beast. I should as
soon thought of eating a human being, so human did it look in
many respects. They halted before us, and asked what they
were to do with it. I, in reply, merely claimed the skin, at which
they appeared well satisfied, and marched off with the remainder
to the king's house at the other side of the square. I hoped, by
hanging up the skin, we might be able to clean it, and preserve
it sufficiently to carry it with us to the coast, for I was sure that
otherwise no one would believe that so enormous an ape existed.
I managed to make the king understand what I wanted, and he,
with several other persons whom he summoned, assisted me in
hanging it up to a branch of a tree, my intention being to light a

fire under it, and try to cure it by smoking. I was thus employed
when I heard several shots. The king and his attendants rushed
out to the front of the house, and I followed. They were evi-
dently in a state of agitation, wondering what the shots could
mean. Presently we heard shouts. In a short time a number
of persons appeared at the further end of the town. As they
drew near, to my great joy I recognised Charley and Harry with
Tom Tubbs and Aboh, accompanied by Prince Ombny. On
seeing me they all hurried forward, eager to know how I had
been separated from them and found my way to the village.
While I briefly narrated my adventures, Prince Ombay learned
how I had rescued his sister. He now came forward and em-
braced me, telling me that I was his brother, that we should
never part.
Calling Aboh, I begged him to say everything civil he could think
of; but, at the same time, not to commit me by making any
promises on my part. The king in his generosity would have
appropriated a house to each of us, but we begged that we might
be allowed to live together in the one he had fixed on for me,
which was amply large enough for all of us. We could thus, we
agreed, defend ourselves should the feelings of the people assume
any unpleasant change towards us; or we could, if necessary-,
better arrange for making our escape should the king take it into
his head to detain us. At present everything appeared as
pleasant as we could desire.
Soon after we had taken possession of the house a number of
girls appeared with baskets of provisions on their heads, and
bowls of farina. There was flesh and fowl and fruits of all
descriptions. We told Aboh that we should be very glad if he
would bring us some big bowls of water in which we could wash
our feet, and as he had before seen us perform that operation, he
at once understood what we wanted. Hastening out, he quickly
returned with a large gourd full of cool water, supplied by a

A VISIT FROM IGUMA.

spring which ran from a hill close to the village. We were about
to perform our ablutions, when a damsel appeared carrying a
basket of fruit on her head. She approached accompanied by a
white-haired old gentleman clothed in one of the robes I have
described. Looking up I recognised Iguma. I asked Aboh
who the old gentleman was, suspecting that he had come with
some object in view.
"That's her grandfather," he answered, looking very knowing.
We, of course, rose to greet the young lady, and to receive and
open the basket she had brought. The ebon damsel then
said something, and stood with her hands clasped before her.
What it was about I, of course, could not exactly make out,
and Aboh did not appear inclined to translate it. Her vener-
able grandsire then made a long speech. It was even more
unintelligible to us than were the words which had dropped
from Iguma's lips. At last we were obliged to apply to Aboh
for information.
"Him say makee her wife," said Aboh at length. It was
certainly a great abridgment of what had been uttered by
the old man, although probably it contained the pith of the
matter.
"Tell him," said Charley, pointing to me, "that I am his elder
brother, that he cannot marry without my leave, and that I con-
sider him far too young to think about taking upon himself the
responsibilities of matrimony. That he must come home first,
then, if he gets our parents permission, that he will come back
with chains and beads and looking-glasses, and ornaments of all
sorts for the young lady, and guns, powder and shot, and a
variety of other articles for her papa. Make this very clear,
if you please, for I must have no misunderstanding on that
point."
Aboh, who understood the chief part of what Charley had said,
immediately translated it to the old gentleman, with a good many

additions of his own. Iguma pouted a little at the thought, I
suppose, of having to wait so long, on which I told Aboh to
remind her of the quantity of beads I was to bring when I got
our father's leave to marry a black wife. I must own I had my
doubts how far we were justified in using this deceit, but our
position was a difficult one and might become dangerous, and
just then we did not consider the consequences which might
result from the artifice we had resorted to. I tried to make
Iguma understand how much I was obliged to her by eating
some of the food she had brought, and assuring her how very
nice I found it. At last she appeared tolerably well satisfied,
and as it was getting late she and her grandfather took their
departure. We were now left alone, with only Aboh and Shimbo
to attend on us.
"Things have turned out much better than I expected, and we
are very jolly here," observed Charley; "but I wonder whether
Mr. Sanga Tanga will let us proceed on our journey."
"To my mind I am afraid that, now he has got us, he intends to
keep us," observed Tom. "These nigger chiefs fancy that white
men can do everything, and as we have arms and ammunition,
the king will, I suspect, take it into his head to try and conquer
all the country round him. King Quagdmolo, as he calls himself,
is evidently afraid of him, or he would not have given me and our
traps up so easily."
"We, however, must try and get away," observed Harry ; "we
may be jolly enough, as Charley says, just now, but we shall soon
get weary of the life."
"We must first try fair means, and endeavour to persuade the
king to let us go home to ask our father to allow Dick to marry
Miss Iguma, as I propose," said Charley; "that appears to me to
be the safest plan to pursue."
"But suppose the king says no, and insists on your brother
marrying his daughter with or without your father's leave, what's
to be done then?"

AN AWKWARD PREDICAMENT.

"We must cut and run," I exclaimed; "I should be very sorry
to treat the young lady ill, but if her father insists on my marrying
her, I shall regret having been the means of saving her from the
wild man of the woods. I certainly thought that he would be
grateful to me for what I had done, but I confess that he exhibits
his gratitude in a very awkward manner as far as I am concerned.
However, there is no use talking about the matter any longer,
I'm getting very sleepy, and should be glad to turn in and
get a quiet snooze, after spending the last three nights up
trees."
My companions were ready enough to follow my advice, and
we all wrapped ourselves up in the pieces of matting with which
our new friends had supplied us, and went to sleep.

WE were allowed a day to rest after our long journey, and
were supplied with abundance of food, but we soon
found that our entertainers had no intention that we should eat
the bread of idleness. Prince Ombay, as we called him, came to
see us early the second morning after our arrival, and began
talking away at a great rate. We nodded our heads to show that
we were listening, but as we could not understand more than every
tenth word he uttered, Charley summoned Aboh.
"Him say go out hunting, kill big beast horns on head."
"I suppose he means buffalo," observed Charley.
"Or deer," suggested Harry.
"Are the animals he speaks of big and hairy, or slight and thin,
with very long horns?" I inquired of Aboh.
Aboh put his thumbs up above his head, and then with his
hands described a fat animal with long hair, and made a bellow-
ing noise.
"Ah, he means buffalo, there is no doubt about that," observed
Charley.

A BUFFALO HUNT.
211
"Tell our friend we shall be happy to accompany him, and if
he can show us the buffalo, we will do our best to shoot them."
Ombay, on this answer being interpreted to him, appeared
well satisfied. Taking his departure, he in a short time returned
accompanied by about twenty young men armed with spears and
javelins—the prince and a few of his companions of more
exalted rank having hangers, mostly rather the worse for wear.
We got our guns ready, and a sufficient amount of ammunition
for the day, and placing our knapsacks and other valuables
under the charge of Shimbo, who promised that he would allow
no one to steal them; we announced that we were ready to set
off. Ombay kept Aboh by his side, that he might converse with
us whenever he pleased. We had a long march before we
stopped to dine, but the party had brought a good supply of pro-
visions, and we had as much food as we required. We then
again set out, and continued our way until near sunset; when we
arrived at the edge of a wide prairie, bordered by the forest
through which we had passed.
"Here big beast soon come," observed Aboh.
According to the custom of the country, our companions
immediately began to set up screens of branches, behind which
we were to take our post. Harry and I were together, Charley
and Tom were stationed behind another screen, at a little dis-
tance off. We had to wait there for some time, when I heard
Aboh, who was with us, whisper something. Presently my ears
caught the sound of the trampling of hoofs, and directly after-
wards I saw by the light of the moon, just then rising, a herd of
thirty or more magnificent animals emerging from the forest, and
scattering themselves widely over the grassy plain in front of
us. We were fortunately to leeward, or our shelter would have
availed us nothing.
We had now to wait patiently until some of the herd might
make their way to our screen. How soon they would do this it
was impossible to say. At all events, there was a prospect of our

patience being severely tried. We remained as silent as death.
In a short time the buffalo, who seemed not to apprehend
danger, began gamboling and sporting with each other. As
there appeared no chance of their coming close to us, Ombay
made a sign to Harry and me to accompany him, and showed us
how we were to crawl along the grass until we got near enough
to have a shot . We were prepared for this, and gladly under-
took to do as he proposed. Just then the moon was obscured
by a cloud, and taking advantage of this he set out . We followed
close behind him, creeping along with our heads just raised
above the grass. We stopped whenever he did, on seeing the
buffalo look towards us. Presently we were close enough to
obtain fair shots. I was afraid, should we attempt to get nearer,
that the animals might take alarm and scamper off. I therefore
signed to Harry to shoot one, while I aimed at another no
great distance from us. Without waiting for a signal from
Ombay, we rose to our knees and fired. The two animals
at which we had aimed lept into the air at the same moment, and
fell over dead. Ombay, who had not expected us to make such
excellent shots, on this shouted with delight. The rest of the
herd of course galloped off, and were soon lost to sight amid the
trunks of trees on the opposite side of the prairie. The hunters
on seeing this rushed out, and instantly began flaying the animals,
and cutting them up.
Each man having loaded himself with as much as he could
carry, we returned to a spot inside the forest, previously chosen
by our leader. Fires were lighted, and our companions were
soon making merry over the buffalo meat. We found it fairly
flavoured, but rather tough. Our camp was formed in the usual
manner with lean-to's, beneath which we sheltered ourselves, and
fires in front of them, the smoke of which contributed to keep
off the stinging insects which abounded, and the bright light was
calculated to scare the savage animals of the forest. We had
now become so familiarised to this sort of life, that we thought

213
nothing of it. Early in the morning Ombay called us up and
told us, through our interpreter, that buffalo were again likely
to be feeding in the prairie, and that we might have a chance
of killing two or three more. Of course we were ready for the
sport,—indeed, the more animals we killed, the more likely we
were to propitiate the chief and his son. We felt all the time
that we were prisoners, although not actually in chains, and that
our masters might, at any time, change their conduct and ill-
treat us.
Jumping up from our bed of leaves, we shouldered our guns,
and accompanied by Aboh, we attended the prince and his
party—a few of the men only remaining to look after the camp
and buffalo meat. As we were making our way through the
forest, we got somewhat separated from the chief, of whom we
caught a sight just as we were nearing the prairie. We were
hastening to overtake him, when a rending and crashing sound
reached our ears, followed by the most tremendous bellowing
I ever heard. Then came a sharp bark—so it sounded—and
a roar such as I had heard proceeding from the huge man ape
I had encountered in the forest. The next instant a buffalo
burst from the cover. To its back was clinging one of the
monster creatures I have just mentioned. It clung on with its
powerful legs and arms with a tenacity against which all the
efforts of the buffalo to free itself were unavailing. Maddened
with terror, on dashed the buffalo, which was making its way
directly towards Ombay, who stood seemingly paralysed by fear
or astonishment. No tree which he could possibly climb up was
near at hand. I saw that in a few seconds the buffalo would be
upon him, and that he would be either gored to death or trampled
under foot by it; or that the ape, springing from its back, might,
with its savage jaws and hands, tear him to pieces. I, for a
moment, was doubtful whether to kill the buffalo, or the still
more savage creature which bestrode it. I decided on aiming
at the buffalo; I might stop it in its mad career, and, rolling over

it might crush the creature on its back, or else I might have time
to reload before the ape could reach me. I took good aim, the
buffalo's shoulder was presented to me, I fired, and the huge
animal, after bounding forward three or four yards, came to the
ground with a tremendous crash, catching the leg of the ape
beneath it as it rolled over on its back. Without a moment's
loss of time I reloaded, for the ape was not likely to be much
injured. Scarcely had I done so, when the monster, quickly
extricating itself, and catching sight of Prince Ombay, with
a terrific roar, striking its breast, made towards him. In another
instant the young black would have received a blow from its
tremendous paws, or have been seized by the fearful grinders
which, giving a savage growl, it exhibited as it opened its mouth.
I could not have imagined a creature with a more diabolical
countenance. Human as it looked, I had no hesitation in killing
it. I fired, and my bullet striking it in the breast, it fell flat on
its face, emitting, as it did so, a hideous death-cry, half roar, half
shriek, which echoed through the forest, and was repeated, it
seemed to me, by others of the same species. Ombay, who had
been fully aware of his danger, quickly recovered, and springing
forward, dealt a blow with his hanger at the neck of the monster,
which nearly severed the head from the body. He then, seeing
me advancing, hastened forward to express his thanks, and
I believe that he really was grateful to me for saving his life,
although I fancy he wished to gain the credit of having killed
his assailant himself. The uproar had frightened away all the
other buffaloes, so, with the bodies of the one I had killed, and
the ape, we forthwith returned to the camp to enjoy a hearty
breakfast. The natives cut up the body of the ape, and ate it
with as little compunction as they would have done mutton or
beef. Charley and Harry, who were close behind me when
I fired, declared that they had never seen better shots in their
lives.
'• I felt that much depended on my taking good aim," I replied.

ABUNDANCE OF ANIMAL LIFE.
"I was anxious to save the life of a fellow-creature, besides
which, I hope, that by rendering him a service, we may
have a better chance of being allowed to proceed upon our
journey."
I wished that we had had our knapsacks and could have at
once set off, without the pain of taking leave of King Sanga Tanga
and the lovely Iguma.
We told Aboh that we should like to secure the skin of the ape,
but he replied that none of the young men would like the trouble
of carrying it. On our way back we met with several beautiful
antelopes, and two or three kinds of gazelles, which bounded
away before we could get near enough to obtain a shot at them.
There was one of a bright orange colour with a chestnut patch
between the horns and eyes, below which was a white crescent-
shaped mark, while its body was completely covered with stripes
from head to tail, of a lighter colour than the rest of the
skin.
Although somewhat heavily built, it was graceful in its motions
and exceedingly swift of foot, so that in little more than a minute
the herd near to which we had got bounded out of sight. We
saw two leopards, but they took good care not to come near us;
they were certainly upwards of five feet in length. Tiger-cats,
some of unusual size, abounded, and would have been dangerous
to encounter unarmed. Charley shot an iguana, which, ugly as it
looked, afforded us a pleasanter meal than the buffalo meat.
As to the monkeys, they were innumerable.
On passing over a stream we caught sight of several beauti-
ful little monkeys, not bigger than rats, frisking about
among the boughs just as we had seen them on a previous
occasion. Near them were some birds, which kept hopping
to and fro on the same branches, apparently on the most
intimate terms with these diminutive quadrumana. By putting
up screens and waiting patiently, we managed to kill several

antelopes and other animals, so that we returned to the village
laden with meat. On entering, we found the inhabitants in
a state of commotion in consequence of the arrival of a person
of importance, who was then said to be having an audience with
the king, but who he was, or what he had come about, we could
not learn. By this time we had expended all our ammunition,
and we hastened to our house to replenish our stock, in case, by
any chance, we might have to use our arms. We felt that our
position was critical, for at any moment our capricious masters
might turn upon us, and we might have to fight for our lives. We
had cause, however, to be grateful to Heaven for our preservation,
and for the many dangers we had gone through safely, as also
that we had been enabled to retain our health, which, in spite of
the heat and fatigue we endured, was excellent. I suspect, how-
ever, that had we not been well supplied with wholesome food
and pure water, the case would have been different. On arriving
at our house, we found Shimbo keeping faithful watch and
ward over our property. By his account more than one attempt
had been made to steal it, but he had driven away the thieves,
so he said, by presenting a stick at them, which they mistook
for one of our guns. He could give us no information as
to the visitor, nor could Aboh, who went out, learn more
than his brother. There was some mystery about the matter,
that was certain. We were tired and glad to take the supper
which was brought to us already cooked, and consisted of
plantains dressed in a variety of ways, and venison, one dish
roasted and another stewed in lemon juice. Very excellent both
were.
Rolling ourselves in our mats, we went to sleep. We had
not closed our eyes long when I heard Charley, who was close
to the door, cry out lustily. At the same instant I felt
myself bitten by numberless creatures crawling over me.
Harry and Tom were treated in the same manner. We all

AN INROAD OF ANTS.

sprang to our feet, and, striking a light, discovered that
the room was full of ants. They came in battle array, a
numerous army pouring in through the door. We rushed
out into the garden, where fortunately we found a spot free
from them. Immediately lighting a fire, we formed it into a
wide circle, in the middle of which we took up our posts. Then
helping each other, we were able to relieve ourselves from
our venomous assailants, and as we plucked them off we
threw them into the flames. We soon found that the
whole village was attacked, and that the inhabitants were
turning out to defend themselves. They came not in thousands
but in millions, covering the streets and forcing their way
onwards. We saw that fires were lighted in all directions, but
whenever there was no time to collect fuel and kindle it, the
insects, marching onward, destroyed everything in their way.
Although they fell by tens of thousands, others took their places.
It was not until the morning that they disappeared, having de-
stroyed in that short time a large portion of the provisions
in the place. Fortunately they did not eat up the fruit
nor the live animals, but among other things destroyed
was the skin of the huge ape which we had intended to
take to England to exhibit to naturalists, feeling sure it would
create more surprise than anything else we could carry with
us. The entire skin was devoured, and the head picked clean
so that only a whitened skull remained. As we had been up all
night fighting the ants, we were glad to lie down again and obtain
some sleep in quiet.
We had just risen, rubbing our eyes and still feeling very
drowsy, when Prince Ombay came in and invited us to accom-
pany him on another hunt, observing that it was necessary to
replenish the stock of provisions destroyed by the ants. We, of
course, could not refuse.
"I would advise, gentlemen," said Tom, when he heard

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
through Aboh what the prince wished, "that we carry our
knapsacks on our backs, and then, if we have the chance, we
can take French leave of our friends. They would scarcely
attempt to stop us by force; and one can make them understand
that we must be off."
"Tom's advice is good," said Charley. "Let us clap on our
packs as a matter of course."
We had a scanty breakfast, as the whole of the village was
on short commons. We hoped before long to get some venison,
on which we could feast before taking to flight. When, however,
the prince saw what we were about, with a smiling countenance
he said—
"Hang up your fetiches again, you can do without them when
hunting, and when you come back you can worship at your
leisure."
From this we found that our knapsacks were looked upon as
objects of worship, perhaps this accounted for their not having
been stolen. Charley tried to persuade the prince that we
should kill more game if we took them, but he either suspected
our intentions, or thought that they were safer in our houses, and
insisted that we should leave them behind us. We had let
Aboh understand what we had been doing, for we knew we
could trust him, but we thought it wise not to say anything to
Shimbo until the moment had arrived, when Aboh would tell
him of our intentions, feeling sure that he would be ready to
accompany us.
In vain we tried to persuade Ombay that we should be more
successful if we carried our knapsacks. He, putting on a
knowing look, again refused, and we were finally compelled to
set off without them.
"We must wait for another opportunity," said Charley; "it
will come some day or other, and it is very evident that we shall
have to practise no small amount of patience."

HUNTING FOR PROVISIONS.
219
"I have been thinking seriously that I could make my way
down to the coast alone," said Tom, "and if I could fall in
with an English vessel, I might form a party of men to help you.
I know that there is some danger, but it matters very little if
Tom Tubbs loses his life, although it would be a sad thing for
you three young gentlemen to be kept prisoners by these black
fellows for the rest of your lives."
"No fear of that," answered Charley. "We may find our-
selves free sooner than you expect. There must be rivers to
the north of us, and if we could once get to the banks of one
of them, we could make our way down to the sea in a canoe.
The longer we remain with King Sanga Tanga, the more con-
fidence the people will have in us. At present we have only
Hobson's choice, stop here we must."
On this occasion the prince was accompanied by three times
as many hunters as before. We were expected to take an active
part in the sport. We proceeded nearly a couple of days
journey, when we formed a camp, and the hunters went out
prepared to kill either elephants, buffaloes, deer, or wild pigs;
indeed, for some object or other, they seemed anxious to accu-
mulate a large supply of food. The first day they killed two
elephants, much in the same manner as I have before described.
The following day Charley, Harry, and I killed two buffaloes
and three deer, while the natives were not nearly so successful.
Parties arrived from the village to carry home the game we had
already shot. We were shortly afterwards joined by a number
of strangers, who came in, we found, from the different villages at
a distance, though all under the government of King Sanga
Tanga, each party bringing a large net, a similar net having
arrived from our village. On examining them, we found that
they were made from the fibre of the pine apple plant and that
of other trees twisted into thick thread. Each net was about
seventy feet long, and nearly five feet in height.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
The villagers—I should have said—were accompanied by
packs of little sharp-eared dogs, who gave vent to loud yelps.
Accompanied by these dogs, about twenty men, taking between
them one of the nets, of which there were altogether about a
dozen, set off to a spot fixed on, where there was a clearing in
the forest. Not a word was spoken as the men crept along,
followed by the dogs, which were kept close together, and seemed
to understand that they were not to bark. On reaching the ground,
the hunters commenced stretching the nets, fastening them up to
the lower branches of trees and shrubs, forming altogether a
semi-circle, upwards of half a mile in length. A party was
stationed at both ends of the nets thus arranged, armed with
their spears and darts, to prevent any of the game escaping; the
rest of the men, whom we accompanied, then extended them-
selves in another semi-circle on the concave side of the net, at
the distance of a mile or more from- it. Thus we advanced, the
dogs barking, and the men shouting, while we held our guns
ready to shoot, and the natives had their darts prepared for
instant action. We might fall in with an elephant, or buffalo, or
leopard, which would of course laugh at the nets, but the belief
appeared to be that no such animals were likely to be found
within the space we embraced. It was often difficult work mak-
ing our way through the dense forest, and the natives had to hew
paths for themselves with their hangers. Getting in sight of the
nets, we saw, stopped by them, half a dozen gazelles, and ante-
lopes of different species, two very large ones of the latter de-
scription, which I should have thought would have forced their
way through the net had they made the attempt. We fired, and
brought them down. Two gazelles were caught in the net, and
others were knocked over by the natives. Altogether, the haul
was considered a very good one. As soon as the animals were
secured, the nets were collected, and the party moving off to
another part of the forest, again spread them in the same way.

GAME CAUGHT BY NETS.
221
Altogether, in the course of the day we killed thirty head of
game of different species, when we returned in triumph to the
capital of King Sanga Tanga, who came out to meet us, and was
especially civil to us, his white guests, who had so greatly assisted
in supplying him with this large amount of game. On coming
back to our house we asked Aboh if he could explain why the
king wished to obtain this large amount of game, as all the
inhabitants together could not consume it.
Aboh looked very knowing, "Him daughter goin' take hus-
band," he answered.
A feeling of dread came over me as he said this. What if the
king intended to make me, nolens nolens, marry his daughter.
It seemed impossible. I expressed my fears to Charley.
"I wish that I could relieve your anxiety," he answered. But
I tell you what, perhaps Tom would not mind so much. We
may ask the king to take him instead of you."
"But the young lady, she would object to that," I said, in a
tone which made Charley fancy that my vanity was wounded.
He laughed heartily, and Harry joined hira. "Perhaps you think
Tom is too old for the young woman," he added.
"Oh! no, no," I answered, he is heartily welcome to her for
that matter.
However, the next day the business was settled in a more
satisfactory way than any of us expected, or supposed possible.
It appeared that the prince, or the heir-apparent of a neighbour-
ing kingdom considerably to the northward, had seen (I must
not call her the "fair ") Iguma, and had fallen desperately in love
with her. He had arrived during our previous absence with a
large party of followers, bringing treasures of all sorts, elephants'
tusks, rolls of matting, and various other articles. The king
having observed my unwillingness to become his son-in-law, and
the young lady being piqued at my indifference, had accepted
her black suitor. Indeed, the treasures he offered were far greater

than any we possessed, which probably weighed chiefly with his
majesty. We hitherto had not seen the happy bridegroom,
Prince Kendo, who had been living since his arrival in a hut by
himself. The ceremony was to take place that very day, when
the various gifts, or the amount he was to pay for his bride, were
to be openly presented in the square of the village. At the hour
fixed on, the prince made his appearance at the door of the house,
his head decked with coloured feathers, a panther robe over his
shoulders, his hunting knife stuck in his belt, to which also was
fastened a sort of kilt of coloured matting, ornamented with
feathers, while his whole body was freshly oiled and painted.
His attendants, who bore his goods, were habited in a somewhat
similar manner. As soon as he appeared, the king came forth
leading his daughter. I cannot say that she was over-encumbered
by robes, but her arms and ankles were encircled by rings. Her
head was decked with coloured beads, and a chain of beads and
charms hung round her neck. Prince Kendo, ordering his at-
tendants to place the goods he had brought in front of the king's
palace, advanced, carrying a big tusk, the last article of value
which he had agreed to pay for his bride. On the king receiving
it, the prince stretched out his hand and took that of the lady's,
when Sanga Tanga gave her his paternal blessing, and apparently
a large amount of good advice, the only ceremony, as far as we
could discover, performed on the occasion. She had now become
the bride of the prince, and I must own that I breathed more
freely when I saw him lead her away, and felt satisfied that the
king would no longer insist on my becoming her husband. The
ceremony, such as it was, being concluded, the people began to
shriek and shout at the top of their voices, congratulating the
prince on becoming the possessor of so lovely a bride. Tom-
toms were heard beating in all directions, and horns sounding, and
the whole capital was in an uproar. The feast then began, and the
cooks, who had been busily employed all the morning in roasting,

THE MARRIAGE OF IGUMA.
223
stewing, and boiling, produced the result of their labours in
baskets and dishes, which were spread out in front of the king's
house, which was on this occasion to serve as a banquet hall.
The guests quickly assembled, the bride and bridegroom taking,
if not the head of the table, the post of honour, while King
Sanga Tanga, the heir-apparent, and the old grandfather and
other members of the family, placed themselves on either side.
At first matters were conducted quietly enough, the guests eating
to their heart's content; but when the palm wine began to circu-
late freely, they, like persons in mere civilised communities under
similar circumstances, became uproarious. The old grandfather
tumbled not under the table, but at full length on the ground; King
Sanga Tanga cried out that it was time to commence dancing, and
he himself starting up, set the example, and the crowd forming a
circle, he performed a series of eccentric evolutions, similar to
those exhibited on a previous occasion by his brother monarch
King Quagomolo; when at last, overcome by his exertions,
he sank down on the ground close to the royal portion of the
circle, the bride and bridegroom springing up went through a like
performance. Their places were taken by a number of courtiers
and the ladies, if I can so describe them of the royal household,
but for obvious reasons I will not describe the style of their
dancing. It was barbarism run mad, and our chief feeling was
disgust that human beings should so degrade themselves.
"Abominable!" cried Charley. "It is wrong to sanction by
our presence such doings, and if we retire to our house, and
afterwards tell Sanga Tanga why we did so, it may perhaps open
his eyes to the true character of what is going forward."
"Well," exclaimed Tom, "I've seen many a rum sight, but
this beats even the worst I ever beheld in a seaport town in
England, or elsewhere, and that's saying a good deal."
With these words Tom turned his back on the performers,
and followed us to the house. So absorbed were the spectators

in the dancing—if dancing it could be called—that they did not
perceive our departure. We could hear the shrieks and shouts
of laughter and applause, the drumming on tomtoms, and the
sound of the horns until a late hour in the night. We had
evidence of many barbarous customs of the natives, which I
have not mentioned. I do not say that they are more savage,
or rather fierce, than people of other parts of the world; indeed,
in some respects they are less so, but their barbarism is the
result of their ignorance and debased condition. They have no
religion—properly so called—their only belief is in what we
denote fetichism, which is a word taken from the Portuguese
feticeira or witch. They have idols, but they can scarcely be
said to worship them, and they believe that power resides in
serpents and birds, as well as in inanimate objects, such as
mountain peaks, in bones, and feathers, and they believe also
that good and evil spirits exist, and that charms have a powerful
influence, as likewise that dreams signify something, but in
many of these respects they really do not differ materially from
their white brethren of more civilised countries. The ignorant
people of many European nations believe in charms. They
bow down before statues, certainly more attractive in appear-
ance than the African's fetich god, but still things of stone.
The people we met were certainly superstitious in the highest
degree, but they nearly all differed in their ideas, as did even the
people of the same tribe. As far as we could ascertain, they
have no notion of the immortality of the soul, although they
fancy that the spirit exists for a short time after it leaves the
body. They dread such spirits more than they reverence them,
and believe that they are rather inclined to do them harm than
good. They therefore place offerings at their graves, for the sake
of propitiating them, sometimes offering up a human sacrifice
for the same purpose—some unfortunate slave who is of little
value to them. In our village we saw a large idol in a house

22$
built expressly for the purpose. It was a hideous, ill-constructed
monster, and it seemed scarcely possible, ignorant as the people
were, that they could really worship such an object, but they did so
if they wanted to gain benefit, either to obtain victory in war, or
success in the chase. On such occasions we saw them present-
ing food, and then dancing and singing before it. Many of the
people also had small family idols which they worshipped much
in the same manner; but if they did not obtain what they
wanted from the idol, they were very apt to send it away in
disgrace. They have also a belief in the power of certain
doctors or medicine men, who exorcise evil spirits, and concoct
charms. In these charms they have more faith than anything
else. They are generally done up in the skins of animals, and
consist of bones, or feathers, or ashes, or the skins or bones of
snakes. The manufacture of these charms brings a large
revenue to the doctors, who constantly encourage their use, just
as do the priests of certain white nations, who make their dupes
pay for the trumpery leaden figures or images, which they persuade
them to wear round their necks.
"On my word, I do not see much difference after all, between
the belief of the ignorant Russians, or Spaniards, or Portuguese,
or other European people, and these unhappy blacks," exclaimed
Harry one day when we were discussing the subject.
The fearful curse of the country, however, is the belief in
witchcraft . When a person is seized with illness, he always
believes that some enemy has caused it, and is not satisfied
until the witch or wizard is discovered, who is immediately
compelled to swallow poison, or is barbarously put to death in
some other way. I prefer thus giving a short account of the
superstitions of the people, and the evil which results from them,
to detailing the abominations and horrors, which on various
occasions we witnessed during our wanderings through the
country. That evening we came to the resolution of endeavour-

ing to make our escape as soon as we possibly could. We
believed that we could depend upon Ahoh and his brother, and
that they would influence several of their tribe who had been
captured, but were allowed to go at liberty.
As we could not sleep, owing to the hideous noise going on
in the village, so we sat up to a late hour, discussing our plans
for the future.

'I ""HE bride and bridegroom had taken their departure
_L northwards. We tried to ascertain the exact position
of their village in order that we might avoid it, rather than pay
the young couple a visit. As soon as the game we had taken
was exhausted, the king wanted us once more to start on a
hunting expedition, but we had come to the resolution of going
as seldom as possible, that we might avoid the expenditure of
our ammunition. It was necessary to husband that, as we
should certainly require it on our journey. Although we were

apparently allowed our liberty, we were conscious that we were
narrowly watched, and that, therefore, we should find great
difficulty in making our escape by stealth. Tom Tubbs having
completely recovered his strength, and we three being in good
condition, we determined to go to the king and boldly request
guides and an escort to the northward as far as his jurisdiction
extended, at the same time, to demand the release of Aboh and
Shimbo, who were willing to accompany us instead of returning
to their own village.
Taking Aboh with us, when we knew the king was at home,
we proceeded together to his palace. His majesty was seated
under the veranda in front on a pile of matting, with a huge
pipe in his mouth, attending to the affairs of state, for several of
his counsellors were seated on either side of him. Harry, who
had learned more of the language than either Charley or I, and
looked considerably older than either of us, was deputed to be
spokesman, having the aid of Aboh as an interpreter, should he
come to a standstill for want of words on his part, or from not
being able to comprehend the meaning of what the king said.
He acquitted himself, as far as we could judge, wonderfully well.
He pointed out that we had been made prisoners when travelling
peaceably through the country, and been compelled to accom-
pany his people, that we had since then enjoyed our liberty, and
that we had made good use of it . In the first place, by saving
his daughter from the wild man of the woods, then preserving
his son from the charge of the buffalo, that we had killed
enough game to support ourselves, and should have been ready
to assist him in any other way in our power, but that we now
desired to return to our own country. That we should be obliged
to his majesty if he would furnish us with the means of pro-
ceeding on our journey. The king, who seemed to understand
perfectly what was said—Aboh aiding with a few words here and
there—gave a smile and replied—

WE DEMAND OUR LIBERTY.
229
"That he would consider the matter, that he esteemed us
very much, that we were good hunters, and had brought peace
and prosperity to the country, as no enemies would dare to
attack his people while we remained with him. But, if you go
away, what will become of me?" he asked.
"What shall I say to that?" asked Harry, turning round to
Charley and me.
"Tell the king that he must manage as he did before we had
the honour of making his acquaintance," answered Charley;
"that we are very glad to have been of service to him hitherto,
still, that now our hearts are yearning for home, and that if he
detains us against our will, our spirits will sink, and we shall no
longer be able to help him."
The king grinned horribly, and said something of which
neither Harry nor any of us could make out the meaning.
"What did he say?" we inquired of Aboh.
"Him say, cut him head off," answered Aboh; "me tinkee
him mean it too."
This was unpleasant information, but we thought it as well not
to take notice of it, but it convinced us plainly that the king
would not agree to our request.
"Endeavour to bribe the king with promises of the things we
will send him," said Charley; "tell him we will pay him hand-
somely."
"I'll try," replied Harry, and forthwith he began to pour out
all the native words he could recollect. It is just possible that
he put in two or three by mistake, which had a very contrary
meaning, for the king looked sometimes surprised, then angry,
then highly amused, but yet he would not give the permission we
requested.
"Try again if he can't be bribed," said Charley. "Promise
that we will send him all sorts of things from England, if he will
tell us how they are to be transmitted."


## p. 230 (#340) ############################################

230
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Harry did his best to carry out Charley's wishes, Aboh inter-
preting the words of the king. He said that a bird in the hand
was worth two in the bush, that if we got away we might forget
the promise we had made, or that if we sent the things, they
might be lost long before they could reach him.
"Now try him on the threatening tack," said Charley; "tell
him what a great man our king is, that ten of his soldiers would
put to flight a whole army of his blacks, and that if he does not
let us go, our king will send two or three hundred men, who will
be landed from our ships, and march up the country to look for us."
"They have not yet arrived," said the king, with another of
those sardonic grins in which he often indulged. "It will take
them some time to get here, and when they do come, they will
have to fight us if they come as enemies."
"Tell the obstinate old fellow that they will come notwith-
standing, and will blow him and his village up to the top of the
mountains," exclaimed Charley, who grew impatient at the king's
refusal.
Harry did not say this, however, for two reasons. In the first
place, he thought it would be imprudent, and in the second, he
could not find words to express himself. He said something
equivalent to it, however, which had no apparent effect on the
king's mind. At last we were obliged to leave his majesty,
determined notwithstanding, as Tom advised, to take French
leave, and go on the first opportunity. Our condition after
this became much worse than it had been before. We were
compelled to go into the plantations, and to dig and hoe the
ground. We at first refused, declaring that we were hunters and
not cultivators of the soil. We expostulated again and again,
reminding the king how we had saved his daughter and son
from death. He only answered "that his daughter did not
now belong to him, and his son must answer for himself."
This convinced us that the black king had not ft spark of

OUR PLANS FOR ESCAPING.
231
gratitude in his composition. We, however, addressed our-
selves to Prince Ombay, who appeared more inclined to accede
to our request than was his father, but he told us he dared not
interfere with his authority.
Week after week went by, and we were kept in a state of vassal-
age. When we went out hunting, the king, suspecting that we
might make our escape, always kept one of the party at home with
our knapsacks. During the whole time, however, neither we, our
knapsacks, or our guns were interfered with, the people evidently
looking on them as fetiches, not daring to touch them. They
also believed us to be something above the common, or we should
not have been treated so civilly by them. At last we could bear
it no longer.
"Come with me, we must fight our way out of this," exclaimed
Charley.
"That is more easily said than done. Although we might kill
a few people we should be overwhelmed with numbers," observed
Tom.
"Let us try if we cannot deceive them by pretending to be
reconciled to our lot," said Harry; "or if one of us shams to be
ill, they'll think we cannot move under the circumstances; such
a trick would be perfectly justifiable."
"Of course it would," said Tom, "and I'll be the one to sham
ill, you'll see how I'll howl and shriek, until the people will be
glad to get rid of us for the sake of peace and quiet."
The next evening Tom put his proposal into execution. No
sooner had the villagers turned in than he began howling and
shrieking in the most fearful manner.
"I think you are overdoing it," observed Harry, "we shall
not get any sleep either."
"Never mind that for a few hours," answered Tom, "I must
howl on until they come and see what's the matter."
He got some white earth with which he bedaubed his face, and

which made it of an ashy paleness as he now lay covered up with
mats on one side of the house.
The noise had been heard by the prince, who, with several
other persons, came to know what was the matter. Tom made
no answer, but howled and shrieked louder than ever, as if racked
with pain.
Aboh, who had not, however, been let into the secret, informed
the prince that the white man was very ill, and that he was afraid
we should all catch the same complaint. This was an addition
of his own that we had not thought of.
Just as he was speaking the king with a number of his wives
came in to know what was the cause of the noise. When Aboh
told him the same story he darted off with great speed, calling on
his son and the rest of the people to beat a retreat from the in-
fected place, and out they all rushed helter skelter, Tom hasten-
ing them by another series of shrieks and cries. After this we
were left unmolested for the remainder of the night, although
Tom once in each watch shrieked and shouted, as he
said,
"Just to keep the people from forgetting us."
Though no one came into the house for several days after this,
Aboh was allowed to go out and purchase provisions for us, which
we were frequently able to do, with some of the beads and
trinkets we possessed.
At length one day he came back, looking very much alarmed,
saying that the king himself was taken ill, and having declared
that some one had bewitched him, had sent for the witch doctor
to find out who it was, and if the rascally doctor fixed on one of
us we should have to drink the Mboundow poison.
Of course we all declared that we would do no such thing, and
laughed at Aboh.
"But, I tell you what, perhaps they'll make you or your brother,
or one of the rest of your people do so," observed Charley, " the

OUR FLIGHT.
233
wisest thing you can do is for you all to come to us to-night and
we will fight our way out of the village."
Aboh agreed, fully believing what Charley said; indeed, there
was every probability that he or some of his people would be
fixed on by the witch doctor, when they would to a certainty be
put to death.
"I'll make them suppose that I'm as bad as the king, or worse,"
said Tom.
As soon as it was evening Tom repeated his howls and shrieks,
with even more vehemence, if possible, than before. Just about
midnight, when all the people were in bed, Aboh sallied forth. We
anxiously waited his return. At last he came back with Shimbo,
followed by a dozen of his tribe, who had managed to possess them-
selves not only of bows and arrows, but of spears and hangers, and
were altogether very well armed. Not a moment was to be lost. We
had strapped on our knapsacks, and shouldering our muskets we
sallied forth as noiselessly as possible. Fortunately no dogs
barked, nor, as far as we could tell, had any of the inhabitants
heard us. Not a light was burning in any of the houses. The
king and his witch doctor were probably also asleep. Had an
enemy attacked the village, the whole of the inhabitants might
have been slaughtered before they had time to unite and offer
the slightest resistance.
We began to congratulate ourselves that we should get a
good distance from the village before our flight was discovered.
Already we had reached the north end of the high street, and
were about to emerge into the open country, when we heard a
shout uttered by a single voice.
"Who speaks?" I asked of Aboh, who was near me.
"Him doctor," said Aboh, "sleep one eye open."
"Don't answer him," said Charley, " push on; if we get a good
start, they are not likely to follow us in the dark."
Fearing that our native allies might be ready to yield, we told

them to go on, while Tom and I dropped to the rear to defend
them should we be attacked. We now heard several other voices.
In a short time the whole village was in an uproar, men shouting,
dogs barking, women screaming, fancying, perhaps, that the place
was attacked. We feared, of course, that the true state of the
case would soon be discovered, and that we should be followed.
Whether Ombay and his people would venture to molest us was
the question. We marched on steadily, but we had not gone far
when we knew, by the increasing noise, that some of the people
were on our track. Charley advised us not to fire unless it should
become absolutely necessary. The shouts and angry cries of the
savages drew nearer and nearer. It was evident that they were
rushing on pell mell, still, as long as no arrows were shot at us,
we were resolved not to fire. Just then the moon, though waning,
rose above the horizon, and showed us a mass of dark forms,
waving their weapons, shouting and howling, not a hundred yards
off. Tom and I turned round and presented our rifles, shouting
loudly to them to keep back. The moonbeams gleaming on
the barrels showed the blacks what we were about, and the mob
halting we rejoined our companions; again we pushed on. The
number of our pursuers increased, we had, however, made up our
minds not to yield and not to return; as soon as they saw us
again moving on, they began to scamper towards us, shouting as
before.
"They beat me at that," observed Tom, "but if they don't
look out, I'll give them some cause to shriek."
Soon after he had spoken an arrow flew near our ears, but
fortunately did not strike any of the people ahead of us, another
and another followed, at last one of the blacks was hit, as we
knew by the cry of pain he uttered.
"If that's your game, my lads, you shall have enough of it,"
exclaimed Tom, turning round and firing a shot into the midst
of the savages. Who was struck we could not tell, but they all

PURSUED BY THE SAVAGES.
235
immediately stopped, though they continued shouting as before.
Tom reloading, we ran on.
"The next time we must both of us stop and fire," he
said.
For several minutes we began to hope that the savages had
given up the pursuit, but as we could not long keep up the pace
at which we were going, we began to slacken our speed. They
again overtook us, and shooting a flight of arrows, Tom was hit
in the leg, and another black man in the back.
"It's your own fault," cried Tom, facing about, when we both
fired with evident effect, for we could see the savages rushing
back instead of pursuing, well knowing that we had two more
muskets amongst us. In consequence of having so frequently
gone out on hunting excursions, we all knew the road well. In
some places it was rather winding, and we were afraid that the
blacks, by cutting off angles, might get on our flanks. However,
that could not be helped, and we kept our eyes open to be ready
for them at any moment they might appear. Fortunately, Tom's
was merely a flesh wound, and it did not occur to us that the
arrow was poisoned. The wound bled pretty freely, but there
was no time to stop and bind it up. Our pursuers seemed to
think that they might have to pay too dearly for the attempt to
recover us, and we were now allowed to go on without molestation,
we could still hear them, however, shouting in our rear. This
only served to make us increase our speed, until our poor slave
companions, who well knew that they would in all probability be
put to death if we were overtaken—though the people might be
afraid to kill us—were on the point of sinking from fatigue. At
last, finding that Tom appeared to be suffering from loss of blood,
we shouted to Charley and Harry to halt. They were glad enough
to do so, both of them coming to assist me in binding up Tom's
wound.
"I don't think it's anything, and it doesn't hurt me much, if

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
I can keep moving I don't mind," remarked Tom, as we finished
the operation.
As we were all very tired with our run, which must have carried
us six or seven miles, we were proposing to rest, when again we
heard the cries in our rear. This made us jump to our feet and
push on as before. We remembered a spot on some hilly ground,
where the rocks cropped' up in a curious fashion, and Charley
had observed to me at the time that it was very like a fortress.
It was still some miles off, but we determined to make for it as
fast as we could go, and there take up our position. Listening
attentively, we could occasionally catch the sound of our pursuers'
voices coming from a considerable distance, showing that we had
got a good way ahead of them, while the light of the moon enabled
us to see our way. It was very rugged, now up hills, now down
* into valleys, though generally through thick woods, when the dark-
ness rendered our progress still more difficult. All the time we
dreaded lest some of the more nimble of our enemies might,
by cutting across the country, get on our flanks and attack us
with their spears, or send a flight of arrows amongst us from
behind the trees. There was a chance, too, of our meeting with
elephants, which might obstruct the road, or a leopard might
spring out upon us. We were all well aware of the dangers to
be encountered, but no less resolved were we to face them boldly.
Charley and Harry kept calling to me every now and then, to
ascertain that we were keeping up with them. The way in which
we marched encouraged our black companions, and prevented
any of the more faint-hearted among them from deserting. Indeed,
it would have been folly in them had they done so, for they would
to a certainty have been discovered and slaughtered.
At length we reached the hill where we had determined to make
a stand, for we were so knocked up by this time, that we could
not have proceeded further without rest. It was exactly the sort
of place we had expected to find, a collection of rocks forming

A NATURAL FORTRESS REACHED. 237
almost a circle, somewhat resembling the remains of Druidical
temples in England. The space where there was no rock was
occupied by trees, which would serve as shelter should we be
surrounded. We hurried in among the rocks. Our first care was
to examine the opening, and the spot where each of us should
stand, and then to place our black allies between us. This done,
we looked about to try and discover any broken pieces of timber
or loose rock, with which we might still further fortify our position.
Neither Sanga Tanga nor Ombay were likely to be thirsting for
our blood—whatever some of their people might do, whose friends
we had killed—their object being rather to recover us and keep
us in slavery, to answer their purpose of frightening their enemies,
by the idea that having white men among them they were in-
vincible. Should we, therefore, be able to make a bold stand, we
hoped to sicken them of the attempt to recover us.
"Reserve your fire lads," cried Charley, " don't pull a trigger
until you are certain of your man. If we can manage to knock
over half a dozen or so, before they get close up to our fortifica-
tion, the rest will probably run away and give up the pursuit."
We were still engaged in stopping up gaps here and there,
when we caught sight through the gloom, for day had not yet
broken, of a dozen or more dark figures at the foot of the hill.
They were apparently looking about to ascertain what had
become of us. They seemed to suspect where we were, but
were still uncertain. Some then went on ahead to see if we had
gone in that direction, while the rest remained where we first
discovered them. We might have shot four of the first party,
as they were full in our view; but Charley told us in a whisper
to refrain from firing, as they were not actually attacking us, and
might, it was possible, be peaceably disposed. We could see
them clearly enough in the open, although they could not
perceive us, sheltered as we were, by the rocks and brushwood.
The sky was now becoming brighter towards the east, and in a

short time the sun would rise, and we should probably be seen.
Just then the men who had gone on returned, and shouting to
their companions told them that we were not ahead. Others
were also coming up from the southward, we could count nearly
fifty of them, while further reinforcements could be perceived in
the distance. It was evident that they were resolved on an
attack. Bending their bows, they sent a flight of arrows against
the rock. We received it with a well-directed fire, which killed
four of our opponents, whom we saw tumbling down the hill.
This checked the advance, but others who had hitherto been in
the rear, pushed on with loud shouts and cries, urging on the
van to a renewed attack. We had quickly reloaded behind the
rock, and waiting until another flight of arrows had been harm-
lessly showered on it, we jumped up, and again we all fired
together with the same effect as before. Without stopping to
see who was killed, our enemies rushed pell mell down the hill,
tumbling over each other, while the more prudent ones, who
had kept in the rear, also turned and took to flight.
"Give them another volley," cried Charley; and having
again reloaded, we fired into the retreating masses. It had the
desired effect of expediting their flight. Away they went howling
and shrieking, and we, our own blacks joining us, uttered a loud
shout of triumph.
"They'll not come back again," said Charley, who had been
watching them from the top of the rock. "I don't believe
Sanga Tanga or his precious son are with them, and although
he may despatch them again when they get back to the village,
it will be a hard matter for them to overtake us. We must have
some breakfast and a couple of hours' rest, and then make our
way onwards, until we can find another secure place for a
camp."
We had brought some provisions I should have said, and not
far off was a stream of water issuing from the hill Having

WE CONTINUE OUR FLIGHT.

despatched our meal, three of us lay down, with all the blacks
except Aboh, who undertook to keep watch with me for a
portion of the time. I was then to call up Harry, who was to be
succeeded by Charley. We agreed that Tom, who was suffering
from his wound, should be allowed the full period to rest.
Shimbo was to succeed his brother, for we did not wish to trust
any of the other blacks. The moment my watch was over, and
Harry had taken my place, I was fast asleep. No one came
near us, and at the time agreed on we recommenced our march.
Our chief anxiety now was about Tom's wound. The poison,
if poison there had been, we hoped had been scraped off by the
arrow going through his clothes, while the blood which flowed
from the wound yet further prevented any dangerous effects.
We had gone on for some hours, when having got beyond king
Sanga Tanga's country, we came in sight of a village. We could
not tell whether the inhabitants might prove friendly. Not to
run any risk, we turned off to the right through a thick part of
the forest, until we reached a small open space. Here we
determined to wait until dark before passing the village. The
provisions we had brought with us were nearly exhausted, but
we had sufficient for another meal, and we hoped to be able to
provide for the next day by our guns, when we should be at such
a distance from human habitations that we might kill some
game without the fear of the report of our firearms being
heard.
The rest was very acceptable. It enabled Tom, especially, to
regain some of the strength he had lost . As soon as we calcu-
lated that the people in the village would be asleep, we decided
again to make our way onward. The moon gave us sufficient
light to discover the path, and also guide us in the right direc-
tion. Next morning Charley fortunately killed a deer, which
gave us an abundant supply of food for that day, while our
native allies found a number of berries and other fruits. As

they ate them readily, we gladly followed their example, for a
meat diet, especially under the burning sun of Africa, is far from
satisfactory. Thus for several days we went on, occasionally
seeing natives, but keeping out of their sight, and avoiding the
villages in which we were more likely to find enemies than
friends. We were mounting a high hill, when Harry, who had
just reached the top, cried out—
"Hurrah, there's a river, I caught sight of the bright stream
between the trees."
We hurried forward, and could see here and there among the
dark foliage the glitter of water in little patches, which extended
a considerable distance to the westward. We had great hopes
that this really was a river by which we might reach the sea. The
scene was a beautiful one. Although the country was chiefly
occupied by forests, there were open spaces visible, looking like
green meadows, and to the right, downs which reminded us of our
own dear England. While we were gazing at it a herd of graceful
deer bounded across one of the nearest meadows. In another
open space I could see a couple of elephants plucking the leaves
with their huge trunks from the trees, and a small baby elephant
frolicking near them. As far as we could ascertain, there were no
human habitations, but they might be concealed by the forest, and
the distance to the river, where villages were likely to be found,
was considerable. Our great object now was to secure two or
three canoes, in which we might make our way down the river to
the sea. We were, we calculated, a couple of hundred miles at
least from the mouth, and with the windings the stream probably
took it might be half as much again, still, as we should have the
current with us, the navigation might be easily performed. Our chief
danger of interruption would arise from the inhabitants of any of
the villages on the banks, who might take it into their heads to
stop us. However, we hoped by running past these at night, we
might avoid them without having to fight our way.

ENCOUNTER AN UGLY CHIEF.
24I
Ten days had passed since leaving Sanga Tanga's village. Our
shoes and clothing were, as may be supposed, in a slightly dilapi-
dated condition, but we were all in good health, and Tom had re-
covered from his wound. On descending the hill, we made our
way through the forest towards the nearest point where we saw
water. We had still some beads and trinkets left, and we hoped,
should we meet any natives to purchase canoes from them. If
not we agreed to try and build them, as Aboh told us that he and
his companions were well able to do so. We were in high spirits
at the thought of so soon terminating our journey, forgetting that
months might elapse after we reached the coast before a vessel
made her appearance.
We were pushing eagerly on through the forest, with less caution
than usual, when we came suddenly upon a large body of armed
blacks, who were out evidently on a hunting expedition. Among
them was a chief who, by his dress, we saw was a person of import-
ance. It would have been useless to have attempted to escape
them, so, telling our blacks to keep behind us, with the exception
of Aboh, who came as interpreter, we all advanced towards the
chief. Neither Quagomolo or Sanga Tanga were beauties, but
this fellow was about the ugliest black we had yet come across,
with a most savage expression of countenance. He was very tall
and big, with a wonderful muscular development. He inquired
who we were, where we had come from, and whither we were
going. Harry, who always acted as spokesman, replied that we
had been shipwrecked, and were travelling through the country
towards the mouth of the river, where we expected to find a ship
to carry us back to England. We wished to be friends, and begged
him to assist us with .canoes, as we desired to prosecute our journey
without delay."
Whether or not he understood what Harry said was uncertain.
He uttered a loud hoarse laugh, as if he thought that it was a
very good joke. We waited some time for a further reply, but
Q

the savage did not deign to say anything. At last he exclaimed
in a harsh voice, "You must come along with me."
'' We must have some guarantee that our liberty is not inter-
fered with if we do that," said Harry.
I do not remember the exact terms Harry used to express him-
self, but the savage only grinned.
"We must keep clear of this fellow," said Charley; "fall back
on our men, he intends mischief."
Before, however, we had time to follow his advice, the savage,
springing on him, wrenched his gun out of his hand, while the
black fellows pressing round us prevented us from using our
weapons. Aboh, Shimbo, and the other blacks, seeing that we were
overcome, were about to take to flight, but they were immediately
surrounded by a large body of enemies, our whole party thus being
made prisoners. We were at once hurried unceremoniously along
until we reached a large village not far from the bank of the river,
which we could see flowing tantalisingly by us. We had no time
to exchange remarks with each other, or to speculate as to what
was to be our fate. At first we fancied that the ugly black was
the king of the place, but this we soon discovered was not the
case, for, as we were dragged up the main street, we saw issuing
from a house of more pretentions than its neighbours another
black wearing a red regimental coat on his back with huge epaulets,
and a round hat, battered and otherwise the worse for wear, on
his head, the insignia of royalty, as we well knew.
Our captor made a speech and described to the king how he
had taken us prisoners.
"Him tell big lie," whispered Aboh, who stood near me.
"Him say great fight, we run 'way, him kill us."
"What's the fellow's name?" I asked, meaning that of our first
captor.
"Him callee Mundungo."
"And the King?"

SHUT UP IN PRISON.
243
"Him King Kickubaroo."
His majesty seemed perfectly satisfied with his general's state-
ment. It tickled his vanity that his forces should have con-
quered four white men and an army of blacks, as was the
description given of our attendants. In vain Harry tried to
explain who we were, and how the affair had happened. The
general, on hearing him speak, began vociferating so loudly as to
drown his voice. All the efforts we made were fruitless. The
louder Harry spoke, the louder Mundungo and his followers
shouted. At last the king issued an order, and we were once
more surrounded by guards and marched away to a house
on the other side of the square, into which we were uncere-
moniously thrust.
"I wonder what these fellows are going to do with us," said
Tom. "1 say, old fellow," he exclaimed, "give me back that
rifle," and he made a spring at one of the men who had pos-
session of his weapon, and snatched it out of his hands. "Tell
them that they are fetiches, Mr. Harry," cried Tom, "they'll not
dare to keep them."
Harry shouted out as advised, and we made a simultaneous
dash at the men who had possession of our guns. So unexpected
was our onslaught, that we were enabled to wrench them from
their hands. Before they could regain them we had sprung
back into the house. Though the guns were all loaded, they
fortunately did not go off in the struggle. From the easy way
in which they delivered them up it was very evident they were
not acquainted with their use.
"Shall we attempt to fight our way out and reach the river?"
exclaimed Charley; "perhaps we may find a canoe there. Before
these fellows have recovered from their astonishment we may be
able to get beyond their reach."
"No, no!" cried Harry; "we should to a certainty lose our
lives, though we might kill a few of them, and very probably, on

reaching the river, we should find no canoe, when we should
have to yield at discretion. Since we have recovered our
weapons, it will be wiser to remain quiet, and watch for a favour-
able opportunity. Something or other may turn up, or when
the people are off their guard, we can steal away as we did from
Sanga Tanga's village."
Charley saw the soundness of Harry's advice. We therefore,
without making further demonstration, allowed the door to be
closed on us. By this time the people outside were shouting and
howling and rejoicing over the mighty victory they had gained.
"I am sure we acted for the best," said Harry, when we found
ourselves alone. "Probably the ugly fellow in the round hat
will find out soon that there is no use in keeping us prisoners,
and will let us go."
"Can't say I agree with you quite," observed Tom. "I
don't trust these niggers. They may take it into their heads to
cut off ours, or offer us up before one of their abominable
fetich gods. The sooner we can get away the better."
Aboh, who had been shut up with us, looked very much cast
down, and he seemed fully to agree in the fears expressed by
Tom. The hut consisted of a single room about twelve feet
square, without windows, the light being let in through openings
between the walls and the eaves. This served also the purpose
of ventilation. There was no furniture, not even a mat, and the
floor was anything but clean. As we were tired, we were anxious
to lie down, but hesitated to stretch ourselves on the dirty
earthen floor. On looking round the room, we, however, dis-
covered two pieces of board, or rather what are called shingles,
being portions of a log of wood split by a wedge. Using these as
spades, we managed, with considerable trouble, to scrape a space
clear of dirt, of sufficient size to enable us all to sit on the
ground. We were going to place our backs against the wall, but
Aboh warned us that some ill-disposed fellow might thrust his

VISIT FROM THE KING.
245
spear through it, and that it would be much safer to take up a
position near the centre. Our knapsacks had not been taken
away, as our captors possibly suspected that they were part of
ourselves; fortunately within them we had stored the remainder
of the deer and several birds we had shot the previous days, and
which we had cooked for breakfast; we therefore had abund-
ance of food. This was indeed providential, for no provisions
were brought us; we had also enough water in our leathern
bottles to quench our thirst. We waited until it was dark before
we attacked our meal, that the natives might not discover that
we had eaten, and would give us credit for a wonderful power of
endurance. By economising the food we were able to save
enough for breakfast the next morning. At last we lay down to
sleep, keeping our rifles by our sides ready for use. We all
resolved that should we be attacked to fight to the last. To
avoid being surprised, one of us, as usual, kept awake as if we
were in camp. Until a late hour we heard the people outside
shouting and making a great noise, for a dance was being given
in honour of the victory obtained over us.
We were left alone during the whole night, and as soon as it
was daylight we sat up and ate the remainder of our food,
waiting for anything that might occur. It was past noon when
the door opened, and the king appeared.
"Are you hungry?" he asked, with a grin on his countenance,
for he expected to find that we were starving.
"Not particularly," answered Harry. "We should not object
to a dish of plantains, or some goat's milk, if you will be good
enough to send them to us."
- "You are wonderful men, you don't look as if you could easily
be exhausted," observed the king. "My general Mundungo must
be a brave warrior to have overcome you."
"He's a big knave, at all events," answered Harry. "But
that's not to the point at present, what we want now are some
plantains and milk, or venison."


## p. 246 (#356) ############################################

246
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
I don't mean to say that Harry used these exact words, but
with the aid of Aboh he thus signified our wishes.
After some further conversation, the object for which the king
had come being gained, he left us again to ourselves.
It was not until near evening that the door opened, and two
damsels appeared with baskets on their heads. They placed
them on the ground before us, when, much to our satisfaction,
we discovered a quantity of plantains, some roast venison, and
yams, and also a couple of large gourds, the one containing
goat's milk, the other water.
"We are much obliged to you for bringing these," said
Harry. "And who may I ask, sent them."
"A friend," answered one of the girls. "But we were for-
bidden to tell you who she is. Eat and be satisfied." On this,
the girls evidently acting as they had been directed, left the hut,
and the-door was immediately closed.
"I thought, when I saw the baskets, some young woman
must have sent the food," observed Tom. "They're alike
all the world over, to my mind, the same sort of heart beats
inside a black skin as a white one. Things don't look so bad
after all."
We had provisions enough to last us—if they would keep
good—for several days. We agreed to husband them, not
knowing when more might be brought us. To prevent any
creatures getting into them, we hung them up to the rafters of
the roof. Next day we were left entirely alone. We were, as
may be supposed, getting impatient, and had good reason to
dread what might next happen. Observing the light coming
through under the roof, we concluded that we might get a look
through the opening, to see what was going forward outside.
Towards the back, and one of the sides, the walls of other
houses prevented us obtaining any view, but on the other we
found that we could look right down the street.

CAPTAIN RODERICK APPEARS.
247
I must pass over several days, during which we were kept in
confinement. Only once in three days was any food brought us,
our benefactor, or benefactress, who sent it, probably not
having opportunities for doing so oftener. We could gain no
information from the slaves who brought the baskets, nor could
we learn anything from the people who were occasionally sent in
to clean out our hut . We were now growing very anxious—more-
over, our health was suffering. All sort of dreadful ideas occurred
to us, and we fancied that the king was reserving us for some great
festival, when he might, as Tom had suggested—sacrifice us to
his fetich gods. At last we agreed that, to save ourselves from
a worse fate, we would run the risk of breaking out, and fighting
our way down to the river.
We had been imprisoned for nearly a month, and had settled
one evening, that the very next night we would make the
attempt. The following day we expected to receive our usual
supply of provisions, which we intended to carry with us. Early
next morning, as the first gleam of light stole into the room, I
climbed up as usual to have a look out, and ascertain whether
anything was occurring in the village, when, what was my surprise
to see a white man with a gun on his shoulder, and holding by a
chain in his left hand a bull dog. Another glance at the dog,
and I recognised him as Growler, while the man bore a strong
resemblance to Captain Roderick. He had then escaped with
his life. I could scarcely suppose that, bad as he was, he would
refuse to assist in setting us free. He was evidently at liberty
himself, or he would not have walked along in the independent
manner he was doing. Guessing that Growler would recognise
me, I whistled. The dog immediately pricked up his ears, and
began to look about him. Captain Roderick started.
"What is it, Growler," I heard him ask.
I again whistled, and called to my companions. They started
to their feet.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"Captain Roderick," I shouted out, "will you assist some
of your countrymen in getting away from these black fellows who
have imprisoned them?"
"Who is that who calls me by my name?" asked the captain
in a tone of astonishment, looking up to the place from which
my voice proceeded, although he could not distinguish my
features under the eaves of the house. Coming to the door, he
without further ceremony withdrew the bars which secured it.
"Who are you?" he exclaimed, with a look of astonishment,
as he saw us ready to rush out.
"Don't you remember us, Captain Roderick?" I asked. "I
don't wish to claim it as a merit, but we set you at liberty when
your ship was wrecked, and enabled you to save your life."
"I wish that I had lost it," answered the captain with a
gloomy look.
"Perhaps you may live to be thankful it was preserved. At
all events, we acted desiring to do you a good service, and all
we beg is, that if you have the power you will assist us in making
our escape from this village, in which for some reason the king
seems inclined to keep us prisoners. Why he does so I cannot
ascertain."
"I can solve the mystery then," he answered; "I confess that
I have been the cause of your detention. I have been living
with the chief almost ever since I got on shore, having made my
way up here immediately, and I am in high favour with him. Two
rascals, former followers of mine, while I was out hunting came
to the village—intending to remain here, I conclude—but finding
by some chance that I had made it my headquarters, they bolted.
As I had no wish to have them prying into my proceedings, I
charged the king to keep them until my return, as I was on the
point of starting up the country on a trading expedition.
"That of course accounts for our being kept here," exclaimed
Charley.

PROSPECT OF DELIVERY. 249
From the description of the men given by Captain Roderick
we had no doubt that they were the two pirates who had escaped
when we were recaptured.
"Now, Captain Roderick," said Charley, " if you will facilitate
our return to the coast, we will report favourably of the service
you have rendered us, and it may be of some use to you should
you ever wish to go back to England and any accusation be
brought against you."
"As to that, sir, I have no intention of ever returning to my
native land," answered the captain in a gloomy tone, but as I
have no grudge against you, I will help you to make your escape,
although the rascal who calls himself king here is an eccentric
character, and it may not be so easy as you suppose. He gets
drunk for six days in the week whenever palm wine is to be
procured, and the seventh amuses himself by cutting off the heads
of his faithful subjects and playing other vagaries. Still I have
taught him to respect me, and as I have been the means of sup-
plying his treasury, I do not doubt but that he will be ready to do
what I ask him in the hopes of retaining my services. I now
intend, if he is not too drunk, to rouse him up and tell him to
supply you with a better house, and ample food, and a supply of
water that you may wash yourselves, for you look remarkably
dirty."
This I have no doubt we did. Charley thanked the captain in
the name of us all. Captain Roderick then told us to remain in
the prison while he went on to the king and obtained our release
in a formal manner; it would be better, he said, than running the
risk of offending the king, who would probably be displeased
should we walk out without his permission.
We accordingly returned and sat ourselves down to wait the
arrival of the pirate captain and the king's officers. Strange to
say, all this time Captain Roderick had not recognised Harry,
nor had he me as the clerk who had overheard the accusation

brought against him by Captain Magor. Perhaps had he done
so his conduct might have been different. We were all getting very
hungry, having eaten nothing since noon the previous day; we were
also becoming more and more impatient, when we heard foot-
steps approaching, and Captain Roderick, accompanied by the
king himself and several of his attendants, opened the door. The
king made a speech, intending, as we supposed, to apologise to us.
He then led the way to another house, far superior to the hut we
had occupied. It was clean and airy, with a veranda in front and
a garden full of fruit trees and vegetables behind. Shortly after-
wards an ample supply of all sorts of provisions was brought to
us, and what we valued in no less degree, some huge bowls of
water. I shall not forget in a hurry the satisfaction of washing,
though we each of us had only a pocket handkerchief with which
to dry ourselves, and that none of the cleanest.
After breakfast, we summoned the slaves who had brought
us the water to procure a further supply, in which we
washed our under garments, hanging them up afterwards to
dry in the garden. This they did in a very few minutes,
for the sun in that latitude does its work with marvellous
rapidity.
In consequence of meeting with Captain Roderick we
abandoned our idea of attempting to get off by stealth,
thinking that it would be wiser to take our departure openly
with the leave of the king. We had not been long in the
house when Captain Roderick, accompanied as he always was
by Growler, came to see us and advised that we should remain
indoors. "I have a rival here in that ugly rascal Mundungo. He
is jealous of the favour shown to me by the king, to whom I have
recounted the true history of your capture, and I told his majesty
that, instead of being taken after a tremendous fight, you were sur-
prised and surrounded before you had time to defend yourselves.
Mundungo has found that I have told the king the truth, and he

MUNDUNGO DEFEATED.
251
is exceedingly indignant, although he is too much afraid of me to
say anything. He will not, however, scruple to injure you if he
has the opportunity."
While he was speaking, Mundungo himself appeared, his
countenance exhibiting the hatred which raged in his bosom.
"Beware what you are about," he exclaimed. "You have
attempted to malign me to the king. Remember I possess the
most powerful fetich in the world."
"A fig for your fetich !" exclaimed the captain, drawing his
huge dagger. "I possess a more potent fetich than you do.
Look at that, and then look at this animal. What do you think
of him? In two minutes, if I were to tell him, he would tear
you limb from limb, and your wretched fetich could not
help you. Now go and talk to your silly countrymen about
your fetich, but don't come and attempt to impose such non-
sense on me," and the captain turned aside with a haughty
air.
Mundungo was defeated. Muttering and growling he walked
away along the street towards his own residence. The captain
set up a loud laugh in which we could not help joining, while
Growler uttered one of his terrific barks, which made the brave
general take to his heels and scamper away as hard as he
could go.
Captain Roderick again burst into a loud laugh. "I have
settled the fellow for the present, but depend upon it, if he can
he will do you and me harm, we must guard against that. I have
hitherto, since I came among these people, kept the upper-hand,
partly by my independent bearing, and partly owing to the fears
they entertain of Growler; who, on several occasions, has given
me timely warning when Mundungo and his supporters have
attempted to murder me, which they have still a strong desire to
do. Although I have obtained your liberty, I cannot answer for
your safety. If they fail to shoot you with'their arrows, or to

spear you, they may try the effects of poison, and against that
you must be specially on your guard. Fortunately, they are no
great adepts in the art, but it will be safer to take only such
food as it cannot be mixed with, such as eggs, birds, and plan-
tains, and fruit, and joints of meat."
We thanked Captain Roderick for his advice, which we pro-
mised to follow as long as we remained in the place.
"But," continued Charley, " as you may suppose, we are very
anxious to get away as soon as possible. We believe that if we
could obtain a good-sized canoe, we could easily navigate her
down the river."
"You may depend upon it, gentlemen, that I will do what
I can to persuade the king to allow you to go, and I have no
wish to have any one interfering with my proceedings here,
which you probably might be tempted to do were you to
remain."
"But we have no wish to interfere with you, Captain Roderick,"
said Charley; "we are grateful for the service you have already
rendered us, and should be very glad if you would accompany
us down the river, for I am very sure you will soon get tired of
living among these savages."
"I shall never return to civilised life, at all events in my own
land," answered Captain Roderick gloomily. "Do not mention
the subject to me again. I will help you more on my own
account than on yours, for I would rather be alone with these
black fellows than herding with white men. Let me advise you
to remain in your hou;.e at present, until I have time to talk with
the king, who is at present too drunk to understand me. I can-
not promise that you will immediately obtain leave to go, or be
furnished with a canoe for the purpose, but it will not be my
fault if, in the meantime, you are not well treated."
As we agreed that it would be wise to follow the pirate's advice,
we re-entered our house, intending to remain there until sum-

moned by him to pay our respects to the king, when his majesty
had recovered sufficiently to give us an audience. Behind the
house was a garden of sufficient size to enable us to enjoy some
fresh air under the trees without the risk of being molested by
the natives.

"\ T 7"E had now been six months in Africa, and, wonderful to
V V relate, none of us had been ill or even hurt, with the
exception of Tom. We, however, often felt sad, not on our own
account, but on that of the loved ones at home, who, we knew,
would be suffering intense anxiety about us, even if they did not
suppose that we had lost our lives. As Tom remarked, we knew
very well where we were and what we hoped to be able to do, but
those at home knew nothing, but that ship after ship arrived and
no tidings of us reached them.1
A thick, black wall, as it were, intervened between them and
us, through which their loving eyes could not penetrate. How we
longed for some bird of rapid wing to carry home a message for
us.
Captain Roderick did not come near us for the remain cer

the day. The following morning, however, he appeared, saying
that the king would not hear of our going away, as he wanted to
employ us for elephant hunting, under the belief that with our
rifles we should obtain a far greater number of tusks than could
his own people.
"You will be well fed, and as the sport is highly exciting, I
don't think you have any cause to complain," said the Captain.
"That may depend upon circumstances," observed Charley.
"When are we to set out?"
"To-morrow, or perhaps the next day; as soon as the hunters
are ready. They only returned from an expedition a few days ago
and require time to rest."
While the Captain was speaking, I saw him eyeing Harry and
me in a far more searching manner than he had done before.
Suddenly he asked me my name. I told him without hesitation,
—indeed, I supposed all along that he must have known it . He
then turned to Harry, and I saw his countenance change as Harry
replied, "My name is Bracewell."
The Captain started as Harry spoke, and as he looked at him
a frown gathered on his brow.
"I might have known you before, but your dress and sunburnt
countenances deceived me. When I first saw you on board the

"Captain Roderick, let bygones be bygones!" exclaimed
Charley, who had heard from me all that had happened in England
between Captain Roderick and my friend—" Do not let us refer
to the past. Here we are, five Englishmen together among savages
If we quarrel our destruction is certain. We can help you and
you can help us."
The captain's features resumed their usual look, showing that
he was somewhat moved by this address.
"I have no quarrel with any of you, and have already shown
you my readiness to render you assistance. I have told you that

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
I will exert my influence with the king to procure your release, and
I intend to keep my promise."
Captain Roderick did not long remain with us; he went away,
as he said, to have a talk with the king.
"My idea is, that that fellow wants us to stop and hunt for him,"
observed Charley. "Depend upon it he would take possession
of the tusks of the elephants we killed. It may be wise in us,
however, to do so for the sake of procuring our liberty."
"He has got a hand over us at present, and as we cannot help
ourselves, we had better make the best of a bad job," observed
Tom.
Accordingly, the next morning, when we saw a number of people
collecting in the square, armed for the chase, we agreed that, if
invited, we would accompany them without showing any objection.
We had just taken our breakfast, when we saw a young man ap-
proaching, who by the ornaments he wore on his arms and ankles,
the chain round his neck, and the circlet of feathers on his head,
we knew to be a person of consequence.
"Why, I believe he's no other than the young fellow who
married Miss Iguma," said Tom; "and if so, he ought to help us,
for if it hadn't been for you, Mr. Westerton, the young lady
would have lost her life."
Prince Kendo at once knew us, indeed, I suspect he was well
aware of our being in the village, but had kept out of the way,
supposing that we were enemies of Captain Roderick's, and not
wishing to offend him. He now, however, came forward in a
friendly manner, and invited us to accompany him on the hunting
expedition of which he was to be the leader.
As agreed, we accepted it and joined his party of about fifty
men. Soon after leaving the village a couple of hundred more,
coming from various quarters, united with us, until we formed
quite a little army. We marched along for a whole day, however,
without seeing any elephants, although we came upon smaller

ELEPHANT HUNTING.
257
game, of which, for the sake of the meat, we killed several. Charley
was fortunate enough to knock over a buffalo, and Harry and I
each killed a deer. Tom shot two hogs—curious-looking creatures,
the most active of the pig species. Those which made their
escape leapt over the trunks of trees several feet high, and a
stream five or six yards broad. They were enormous creatures,
having red bodies and white faces, on which were several lumps
between the nose and the eyes, which latter were surrounded by
long bristles, while their ears were exceedingly long, having at
their tips tufts of coarse hair. We knocked over several monkeys,
and a huge ape, just as it was about to strike a man who had
approached and had had his spear snatched out of his hand.
Prince Kendo complimented us, and evidently looked upon
us as great hunters. After encamping for the night, as was
usual, we again set out, and just as we reached the edge of the
forest, beyond which was a plain, we caught sight of a huge
elephant standing by himself, while he kept flapping his ears
and whisking round his tail. As we watched him the trees
around him looked like mere shrubs, so vast was his size.
Charley insisted on shooting him. K^ndo, as he looked at the
animal, whispered that he was afraid that he would make for the
open plain should his own men attempt to kill him. On this
Charley volunteered to shoot the huge creature. I felt very
anxious about it, but he said that he was confident, unless his
rifle failed him, that he should kill the beast. Having ascertained
the way the wind was blowing, we made a slight round so as
to get to leeward. We got behind some trees, while Charley,
imitating the native way of approaching the enormous creatures,
stooped down among the grass, and began to creep up slowly
towards the elephant, keeping himself entirely concealed, while
only occasionally could we get a glimpse of him to assure us
that he was moving on. I regretted that I had not insisted on
accompanying him, to fire in case he should miss, though he

himself had no apprehensions on that score. For several
minutes we could perceive no motion in the long grass. Not a
word was spoken. No sound came from any part of the forest,
except that we fancied we could hear the flapping of the ele-
phant's ears. For a few seconds even that ceased, and then
there came a sharp report, ringing through the forest and across
the plain. I dashed forward and saw the elephant raise its
trunk in the air, and move on as if about to destroy its enemy,
but the instant afterwards the trunk dropped, the huge animal
staggered, and down it came with a crash on the shrubs and
rotten wood beneath the trees. Charley started up scarcely three
yards from where the creature fell. Numbers of monkeys and
birds shrieking and screaming clambered chattering away amid
the branches, or flew off across the plain at the report of
Charley's rifle, while the blacks came rushing forward, shouting
and congratulating him and us on the success of his shot . Never
had they seen an animal brought down so suddenly. This was
the first elephant we had killed on the expedition. Charley
killed two others from the ground, while Harry and I each shot
one while we were perched on a tree, a far safer, if not so honour-
able a position. All the natives together had, in the meantime,
only killed three, by piercing them with their spears, and they
had lost two men crushed by the monsters' feet. Altogether,
Kendo acknowledged that it was the most successful hunting
expedition he had ever engaged in, while our success raised us
greatly in the estimation of the blacks, but also made them more
anxious than ever to retain us. We were well aware of this, and
came to the conclusion that if we were to get away, it must be by
stealth, as we had escaped from the other savages. On ap-
proaching the village, we were met by some women howling and
wailing, and on inquiring the reason, we were informed that
queen Hugga Mugga, the favourite wife of the king, was
desperately ill, and had been bewitched, and that the king had

THE CAPTAIN WARNS US.
259
sent for a learned sorcerer to discover the guilty persons. On
inquiring for Captain Roderick we found also that he, during our
absence, had been away. We saw him, however, coming along
the street. Charley and I went out to meet him, advising Harry
to keep in the house. He appeared to be in a very different
humour to that in which we had before seen him. He appeared
greatly out of spirits. Seating himself in our veranda, without
attempting to enter the house, he turned to Charley.
"You have been more successful even than I expected," he
said, "and I have to compliment you on your skilful hunting.
You might remain out here and make your fortunes in a very
short time, but I suspect that your lives would not be safe in this
place. You have already excited the jealousy and hatred of
Mundungo, and he is, I have discovered, a friend or relative
of the fetich doctor who has been sent for, and will probably
accuse you of causing, by your incantations, the illness of
Kickubaroo's wife. Come here," and he approached a palm
tree which grew on one side of the house, from which he cut a
long branch. "If I ascertain that you are in danger, I will find
means to send you a similar branch to this, in the basket with
your provisions, in which case do not leave the house until
nightfall, then, as soon as the people have gone to their houses,
and are asleep, make your way directly to the bank of the river,
where I will cause two canoes to be prepared with paddles and
food in them. Embark at once, and make your way down the
stream. You must not ask why I did not long ago follow the
course I advise you to take."
I was struck by the man's melancholy countenance and the
mournful tone in which he spoke, so different to his usual over-
bearing confident language.
Charley and I expressed our thanks, feeling more pity for him
than we had ever done before. Keeping the palm branch in his
hand, he resumed his seat in the veranda, then turning to me
he said—


## p. 260 (#374) ############################################

26o
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"If you ever reach home, tell my brother that you met me,
and that I asked his forgiveness for my conduct towards him.
I do not suppose that he will withhold it, when he knows that I
intend never again to resume my former mode of life. I wish
I could feel as certain that all my sins are forgiven."
I pointed out to him the only way by which man's sins can
be forgiven. He turned his head from me, and said abruptly to
Charley—
"You must be surprised at the change you perceive has come
over me."
"For some reasons I am glad of it," answered Charley,
"although I hope it is not because you feel yourself suffering
from illness."
"No," answered Captain Roderick, "I am as well as ever, still
I believe that my clays are numbered. My enemies here have
succeeded in destroying my faithful dog Growler. While you
were away I missed him while out shooting, and after some time
he crawled back to me with a poisoned arrow sticking in his ribs.
I drew it out, hoping that the flow of blood would prevent the
poison taking effect. In less than ten minutes he was seized
with violent convulsions, between the paroxysms of which he
endeavoured to lick my hand, and gasped out his last breath in
the attempt. He was the only friend I ever had in the world in
whom I could truly trust."
After sitting some time, Captain Roderick took up his gun and
hat, which he had placed by his side while enjoying the shade of
the veranda, and proceeded towards the house he inhabited, close
to that occupied by the king. Going in we told Harry what
Captain Roderick had said.
"He exhibits very little true remorse and sorrow for his mis-
deeds," said Harry; "like many men with fierce, ill regulated
minds, he is overcome with superstitious fears, and probably his
present temper will not last very long. I only hope he will give

TWO OLD ACQUAINTANCES APPEAR. 261
us warning in due time, and enable us to make our escape, we
shall then have good reason to thank him."
We were now expecting the arrival of the witch doctor, who,
however, we discovered lived at a considerable distance, and
might not make his appearance for two or three days. We
scarcely supposed, however, that he would accuse us of bewitching
the queen. We felt, indeed, rather a curiosity to see how he
would proceed, than any fear of bad consequences to ourselves.
Soon after Captain Roderick's visit, Prince Kendo appeared,
and invited us to accompany him that evening on another shooting
expedition. Some elephants, he said, had been seen a short dis-
tance off up the river, and as there was plenty of the food they liked
thereabouts they would not probably have gone away. As we
were glad of something to do, we accepted the offer, and all four
of us, with Aboh and Shimbo, set out with the party the prince
had already collected, and who were waiting at the outskirts of
the village. It was too dark, however, by the time we reached the
part of the forest where the elephants had been seen to go in search
of them. We therefore encamped, and lighted a fire to cook the
provisions we had brought with us. Soon after we had begun
supper, two figures appeared from amidst the brushwood surround-
ing the open spot we had selected for our camp. The gleam of
the fire fell upon them. We saw by their dress and faces that
they were white men. Their haggard countenances showed that
they were suffering from hunger. Tom Tubbs, who had started
to his feet, advanced a few paces towards them—
"Why, as I live," he exclaimed, "I think I know you fellows."
"Like enough you do, mate," answered one of the men, "like
enough you do, but before you have any palaver, just hand us
out some of that grub, and a drink of water or anything stronger
if you've got it, for we are well-nigh famished."
"So you look," said Tom; "sit down, the gentlemen here will
be glad enough to share their provisions with you, so will this

nigger prince, and after that we will hear what you have got to
tell about yourselves."
The men without uttering another word sat down close to the
fire, and eagerly seizing the food we offered them, began munch-
ing away in a style which fully confirmed the account they had
given of their famished state.
Looking at their countenances more narrowly, I at once re-
cognised the two seamen, Caspar Capar and Herman Jansen,
who had escaped during the massacre of the Frenchmen.
The two men exhibited a marked contrast, and it seemed sur-
prising that they should have associated together. Caspar seemed
a good-natured, honest fellow, and as soon as he had satisfied
his hunger, he began to laugh and joke with Tom, and to describe
the adventures they had gone through, while Jansen sat moody
and silent, a frown on his brow, and his looks averted from us.
Even when Tom spoke to him he answered only in monosyllables,
or did not answer at all, holding out the gourd which had been
given him for a further supply of palm wine.
"I shouldn't like to meet that fellow by myself were I unarmed
in a dark place, he looks as if he would attempt to kill a man
merely for the satisfaction of committing murder," whispered
Charley to me; "I wonder he has not before now shot his com-
panion, and I suspect that only the desire of self preservation has
restrained him."
I fully agreed with my brother, and we settled that we would
not allow him to associate with us more than we could help. At
present common humanity demanded that we should give him
food, and such protection as we might be able to afford against
the savages. After eating and drinking as much as he required,
he got up and strolled away from the camp towards the lake, the
shore of which was at no great distance.
We now spoke more freely about him. Harry suggested that
hunger and privation had given him the expression we remarked

JANSEN IN THE SULKS.
263
in his features, and that he might notwithstanding be a useful
addition to our party, and assist us, should we make our escape,
in navigating our canoe down the river.
"What's the matter with your friend?" I asked, turning to
Caspar.
"He's in one of his sulks," was the answer; "he is often like
that, and I have been in fear of my life over and over again, but
I have kept an eye upon him, and generally managed to get hold
of his long sheath knife, and to hide it until he got better again.
Lately he has become worse, and I would have left him had I
been able to do so. My idea is, that he'll do some harm to him-
self, or he will try to kill some one else, and if he had a gun I
should not think any one of us was safe sitting down here."
"Should there be a chance of his injuring himself, it is our duty
to try and prevent him," observed Harry, "we must deprive him
of his weapon, and watch him narrowly. Perhaps after he has
been well-fed for a few days he may recover his temper. I think
it would be as well now to go and watch him, and see that he
doesn't throw himself into the lake."
I agreed with Harry, and both getting up accompanied by
Caspar, we walked on in the direction Jansen had taken.
The moon which had just risen, afforded us light sufficient
to make our way through the forest, which was here not so
thick as in most places. We had gone some little way, when we
reached an open spot or glade close to the lake.
"Stop here," said Caspar, "I think I see him coming along, it
is as well he should not discover us."
We concealed ourselves behind some bushes. We could hear
approaching footsteps, and thought that Jansen, having gone on
some way, had turned back and intended to rejoin us at the
camp. Just then I saw that the figure of the person approaching
was not that of Herman Jansen, but of Captain Roderick. I
concluded that he had followed us intending to treat with Prince

264
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
Kendo for the ivory we had procured, or else that he had come
to warn us of some danger to which we might be exposed, should
we return to the village. I was on the point of stepping out of
our place of concealment to go and meet him, when another
person sprang up from behind a bank where he had been con-
cealed, with a large knife in his hand, and before I could cry out
to warn the captain, the other had plunged the weapon into his
breast. With one piercing cry Captain Roderick fell back, while
his assailant having driven the weapon home, left it sticking in
the wound, and with a howl like a wild beast plunged into the
forest, which immediately hid him from our sight. We all hurried
fonvard, eager to give assistance to the wounded man; Caspar
drew out the knife.
"Yes," he said, " this was Jansen's, he had vowed vengence
against the captain, and we had good reason to hate him, but
this is a foul cowardly deed notwithstanding."
Harry and I meantime lifted up the wounded man; his arms
dropped downwards, not a groan, not a breath escaped him, his
eyes were fixed and staring in death. The weapon had struck
too deeply home for human power to save him. His spirit had
fled. We notwithstanding sent Caspar back to obtain assistance,
that we might carry the body to the camp.
In a short time Caspar returned with Charley and Tom and
several blacks. A litter was formed, and we conveyed him to
the camp. Though we had every reason to dislike the man who
had been the cause of all the hardships and sufferings we were
enduring, yet we felt no animosity towards him, and were horror-
struck at his appalling death. Prince Kendo expressed his
astonishment at the captain's death. What he said was to the
effect that he thought that no human power could injure him,
"but I now see that white men can die like black men," he
observed with a peculiar expression which made us feel that it
would be dangerous to offend the black Prince.

CAPTAIN RODERICK BURIED.

"But it was a white man that killed him, remember that," said
Tom, "the black fellows, from what I hear, tried it very often
but could not succeed."
"Yes, that was the case, but he had a friendly spirit always by
to protect him, but that got killed at last, and so you see his
power departed from him."
The prince alluded to Growler, whose death we thus discovered
was well known, although Captain Roderick had endeavoured to
conceal the fact."
"The sooner we bury the poor fellow the better," observed
Charley. "While he is in their sight the blacks will be thinking
about him, and being reminded how easily a white man is killed,
they may take it into their heads to try and put us out of the
way, and possess themselves of our guns and the contents of our
knapsacks."
We accordingly asked Kendo to allow some of his people to
assist us in digging a grave. Though they at first showed some
indications of fear, yet on Tom suggesting that the spirit of the
dead man would haunt them if they did not, they eagerly set
about the work, and saved us any trouble whatever. At first
they made only a shallow hole, but Tom told them that that would
never do, that it was necessary to bury a white man very far
down in the earth, as they had such potent spirits that they would
otherwise quickly force their way up again. On this they eagerly
recommenced their labours, and managed to dig a grave six feet
deep. We were going to put the body into it, when Tom
advised that we should examine his pockets, and take possession
of any documents or valuables he might have about him. We
found nothing, however, except some ammunition, a knife, and a
tinder box. Not a line or document of any sort to prove his
identity. Had we not witnessed his death, or discovered his
body, no one would have known how he met with his untimely
end. Like many another evil-doer, he would have disappeared
from the face of the earth and left no trace behind him.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
At a late hour we lay down to rest. By Harry's advice, how-
ever, one of us kept awake lest the blacks should attempt to play
us any trick, or, as was very likely, lest they should all go to sleep,
and a leopard steal into the camp and carry some one of us off, or
a troop of elephants come rushing along and trample us under
foot.
Next morning, although we were very unwilling to continue
the hunt, judging it safer to get back to the village and attempt
to make our escape without delay, Prince Kendo insisted that
we should remain, promising that we should have a share of the
tusks of any elephants we might kill.
We thought it wise to make a virtue of necessity, but deter-
mined, should we find a canoe on the banks of the river, to
appropriate it, and without taking leave to make our way down
the stream.
We had not gone far when our ears were saluted by a terrific
roar which seemed to come from the depths of the forest. My
companions looked at each other, wondering what animal could
produce the sound. Roar succeeded roar, and I guessed it must
come from one of the big man apes which I had before encountered.
Charley and Harry, upon my telling them, were both eager to see
the creature, and keeping our guns in readiness we approached the
spot whence the fearful sounds proceeded. The roars were
accompanied by a loud drumming noise, followed by a fierce bark-
like yelp, which, as Harry observed, sounded like the horrible
ravings of a madman. Kendo and several of the other blacks
accompanied us, but kept well in our rear, ready to take to flight
should we fail to kill the beast.
"There he is," exclaimed Charley, "let one fire at a time.
Dick, you fire first, if you miss I'll have a shot at him, and if I
miss, Tom, you must take the next shot, and you, Harry, must be
in reserve. Remember that our lives will depend upon the steadi-
ness of your aim.

ENCOUNTER A MAN APE.
267
These arrangements had just been made when the boughs
were put aside by a pair of long arms, and the next instant a
huge hairy creature, with a hideous countenance, appeared in
sight, advancing slowly into the open; I could distinguish its fierce
eyes glowing at us, the face black and wrinkled, and distorted
with rage, as it came forward balancing its monstrous body with
its long arms, while at every few seconds it stopped and beat its
breast, at the same time throwing back its head to give utterance
to one of its tremendous roars. We might have been excused had
we really taken it for a forest demon, for nothing which the imagi-
nation of man has pictured could be more calculated to inspire
its beholders with awe.
The natives ceased their chattering and drew back. The
creature still advanced, but every now and then stopped to sit
down and roar. One circumstance, however, showed that its
power was limited. Its legs were short and slight, and unable
firmly to sustain its huge body, they tottered beneath its weight.
While it hobbled forward it had a somewhat ridiculous appear-
ance, which made Tom burst into a loud laugh. This seemed to
increase the creature's rage ; unable to spring forward, it sat down
and began to roar and beat its breast. Once more it rose with
the aid of its long arms, and advanced. I waited until it was
about ten yards off, when I fired, half expecting, however, to see
the animal when the smoke cleared off still coming towards us.
I was prepared to spring back tp let Charley fire, when throwing
up its arms down it came with a crash to the ground. The blacks
set up a shout of triumph.
"Take care, sirs, a bite from those big teeth would not be
pleasant," exclaimed Tom, as he saw Harry and me rushing for-
ward.
The creature, however, made no movement, and the blacks
coming up, turned it over without ceremony and thrust the end
of their spears into its eyes to show that it was dead. They then

began singing and dancing around it in triumph, as they would
round the body of a dead human enemy, indeed, even now I
could scarcely persuade myself that the creature had not some-
thing human in it. It was not until very many years afterwards
that I ascertained that this man ape, as I have called it, was what
is now known as the gorilla. When I afterwards described it in
England, no one would believe that it was of the size I have men-
tioned, and I got credit for indulging in travellers' tales.
The natives at once skinned the beast and then cut the body
into pieces, which they afterwards cooked and ate with great gusto.
None of us, however, could persuade ourselves to touch it.
We later in the day killed three elephants, much in the way I
have before described, and early next morning our party, carrying
the skin of the ape and the elephants' tusks, with large quantities
of meat, returned to the village.

IN the course of the morning we reached our house, which we
had left in charge of Shimbo. We had the satisfaction of
finding that none of our knapsacks had been touched. We
invited Caspar to join us, which he, poor fellow, was very glad to
do. Nothing had been seen of Jansen; we supposed that he
had either thrown himself into the river, or been seized by a wild
beast. We were surprised to find that the witch doctor had not
yet arrived, and therefore hoped that something had detained
him, and that by his not coming the people whom he would
accuse of witchcraft, should he appear, might escape death. We
thought that the king might possibly not have heard of the death
of Captain Roderick, and after duly discussing the subject, we
came to the conclusion that it would be wise while the 'king was
still impressed with the belief of his almost superhuman powers,
to request leave to proceed on our journey.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
As it was still early in the day, we hoped to find his majesty
tolerably sober, and capable of listening to reason. We accord-
ingly issued forth from our house with four knapsacks on our
shoulders, and our guns in our hands, Harry and Aboh ready to
act as spokesmen, Charley and I coming next, and Tom and
Caspar with Shimbo bringing up the rear. We found the king
seated in a sort of broad veranda in front of his house, which
served him as an audience chamber. On one side was his fetich
or idol house. At the further end was a huge hideous figure
painted in various colours; with big goggle eyes, and clothed in
robes of matting, and adorned with feathers of various hues.
Numerous other idols were placed against the walls, most of them
bearing but the very faintest resemblance to human figures—big
round eyes, and marks for noses, and grinning mouths, with
teeth set in them, showing for what they were intended. The
king, with his round hat on his head, and his red uniform coat
covering his royal body, was seated on a pile of mats with a
bottle by his side, while one or two empty ones lay outside on
the floor, showing how he had already been spending his morning.
Several of his counsellors and other chief men sat at a little
distance on either side of him, discussing, apparently, affairs
of state.
We waited until there seemed to be a pause, when we advanced
in a bold manner, and Harry began an address, thanking the
king for the hospitality he had shown us, and the opportunities
we had enjoyed of seeing some sport, and adding that now,
having done all the service we could, we were desirous of going
down the river, as we were anxious to get on board one of the
ships of our country, which we expected to find at the mouth of
the stream."
The king rolled his eyes round as Harry spoke, apparently not
understanding a word; he then turned to his courtiers, desiring
them to explain what the white man said.

THE KING DISMISSES HIS MINISTERS. 2JI
This was more than even the most learned of his attendants
could do, for, although they were more sober than their master,
they also had had a pull at the bottles. Fortunately the king did
not appeal to us, but again and again asked them what we
had said. At length starting up he called them all by the most
opprobrious names, insisting that they should interpret, then
seizing a cane, which he probably thought was a sword, he
ordered them to go about their business, bestowing a kick on
the rear of first one, and then on another, sending them all
flying away from him, the commander-in-chief, who maintained
his post to the last, receiving a blow from the monarch's foot as
he endeavoured to leap down the steps, which sent him flying
away some fifty yards, when down he sprawled with his nose in
the dust, kicking up his heels in the air. The king having
accomplished this feat, no longer able to stand, rolled back in
his seat, where he continued kicking out with his legs, shaking
his hands, and blubbering away, exclaiming, "that he could get
no wisdom out of his counsellors, who were a useless, lazy set."
He then looking up, inquired in husky tones "What we
wanted?"
Harry once more endeavoured to explain our object in com-
ing, but all his efforts were vain to make the king comprehend a
word he said. Aboh then tried, with the same want of success.
The king, who in the meantime had taken a pull at another
bottle, evidently felt no inclination to rise, and comforted himself
by showering abuse on Aboh's head and ours, bestowing upon
him all sorts of opprobrious epithets.
At last, as it was very evident that we could get nothing out of
the monarch, we beat a retreat in as dignified a manner as
possible, and retired to our house, more resolved than ever to
take French leave before many days were over, should we have
the opportunity.
The king's attendants wisely kept out of his way when he was

in his drunken fits, and shut themselves up in their houses, or left
the village, lest he might take a fancy to cut off any of their
heads. We, finding the road open to the river, determined to
make an excursion along the banks in the hope of discovering
some canoes fit for our purpose. Keeping our guns ready for
action, we sauntered along near the river, though we pretended
to take that road merely for the sake of the fresh breeze which
blew off the water. We spied four or five canoes; in none
of them, however, could we see paddles, and without some
such means of propulsion they would be useless. How to
procure the paddles was the difficulty. They were probably in
the houses of the owners, and it was a question whether these
owners would part with the paddles, and whether it would be
safe to enter into a bargain with them, lest they should betray us
to the king.
"To my mind, the best thing we can do, sir, is to make some
paddles for ourselves," observed Tom Tubbs.
"Of course," answered Charley; "we can work away as soon
as it is dark, and have them ready by to-morrow night. Longer
than that we must not stay in this horrible place, we shall have
wood enough for our purpose in the building, by pulling down
part of the rear of our house, where it won't be missed, or from
the trees in our garden, or part of the fencing. We should have
a paddle for each person, as we shall require two or three canoes
to convey all our party."
This matter settled, we were about to return, when we saw a
female at the door of one of the largest houses near the water, at
the end of the village which we had just reached. She appeared
to be beckoning to us; we went forward, and great was our surprise
to find that she was no other than Iguma, the young lady I had
saved from the ape, and whose marriage with Prince Kendo I
had afterwards witnessed. Feeling sure that gratitude would
animate a female bosom, I asked Harry to tell her the difficulty

A FRIEND IN NEED.
273
in which we were placed, and, throwing ourselves on her
generosity, entreat her to assist us in escaping. She seemed
much pleased at seeing us, and at once recognised me, and said
she had not forgotten the service I had done her. We then
informed her how we were situated. She at once said she
would do all she could to help us, but that her power, she was
afraid, was very limited. She complained that her husband was
constantly away on shooting expeditions, and that she held his
drunken uncle, King Kickubaroo, in great awe, and that he
evidently had no affection for her. She told us that we need
have no fear about canoes, as her husband had three or four
which were hauled up on the bank inside a yard, close to which
we then were, and that by climbing over the fence we should
find them at any time ready for use. As to paddles, she acknow-
ledged that they were generally kept shut up in the house, to
prevent the canoes being taken away, but that she would try and
place them on board the following evening as soon it was dark.
Thus all was quickly arranged for our attempt to escape.
As soon as we got back to our house we looked about for
wood suitable to form paddles, not wishing to trust entirely to
those with which Iguma might supply us. We had no difficulty
in finding an ample supply of material for our purpose, although
we thought it prudent not to begin working it up until darkness
should prevent the risk of what we were about being discovered.
We were thus employed when we heard a tremendous noise
proceeding from the house in which the king's wife lay sick. On
looking out we saw it surrounded by people, who were singing,
and shouting, and shrieking, and dancing, with all their might;
some beating tomtoms and drums; others blowing horns and
shaking rattles, all uniting in a hideous chorus. The object of
this, Aboh told us, was to drive out the evil spirit which was
making the queen ill.
"It was a signal," he said, " that the fetich doctor, who had
s

been so long coming, was about to arrive, and that his canoe was
probably seen descending the river."
As we thought it prudent to keep out of the way of the people,
we remained in the house, although we would very gladly have
got to a distance to escape from the uproar. We had cooked
our dinner and were eating it, when Aboh, who had been to the
door, came back and told us that the doctor had arrived, and
was beginning his incantations. As we were curious to see what
he was about, we went a short distance from the house, where,
remaining concealed behind a fence, we could observe what was
going forward without ourselves being seen. The doctor had
dressed himself up to look as hideous as possible. On his head
he wore a huge and lofty plume of black feathers drooping down
on all sides; his face was painted white, with red stripes over his
eyes, and others in different parts of his face. A case was sus-
pended by a piece of rope round his neck, which was also adorned
by a necklace of human bones, while a girdle of a similar descrip-
tion was fastened round his waist, to which was suspended a sort
of apron. He had taken his seat on a stool, round which were
hides and the horns of several animals, a leopard's skin, and
more cases containing charms. In one hand he held a rattle,
and in the other a wand. Near him stood two attendants, one
beating a small drum, and the other a couple of sticks. For
sometime he continued uttering all sorts of gibberish, which I
do not think was intelligible to any even of his hearers, while his
attendants played on their instruments—if playing it could be
called. He then took up a horn, from which he shook a quantity
of black powder in the air, and regarded it gravely as it fell.
It was sad to think that human beings could be deceived by so
gross an imposture, but yet it was very evident that all the people
present watched the proceedings with the utmost awe and re.
spect. After a dead silence the people again shouted out, though
what they said it was impossible to understand, but I shall never

MOB EXCITED BY THE WIZARD. 275
forget the alarmed looks Aboh and Shimbo exchanged. At
length the shouting ceased, when the doctor began to shriek,
making his voice sound like the croaking of a whole flock of
birds of prey about to descend on a dead carcase. Then he
stopped, and slowly pronounced several names.
If ever black man turned white, Aboh and Shimbo did on that
occasion. Poor fellows, they understood the meaning of what
was said better than we did. Again the people shouted and
shrieked in the most savage manner, indeed, no words can de-
scribe the hideous noise they made.
"Go back to the house, go back," cried Aboh.
We followed his advice, but ere we could reach our dwelling
the crowd had rushed towards us. Unfortunately we had come
out without our arms. The infuriated blacks did not attempt to
touch us, but before we could prevent it, they had seized Shimbo
and dragged him off, although we succeeded, by knocking down
with our fists those who came near us, in hauling Aboh into the
house. We at once shut the door, seized our rifles, and stood
prepared for a desperate resistance. Contrary to our expecta-
tions, the mob, having got possession of one of our followers,
retreated with him up the street. Scarcely had they gone than
we heard a knocking at the door, and finding that there was only
one person present we opened it, and Prince Kendo entered.
"Ah, white men, save my wife," he exclaimed, "the doctor
has accused her of bewitching the queen, and should her majesty
die, nothing will save my poor Iguma, her head will to a certainty
be cut off."
We all at once exclaimed that we would endeavour to save her,
if he could point out the best way we could do so.
"Shall we go to the king and ask her life?"
Aboh shook his head, and declared that it would be utterly
useless. "The king was bound to kill her with his own hands
if the doctor accused her of causing the queen's death."

276
THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
"The queen is not dead yet," said Harry.
"No, but she may die to-night, for she is much worse than she
has been before, and frightened out of her wits by the noise the
people make."
"Then what do you propose we should do?" said Harry.
"Carry her away. You intend going yourselves, I will go too,
I should like to see your country and the wonderful things it con-
tains, and I had made up my mind to propose going, even if this
had not happened. I should like to take my wife with me, for
whatever you may think, I love her dearly."
On hearing this, we resolved at once to put our long projected
plan into execution. Kendo's assistance would be of great value,
as he had canoes at hand, and could aid us in getting away.
We advised Kendo to go back and hide his wife, should he not
have the means of protecting her, lest the people might come and
seize her at once, and we promised to be at the house or at any
spot he might appoint as soon as possible after dark.
He stopped for a moment to consider.
"Come to my house," he answered, "the canoes will be ready,
and so will Iguma; but be prepared to fight, for if the people
come and find out that we are going to carry her off, they will
try to prevent it. Better fight than lose Iguma."
We of course promised, unless prevented by any unforeseen
occurrence, that we would do as he proposed, feeling confident
that we could trust to his honesty, and that he had a real desire
to save his wife from the horrible fate which threatened her. We
had not in the meantime forgotten poor Shimbo. Aboh con-
stantly cried out—
"Oh! my brodder, my brodder."
"I say, it would be a great shame to allow these murderous
scoundrels to put the poor fellow to death," exclaimed Charley.
"If the old woman dies they'll make short work of him; I propose
that we set off and claim him as our servant, threatening them

277
with the vengeance of England should a shock of his woolly pate
be injured."
Aboh, who understood what was said, cried out, "Tankee,
massa, tankee, no let my brodder die."
We scarcely needed this appeal from the faithful Aboh to run
every risk for the sake of rescuing his brother.
"Never fear, we will do what we can to save him," said
Charley, "but do you remain in the house, lest that abominable
juggler takes it into his wicked head to accuse you as well as your
brother."
Aboh was very thankful to follow this advice, indeed, he was
scarcely fit to accompany us, so overcome was he by the fears
of death for himself and his brother, increased by the superstitious
dread he had of the doctor. Shouldering our arms, with our
knapsacks on our backs, we left the house, closing the door behind
us, and marched boldly towards the fetich house, a sort of temple
situated near the residence of the king. The number of people
collected round it showed that something was going forward.
At the further end of the structure—a sort of temple composed
of rough timber with a thatched roof—was a hideous idol stand-
ing in a shrine raised on an altar, for such it resembled, possibly
imitated from the Portuguese who once held sway in the land,
and established for a short period what they called Christianity,
although it was in reality an idolatrous system, scarcely superior
in the effect it produced on the moral and religious sentiments
of the people to that which it displaced. This Christianity, how-
ever, such as it was, had long ago been overthrown, and only such
slight traces as I now observed remained. I may here remark,
that wherever the Spaniards and Portuguese have established
their religion, the people have invariably sunk back again into
the barbarism and gross idolatry of their original state, indeed, it
might be safe to say that they were never really raised out of
idolatry. On getting nearer we saw that the king was standing

in front of the temple, with a drawn scimitar of enormous size in
his hand. We were hurrying forward, when the starling cry
arose, "The queen is dead, the queen is dead!"
The multitude immediately uttered the most piercing shrieks
and lamentations. Directly afterwards we caught sight of the
hideous doctor, or priest, urging on a party who were dragging
forward a person between them. We did not at first see the
features of the latter, and it was not until he had been hauled up
on the platform, where the king was standing, that we discovered
him to be our friend Shimbo. His hands were tied behind his
back, so that he was unable to make any movement with them.
He cast an imploring look around him, for he knew but too well
why he was brought there.
Harry on seeing him shouted out to the king: "Let that man
go, he is our servant."
But the king, taking no notice of what was said, flourished his
long sword. The multitude shouted and howled, the weapon
flashed in the sunlight, and the next instant Shimbo fell, and his
head rolled along the floor of the temple. The maddened cries
of the superstitious mob on this grew louder, and many of the
elders and chiefs of the people, rushing forward, bowed them-
selves before the king.
We were horror-struck at what we had seen, and we had also
reason to fear, from the savage looks that the people cast at us,
that we ourselves were in no slight danger. The juggler might
at any moment accuse us of sorcery, and, in the excited state of
mind in which the people surrounding us then were, they might
set upon us, and in spite of the resistance we might make, tear
us limb from limb. Fortunately for us, the names of three other
persons were shouted out as having taken part in the enchant-
ment which had destroyed the queen. As the mob were
occupied with them, we beat a retreat in a dignified way to our
house.

CRUEL EXECUTIONS. 279
Without telling Aboh what had happened, we placed him in
our midst, and avoiding the excited multitude, made our way
down to the river. If we were to save Iguma, we must carry
her off at once without waiting for the night, for the instant the
priest had pronounced her name, the crowd, in overwhelming
numbers, would rush to her house to seize her, and even Kendo
himself would be utterly unable to afford her protection. All
this time we knew by the hideous din that the cruel executions
were going forward. As long as the people were thus engaged
we might be unmolested, but should a new victim be required,
they would at once come rushing towards the house of the
prince. We dreaded every instant to hear their voices approach-
ing. We had already reached the bank of the river, but could
find no canoes fit for our purpose. The prince's house was,
I should have said, some way along the bank. We hurried
towards it. As we got near Kendo himself sprang out to meet
us.
"My wife is in the canoe," he exclaimed, "quick, quick!"
There was good reason for our hastening, for after a few
minutes' cessation of the uproar, the din from the vast multitude
again burst forth. Kendo was certain that they were coming
towards us. Not a moment was to be lost. Several canoes were
on the bank, one was already in the water smaller than the
others. Kendo pointed it out to Charley and me, and entreated
us to jump in, observing as he did so : "Wife dare." We thought
that he was about to follow, but instead of doing so, he gave
the canoe a shove off with all his might into the middle
of the stream, and then assisted Harry and the rest to launch
another.
As soon as we found ourselves adrift, we each took a paddle
and made down with the current. If we were to save Iguma's
life, we had no time to spare. Already we could see a mass of
black forms coming rushing frantically towards the river flourish-

ing their weapons, while the air was filled with the cries they
uttered. Two other canoes contained the remainder of our party,
Kendo being accompanied by a single faithful attendant who
had acted as his henchman and companion on all our hunting
expeditions. Just as they were on the point of shoving off, a
white man appeared on the bank, and without apparently even
asking permission, leapt into one of the canoes. Instantly she
shoved off and came paddling after us. Kendo shouted to us
to go on and not stop for anything; a piece of advice we saw
the wisdom of following.
As Iguma was the chief object of the savages pursuit, it was
of the greatest importance to get her beyond their reach. She
lay all this time, I should have said, at the bottom of the boat,
covered up with a piece of matting, but she uttered no expres-
sions of terror now that she thought she was safe. Had we
delayed another minute, not only would Iguma have been
captured, but we should ourselves very likely have lost our lives.
Scarcely had the other canoe got away from the shore, than a
vast multitude of infuriated natives, uttering the most fearful yells,
appeared on the banks. We naturally expected to be immedi-
ately followed, but, as we looked astern, we saw no canoes being
launched. We were not aware at the time that Kendo had
thoughtfully concealed all the paddles, or had so injured the
canoes that they were unfit to put off.
"Paddle on, paddle on," he kept shouting to us, and we were,
as may be imagined, well disposed to follow his advice. We
wished, however, that he had come with us, both to act as pilot
and to assist in the defence of his wife, for he was a brave fellow,
and would certainly have fought to the last. Though it was still
daylight, evening was approaching. We hoped during the dark-
ness to get far beyond the pursuit of the savages, who would, we
felt sure, endeavour to obtain possession of Iguma, and to wreak
their vengence on our heads for attempting to carry her off.

ESCAPE DOWN THE RIVER.
Had the course of ihe river been straight, there would have been
no doubt about our ultimate escape, but it made numerous bends,
sometimes running to the north, then to the south, then again to
the west, so that it would be a long time before we could get out
of the territory owned by King Kickubaroo. Now and then also
the river was very broad, extending almost into a lake. This
under some circumstances might be to our advantage, but
during the night we ran the risk of losing our way, for though
Charley still had in his possession the pocket compass, it
was so dark that we could not see it, and we did not venture to
strike a light. Charley and I, however, paddled along with all
our might, hoping that even should our savage pursuers again
catch sight of us, they would be still unable to procure canoes
in which to follow us.
The night was unusually dark, and by Charley's advice we all
kept silence, that our voices might not betray our position, should
there be any of the enemy near us. Although our canoe was
somewhat smaller than the others, yet as they were more heavily
laden, we managed to keep ahead. We must have paddled on
for a couple of hours or so, when we found ourselves on a broad
lake. A thick mist obscured the sky, so that not a star was
twinkling over head to guide us, and we were only able to steer
by ascertaining in which direction the current was running. The
darkness was so great that we could not even see the other
canoes, and we were afraid, for the reason I have before men-
tioned, of shouting to attract their notice. We thought that unless
we paddled on we should be overtaken by daylight. At length,
however, my strength began to fail, my arms ached, though by
this time I was pretty well used to bodily exertion. Charley
continued working away without uttering a word, and sometimes
1 wished that he would speak, for the silence oppressed me;
Iguma lay perfectly still in the bottom of the canoe; it was evi-
dent she fully comprehended the danger we were in.

THE TWO SUPERCARGOES.
On we went, hour after hour passed by. Daylight broke
sooner than I had expected, and yet it seemed that we had been
in the canoe a long time. A mist hung over the water shrouding
all objects, so that we were unable to see the land, or discover
which bank we were nearest. Though we listened attentively,
we could not hear the slightest splash of paddles to indicate the
whereabouts of our friends. We were afraid that something had
happened to them, either that they had been overtaken, or that
the canoes had run on snags. We said nothing to Iguma, how-
ever, lest we should alarm her, but it was absolutely necessary
that we should rest our arms and take some food, of which we
had brought a supply in our knapsacks, some also had been put
in the canoe. Not knowing how far off the shore we were, we
allowed the canoe to drift down, while we took in our paddles
and got out our provisions. We invited Iguma to take some break-
fast; she, pointing to some plantains and roast yams, signified
that they would satisfy her hunger.
"Come, I think we ought to take to our paddles again," said
Charley, when we had finished our meal. "How do your arms
feel, Dick?"
"Ready for work, though I should be glad to give them a few
hours' rest," I answered—" but softly, where are we?"
As I spoke, I found that the canoe had drifted in among some
tall reeds, which showed that we were nearer the shore than we
expected. While we were attempting to paddle out from among
them, a breeze blew the mist away, and what was our astonish-
ment, not to say dismay, to see a number of blacks standing on
the banks and regarding us attentively. They had probably
heard us talking and making a splashing while endeavouring to
extricate the canoe from the reeds into which it had drifted. No
sooner did they discover us than a dozen of them, or more,
armed with spears and lances, plunged into the water and began
swimming towards us.

iguma's courage.

"Put down your paddle and take your gun," cried Charley,
"these fellows mean mischief."
All this time Iguma had not moved. The blacks, seeing only
two white men in the canoe, thought that they would easily master
us, and swam boldly forward.
"I suppose that there are no crocodites hereabouts, or those
fellows will be picked up to a certainty by one of the beasts; we
must not trust to that, however, but when the men come near
enough, shoot them without ceremony," exclaimed Charley.
Standing up in the canoe we warned the blacks to go back,
but they took no notice of what we said.
"Their blood be on their own heads—fire, Dick."
We both pulled our triggers, one black threw up his arms and
floated down the stream wounded, another dived, still I felt sure
that I had hit him. The rest, undaunted, came on while we
were reloading. Three were close upon us, and several others
were not far behind them; one had actually got hold of the gun-
wale of the canoe, while Charley was aiming at another a short
distance off. He fired, the black letting go his spear, threw
up his arms. The first, however, might in another instant have
climbed into the canoe, when Iguma, springing up with an axe in
her hand, dealt him a blow on the head; without a cry he
dropped back and sank immediately. I fired, and the rest
seeing the fate of their companions, turned about and made for
the shore. This gave us time to reload and be ready should any
fresh ones come off to renew the attack. They appeared, how-
ever, to have had enough of it, and we, putting down our rifles,
again took to our paddles and urged the canoe further out into
the river, which was here very broad and the current slow. Still
it ran at a sufficient speed to enable us to ascertain the direction
we were to take. We now had time to look-out for our com-
panions. They were nowhere to be seen, and we were still in
doubt as to whether they were ahead or astern of us. Charley

thought they must have paddled on and gone ahead, and if so,
we should overtake them before long. We were, however, still
followed by other bodies of our enemies along the shore, for
those we had encountered were evidently only a small party,
and, probably, others would be waiting for us close to the
banks.

BELIEVING that our friends were ahead, we paddled on
•with all our might. It was of the greatest importance that
we should join them before we were again attacked, for, united,
we might set at defiance any number of our pursuers likely to
assail us. As may be supposed, our arms ached, and though we
paddled on mechanically, I felt very sleepy, and occasionally my
eyelids closed. As the sun got up the heat became excessive,
but we did not dare to stop even for a few seconds under the
trees which shaded the banks, lest any of our enemies might be
lurking near, and might pounce clown upon us. At last Iguma,
who had been sitting watching us, offered to take my paddle.
At first I felt ashamed to let her have it
.
"Give it up to her," said Charley. "I daresay she under-

stands how to handle it as well as you do, and we shall make
better way."
I at length consented. When she had the paddle in her hand
I lay down in her place at the bottom of the canoe, and I soon
saw that she was working away with far more energy than I had
lately shown. I watched her for a few minutes admiring the
grace and dexterity with which she plied the paddle, and then
my eyelids closed, and in another instant I was fast asleep. I
do not think I ever enjoyed a more sound slumber, lulled by the
ripple of the water on the side of the canoe as we glided rapidly
along. Charley, being older and more inured to labour, was
able to keep up better than I was, and I knew that he would not
give in while there was any necessity for his exerting himself. I
had pulled the matting over my head to preserve myself from the
heat of the sun, which struck down with great force on the calm
water.
"There they are, there they are !" I heard Charley shouting
out.
His words awoke me, and starting up I could distinguish two
dots on the water right ahead.
"Are they our friends, though ?" I asked Charley, after I had
gazed at them a few seconds.
"I hope so," he answered. "I felt sure that they were ahead
of us, for, thinking that we were before them, they have been
paddling on, expecting all the while to overtake us."
"What does Iguma think?" I said, and tried to make her
understand that we wanted to know whether the canoes we saw
were those of our friends. To my great satisfaction she appeared
to have no doubt about the matter.
I then begged that she would let me have the paddle again,
but she smiled and replied that her arms did not ache, and advised
me to take my brother's paddle.
"I don't mind if you do for ten minutes or so, I will then

WE REJOIN OUR COMPANIONS.
287
resume it and try if we cannot come up with the other canoes,"
said Charley.
"How long have I been asleep?" I asked him, as I took his
place.
"Three or four hours, I suspect," he answered, "though I have
not had time to look at my watch."
As I thought would very likely be the case, no sooner did
Charley lie down than he dropped off into a sound sleep. As after
my long rest I felt very capable of work, I determined not to
arouse him, treating him as he had treated me.
Iguma and I made the canoe glide rapidly over the water. A
light breeze had sprung up, somewhat cooling the air and enabling
us to increase our exertions. I eagerly watched the canoes ahead,
and felt sure that we were gaining on them. I wondered, how-
ever, that no one on board saw us, and could only suppose that
those who were not paddling were asleep, while, of course, the
paddlers had their backs towards us, and believing that we were
ahead did not trouble themselves to look astern.
At length I thought that they were near enough to make them
hear me. At first I thought of firing my rifle, but the sound
would, to a certainty, show our whereabouts to our enemies should
they still be pursuing us, whereas my voice could be heard to any
distance along the water alone. Acting on the impulse of the
moment, I shouted out at the top of my voice. Charley started
up, thinking that something was the matter. On seeing the
canoes he joined his voice to mine.
At length they ceased paddling; as they did so I cried out:
"I fear, after all, they are enemies. See, those are black fellows
standing up in the canoe nearest us."
"If they are we must fight our way past them," observed Char-
ley; "they have no firearms, and we can knock over several of
them before they get up alongside, and should they do that we
must fight them hand to hand; Iguma has shown that she is well

able to defend herself; at all events, a few minutes will settle the
matter."
We again took to our paddles, and I, making a sign to Iguma
to sit down again in the canoe, took her place. We had not gone
far before Charley shouted out, " Hurrah ! it's all right, I see
Harry's and Tom's broad-brimmed hats, and I make out two
white men in the other canoe."
We were soon up to our friends, who greeted us warmly, they
all along having fancied that we were ahead, and under that belief
having paddled on, incited to exertions by occasionally hearing
the voices of their pursuers as they cut off the bends of the river.
They were of opinion, however, that we were now well ahead of
them,—still we agreed that, during the remainder of daylight, it
would be safer to continue our course.
The river now narrowed considerably, and the current became
much more rapid than it had been hitherto. Kendo and his
henchman, with Harry and Tom, led the way.
We were gliding quickly on, when suddenly Kendo's canoe
spun round, and filling was driven against some rocks whose black
heads rose above the foaming water. We narrowly avoided the
danger, and as we shot by had just time to help Harry, who held
on tight to his gun, on board, while Kendo, striking out, got up
along side us, and with the aid of Iguma also scrambled in.
"Never mind me," cried out Tom, who was standing on the
half sunken canoe, " I'll get into the other. Steer over this way,
mates," he shouted out to the men in the other canoe.
We had no time to render him assistance, and had to exert our
skill to prevent our canoe running against some more rocks which
appeared ahead.
In less time than it has taken to describe the occurrence we
were again in tranquil water, when looking round we were thank-
ful to see Tom and Kendo's henchman safely seated in Caspar's
canoe. The wrecked canoe was in the meantime dashed to

pieces, so as to be rendered perfectly useless. We were some-
what crowded, but that could not be helped, and we hoped that
we should not meet with more rapids in our course; although we
might manage to swim on shore, should any accident occur, we
should probably lose our rifles and knapsacks, and at all events
damage our ammunition. We waited until Tom's canoe came up
with us. I now recognised the stranger who had got on board
just as they were shoving off as Herman Jansen, the murderer of
Captain Roderick. His countenance wore the same gloomy
expression as before. By his manner, however, he appeared not
to be conscious that we were witnesses of the fearful deed he
had committed, and under the circumstances we were placed,
Harry and Charley agreed with me that it would not be wise in
any way to allude to it. He had brought a rifle with him, how
procured we could not tell. That would, of course, be of assistance
should we be again attacked. From what we could learn from
Kendo, we had too much reason to fear that we should meet with
numerous enemies on our way down the river, who would only be
restrained from attacking us by seeing our means of defence.
He advised that we should keep our weapons ready for instant
use.
Another night was approaching. It was absolutely necessary
that we should seek some place of shelter where we could rest
for a few hours, as it would otherwise be impossible to paddle on
during another day. We had fortunately a sufficient supply of
cooked food, so that we had no need to go on shore and light
a fire. Seeing a wooded point on the south bank of the river,
where the trees overhung the water, we agreed to paddle in and
secure the canoes. After supper it was arranged that some of us
should lie down while the rest sat up and kept watch, so that we
might be ready to defend ourselves against either human foes or
any savage creatures which might be on the look-out for prey.
We had remained at rest a couple of hours, when as Harry and

1 were sitting up while the remainder of the party were sleeping,
we heard voices approaching, and looking out we saw a number
of black forms gliding through the forest. From the way they
approached, however, the savages could not have expected to
surprise us, we therefore concluded that they were entirely
ignorant of our whereabouts. Presently they came to a halt
about a couple of hundred yards from where our canoes lay.
We saw a light struck and they soon had a fire kindled, around
which they seated themselves. In a short time other blacks ar-
rived, and they all began to cook the provisions they had brought
with them. It was very evident they had not forgotten a supply
of palm wine, which they must have quaffed pretty freely, as ere
long several of them got up and began dancing away furiously.
Others joined them, until the greater number were dancing round
and round the fire, snapping their fingers, kicking out their legs,
and giving vent to the most hideous yells and shrieks of laughter,
the sounds echoing through the forest being answered by the
jabberings of monkeys and the cries of night birds. Whether
these were our pursuers or some other tribe indulging in a night
orgie we could not tell. Kendo touched Charley's rifle as a sign
for him to fire. My brother shook his head and answered—
"We none of us wish to injure any of the poor fellows unless
compelled to do so in self-defence. The sooner we get away from
this the better. We shall not be discovered while all this uproar
is going on, and may be far down the river before the blacks re-
cover their senses."
Kendo rather unwillingly took his paddle, and Charley setting
the example, we cautiously cast off from the branch to which we
were moored and got up to the other canoe. Telling Tom that
we were going to continue our course down the river, we paddled
on.
"Let's have a shot at the niggers," I heard Jansen say to his

companions; "we might knock over a dozen before they could
get near us."
"Pull on, mate," said Tom; "what would be the use of injur-
ing the people? they can do us no harm."
Aboh seeing us going ahead, took his paddle, Tom doing the
same, compelled the others to do so likewise. As I looked round
I saw them following us. We continued our way during the
greater part of the night, Kendo being sure that we were keeping
the right course. We were thankful, however, once more to bring
up, when we believed that we had put sufficient distance between
ourselves and our pursuers, and that there was now no longer any
fear of our being overtaken by them. We had another enemy,
however, to contend with. As we lay moored to the bank we
heard grunting sounds, and a splashing which proceeded, we well
knew, from hippopotami, and from the frequency and loudness of
the noises we had good reason to believe that a number of the
creatures were either sporting about or feeding near us. How-
ever, they seldom attack canoes so as to injure them intentionally
and are generally greatly afraid of human beings either when on
shore or in the water.
Huge and awkward as they are, they can run, and manage to
make good progress over the ground, which they do when in
search of grass, the food they live on. The bodies of those we
saw were fully as large as elephants, although, having short legs,
they were of a very different height, indeed, their bellies almost
sweep the ground as they walk. Their feet are constructed in a
very curious manner, to enable them to walk among the reeds
and over the mud, as also to swim with ease. The hoof is
divided into four short unconnected toes, which they can spread
out like the feet of the camel when moving over the soft mud, or
when swimming. The skin, which is almost entirely hairless,
except in a few spots, is of a yellowish colour, the lower part
assuming almost a pinkish hue. The head is hideous in the

extreme, and armed with huge crooked tusks, the object of
which is not so much for defence, as to dig up grass from the
bottom of the river. These tusks afford the whitest ivory to be
procured. There must have been thirty or forty of these
creatures gamboling about around us. In spite of their noise,
"those who had the watch below," as Charley called it, slept as
soundly as tops.
As soon as the sun rose the next morning, we went on shore
for the first time since we had embarked, but no enemies were in
sight, and we ventured to breakfast comfortably on the bank;
Harry and I having shot several birds which contributed to the
repast. As soon as breakfast was over, we continued our
course, as we were anxious to get into a district where people
were accustomed to white men, and were likely to assist us.
Our canoe was leading, Tom being a little astern. We were
just rounding a point where the water was somewhat shallow,
when I heard a cry from the canoe astern. Upon looking round,
I saw it lifted high in the air, and turned bottom upwards, while
beneath it appeared a huge hippopotamus, which was making
after one of the men; another man was on the point of being
pitched on the creature's back, the two blacks, with their legs in
the air, were falling into the water, and one of the men, who
seemed to have sprung on shore, was scrambling up the bank.
I saw all this at a glance, the next instant a fearful shriek
escaped the swimmer, the huge hippopotamus had pierced him
with its tusks, and seemed bent on venting its rage upon him.
For an instant I feared that the victim was our friend Tom,
but his voice reassured me, and I saw the good boatswain mak-
ing for the bank, which his other companion had gained. The
two blacks quickly followed. Just then catching sight of the
countenance of the man attacked by the hippopotamus, I recog-
nised Jansen, the murderer of Captain Roderick.
Before either of us could raise our rifles to fire at the beast,

jansen's horrible death.
293
the miserable man had been dragged down beneath the water by
the infuriated monster. We were on the point of returning to
try and secure the canoe, when the hippopotamus again rose,
and seizing the side in his huge mouth, crushed it to pieces, and
we were thankful to paddle off to save our canoe from a like fate.
We had now to consider what was to be done. We could not
possibly take all the party into our canoe, nor could we leave
any of them behind us. The blacks would to a certainty have
been seized and carried off into slavery, unless protected by us.
We were still, we calculated, a hundred miles or more from the
coast; our only mode of proceeding, therefore, was for one party
to continue along the shore, while the other paddled the canoe,
and to relieve each other at intervals. We continued on in this
fashion the greater part of the day, not meeting with another
canoe or any habitations.
As evening approached, having reached an open spot, we
agreed to encamp there that we might shoot some game, as our
stock of provisions was reduced to a very low ebb.
Tom and Caspar, who had been walking the greater part of
the day along the bank, were glad to take charge of the camp,
while Charley, Harry, and I, with Kendo, went out in search of
game. We were fortunate' in killing two deer, several birds, and
a couple of monkeys, and on our return we found that Iguma had
not been idle, and had collected a supply of fruits and nuts,
which, with the remainder of the plantain, gave us an abundant
meal. There was still some time before dark, which we occupied
in building a hut for the young lady, while we put up shelters for
ourselves, and collected a large supply of sticks, so that we could
have a blazing fire during the night. This was very necessary,
as we had seen traces of wild beasts, and we might have other-
wise very likely been visited by some of them. All of us required
as much sleep as we could get . As soon as supper was over, we
set the watch and lay down under our lean-to's, which were, I

should have said, at a sufficient distance from the water to avoid
the risk of any of us being carried off by a hungry crocodile. I
had been some hours asleep, forgetting entirely where we were,
when I was awakened by a tremendous crash of thunder. Start-
ing up, I heard crash succeeding crash, while vivid flashes of
lightning darted from the sky, and went playing round us like
fiery serpents. The wind at the same time began to blow with a
fury we had not encountered since we landed on the shores of
Africa, but as it was off the land we were partly sheltered by the
forest, and it did not send the waves up the bank. Our lean-to's
were speedily blown down. In a short time the rain came down
in torrents, and had we not just before made up the fire it would
at once have been put out. Fortunately Iguma's hut stood, and
she invited us all in to take shelter beneath its roof, which, being
composed of several layers of large leaves, fastened down by vines,
sheltered us from the pitiless storm. There we all sat for the
remainder of the night, all huddled up like so many mummies,
and a curious picture we must have presented.
Towards morning the hurricane abated, Tom and Aboh rush-
ing out managed to scrape together the ashes of the fire which
was not wholly extinguished, and again made it up. Shortly
afterwards dawn broke. Uncomfortable as I was, I was actually
dozing when I heard Tom cry out—
"The canoe, the canoe, where is she?"
We all of us jumped up and hurried to the beach, when what
was our dismay to find that the tree to which the canoe had been
made fast had, riven by the storm, fallen and crushed it to pieces.
On examining it we saw at once that to repair it would be hope-
less, and we had now only to make up our minds once more to
continue our journey overland.
Fortunately we had still enough ammunition remaining to kill
game for our support, but it was necessary carefully to husband
it. Charley at once called a council of war.

"One thing is certain. We must not delay," he observed, "for
even when we do reach the coast, we don't know how long we
may be detained, and unless we fall in with friendly savages
we may find it difficult to procure food; or, perhaps, indeed have
to fight our way. We are bound also to protect the blacks who
are trusting to us, for depend upon it, every attempt will be made
by the slave-trading rascals on the coast to detain them."
Every one agreed with Charley, and without loss of time we
commenced our march. I have already described travelling in
Africa, so that I need not enter into the details of the journey
we performed. We passed through the neighbourhood of several
villages, from the inhabitants of which, with the remainder of the
beads and the trinkets we possessed, we purchased food so that
we were able to husband our powder and shot. Two attempts
were made to carry off our black friends, but by showing a bold
front and by pushing on, we prevented them from being made
prisoners.
The health of all the party was wonderfully preserved, indeed
the climate, though so close under the line—from the nature of
the soil—is superior to that further north. At length to our
great joy we caught sight from a rising ground of the blue ocean
sparkling in the distance.
We had been two weeks performing the journey. We found
that we had hit the shore some way to the south of the river, at
a spot where a fine sheltered bay afforded a tempting harbour
to any ships cruising off the coast, and the clear sparkling
stream, which flowed clown from the hill side at which vessels
could obtain water, made it still more a likely spot to be
touched at.
We accordingly determined to pitch our camp there, near a
wood from which we could obtain materials for building huts,
and an ample supply of fuel for our fires as well as game for our
food. It seemed surprising that no blacks should have taken up

their abode in what appeared to us so fine a situation. We lost
no time in erecting our huts, and making ourselves, as Tom called
it, "at home."
Of course we could not tell how long we might be detained
there. Day after day passed by, no ship appeared in sight. At
length Charley proposed proceeding to the northward, but Harry
and I urged him to wait patiently a little longer.
That same evening my brother and I had strolled out from our
camp to enjoy the freshness of the breeze along the sea shore.
A light wind played over the water, the stars shone forth with
wonderful brilliancy. We were tempted to sit down on the rocks,
where we remained talking over our prospects for some time,
when Charley exclaimed—
"Look there, Dick, look there! a vessel, as I'm alive, she's
standing into the bay. She's no stranger to it, or she would not
come here during the dark. We must make a signal and try to
attract her attention, though it is pretty certain that she will send
a boat on shore early in the morning, yet it will be trying to have
to wait until then to know what she is."
There was abundance of drift wood on the beach which we
quickly collected, and Charley having fortunately a tinder box
in his pocket, we had no difficulty in kindling a blaze. As soon
as we got a brand burning I took it up, and swinging it round
my head threw it high into the air. A second and a third time I
did the same, when as I threw up a fourth brand, the signal was
answered by a rocket which rose from the vessel.
Before many minutes were over we heard the splash of oars,
and could distinguish a boat. We both shouted, our hail was
answered by an English voice. In another five minutes the
stem of the boat touched the beach, and a person sprang on
shore.
"Who are you? where do you come from?" exclaimed a

A HAPPY MEETING.

voice which I well knew. It was that of Captain Magor. The
next instant we were all warmly shaking hands.
Harry and Tom hearing our shouts had hurried down to the beach.
Our surprise and satisfaction were mutual. We very quickly told
him our adventures, and he then informed us that he had played
the same trick on the pirates which they had played on Lieutenant
Hillton, and that having recaptured the " Arrow" he had carried
her safely back to England, and that he had now just arrived
on the coast, the only misfortune which had happened to him
being the death of a young man who had come out as super-
cargo.
"You may therefore still be of the greatest assistance to me,"
he said, "and having now learned something of the language,
and being acclimatised, you will be able to transact business with
the natives far better than you could otherwise have done."
We then told him of our black followers, who would, we believed,
be of still greater assistance in procuring the articles we required,
and disposing of the goods we had brought.
Iguma and Kendo were somewhat alarmed at first at the
thought of going on board a ship, but we soon overcame their
fears, and the next morning we all went on board, bidding fare-
well to our encampment, and once more trod the deck of the
"Arrow."
Harry and I resumed our berths on board, as did Tom Tubbs,
for the boatswain who had come out had already fallen sick and
was unable to do duty.
Caspar entered as one of the ship's company, as did Aboh.
Captain Magor arranged to carry Kendo and Iguma with their
followers to England, if they preferred going there to being landed
at one of the English settlements on the coast.
I must now bring my tale rapidly to a conclusion. Kendo
and his wife—wisely, I think—determined not to go to England.
A week afterwards we fell in with the " Rover," when Charley

rejoined his ship, taking the blacks with him, the captain kindly
promising to land them at Cape Coast Castle, where they would
be properly treated and looked after. With the information we
had gained, we were so well able to conduct our transactions,
that our voyage was the most successful ever made by the
"Arrow," and we had the satisfaction of meeting with the
approval of our employers, and receiving substantial acknowledg-
ments.
Of course our disappearance had caused very great anxiety to
our friends, though they had been buoyed up by the hope that
we would surely return.
Harry and I having married the young ladies to whom we had
so long been attached, entered the firm, and on the death of
that kind and excellent man Mr. Swab, we found that he had
divided his fortune between us.
