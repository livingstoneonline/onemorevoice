  <h5 style="text-align: center">The Gospel preached by a Captive Yoruba Girl.</h5>
  <p>The subjoined deeply interesting narrative is from a recent journal of the Rev. Daniel Olubi,
    Native Pastor at Ibadan, and well known as the faithful helper for many years of Mr. and Mrs.
    Hinderer:&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%"><em>June</em> 6<em>th</em>, 1874&#8212;To-day, Messrs.
    Allen, Okusende, two members of
    our Church, and myself, went to Adeladan, a wicked persecutor of a new
    inquirer, a girl named Moyoade, now in fetters, to beg him and his
    brothers to release her from the fetters, and let her be coming to church,
    and that nothing bad will be the result if she sincerely follow the Lord
    Jesus Christ. We were there for five hours, reasoning and urging them
    to this point; but sorry to say that they remained obstinate and unreasonable, and so we
    returned unsuccessful. The poor persecuted girl
    sent to us afterwards, that we should not take the trouble of coming to
    her relatives, because they determined to lend us their deaf ear.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">A few weeks after this she escaped from the chains, and ran to Kakanfo
    (the Mohammedan head chief) for protection. The chief was informed
    of this beforehand, and he promised her assistance whenever the case
    is brought before him. So now he fulfilled his promise and assisted
    her very much; and though poor Moyoade knows little of Christianity
    herself, yet it pleased the chief to keep her for three days in his
    house, during which time he conversed much with her on the subject
    of Christianity. He received more knowledge from the girl of that way,
    and the girl was also happy to receive more encouragement from the
    chief. Now, after three days, her relatives were sent for by the chief,
    and he warned them that the girl must be left alone to pursue this new
    religion, and, he added, "it is the best religion." Then he delivered the
    girl over to them. But before they left the chief's presence the girl stood
    up and assured the relatives," I shall willingly obey and do your orders;
    but if you will stop my going to church, I prefer death rather than obey
    you."</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">Alas! when they got home with her every punishment was doubled.
    She was the more cruelly chained. But He whom she desires to serve
    mercifully helped her, and she escaped from the chains, and took refuge
    at another new inquirer's house; but here she was not at all safe, consequently she was brought
    to me. The next morning I went to tell the
    chief of it, and he wondered that he was not listened to. He kindly
    advised me to keep the girl secret out of their way until they are pacified.
    But, then, how long? is the question.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">We earnestly beg the faithful prayers of the friends of the Mission,
    that it may please God to turn the hearts of these persecutors as the
    rivers of water, withersoever He wills.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">We are thankful to add that a more recent communication
    from Mr. Alubi mentions incidentally that the girl's case was
    "nicely settled," and "all going on beautifully."</p>
