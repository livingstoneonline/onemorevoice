my grateful and sincere thanks to you for the great interest you have taken in my
education, by which means I have been brought from <span class="">African</span> darkness to a knowledge of the comforts of a civilized and social life. Hitherto,
for these ten years, I have experienced your benevolent care and tuition, and have
been elevated far above many of my poor countrymen, whose minds are lying with the
dust. To whom should I ascribe this work, if not to the patroness of my education?
To whom should I dedicate these incidents, if not to the guardian of my younger years?
Yes, Madam; to you, and to you alone, I now acknowledge my gratitude for the many
benefits which I enjoy. Although far distant from kindred and relations—although far
from the care of an overlooking mother—I have found in you, Madam,

having been taken away from his country at a very early age. Of all the quarters of
the globe, <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> is the least known. Ignorance, barbarity, and superstition, prevail in its centre,
and the unhealthy nature of its climate renders it almost impracticable for any <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span> to travel into it, and satisfy an enquiring public. Taking a natural view of the
country, it is barren, sandy, and mountainous, interspersed with a few green spots,
called oases, or made fertile by the inundation of some river in the rainy season.
Taking an artificial view of those regions, you will perceive nothing but a few small
huts here and there, built by the inhabitants for their own accommodation. The <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Northern</span> and <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Southern States</span> can boast of a little civilization, being frequented

<p class="p noindent preface">and inhabited by the dwellers of the north temperate zone. In taking a political view
of the centre of Africa, the enquirer will find the country divided into a number
of small principalities, who maintain their dignity by making war against each other.
The captives taken in these wars are sold as slaves, being purchased by Arabs and
Turks on the east coast, and Spaniards, Portuguese, and Americans, on the west. Thus
many of these poor creatures are brought to a level with the brute beasts, by the
inhabitants of that federal government, (the <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">United States</span>), who pretend to profess the principles of freedom and Christianity in their truest
light. The selling of these <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">captives</span> stimulates others to kidnap some of the poor <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span>, and carry on a brutal traffic in buying and selling human victims for the gratification

<p class="p center "><span class="seg caps small ">Description of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">valley of Tegla</span>, and
its inhabitants.</span></p>
<br>
<p class="p noindent "><span class="seg smallcaps ">Surrounded</span> by some beautiful mountain scenery, and situated between <span class="country" title="A country.">Durfur</span> and <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Abyssinia</span>, is a small valley going under the denomination of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Tegla</span>, or <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Tegeley</span>. To this valley I stretch forth my affections, giving it the endearing appellation
of my native home and father land. It was there that I was born; 'twas there that
I received the fond looks of a loving mother; and it was there that I set my feet
for the first time upon a world full of cares, trials, difficulties, and dangers.
I cannot give the exact limits of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">valley of Tegla</span>. There were, however, three Chiefs who exercised power over its inhabitants. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mehemet Chammaroo</span> (under whose government my father was) ruled the centre; while two other princes
had the sway, one on each side. Like many of the regions bordering on the equator,
the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">valley of Tegla</span> is exposed to the excessive heat of the burning sun. Its seasons, properly speaking,
can only be divided into two parts—the rainy and the dry season. In the rainy season

<span class="fw small "><span class="seg left ">12</span> <span class="seg center caps ">Aga's Recollections.</span></span>
<p class="p noindent ">agriculture is carried on by the farmer on a very small scale—the only substitute
for a plough being a long pole, with something similar to a shovel attached to the
end of it. With this instrument the surface of the ground is broken, after which the
seed (consisting of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Indian</span> corn and maize) is sown in small quantities at certain distances from each other.
After it has grown a certain length, part of it is transplanted into different fields,
thus giving the crop full scope and encouragement to grow. When the corn begins to
change colour, the rainy season declines, till at length the refulgent rays of the
sun perceive the inhabitant of the vale preparing to reap his harvest. The rain is
over, the dry season is on; many begin to reap the fruits of their labour.<span class="">*</span></p>
<p class="p ">My juvenile recollections did not bring the nature of the implements used for shearing.
The shearers are not formed of a number of mercenaries, who expect to pocket shillings
and half-crowns at the end of their period of labour; but such is the social nature
of the people among themselves, that they exchange services with each other. A large
concourse of them assemble

<span class="note indent small ">* How wisely has Providence ordered all things. The inhabitants of <span class="country" title="A country.">Egypt</span> have no rain, and yet the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">river Nile</span> has its yearly inundations. The rainy season in the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">valley of Tegla</span>, and its neighbouring countries forms tributaries to the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>; makes it overflow its banks; spreads fertility through the muddy soil of the country;
and supplies its dependant <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> with the necessaries of life.<br></span>

<p class="p noindent ">in the harvest field; and, in a very short time, the harvest is taken in. The day
of shearing is generally ended with dancing, of which amusement they are very fond.
The reader, perhaps, will inquire what sort of drink these dancers use? His mind will
very likely answer, <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Jamaica</span> rum, <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">French</span> brandy, or <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Irish</span> whisky. But no; water is their chief drink. They have a thick intoxicating liquor,
which they make from the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Indian</span> corn; but such a luxury is only used on extraordinary occasions. After all their
harvest festivities are over, they give themselves up to all the indolent habits prevalent
in these eastern countries; and lounge in their booths until the appearance of the
skies proclaim the distant approach of the rainy season.

<p class="p ">Widely different is the dry season, when compared with the rainy. In the dry season
the inhabitant of the vale employs his time with various pursuits;<span class="">*</span> <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: In">in</u> the rainy, nothing but agriculture occupies his attention. In the dry season he has
to dig wells to supply his household with water; in the rainy, he has only to go to
the rivulets for that supply. The dry season carries off all traces of water; scorches
all the grass and green trees; occasions deep chasms in the earth; and leaves the
poor <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> nothing to depend upon but his industry in the rainy season. <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Indian</span> corn, maize, and a flock of goats are generally

attention is attracted to the sun, the moon, and stars.
</p>
<p class="p ">About a month after the ceremony of circumcision, a number of young men convene at
the house where the rite had been performed, and sally from thence through the country
on hunting excursions. Everything falls a prey to the hunter's knife and spear; and
on these occasions the poultry-yard suffers most, while the poor owners are mere lookers
on at these depredations, it being deemed sacred to interfere with the behaviour of
these young men. Fasting is also very strictly observed by the devotee, one month
in the year being <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: allotted">alloted</u> for that purpose. Before daybreak, he rises and eats, and never again tastes anything,
until the evening stars declare the shades of night, when he breaks his fast and retires

feet high, thus leaving an open square in the centre. In the great heat of the dry
season, this square is used by the indwellers for sleeping apartments, where they
all lie down on the floor, and cover themselves with a large white sheet. If disturbed
by any wild beasts during the night, they betake themselves to the inner rooms. My
father's house consisted of two bedrooms, a kitchen, a mill room, and a goat room,
or fold. Goats' milk is considered a very wholesome commodity; it has a pleasing sweet
taste, which attracts the palate to it, and is said to possess a certain virtue in
medicinal qualities. The junior male members of the family are employed in taking
care of the flock. When a number of them are going in the same direction they mix
their flocks together, and each in his turn mutually takes care of the whole flock
till evening, when, by a cry peculiar to each goat-herd, his flock separates from
the rest, and follows him. He then takes them home, gets them milked, and secures
them in the fold. Those which are great favourites are generally taken into the sleeping
apartments. The milk must not be allowed to stand till the middle of next day, else
it would get quite sour. In order to prevent this catastrophe they either drink it
or make butter of it. Their mode of churning is as follows:—
</p>
<p class="p ">The gourd or calabash, which grows plentifully in these districts, is a plant something
similar to

<p class="p noindent ">a melon plant. It's fruit is like a melon, but the inside is bitter. The gourd melons
grow to different sizes, so that the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> make dishes and plates out of them, by cutting them into halves. The churn, however,
requires a whole melon, and one of the largest is taken for that purpose. After a
part of the pith is taken out, it is filled with water, and permitted to stand till
the inside is quite rotten. It is then cleaned out, secured into a rope basket, suspended
to the roof of one of the rooms, so as it can be reached by a person standing, and
there it serves as a churn,—the dairymaid's work being to put the milk into it, and
work it to and fro with her hands. No cream is extracted.
</p>
<p class="p ">The butter is generally used for rubbing their skins; and very little clothing being
used, many of them could be seen standing out in the sun like a number of polished
statues. After washing themselves with water, they never think that they are complete
till they rub some butter on their skins. The dress among the higher classes is a
long wide gown, reaching to the ancles, and wide open sleeves, so as not to confine
the wearer too much, and sandals on their feet. The lower classes, again, have a long
wide plaid, which they tie round their body, and over one of their shoulders, leaving
the other quite free; while in length it only reaches to the knees. This forms all
their variety of dress.

<br>
<p class="p noindent "><span class="seg smallcaps ">Youth</span> is the period in which true happiness is enjoyed. It is the time when all trials
and difficulties seem to lie in oblivion; and it is then that all principles can be
instilled into the tender mind. The mind in youth is not prejudiced, builds many castles
in the air although without any symptoms of ambition, is pleased and always desires
to please. It is like the shoot of a tender flower ere its leaves expand. It is the
germ on which strong propensities and sentiments are framed. It is in youth that the
stronger faculties of the artist, the genius, and the mechanic are pictured. None
of these propensities, however, were predominant in my mind while home was my residence.
Being the oldest of the boys, my pride was raised to no small degree when I beheld
my father preparing a farm for me. This event filled my mind with the grand anticipation
of leaving the goats to my brother, who was then beginning to work a little. While
my father was making these preparations, I had the constant charge of the goats; and
being accompanied by two other boys who resided near

<p class="p noindent ">my father's house, we wandered many miles from home, by which means we acquired an
acquaintance with the different districts of the country. 'Twas while in these rambles
with my companions that I became the victim of the slaveholder. While tending our
flock between two hills, we spied two men shaping their course towards us. They inquired
whether we had any goats for them, a term quite common in that country. Our reply
was, of course, in the negative; but they merely used this craft in order to deprive
us of suspicion. Myself being nearest to them, I was firmly secured in their hands,
and forced away whether I would or not.
</p>
<p class="p ">On showing symptoms of resistance, one of them procured a green twig, and whipped
me till the blood was falling in drops from my legs. After proceeding some miles,
we came to a house, where I was tied with ropes hand and foot, and laid down to rest.
Next morning, before dawn of day, my cruel master took the ropes off my legs, and,
setting me on a certain direction, desired me to walk while he followed with a large
whip. Terrified out of my judgment, I saw that there was nothing to be done but either
do or suffer. I of course chose the former. This was rather a harsh treatment for
a child of eight years of age. Commencing before sunrise, we continued our journey
till the middle of the day, when we arrived at a village. This village went under
the name of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tegla</span>. At the village of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tegla</span> my inhuman master disposed of me, and returned

<p class="p noindent ">home. On entering the house of my new master, what was my astonishment on seeing an
old acquaintance there, a girl with whom I had an interview a few weeks previous.
She, poor creature, had also fallen into the hands of the enemy only a few days before
myself. This girl, whose name was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Medina</span>, admonished me on this occasion, telling me to do whatever I was desired, assuring
me that the white man would not care for taking our lives, that the killing of us
would not cost him a thought.
</p>
<p class="p ">We were well secured with iron chains on our feet, and were never permitted to go
far from the house. We could never fall upon plans for effecting our escape, although
we often tried different means for that purpose. One night I managed to get the chains
off my feet, and would have escaped had not the fear of being recaptured prevented
me. Notwithstanding all the plans which <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Medina</span> resorted to, she could not get the chains off her feet. A short time after this,
a caravan (consisting of merchants and travellers) left the village of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tegla</span>. With this caravan our master joined, and, after a day's journey, we arrived at a
small village, where he was disappointed in his object, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, the disposing of us into another's hands, therefore he had no other recourse but
to return to his own country. Arriving at the village, we received the heart-rending
intelligence that our friends had been in search of us, and were frustrated, having
heard that we were taken to a distant land. Another caravan was soon

<p class="p noindent ">equipped for a farther distance. This was some four day's journey from the village
of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tegla</span>, to a large town called <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kordofan</span>, under the jurisdiction of the Pacha of <span class="country" title="A country.">Egypt</span>. The first night we pitched our tents at a well of water, not having seen a single
house on the whole of our journey. The second day we continued our journey till late
at night, when we received the guidance of some light from a distant village, where
we arrived and reposed ourselves. This village was called by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Albaharr</span>, or, as seen on our maps, Albeit. The inhabitants are a people who might be distinguished
among a thousand different nations. Such is their love of jewellery, that they wear
rings on their nostrils as well as ears. Instead of horses, or donkeys, or camels,
they ride upon bullocks, the noses of which are also adorned with rings, and to these
the bridles are tied. We stayed a few days at this place, and shared the unfeigned
hospitality of the people, who were uncommonly kind. During our stay here, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Medina</span> and I were taken to the camp of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Turks</span>, not far away from the village, where we were put through different exercises. The
first thing we were desired to do was to show our tongues, and then our teeth. The
rest of our limbs underwent a serious examination also. Having undergone this examination,
we were taken back to our lodgings again. The next day our master joined the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Turks</span>, who were returning to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kordofan</span>, and by that means ensured our fate of never returning to our native country. In
two days we

<p class="p noindent ">reached the point of our destination, and there our master disposed of us to an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span>, with whom we lived but two or three days. From an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> we fell into the hands of a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Turk</span>. My time while with the first three masters was employed doing nothing. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Turkish</span> gentleman found work for every body; and all the testimony I can bear to his good
character is, that he was one of the cruelest men in existence.
</p>
<p class="p ">Being an officer of the rank of an aga , his men suffered many harsh cruelties under
him. On one occasion, a soldier having been brought to his house for a small offence,
he took the office of corporal; and commanding four men to hold him down, beat the
poor man, till the blood was running from his cheeks. The keeper of his camels often
suffered in a similar way. My office was what might be called a general house-servant.
The duties of waiting the table, washing dishes, making coffee, and waiting for orders,
were allotted to me as my share of the work. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Medina</span> was made assistant cook for a short time, but I had the disagreeable misfortune to
see her sold to another <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Turk</span>; thus I was left to suffer alone.
</p>
<p class="p ">Some six months, however, relieved me of my hardships. To mention all the cruelties
I suffered at that time, would be quite needless. I will only notify a few of them.
My master, on whom I had continually to attend, punished every small fault with great
severity. If he called, he said I ought to hear him at whatever distance I might be.

<p class="p noindent ">mistress, my master interrogated me on my return with where have you been, and began
to thrash me. Self-justification was of no use. No moderate blows did with him, for
while he struck one side of my head, he met it at the other side also. I became almost
insensible, while the blood was running out of my ears. At another time, having made
some coffee by his own orders, I happened to make a few cups more than was required.
He said nothing at the time; but after I was in bed, he got hold of a horse whip,
and coming upon me unawares, thrashed me till I was quite speechless. I am persuaded
he would have killed me had not one of the domestics heard my cries, and come to my
rescue. Here I may mention that a very small child can stop a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Mahomedan</span> from revenging himself to too great an extent, by taking the whip, or whatever he
uses, from him. One of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> was the means of preventing my master from whipping me any longer. In <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kordofan</span> the houses are all of one storey high. The part in which I lived was chiefly occupied
by officers in the Pacha's service. My master was married, had two children, two female
slaves, two males, and myself. The other two being grown-up men, were taken out to
exercise along with the rest of the soldiers. When coming home from exercise, my master
was sure to be heard crying my name a quarter of a mile's distance from the house,
at which I had to run out to meet him and carry his sword home. These, and other sufferings
of the like nature,

<p class="p noindent ">prepared me for my subsequent career, and fitted me for the journey on the desert.
The circumstances which relieved me of my present master were as singular as the many
unlooked-for whippings I received. One evening, when the sun was going down, and everything
assuming the quietude of an <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">eastern</span> calm, a certain <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> came to our house, with whom I was desired to go and fetch some soap. I left everything
behind me, and went on my supposed errand. Having arrived at the man's house, he asked
my name, and told me that I was his property. I merely answered his reply by a look,
for ere this time I had become quite regardless of my fate. My new master, whose name
was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jubalee</span>, was a native of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Dongola</span>, and had come to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kordofan</span> on a trading excursion. He was in company with two others of the names of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Auchmet</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mahomet</span> from the same town. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mahomet</span>, the youngest of the two, was a cruel monster, torturing and beating the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> without any occasion. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Auchmet</span> was moderate. My master was of a quiet resigned temper, unless too much interfered
with, and very seldom whipped any of his <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span>. Having gathered six of us, they now thought of starting for their native country;
and to this effect preparations were soon made. They procured four camels, a horse,
and other necessaries for travelling, and started, shaping their course to the banks
of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>. Travelling in these eastern countries is attended with many perilous situations,

<p class="p ">Our journey (before reaching the banks of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>) occupied ten days. Many were the privations we suffered on our way, sometimes from
the excessive heat of the sun, and sometimes from want of water. During the middle
of the day, we were so much overpowered by the heat, that we often had to delay our
journey. At another time we had to exist a whole day without water, under the following
circumstances: The water camel, of which I had a particular charge, was going before
all the rest, and, unfortunately came, upon a dead camel lying on the road. The sight
and smell of this animal soon spirit-stirred it, and the result was, that it danced
and ran through thick and thin till the water bags, which were hanging on each side
of the saddle, were destroyed, having come in contact with some wood on the side of
the saddle. Fortune, however, had not altogether turned her face from us, for, in
the evening, we came to some wells, where we supplied ourselves and rested for the
night. From this place we pursued our journey to the banks of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>, and pitched our tents in the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">valley of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Senaar</span></span>, only a short distance from the town.

Taking with him <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mahomet</span>, and the rest of the travelling appendages, he went to the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">town of Senaar</span>, and there stayed for about a fortnight. During the whole of my time here, I had
very little to occupy me, so I ran about through the different places without the
least danger of meeting with a second kidnap. The vale at that time was in its prime,
the trees having on their coats of variegated green; the grass, the herbs, and flowers,
in full bloom; in short, everything was so beautiful, that nature seemed to contradict
the wickedness of the world. Happening one day to go to the river side, I observed
something uncommon moving on the water, with some white sheets filled with wind, as
I thought. I had a dish in which I intended to have carried some water home, but on
seeing this curious spectacle approaching me, I took to my heels, and leaving the
dish behind, presented myself almost breathless before the old man. On explaining
to him the appearance of the sight I had seen, he reprimanded my silliness, and told
me that it was a ship, assuring me that it would injure no person, provided the people
on board kept quiet, so I went back for my dish. This was the first time I ever saw
a ship. My master arriving from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Senaar</span> soon after, we started, with an additional number of merchants from the town, and
proceeded to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Dongola</span>. These merchants were not possessed of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span>, but had a great number of camels, and horses, and donkeys, thus making a

the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>, under the direction of one of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native Arabs</span>. At the end of that time, we prepared for a journey on the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="country" title="A country.">Libyan</span> desert</span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">Our <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> guide now left us to pilot ourselves, and returned home. I was entirely deprived
of a ride on any of the camels, being engaged in leading my old friend, the water
camel, which was now turned into an hospital. One of the female <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> having grown ill with a mortal swelling in her thigh, could not walk, and, in consequence,
I had to lead the camel on which she rode for nearly a month while crossing the desert.
She grew worse and worse every day till she died, and was buried in the sand, without
coffin or anything, while her death was not commemorated by the shedding of a single
tear. Such are the horrors of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slave</span> trade. Well do I remember the evening of her death. The sun was going down, the azure
sky appeared to witness the end with calmness and composure, while the surrounding
aspect threw a deep gloom over all our proceedings. I was thrown far behind the rest
of the travellers; my fellow companion in slavery began to totter on her saddle, and
death was soon announced by her falling from the camel. She was a native of <span class="country" title="A country.">Durfur</span>,—a woman in the zenith of her life. The death of this unfortunate female put me in
permanent possession of the camel during the remainder of the journey. By this time
I became a great favourite with my master; and on one occasion

of our journey, we were glad to see <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Old Dongola</span>, which predicted our nearness to the point of our destination. This town is situate
on the banks of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>, and is distinguished for its ruins. We stayed here a short time to recruit our strength,
and then proceeded to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">New Dongola</span>, along the river's banks. A few days saw us home, and on our arrival, the different
masters separated, each taking a share of the spoil with him. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Auchmet</span>, the eldest, took two of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> and a camel; <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jubalee</span> took for his share three of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span>—one having died in the desert; and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mahomet</span> took the rest of the live stock.

of the country. His shop was in one of the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Dongola</span> arcades, and was situated between a doctor's and a jeweller's. Besides myself, another
young man, of the name of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span>, graced the shop door. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span> and I became great friends, and often went together to play by the water side. After
the shop was shut one evening, we traced our steps, as usual, to the river's side,
but what was my singular astonishment on perceiving a female at a distance whom I
thought I knew. On going up to her, whom should I see but my old friend, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Medina</span>. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span> stood quite astonished when he heard her call me her brother. A small explanation,
however, soon settled him. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Medina</span> took us to her master's house, and introduced us to her fellows, but our time being
limited, we had to leave and get home as quick as possible, promising to return and
see them again. This was a thing which we never accomplished while together, for <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span> was sold soon after. A few days after this event, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span> and I happened to fall in with a pistol and some powder in the shop. Curiosity induced
us to load it. Being the first time I had examined a pistol closely, I desired <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span> to fire. He went to the window, and putting the mouth of it out to the open air,
fired it off, and loaded it again, asking me to fire it off next. Instead of using
the same precautions as he did, I fired it off in the shop, which caused a great smell
of powder in the arcade. This induced

<p class="p noindent ">the neighbours to investigate every place closely, who found that the greatest smell
proceeded from our shop. They accordingly took hold of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span>, and would have thrashed him had he not put the blame upon me. I now took to my heels
and ran for it, but my limbs were not sufficient to escape so many pursuers in the
arcade; in consequence I was captured, and received such a thrashing as I did not
forget in a very short time. Luckily our master was away from the shop at the time
of this occurrence. Contrary to our expectations, he only gave a laugh when he was
informed of our conduct. Soon after our master found out that it was not adequate
to keep two of us in the shop, and accordingly sold my friend, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Salama</span>. I was now obliged to deal alone among the spices. I made out to pay another visit
to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Medina</span>, who always gave me a kind reception, and had a little more time to relate our respective
histories. I found that I was with my seventh master, whilst she was only with her
fifth. Our time being so uncertain, we always bid each other good bye for ever, and
it proved so on this occasion. Two or three days after, my master brought a man to
the shop, who carefully scrutinized me after the manner of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slave</span> traders, and then I was desired to follow him as my future owner.

We arrived at his brother's house, situate a few miles
out of town, where two of his sons were waiting to receive us. I was put into a room
where two other <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> were sitting, and with them I soon entered into conversation. The one was a boy the
other a girl; the former from <span class="country" title="A country.">Durfur</span>, the latter from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Senaar</span>. Our master was merely staying at his brother's for the purpose of gathering <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span>, as his home was nearly a month's journey from <span class="country" title="A country.">Dongola</span>, on the way to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Cairo</span>, a small village, called by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Goortie</span>. Having gathered three of us, he and his sons now thought of going home, and began
to prepare accordingly. We started on a morning when the sun was shining on the green
fields of corn with bright illumination, and marched along till we found ourselves
in a desert country. Before I left <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Dongola</span>, my old master, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jubalee</span> (having heard that a travelling merchant had bought me), came and gave my character
as being an excellent traveller, and mentioned several incidents to ratify that belief
on my present master's mind. For this reason I was entrusted with one of the camels.

lands of the farm, which were between three and four miles from the house. About six

with some corn to the old lady's, on a donkey's back, she would not allow me to empty
the sacks, so I had to stand for about half a day to await my master's arrival. On
his coming up to me, he asked me why I did not empty the sacks? I told him my reason;
after which he went into the house, and a quarrel ensued. The neighbours gathered
about the house, and tried to prevent the quarrel; but, my master being in a passion,
they found great difficulty in getting him quieted. After he had broken a great number
of things, they managed to get him out of the house, and I obtained liberty to empty
my sacks and return home. My master also returned to his new wife's, and never went
back to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Goortie</span>, till within a few days of leaving for <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Cairo</span>.

We arrived at the first cataracts of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>, and it being impracticable for the ship to proceed farther, we had to change our
quarters. The masters busied themselves looking out for another ship to contain their
menagerie of human beings. For this purpose we had to travel by land, and finally
to sleep on land, before embarking again. Our new ship was a small one, and could
not contain all our luggage without a crush; in <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: consequence">consesequence</u>, some of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> sickened, and were paid for their trouble by receiving a good flogging.

march in military order. The grown up <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> led the van, and I, along with other young ones, marched in the rear, while our masters
kept on the flanks. On reaching the entrance to the royal city, we were all counted
by a man appointed for that purpose, who found that there were forty of us and ten
masters. As soon as the counting was over, each master took his <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slaves</span> and separated. Our master took us to an acquaintance of his, where he disposed of
us, one after the other, but not before two months elapsed. We were regularly taken
and exhibited in the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slave</span> market, where purchasers came to pick and choose. The grown up ones soon went off,
while the small live stock remained for a long time in the market. A month after,
my master shifted to another part of the town, a place near the barracks of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Cairo</span>. Here there were several of his countrymen, (under the employ of the Pacha ,) whose
duty it was to keep the gate of a manufactory of sundry wares. In this place he left
me, and went away, but where I could not tell. A week or ten days after he returned
for me, and took me to my old quarter, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">slave</span> market, where he soon disposed of me.

Contrary to my expectation, however, I was treated with the greatest clemency, received
many indulgences which I never met with before, and what completed my happiness was
the pains which <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. L——</span>, my master's son-in-law, took in learning me to read and write. When he found it
impossible to teach me himself, the duty devolved upon <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mrs. S——</span>, the housekeeper. I found much gratification in this novel treatment, and expected
to know great things by it. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mrs. L.</span>, who took great charge of me, never failed in seeing that I was comfortable. While
all the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">African</span> formalities were exchanging for European fashions, four months elapsed, after which
the family sailed up the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span> to the first cataracts, taking me, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mrs. S——</span>, and an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Italian</span> servant, of the name of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jacquomo</span>. The first cataracts are about 400 miles from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Alexandria</span>. A whole month was spent in going and coming back from the cataracts; and the objects
which occupied the particular attention of the family were the ancient buildings then
standing in ruins. On the left bank of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nile</span>, and at some distance from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Cairo</span>, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Egyptian</span> pyramids present a huge spectacle, having the appearance of small hills.

many other edifices were built in the distant ages of antiquity, when the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Egyptian</span> monarchy flourished under its native dynasty. It is now a country ruled by a despotic

This was the first steam-boat I ever had been in, and was curious to know how the
vessel went without sails. I asked one of the sailors, who explained the whole mystery
by telling me that it went upon wheels.

return to <span class="country" title="A country.">Malta</span> again. I had fallen asleep during the night, and was not aware of our return till
morning. When I went on deck I learned that the family had gone ashore during the
night, while the sailors, who were all <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Maltese</span>, told me that they were desired to remunerate their toils by appropriating me to
themselves. I began to cry, and and could not be pacified till they assured me to
the contrary. They gave me some breakfast, and two of them (who had received previous
instructions) took me to my master.
