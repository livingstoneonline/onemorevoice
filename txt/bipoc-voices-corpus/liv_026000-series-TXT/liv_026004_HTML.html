<p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">Are there not many still amongst us who were once strongly attached 
to all our old customs, and the superstitions of our forefathers? Let me 
ask them, what was it that made you forsake those ancient customs? 
My friends, it was the Word of God, which sunk deep into your hearts. 
We did not lay them aside as a man does an old garment when it is no 
longer fit to wear. No! but because it opened our eyes to see the folly 
of them. St. Paul truly says, that though our bodies may be separated 
according to the flesh, still the spirits may be near. This is the case with 
the Members of the Church Missionary Society. We do not know them 
personally, nor the place where they live; but we know them in our 
hearts as our sincere friends, and the remembrance of what they have 
done for our welfare will always claim our love.</p></div>
