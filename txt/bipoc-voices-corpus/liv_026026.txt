"WHAT HAVE I TO DO ANY MORE WITH IDOLS?"
[...]
The following account of a poor heathen led to see, under the illuminating influence of the
gospel, the vanity of idols, and the preciousness of Jesus as a Saviour, is taken from the
journals of Mr. James White, one of our native catechists at Lagos, in the Bight of Benin, a
place where Missionary work has been only recently commenced, and where it is carried on, as
yet, amidst very much of difficulty and discouragement—
April 6, 1853—Having been requested by one
of my Sunday-scholars,
by the name of Ige, to come and take away her idols, and informed that
she had obtained her mother's and husband's consent, because they had
contributed towards procuring them, I went, accordingly, with Mrs.
White, two of our converts, and our school teacher, to her house. We
found that she had assembled her relatives together, and we read and
prayed with them; and after encouraging her, she brought me her
Shango, Elegbara, Osoyin, Obatala, and Ifa. Notwithstanding the
violent opposition of her enemies, she stood firm and undaunted in her
faith, as the following narrative will show.
Her priestess having heard that she renounced
idolatry, paid her a visit,
with a hope of reclaiming her. "I have heard," said she, "that you have
become a book-woman" (Christian). "Yes," Ige replied, "I have served
idols long enough, and I now determine to try this new mode of worshipping
God." "I beg you," said her priestess, "not to do so, else we shall
no longer be friends." "Though you may hate me on this account," continued
Ige, "yet I love you, and would recommend to you this new religion."
"Are you mad?" said the woman. "You may think me so," replied
Ige; "but I pray that you will one day become as mad as myself." After
this discourse, Ige gave her something to eat, which she accepted; but
first of all offered a pinch of it as a thankoffering to Ige's Shango, that was
in one corner of the house; upon which Ige exclaimed, "How have you
robbed me of my right! Instead of thanking me, your benefactress,
you have given my praise to another: so," continued Ige, "we have given
God's honour to idols." The priestess, having nothing more to say, left her,
wondering at the mighty change that had taken place in her.
A Sierra Leone emigrant, who lately arrived here,
found the same firmness
and resolution in her, which distinguishes her character. A very
grave old man, indeed, he is; and has perhaps never once attended church
in his whole life, though he was located in a place where the sound of the
gospel incessantly invites sinners to accept of a Saviour's dying love.
He was once at my house, where he met Ige learning her Primer. He said
nothing, but went to Ige's mother, to question why she had allowed her
daughter to go to a white man's house, "for I see they have brought the
same lies that they teach in Sierra Leone: but who will ever believe them?"
Then, putting his hand into his pocket, he produced his Ifa. "See," said he,
"I have just come from white man's country. This is what took me there
and brought me back again." Ige, who was then present, silently listened
to him till he had done, and then answered, "Though I have never gone
to a white man's country, yet I am not a stranger to all our idolatrous
system, for I was one of its votaries, and I know that white men do not
practice such lies and frauds as we do; and since I have not discovered
any thing but the truth in all they say, I am determined to believe their
teaching." After a warm debate on both sides, Ige remained invincible,
and the old man went away ashamed.
