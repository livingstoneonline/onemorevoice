    <p>I <span class="small">HAVE</span> just settled down in the Tsomo Mission house, under the superintendence of the Rev. E.
      J. Barrett, at Butterworth. On my journey I called at Kamastone, and preached there one Sunday,
      morning and afternoon. The power of God came down upon the people: many came forward and got
      good. You see that I am sent to a very dangerous place, where there is a great battle, and my
      Superintendent lives many miles away. Please, Sir, to pray for me very much, that God may bless
      my labour in this place, as He has done in others. There seems to be a good feeling. By the help
      of God, I hope to see a very good work next Sunday. The work has already commenced. An
      Englishman was converted last night in my house. He had been seeking the Lord since last Sunday,
      and last night was soundly converted, and slept in my house. He is going to meet in class now. I
      have a very good work here. If I had a little time with you, I should be able to preach in
      English with ease. More than twenty sinners have been saved here at the station alone.</p>

    <h3 class="center"><em>Letter from Rev. Charles Pamla to Rev. W. B. Boyce, dated
      Fernley, Tsomo, July 26th, 1872.</em></h3>
    <p>I<span class="small">T</span> is scarcely four months since I have been sent to this station, and the Lord has owned my
      labours here; a hundred and eighty heathens have been converted in my Circuit. More than one
      hundred is composed of adults, and the rest young people. We have been going from kraal to kraal
      in gathering these: one native chief and his family has been brought in, and many of his
      councillors.</p>
    <p>I visited about thirty kraals. And we had services morning and evening, and preached, and held
      prayer-meetings, from hut to hut, and many out-door services. Hundreds of the heathen came to
      hear us, and after these services in the day-time, we had a great deal of talk about Jesus,
      telling them how God loved the world, and gave His only Son to save sinners. Many of them broke
      into tears, and came forward as penitents; and after a long struggling in tears, they at last
      found their Saviour, and rejoiced with an unspeakable joy. The Europeans are very thinly
      scattered in this territory, but there are eight added to the Society since my coming here.</p>
    <p>I hold a service in English occasionally for the Europeans at their own request. I have formed
      an English class, which I meet in the Mission house, which is composed of ten members at
      present. Some of these express their joy now in the Saviour, who have also showed their regret
      and repentance by coming forward as penitents along with the natives during the service, and
      were not ashamed to confess Christ before men.</p>

    <h3 class="center"><em>Letter from Rev. Boyce Mama, Etamara, to Rev. W. Impey, Heald
      Town, June</em> 21<em>st</em>, 1872. </h3>
    <p> I <span class="small">WANT</span> to let you know about the work of God here at Tamara. Since you sent me here I have
      never wrote to you about the work.</p>
    <p>The word you sent through the Superintendent of the Annshaw Circuit to my Superintendent at
      Mount Coke about W. Shaw Kama to take Tamara, and for me to take Pewuleni, has reached me. I am
      sorry, because I have not been here long enough. I should like to have stayed here a little
      longer. I have been sowing the seed, waiting to see the fruits. I have great hope that the seed
      which has been sown here shall grow. But still I don't refuse to leave this place, although I
      should like to stay longer. I am quite willing to go to Peuleni, as I believe that it is the
      will ofGod. I have promised God that I shall go any where He sends me. I am no more to do what
      pleases me, but to do God's will.</p>
    <p> When I first came here the number of members was less than it is now. There were sixteen
      members at Tamara, and forty-seven on trial: now there are forty-eight members and forty-seven
      on trial. At Equgqwala there were ten members, and now there are thirty-six. There were five
      classes, and now there are thirteen classes. Total, eighty-four members, and good many on trial.
      There was no school at Tamara, now there is one. There was no school at Equgqwala, and now there
      is a school. There were no chapels; and even now there are none, only that I am busy preparing
      to have a nice chapel here at Etamara; poles, wattles, &amp;c., are ready. My intention was,
      that as soon as I have Tamara chapel, one must be erected at Equgqwala.</p>
