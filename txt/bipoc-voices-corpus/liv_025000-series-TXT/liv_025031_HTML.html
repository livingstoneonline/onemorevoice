  <p>MY DEAR FRIENDS,�I, Lutchmee, beg to send you many salams, and write the following for your
    information:�</p>
  <p>By the grace of God, I attend the Mission-school supported by you, and am glad to say that I am
    improving in my learning. I read the Word of God daily, and every Sabbath morning I join my
    school-fellows in the Mission Chapel to repeat my lessons. I also go with them to dear Mrs.
    Wardlaw's house every Saturday, to give up my lessons to her. I am a very poor girl, and I beg
    your assistance and further support. Psalm xix, 12: "Cleanse thou me from my secret faults."</p>
  <p>With many salams,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">Yours affectionately,<br>
    LUTCHMEE</p>
