Native Female Education.

I also have the pleasure of forwarding several
letters from the girls of the Sunderland School.
These will give a better idea of the progress
they are making in their various studies than
any statement of mine regarding them. Some
of the children, we fondly trust, are giving
indications of their interest in divine things;
looking, with humble faith to "Him who
love them, and gave Himself for them."

MY DEAR FRIENDS,&#8212;I, Chenjee, your affectionate girl, send my salams. Up to this day, 17th
April, 1849, I have attended the Missionary-school at Bellary, supported by kind friends at
Sunderland, and, by the help of God, I try to learn the truths of his Word daily. On Sunday
morning I go to the Mission Chapel to repeat my lessons to her. I do all I can to assist my kind
mistress in teaching the younger girls. I need your support and feel very thankful to you for
all you have done for me and my school-fellows. Psalm xxv, 5: "Lead me in thy truth, and teach
me thy statutes." &nbsp;&nbsp; With many salams,
Yours affectionately,
CHENJEE.

MY DEAR FRIENDS,&#8212;I, Tooloosee, your affectionate friend, send you many salams. By the favour
of God I attend the Mission school at Bellary supported by you, and endeavour to learn my
lessons well. I read the Word of God daily, and every Sabbath morning I repeat my lessons for
the week. I also give up my lessons to dear Mrs. Wardlaw at her house. She is very kind to me
and to all my school-fellows. My father and mother are exceedingly delighted to find that I am
making progress in my learning. I am a poor girl; therefore I beg you will look with pity on me,
and favour me with your support. Luke xviii, 13: "God be merciful to me a sinner." &nbsp;&nbsp; With many salams,
Yours affectionately,
TOOLOOSEE

MY DEAR FRIENDS,&#8212;I, Lutchmee, beg to send you many salams, and write the following for your
information:&#8212;
By the grace of God, I attend the Mission-school supported by you, and am glad to say that I am
improving in my learning. I read the Word of God daily, and every Sabbath morning I join my
school-fellows in the Mission Chapel to repeat my lessons. I also go with them to dear Mrs.
Wardlaw's house every Saturday, to give up my lessons to her. I am a very poor girl, and I beg
your assistance and further support. Psalm xix, 12: "Cleanse thou me from my secret faults." &nbsp;&nbsp; With many salams,
Yours affectionately,
LUTCHMEE
