							<p>Within the last eight months, six of our pupils from the
								<settlement>Philipton</settlement> day-school passed their examinations for the office of
								schoolmaster, and have been appointed to their several spheres of labour; and it is pleasing
								and encouraging to see the attitude that evince in imparting instruction, and the pleasure
								they take in communicating knowledge to their little countrymen.<space extent="1"
								unit="chars"/>The more I see of working the system of native agency, and of growing
								intelligence and devotedness of our young men, more confirmed I become in the police we must
								ultimately look for the great results of Missionary enterprise.<space extent="1"
								unit="chars"/>Whether we look at the system in point of economy, the constitutional
								qualifications of the natives to endure the influence of climate, their acquaintance
								[with<!-- Typo in original. MT --> the habits, customs, and language of their countrymen,
								facilities they possess of ingratiating themselves with the people; and consequently the
								ready access they can obtain their understandings and affections:&#8212;all these
								considerations seem to warrant the conviction we entertain of the success that would attend
								the establishment of a comprehensive and well organised system of native agency.<space
								extent="1" unit="chars"/>The appointment of native schoolmasters has had a suprisingly
								beneficial effect on the young men, and even on the school children; as many of them are
								thereby encouraged to hope that they may at some future time be enabled to fill the
								situation of teacher, or other office of respectability, and are consequentaly led to apply
								themselves more diligently to the improvement of their minds, in order to qualify themselves
								to undertake it.</p>

							<head rend="center italic">Education of Schoolmasters.</head>
							<p>Previous to appointment the schoolmasters go through the following course :&#8212;English
								reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, <term type="collective">Roman</term> and <term
								type="collective">English</term> history, use of the globes, natural history, and English
								grammar.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After their appointment they are expected to pursue
								their studies by coming to <settlement>Philipton</settlement> once a week to receive such
								aid as we can give them; and I am glad to say that their improvement is very
								encouraging.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The books the <orgName>Society</orgName> sent us

							<p>Since my return from <country>England</country>, three new school-rooms have been built,

								seats, &amp;c.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<lb/>
							<head rend="center italic"><orgName>Local School Committee</orgName>.</head>
							<p>A committee under this name has been appointed, whose duty it is to co-operate with the
								Missionaries in extending the work of education in the Settlement, and watching over the
								instruction of the children.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I have found it advisable to
								invite some of the most intelligent and respectable of our young men to become members of
								the committee.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>No sooner was the proposal made to them, that
								they came forward to join it.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Their principal work, as I have
								said, is to assist the Missionary in founding new schools, to see after the conduct of the
								schoolmasters, to take care that the people contribute regularly towards their support and
								to oversee the building of school-rooms, &amp;c.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In the first
								place, but the appointment of such a committee, the people become interested in, and
								qualified for, the management of their own affairs, so as gradually to carry on the
								education of their own children, without looking ofr assistance to the parent
								<orgName>Society</orgName>; and, secondly, it supplies a stimulant to the exertion in our

							<p>Besides superintending the schools, I take my regular turn in preaching and itinerating

								the two recently established settlements of <settlement>Blinkwater</settlement> and
								<geogName><settlement>Fish River</settlement></geogName>; both of which I am happy to say
								are doing well under the care of our two native teachers, <persName>Dirk Hather</persName>,
								and <persName>Andreis Jagers</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>On my last visit to
