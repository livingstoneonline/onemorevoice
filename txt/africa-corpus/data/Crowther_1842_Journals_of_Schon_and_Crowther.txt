PREFACE. 


In the year 1841, an Expedition, consisting of 
three Steamers of the Royal Navy, was sent up 
the Niger by Her Majesty’s Government. Their 
views in entering on tliis undertaking are thus 
explained in a Letter from Lord John Russell, 
then Colonial Secretary, to the Lords of the 
Treasury, Dec. 26 , 1839 : 

Her Majesty’s Confidential Advisers are compelled to 
admit the conviction, that it is indispensable to enter upon 
some new preventive system, calculated to arrest the Foreign 
Slave-trade in its source, by counteracting the principles by 
which it is now sustained. Although it may he impossible 
to check the cupidity of those who purchase slaves for ex- 
portation from Africa, it may yet be possible to force on 
those by whom they are sold, the persuasion that they 
are engaged in a traffic opposed to their own interests, when 
con-ectly understood. 

M'ith this view, it is proposed to establish new commercial 
relations with those African Chiefs or Powers, within whose 
dominions the internal Slave-trade of Afiica is carried on. 


11 


PREFACE. 


and the external Slave-trade supplied with its victims. To 
this end, the Queen has directed her Ministers to negotiate 
conventions or agreements with those Chiefs and Powers ; 
the basis of w^hich conventions would be — 1st, The aban- 
donment and absolute prohibition of the Slave-trade ; and, 
2dly, The admission for consumption in this country, on 
favourable terms, of goods, the produce or manufacture of 
the territories subject to them. Of those Chiefs, the most 
considerable rule over the countries adjacent to the Niger 
and its gi-eat tributary streams. It is therefore proposed to 
despatch an Expedition, which would ascend that river by 
steam-boats, as far as the points at which it receives the con- 
fluence of some of the principal rivers falling into it from 
the eastward. At these, or at any other stations which may 
be found more favourable for the promotion of a legitimate 
commerce, it is proposed to establish British Factories ; in 
the hope that the Natives may he taught, that there are 
methods of employing the population more profitable to 
those to whom they are subject, than that of converting 
them into slaves, and selling them for exportation to the 
slave-traders. 

In this communication it w'ould be out of place, and in- 
deed impracticable, to enter upon a full detail of the plan 
itself— of the ulterior measures to which it may lead — or of 
the reasons wliich induce Her Majesty’s Govenunent to be- 
lieve that it may eventually lead to the substitution of an 
innocent and profitable commerce for that traffic by wliich 
the Continent of Africa has so long been desolated. For my 
immediate purpose, it will be sufficient to say, that having 
maturely weighed these questions, and with a full perception 
of the difficulties which may attend this undertaking, the 
Ministers of the Crown are yet convinced that it affords the 
best, if not the only prospect of accomplishing the great 


PREFACE. 


Ill 


object so earnestly desired by the Queen, by her Paiiiainent, 
and her People *. 

It is probable that Sir T. F. Buxton’s important 

Work, “the AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE AND ITS REMEDY,” 

contributed to fix the attention of the Government 
strongly on the subject; and to prove to them, 
that other measures, in addition to those pre- 
viously adopted, were necessary, in order to ter- 
minate that trade in man which had so long and 
so deeply afflicted Africa. 

The formation, too, in 1839, of the society 

FOR THE EXTINCTION OF THE SLAVE-TRADE, AND FOR 
THE CIVILIZATION OF AFRICA, and tlio proceed- 
ings of its Committee, were calculated to sus- 
tain the Government in the course which they 
contemplated, by powerfully influencing public 
opinion in favour of measures directed to check 
and ultimately to extinguish the Slave-trade, by 
the substitution of legitimate commerce, and the 
encouragement of agriculture. 

The attention of the Committee of the Church 
Missionary Society was naturally drawn to this 
enlightened and benevolent attempt on the part 
of the British Government to benefit Africa; and 
they were encouraged to indulge the hope that the

Expedition might open the way for carrying on 
Missionary operations in the interior of that 
continent, through the medium of one of her 
noblest rivers. They therefore applied to Lord 
John Russell for permission to send with the Ex- 
pedition two persons connected with the Church 
Missionary Society, in order to collect such in- 
formation, during its progress, as might enable 
them to decide, on valid grounds, on the practica- 
bility and expediency of forming a Mission up 
the Niger, should the general results of the Expe- 
dition favour, and the pecuniary means of the 
Society admit, of such an extension of its opera- 
tions, — The request of the Committee was most 
kindly granted.' — The individuals selected by them 
to accompany the Expedition were, the Rev. James 
Frederick Schon, and Mr. Samuel Crowther. 

Mr. Schon had spent ten years in Sierra Leone, 
in the zealous discharge of his duties as a Mis- 
sionary of the Society. He had thus become in- 
timately acquainted with the African character, 
and had acquired some knowledge of the Native 
Languages. He had also had his mind turned 
toward the Niger Expedition, and the prospects 
of improving, through it, the condition of the 
Natives of Africa, by imparting to them the 


PREFACE. 


V 


Gospel of Christ, and the social blessings which 
are the sure concomitants of the cordial recep- 
tion of it. 

Samuel Crowther is an African, about thirty- 
three years of age. He is of the Eyo Nation, 
situated in the vicinity of the Niger. He was sold 
into slavery, to the Portuguese, in 1821 , when 
about eleven years of age*. The slaver to which he 
was consigned having been captured by a British 
Cruiser, he was carried into Sierra Leone. This 
brought him under the instructions of the Mis- 
sionaries of the Church Missionary Society ; and 
by their instructions he has, through the blessing 
of God, much benefitted. Of his religious cha- 
racter the Committee have every reason to hope 
well; and his attainments, under many disadvan- 
tages, are such as to have encouraged them to 
invite him to this country, with the view to his 
admission to Holy Orders, for Missionary labours 
in his own country, should the Bishop of London 
deem him qualified for the Ministry. 

* Tlie particulars of this part of his history were some years 
ago detailed by himself, in a Letter to one of the Secretaries of 
the Society. This Narrative, which strikingly developes the 
atrocities and miseries of the Slave-trade, is printed at the end 
of thisVolume — Appendix III.

PREFACE. 


Mr. Schon and Samuel Crowther joined the 
Expedition, on its touching at Sierra Leone. 
Mr. Schon was placed in the “ Wilberforce,” and 
Samuel Crowther in the “ Soudan.” 

The proceedings of the Expedition, and the 
distressing effects of the climate on the Europeans 
engaged in it — which compelled its premature 
return to the sea — are detailed in the Journals 
which compose the principal part of the Volume. 
To these Journals are added two Letters : one 
from Mr. Schon, and one from Samuel Crowther. 
These explain their respective views as to the 
results of the Expedition, and the measures best 
calculated for the evangelization of Africa. 

That the Expedition failed, to a considerable 
extent, of attaining the object for which it was sent 
out, cannot be denied. On the other hand, the 
documents now submitted to the public prove that 
it has not been unattended with advantage : — 

1. The Chiefs in the interior of Africa have 
had the British Nation and character brought 
before them in a point of view in which they were 
unknown before. They had previously known us 
too well as agents in the nefarious traffic in men. 
Now we have been seen and recognised as bene- 
factors — visiting them at a great sacrifice of life

and money, solely to promote their benefit, by 
the substitution of agriculture and lawful com- 
merce, and all the conveniences and comforts 
which spring from them, in the place of a trade 
scarcely less injurious to the slave-traders than 
to the victims of slavery themselves. 

2. The point of view in which our national 
character was thus presented to the Chiefs vi- 
sited by the Expedition, together with the com- 
munications held with them, had the effect of 
disposing them cheerfully to make treaties with 
us for the abolition of the Slave-trade. Views 
on the nature and consequence of this traffic were 
presented to their minds, of which they were 
before ignorant; but the truth of which, when 
thus presented to them, there is reason to believe 
they felt as well as acknowledged. 

On this head Mr. Schbn remarks, in his 
Journal — 

I always observed, that whenever tlie motives were 
explained to them by which England or English Peoi)le 
were aetuated in their exertions to abolish the Slave-trade, 
every advocate of it was silenced ; and those who had before 
defended it would stand before us convicted in their own 
consciences of crimes of the blackest tinge, and would blush 
as much as Black people can blush. “ tV''e knew no better,” 

they 


Vlll 


PREFACE. 


they would often say ; “ hitherto we thought it was so God’s 
wiU, that Black people should be slaves to 'White people. 
IVhite people fii’st told us we should sell slaves to them, and 
we sold them ; and 'Wliite people are now telling us not to 
sell slaves, and we wiU not sell them again and, as another 
justly added, “ If 'White people give up buying, Black 
people udU give up selling*.” 

A foundation has thus been laid for future 
measures in the same direction. 

3. The Expedition has been the means of making 
us better acquainted with the languages and dia- 
lects of the tribes on the banks of the Niger and 
in the interior of Africa. This is a point of much 
importance. If Christianity and Civilization are 
to be extensively imparted to Africa, the principal 
native languages must be employed as the media 
for that purpose. Before they can be so employed, 
these languages must be learned and reduced to 
writing by Europeans. Much valuable informa- 
tion, in subserviency to that end, has been ac- 
quired by means of the Expedition f. 

4. The intercourse carried on by the Expe- 
dition with the Chiefs has served deeply to 
impress their minds with the superiority which 
White Man’s knowledge gives him over Black

Man. The consequence is natural. They desire 
“ White-Man’s Book that is, they are desirous 
to receive Teachers from White Men, that they 
may thus become possessed of their knowledge, 
and of that power and those numerous advantages 
which knowledge, they clearly perceive, carries 
along with it. An important step in advance is 
thus gained for the future Missionary Teacher. 

5. Another result of the Niger Expedition is, 
the proof which it has supplied of the willingness 
of the people, and of the Chiefs themselves, to 
receive religious instruction from Black Men, 
even from such as they knew had been sold into 
slavery. This fact is of very great importance, in 
its bearing on the propagation of Christianity in 
Africa. It must be conceded, that the Niger Ex- 
pedition has shown that European agency cannot 
be successfully employed to any considerable ex- 
tent for the accomplishment of that great end. 
It is therefore not a little consolatory to have 
ascertained, at the same time, that Natives, as 
Religious Teachers, are acceptable to Natives; 
and that, consequently, there is every encourage- 
ment for the employment of them. The following 
passage, from Mr. Schdn’s Journal, illustrates this 
remark : — 


X 


PREFACE. 


Aug. 28. — The business with Obi commenced again early 
this morning, on board the “Albert." The object for which 
I had come to this country was not forgotten : on the con- 
trary, 1 admired Capt. Trotter’s anxiety that all should be 
fully explained to him. Obi confessed that he did not know 
God, nor the right way of worshipping Him ; and expressed 
an earnest desire that Teachers should be sent to him and his 
people. ATe could make him no decided promise that AA’hite 
Missionaries would ever settle in his dominions; but ex- 
pressed our belief that we could get good people, who spoke 
his o'wn language, and had learned to know God and to 
worship Him, at SieiTa Leone ; at which he was much 
pleased. An English and an Arabic Bible were presented to 
him, though he cannot read either of them : persons may 
come, however, to his town who may be able to make 
proper use of them. I opened the English Bible, and made 
Simon Jonas read a few verses to him, and translate them 
into Ibo. The verses he read were some of the Beatitudes 
of Our Saviour, in the fifth chapter of St. IMatthew. Obi 
was uncommonly taken with this. That a AThite Man 
could read and write, was a matter of course ; but tiiat a 
Black man — an Ibo man — a slave in times past — should 
know these wonderful things too, was more than he could 
ever have anticipated. He seized Simon’s hand, squeezed it 
most heartily, and said, “You must stop with me: you 
must teach me and my people. The AV’hite people can go 
up the river without you : they may leave you here imtil 
they return, or until other people come;’’ and he would 
not be satisfied, until Simon had made his desire known 
to Capt. Trotter. After much consideration, it was agreed 
tliat he should remain here till our return from the interior.

6. The Niger Expedition, by establishing the 
facts just adverted to, has strengthened the obli- 
gation to train Natives of Africa as Religious 
Teachers of their countrymen. The necessity of 
this course, in order to the Evangelization of 
Africa, had long been felt by the Committee of 
the Church Missionary Society, and means had 
already been employed by them in Sierra 
Leone directed to this end ; but the adoption by 
them of further measures for the attainment of 
the object may be mentioned as a consequence of 
the Niger Expedition; for after communication 
with Mr. Schon, on his return to England from 
the Coast of Africa, they, on the 22d of February 
last, adopted the following Resolution : — 

That, adverting to the afflictive results of the Niger Expe- 
dition, and the position of the Society in Sien-a Leone, the 
Committee are of opinion that further measures should be 
adopted, in order to train Natives in Sierra Leone with a 
view to their being employed as Teachers of their country- 
men, and in order also to fix the most considerable native 
dialects, and make translations into those dialects for Missio- 
nary purposes. 

Such are some of the beneficial results which 
may be fairly attributed to the Niger Expe- 
dition, notwithstanding its admitted failure as

to the attainment of much that was anticipated 
from it*. 


The necessity of a Native Agency for amelio- 
rating the religious and social condition of Africa 
being manifest, it may not be unsuitable to ex- 
plain a little more fully the views of the Com- 
mittee of the Church Missionary Society as to 
the means best calculated, under the Divine 
Blessing, for the attainment of the object. 

In oi'der to an effective Native Agency, as Reli- 
gious Teachers in West Africa, three things are 
requisite : — 

1. Due educational training of hopeful Native 
Youths. 

2. The reducing to writing of the principal 
Native Languages of Western Africa; and the 


* With regard to the loss of valuable lives during the progress 
of the Expedition — and afflicting indeed has the loss been — it 
has been pertinently observed : “ It is surely very unjust to press 
more heavily on the misfortunes of pure unmixed benevolence, 
than on those of mere gain. There is something very ungenerous, 
in charging a plan for the extinction of the greatest evil tliat 
ever afflicted humanity, with calamities, whidi, had they oc- 
curred in an ordinary enterprise of commerce, would either have 
attracted no notice at all, or only that of commiseration and 
sympathy ,” — African Civilization Report,\M2.

giving instruction in them, grammatically, to 
Youths to whom they are vernacular. 

3. Tlie making Translations, especially of the 
Scriptures, into the languages so reduced to 
writing, for the use of Missionaries and Teachers. 

The Committee are of opinion that Sierra Leone 
possesses some peculiar advantages for carrying 
out these views : — 

1. In that Colony a large proportion of the 
Africans liberated from Slave-ships have been 
located. They, of course, bring with them their 
respective languages. These languages or dia- 
lects amount, Mr. Schon estimates, to forty ; and 
include the principal of those used by the tribes of 
Western Africa. It is, too, a remarkable circum- 
stance, that the Liberated Africans in Sierra Leone 
cling to, and consequently retain, the language 
which is to them respectively vernacular. Hence 
the opportunity is presented of acquiring and 
fixing in Sierra Leone, for Missionary purposes, 
the principal languages of Western Africa. This 
very important advantage is possessed by Sierra 
Leone, incomparably beyond any other spot what- 
ever. It is calculated that three or four of these 
languages would suffice to carry the Christian

Niger and Tshadda ; and that two others would 
enable him to penetrate from Sierra Leone to 
Timbuctoo. 

2. Many of the Liberated Africans in Sierra 
Leone have learned English in the Society’s 
Schools, and have acquired more or less general 
as well as religious knowledge. The person 
employed in fixing a given language would thus 
be materially aided in his work, as he would be 
able to prosecute it in connexion with those 
between whom and himself English was a com- 
mon medium of communication. 

3. The Missionaries of the Society have already 
been engaged to some extent in acquiring and 
fixing the languages of West Africa, by means of 
their intercourse with the Liberated Africans 
congregated in Sierra Leone. Some progress 
has already been made in the Bullom, the 
Sherbro’, the Timmanee, the Susoo, the Aku, the 
Yaruba, and the Haussa*. The Committee have 
now devolved this branch of labour specifically 
upon certain Missionaries in Sierra Leone, of 
aptitude for lingual and philological pursuits,

besides engaging the service of one individual 
exclusively as a linguist. 

4 . Among the Liberated Africans of Sierra Leone 
there is a strong and natural desire to return to 
the countries from whence they were carried into 
slavery. The advancement which many of them 
have made in religious knowledge and social im- 
provement fit them for returning to their native 
places, with the prospect of benefitting their coun- 
trymen, by imparting to them the advantages 
which they have themselves acquired in Sierra 
Leone. Hence a strong inducement to them to 
promote the views of the Committee, both with 
regard to education and the native languages. 

5 . The general result of the Society’s Mission 
in Sierra Leone may also be referred to, as faci- 
litating the carrying out of the views of the Com- 
mittee, in training Natives as Religious Teachers. 
This Mission was commenced in 1804 . In addi- 
tion to the usual obstacles to the success of a 
Christian Mission among an uncivilized people, 
still more formidable ones were encountered in 
this instance, arising out of the insalubrity of 
the climate to Europeans. Great, in consequence, 
have been the difficulties of this Mission, and many 
its afflictions; yet it has pleased God signally

to bless tlie labours of the Teachers employed 
in it. Though they have not been in numbers 
sufficient to occupy all the villages in the Colony, 
yet, out of a population of upward of 42,000 of 
Coloured Persons, as exhibited in the Census of 
1840, the Returns from the Mission, made up 
to the 31st of December last, represented the 
religious state and advantages of the people, 
under the charge of the Society’s Missionaries 
and Catechists, as follows : — 

12 Ordained Missionaiues. 

7 European Catechists. 

1 Surgeon. 

1 Linguist.

which the scene leaves on the mind is one of pleasing asto- 
nishment. The effects, instead of falling short, I think, far 
exceed the means employed, so as to leave no doubt of the 
blessing of Heaven having rested on past efforts ; which 
proves the susceptibihty of the Africans for improvement. 
The Christian aspect of the villages exhibits a most en- 
gaging sight, and forces the exclamation, “ What hath God 
wrought!" The success of Scriptural Education, accom- 
panied ^vith Missionary labours, has nowhere been surpassed 
in the history of modem Christianity. 

The work is not artificial and illusory, but sober, gradual, 
deep, and may therefore be expected to be permanent and 
progressive. On this ground I take my stand, and fearlessly 
invite the scrutiny of the most sceptical doubter, and of the 
most inveterate foe ; and direct him to the Schools and to 
the Churches, and to the cottages of the Christian Africans, 
and then leave him to his own conclusions *. 

* A gentleman, well known for his philanthropic exertions in 
belialf of the Slaves, lately visited this Colony, and gave tlie 
most flattering testimony to the state of education. After ex- 
amining one of the Church Missionary Schools, he said to the 
writer: “ I was not at all prepared to expect what I have just 
witnessed. I have visited schools in my own country, in the 
West Indies, and in other parts of the world ; but I must con- 
fess that in all my experience I have never seen a better regu- 
lated school. Tlie readiness with which the children answered 
questions put to them, their advancement in general knowledge, 
and the intelligence they evinced, surpassed every thing I recol- 
lect to have seen before.” Upon the writer asking again if he 
thought the school in every respect equal to any he had visited 
in the large provincial tow'ns : — “ Yes ; and you may include 
London too. It is impossible,” was his emphatic expression, 
“ but that such schools must do much good.” — Sermon, pp. 18, 19.

Without inquiring here, whether the original 
selection of Sierra Leone, as a point for exerting 
a beneficial influence on the religious and social 
condition of Africa, was a judicious one or not — 
or whether due means have been employed for 
developing the agricultural capabilities of the 
Colony, and improving the state of the Liberated 
Africans located there * — the influence of the Mis- 
sion upon the people, and their comparative ad- 
vancement in religious and social improvement, 
is unquestionable, and point out Sierra Leone 
as offering a decidedly advantageous theatre for

nial Chaplain of Sierra Leone, thus speaks in the Sermon 
akeady quoted : — 

This colony was selected as the base of operations, whence the 
light of Civilization and Christianity was to issue forth into the 
surrounding countries. But the friends of Africa have always 
been taunted with its utter failure in answering the expectations 
that had been raised, and producing effects at all corresponding 
with the expenditure laid out upon it. I will not stop to inquire 
whether or not these expectations were too sanguine in compa- 
rison with the means employed. But the taunt itself, founded 
on a wilful miscalculation of contingent circumstances, betrays 
the enmity in which it originates. Whereas a fair and just cal- 
culation of the whole of the proceedings, and a correct estimate 
of present appearances, compared with a sober and legimate ex- 
pectation founded upon the nature and amount of the means 
employed, and the mode of their application, must lead to a 
modification of such an opinion, if not to a complete change.

raising the African in intelligence, and those moral 
and social habits whereby he may become a fitted 
instrument for meliorating the condition of his 
countrymen. 

In accordance with the views already explained, ^ 
the Committee propose to enlarge their present j 
Seminary, which is eligibly situated at Fourah 1 X- 
Bay, near Freetown, so as to receive an increased 
number of Students, and to give them a sound, 
general, and religious education. 

The existing buildings are not only too small for 
this purpose, but are so dilapidated as to render a 
re-erection on that account unavoidable. The cost 
of the buildings requisite for the accommodation 
of two Masters and thirty Students would exceed 

The usual metliod of judging on the subject is highly unfair ; for 
no careful separation is made between the amount expended in 
connexion with the abolition of slavery, and what is laid out by 
Government in the improvement of the Colony 

The funds applied to the improvement of the Liberated Afri- 
cans, subsequently to their emancipation, have been extremely 
limited. No encouragement whatever has been held out to 
industry in the cultivation of the ground : no capital has been 
expended in teaching the rearing of any of those staple com- 
modities for the Englbh market which the soil is ready to yield. 
Arriving in the colony in a condition of tlie most abject wretched- 
ness, just rescued from the horrors of slavery, the re-captured 
Negro is almost immediately thrown upon his own resources, in

the Committee of the necessity for the good of 
Africa of the Educational measures which have 
been explained, the state of the Society’s funds 
precludes the erection of the buildings necessary 
for the object out of the regular income of the 
Society. Under these circumstances, the Com- 
mittee have directed that a Special Fund should 
be opened for defraying the expenses of the 
buildings required ; and that an appeal should be 
made to the Members of the Society and to the 
friends of Africa for their contributions in aid of 
the object. This appeal is inserted at the end of

wealth to engage tlie labours of others, wliich would enable the 
rich to enlarge his property, and would give employment and the 
means of subsistence to the poor. Accumulation of property in 
agricultural pursuits is slow ; and without it there can be no 
cultivation on an extensive and profitable scale. Private enter- 
prise has never been directed to this colony, which in other places 
has given impulse to industry, and imparted the means of im- 
provement. With thtee disadvantages there is no legitimate 
ground for expecting any rapid advancement, and its absence 
should not create disappointment. — Sermon, pp. 15 -- 17.

generation to generation have degraded, demo- 
ralized, and devastated Africa, we close these 
remarks with the following passage from Sir 
T. F. Buxton’s work, in which, toward the close of 
the “ REMEDY,” he records this as his deliberate 
judgment : — 

From these facts, gathered from different sources, the 
inference does not appear by any means doubtful, that 
whatever methods may be attempted for ameliorating the 
condition of untutored man, Christianity alone can pene- 
trate to the root of the evil— can teach him to love and to 
befriend his neighbour— and cause him to act as a candidate 
for a higher and holier state of being. 

The hope, therefore, of effecting Africa’s civilization, and 
of inducing her tribes to relinquish the trade in man, is, 
without this assistance, utterly vain. This mighty lever, 
when properly applied, can alone overturn the iniquitous 
systems which prevail throughout that continent. Let 
Mi^ionaries and Schoolmasters, the plough and the spade, 
go together, and agriculture will flourish ; the avenues to 
legitimate commerce will be opened; confidence between 
man and man will be inspired; whilst Civilization will 
advance as the natural effect, and Christianity operate as 
the proximate cause, of this happy change. 

If, indeed, it be true that such effects will follow in the 
train of Religion, and that Christianity alone can effect such 
changes and produce such blessings, then must we pause 
before we take a single step without it. The cause of Africa 
involves interests far too great, and results far too stupen- 
dous, to be trifled with. The destinies of unborn millions, 
as well as of the millions who now exist, are at stake in the

project ; and the question is one of life or of death, of com- 
fort and happiness or of unutterable misery. 

I believe that Christianity will meet the necessities of the 
case, and will prove a specific remedy for the moral evils of 
Africa*.

I received the certain intelligence of the arrival

arrived very unseasonably for me, my dear wife 
having hardly recovered from a severe illness. [ 
thought it best not to make known the circum-

into the arms of Divine Mercy, and sought di- 
rection as to my proceeding; feeling convinced 
that I should not be forsaken. This being done, 
I approached the bed of my afflicted partner, and 
made her acquainted with the arrival of the 
vessels. She was not taken by surprise ; but on 
the contrary, and to my astonishment, calmly re- 
plied : “ Oh ! I will bear it . Never mind me : 
I am only sorry that I cannot assist you more 
in getting ready. Leave me : go on with your 
business. God will take care of me.” — To find her 
in such a frame of mind was very cheering to 
me. I knew well that flesh and blood could not 
have given it to her, and that it was an answer 
to many prayers. I learned to understand anew, 
that it was the will of ‘God that I should engage 
in this important work. Hitherto the Lord has 
removed all obstacles, and has given me more 
than ordinary strength to prosecute my prepara- 
tions for it ; and although I more than ever feel 
my unfitness, I am not dismayed : I can lay hold 
on the precious promises of God, and will go on 
my way rejoicing. 

On the following days, I assisted Captain Trotter 
in selecting Interpreters of the various languages 
spoken on the banks of the Niger and in the

adjacent countries. Twelve persons were en- 
gaged for that purpose, of the following nations : 
Haussa, Ibo, Kakanda, Yaruba, Bornoa, Laruba, 
Filatah, and Eggarra. Time only will prove whe- 
ther we have made a proper selection; and all 
further remarks on them may be postponed, until 
they shall have been called upon to act in those 
spheres of labour to which they are appointed. 
Those who had attended me for the last ten 
months, and from whom I had acquired some 
knowledge of the Ibo and Haussa Languages, re- 
mained faithful to their promise, and were willing 
to accompany the Expedition, whatever their pe- 
cuniary remuneration might be. How well would 
it have been, had more been trained for this 
important work. It is still very desirable that 
others should be taken under a course of instrue- 
tion, to be ready for another ojiportunity of a 
similar nature. There was no want of people 
who were willing, and even anxious, to leave 
Sierra Leone, in order to join the Expedition. 
Seamen, labourers, interpreters, and mechanics, 
such as they were, offered their services in great 
abundance ; though I am afraid they were not all 
actuated by proper motives. Of some who were 
chosen, I have reason to believe that it is their

hearts’ desire to render themselves useful to their 
fellovE-creatures, and to make known to them the 
unsearchable riches of Christ. 

The Expedition caused great excitement among 
all classes; and the most cheering manifestation 
of it was, that a spirit of prayer seemed to have 
been poured out upon all Denominations of Chris- 
tians for its success. On the 28th of June, Divine 
Serx-ice was held at St. George’s Church, Free- 
town, by the Rev. D. F. Morgan, Colonial Chaplain, 
who delivered a most excellent Sermon on the 
occasion, well deserving a wider circulation. In 
the afternoon, a Prayer Meeting was held in the 
same Church, which was well attended. The 
Gentlemen of the Expedition addressed a few 
w’ords to the people, explaining the objects of their 
Mission, and asking an interest in their prayers. 
Oh 'may that Spirit which animated them then, 
never leave them ! May they, myself, and all, 
ever be mindful of this, that it is not by might 
nor by power, but by the gracious influence of the 
Spirit of God, that alone success can be expected. 

By the kindness of Captain Trotter, a cabin in 
his own department w'as prepared for my occu- 
pation, until we should arrive at Cape-Coast 
Castle. I took possession of it on the 2d of July,

the day fixed upon for our departure. My feelings 
were such as are common to all, when called upon 
to leave those whom they love most dearly on 
earth ; but I was abundantly supported by the 
consolations which Christians alone can expe- 
rience ; and could, with all calmness of mind, cast 
my care upon the Lord, knowing that He careth 
for me. My own conscience bore me witness that 
I was actuated by a concern for the salvation of 
the poor, oppressed, and benighted Africans; and 
that I should feel abundantly rewarded for any 
self-denial and privation I might have to endure, 
if I could but be in the smallest degree useful 
to them. 

July 3 — Slept but little during the night. My 
mind was much occupied. I felt that I was in 
a situation altogether new to me. On rising, I 
once more saw the coast of Sierra Leone, and the 
Banana Islands. I began to translate Haussa; 
but was soon obliged to relinquish it, on account 
of sea-sickness. I could not keep in my cabin ; 
feeling better on deck, where I could enjoy fresh 
air. In the evening, we met the “ Ferret,” a 
British ship-of-war, cruising along the coast, near 
the Turtle Island, belonging to the Sherbro Coun- 
try. We were sorry to learn that tliere was much

sickness on board ; and that the Captain himself, 
besides sixteen men, were laid up with fever. 

A serious accident occurred this evening. An 
able seaman, Samuel Johnson, fell from the mast, 
and expired a few moments after. This is the 
first accident on board the “ Albert,” since it left 
England; but the “ Wilberforce” and the “ Soudan” 
had each lost a man, in a similar manner, before. 
— What a sudden call from time to eternity! 
May it lead all of us to make our calling and 
election sure, and be ready whenever we shall be 
called hence 1 

July 4 : Lord's Day — Felt very unwell all day; 
confined to my bed the principal part of it : could 
take no active part in the Religious Services, nor 
join the company in worshipping God ; but was 
able to read a little in my cabin, and to hold com- 
munion with my God. The weather becoming 
very fine in the afternoon, I was delighted with 
the sight of Cape Mount, the northern extremity 
of the Colony of Liberia : the prospect of being 
permitted to put my feet again on solid ground 
next morning cheered my spirits not a little. 

July 5 — When I got up this morning, I ob- 
served that we were fast approaching Cape 
Mesurado. The town of Monrovia presented a

lovely view from the sea. We cast anchor close 
to the Bar, about 8 o’clock a.m. The Kroomen* 
were the first to welcome us, coming out in their 
little canoes. Heavy rain began to fall, which 
prevented us from landing for about two hours. 
A small boat soon arrived, with a kind invitation 
from the Governor of the Colony to the Com- 
mander and any of the Officers. Captain Trotter 
kindly allowed me to embrace the first oppor- 
tunity to go ashore. The Bar is extremely bad : 
we were nearly upset ; and twice got aground, 
the waves washing our backs : I did not, there- 
fore, feel very comfortable, until we had reached 
the shore. Governor Buchanan received me very 
kindly. In his house I met a Missionary from 
Cape Palmas, connected with the American Epi- 
scopal Church : he is on his way to Sierra Leone, 
for the recovery of his health ! I visited the 
Episcopal Methodist Missionaries at the place ;

though the writer is satisfied of its incorrectness. The nation 
from which these African sailors are selected is called Grebo. 
Grebos, or Grebomen, would, therefore, be preferable. Kroomen, 
or Crewmen — men composing the crew — appears to be derived 
from their occupation. Others of the same nation are called 
Fishmen ; the origin of which is evidently English, referring 
likewise to their occupation.

Dr. Goheen, and Mr. Burton, the Superintendant 
of the Seminary. As the students were absent, I 
could not ascertain what progress they had made 
in those branches of science in which they are 
instructed. 1 regretted this the more, as there 
was no Day School open, which I might have 
seen. 

July 6 — The weather has been very bad to-day : 
continual rain. No one, that was not obliged, went 
on shore. We left Monrovia about 7 o’clock p. m. 

. July 10 — The intervening days presented little 
of interest. I have felt in a great measure the 
inconvenience of a seafaring life. My cabin has 
been hot; the deck wet; and repeated attacks 
of sea-sickness have indisposed me for mental 
exertion. I could commence something very 
zealously in the morning; but have been gene- 
rally obliged soon to lay it aside again. To-day, 
particularly so, I was obliged to keep on deck ; 
and was therefore very glad, when, at 3 o’clock 
P.M., we cast anchor near the river called Sinoe. 
Our object is to procure fire-wood; as our stock 
of coals is nearly consumed, and the wind still 
against us. There was no vessel in the har- 
bour ; and no person was seen for some time, 
except Kroomen and Fishmen, who came out

in their little canoes, with plantains and bananas 
for sale. 

July \\\ Lord's Day — We spent a quiet Sab- 
bath on board. Divine Service was performed, 
in the morning by myself, and in the evening by 
Rev. T. Muller, 

July 12 — I accompanied Captain Trotter and 
some other gentlemen to see the American Set- 
tlement, called Greenwell, the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of which is peopled by Kroomen, Fish- 
men, and Blue-Barra People. The Settlement 
was founded in 1838 ; when thirty-eight emigrants 
arrived from America, and were located at this 
place. Four of them died soon after, of the 
country fever. The common impression, how- 
ever, about them was, that they killed them- 
selves; either in having eaten too much, or in 
refusing to take medicine, &c. — There is a great 
inclination, not only in the Americans, but in 
others too, to disprove the unhealthiness of the 
climate, in spite of daily experience and observa- 
tion ; for which I am unable to account. But 
I cannot easily be deceived by such expressions. 
I have seen too much of Africa, and its injurious 
effects upon European as well as upon American 
constitutions, to feel justified in allowing such 
B 3

REMARKABLE HEATHENISH CEREMONY 


charges against the poor victims which sunk 
under the climate ; — and why not admit the 
truth ? 

From Greenwell I went to a small village of 
Fishmen, situated n.w. of the Settlement; where 
I witnessed an interesting ceremony of native 
superstition, which well deserves a page in my 
Journal. I much regret, that, not understanding 
the language of the Fishmen, I cannot determine 
the exact meaning of the transaction. In a 
large open space, between several houses, there 
was a considerable number of Natives, of both 
sexes and all ages, assembled. Two women 
liad seated themselves under the projecting roof 
of a native dwelling-house, with musical instru- 
ments — that is, small calabashes garnished with 
iron and brass rings and hooks — ^ in their 
hands ; from which they dexterously produced the 
same sound continually, accompanying their in- 
struments with vocal music, singing the same 
sentences over and over again. On their left 
hand was an old man, sitting on the ground, 
beating a drum made of the trunk of a tree 
merely hollowed out. In front of them was a 
small fire ; to the right of which was a heap of 
charms of various kinds ; as, horns, claws, teeth 


NEAR THE RIVER SINCE. 1 1 

and skins of animals, filthy pieces of calico, &c. 
There was also a country mortar, such as is 
generally used by the Natives to beat their rice 
in, containing a little water, with some herbs 
or leaves, and earth, beaten up in it. The music 
having continued for some time, a woman, of 
about forty or forty-five years of age, stepped for- 
ward, placing herself before the mortar above 
described. Her legs were covered, almost to her 
knees, with iron rings — whether as an ornament 
or a punishment I cannot say : to me they would, 
undoubtedly, have proved the latter. Another 
woman then placed herself on the other side of 
the mortar, and with both her hands took out 
some of its contents, smearing it over the other 
woman’s face, chest, back, arms, and legs. This 
being done, the person thus marked, decorated, 
or sullied, whatever it may be called, began 
dancing about in a small circle for a few mi- 
nutes, occasionally blowing a large horn. An 
old man now made his appearance, and put a 
few questions to the dancing- woman ; which, if 
I am not mistaken, were always answered in the 
affirmative ; while the eyes of the woman appeared 
faint, and an unnatural perspiration covered her 
whole body. The old man then took two white

fowls, a cock and a hen, and, speaking in a low 
and mysterious voice, handed them over to the 
great actress. He placed them first under her 
left arm ; after which she lifted them up with 
both hands, showing them to all the people as- 
sembled. She then took a few grains of rice, and 
scattered them among the charms which were 
lying in front of him, placed a few grains on 
the musical instruments, and held the heads of 
the fowls near the rice, which they picked up 
eagerly. It appeared to me that the people were 
pleased at this ; and the fowls were removed out 
of sight, alive. A young kid was now brought 
forward by the same old man, and presented to 
the woman, who tried whether it would eat rice ; 
but not a single grain being eaten, she handed 
it over to the old man ; who, after murmuring 
a few unintelligible words — not addressed to any 
body, as far as I could observe — seized it by its 
hind legs, and with all his strength struck its head 
three or four times on the ground : then, turning it 
swiftly round, he seized its head with both hands, 
and knocked its body several times on the ground 
with such \'iolence, that every bone of the poor 
creature must have been broken. When the kid 
was dead, the people walked off, and the ceremony 


NEAR THE RIVER SINo£ 13 

seemed to be over. A Fishman told me that the 
people would now sit down quietly, and eat and 
drink. 

Three explanations were given of the meaning 
of the affair. The first was, that the woman, hav- 
ing been accused of witchcraft, had been obliged to 
drink the “ saucy water,” as it is called, prepared 
from the bark of a tree, and containing poisonous 
qualities; and as it did not kill her, her inno- 
cence was clearly proved, and the ceremony was 
intended to acquit her publicly and honourably of 
the charge. The second version was, that it was a 
nuptial feast: and the last, that the woman was 
a “doctor”; that she had given some medicine 
to the old man by which he had been benefitted ; 
and that, in return for her services, he presented 
the fowls, rice, and kid, to her. Which of these 
versions, or whether any one of them is correct, 
I could not ascertain. 

The neighbourhood of Greenwell, and the banks 
of the river Since, are inhabited by people who 
pass under three different names ; — the Blue-Barra 
People, who seem to be the Aborigines of the 
place; the Fishmen, and Kroomen, who seem 
to be settlers or emigrants from their own 
countries, which lie s. e. from this place. They 


14

have all the same marks on their faces, chests, 
and arms. Some of the American Settlers 
asserted that they spoke three different lan- 
guages ; while others maintained that one was 
spoken by all. From the little I have been 
able to observe, I feel inclined to think that 
the last assertion deserves more credit than the 
first. I have endeavoured to take down a few 
words ; and on repeating them to Blue-Barra 
people, Fishmen, and Kroomen, the result 
appeared to be in favour of one language for 
all. It must, however, be admitted, that as 
they have only been tried with people associated 
on a small tract of land, and constantly inter- 
mixing w’ith each other, the evidence is not 
conclusive. The words are the following: duh, 
“one”; sub, “two”; tuh, “three”; nie, “four”; 
mu, “ five” ; mune duh, “ six” ; mune suh, “ se- 
ven ”; mune tuh, “ eight” ; supe duh, “ nine” ; pua, 
“ten”; mira, “nose”; nigburu, “man”; nigiro, 
“woman”; gibe, “boy”; giburuweh, “ girl” ; biri, 
“low”; brabari, “ sheep”; boguro, “goat” ; shoa, 
“ beef” ; ni, “ water” ; tong, “ salt” ; hira, “ palm 
wine”; honi, “sit down”; gea, “get up”; dieni, 
“ eat”; nnahni, “ drink water” ; gidemgbo, “ come

July 15 — A sufficient quantity of fire- wood 
being obtained, steam was got up about nine 
this morning, when we left Sinoe. It was a 
very line day, and the air pure and healthy ; which 
had a good effect upon me. 1 began to feel much 
better, and gradually lost the uncomfortable sen- 
sations which sea-sickness produces. For this I 
felt thankful to the Author and Giver of every 
good gift. 

July 16 — We passed Cape Palmas early this 
morning. The current is now more in our fa- 
vour. The weather fine — no rain — as agreeable 
to me as a fine summer’s day in Germany 
could be. I regret that I had no opportunity 
of seeing Cape Palmas, and visiting the Mis- 
sionaries there ; especially as this Settlement is 
said to be the most flourishing of all. It forms 
a State of itself, and is not dependent on the 
“ Liberia Commonwealth.” There are Missiona- 
ries of the American Episcopalian Church, and of 
the Presbyterian Church, at this place. They have 
done much toward reducing the Grebo Language 
to writing; and have already printed several 


16 


DIX COVE. 


translations of portions of Scripture, and other 
elementary books. They convey religious instruc- 
tion to the Natives through the medium of their 
own language; but pay much attention to the 
teaching of the English Language also. 

July 18 ; Lord's Day — As our fuel was nearly 
exhausted, and the current still in our favour, 
steaming was relinquished this morning, and 
we sailed along the coast very smoothly all 
day. The vessel, and all the people, were very 
clean : I trust all enjoyed the privileges of the 
day. After Morning Service, we were oppo- 
site Fort Dix Cove, belonging to England. About 
six or eight men came out to us from the shore, 
in a flat-bottomed canoe. The headman ap- 
peared to be an intelligent man, and spoke English 
very well. His native language is the Ahanta, 
of which he gave me the numerals to ten. As 
it was the Lord’s Day, I did not feel quite at liberty 
to require more information of him on languages. 
I mention them here: aku, “one”; amu, “two”; 
arra, “three”; arsah, “four”; ernu, “five”; ashia, 
“six”; noua, “seven”; awothre, “ eight ”; ahuaro, 
“nine”; bura, “ten.” There is but one European 
merchant residing at Dix Cove ; and for the last 
three montlis, an English Missionary, Mr. Watson, 


CAPE-COAST CASTLE. 


17 


who arrived here from Cape Coast, and is in 
connexion with the Wesleyan Missionary Society. 
The articles for trade which they brought along 
with them, in their canoes, consisted of pine- 
apples, plantains, sugar-cane, and cassada ; but 
I believe none were purchased of them, it being 
the Lord’s Day. The appearance of the country 
was very pleasant: the weather hot, but not 
oppressive. No rain all day. 

July 19 — Arrived at Cape-Coast Castle at 10 
o’clock A.M. Many of the Natives came out to us, 
in their flat canoes. Their articles of trade 
consisted of a great abundance of pine-apples, 
much inferior in flavour to those of Sierra Leone ; 
plantains, bananas, most excellent yams, cassadas, 
Indian-corn, monkey-skins, beautiful parrots, and 
nicely-worked baskets. 

July 21 — I have now spent some days at Cape 
Coast, and a few observations on it may be ex- 
pected from me. A description of political affairs, 
and of its gold and gold-dust, I may safely leave 
to others better qualified than myself; but I must 
not omit to mention the kindness and hospitality 
which I have received at the Governor’s hands. 
I have frequently been on shore, and have ob- 
served with pleasure the great influence which 


18 


VISIT TO A FARM. 


the Governor has obtained over the Natives, even 
over such as reside at a considerable distance 
from Cape Coast. They appeal to him in all 
their quarrels with each other ; and generally bow 
to his decision, and comply with his demands. 
An instance of the kind happened while we were 
there, and several of our party were present 
while the important palaver was settled. As I 
was only present at the opening of the Court, 
I prefer leaving the description of it to those 
who were present from the beginning to the 
end. 

The Governor kindly invited me to accompany 
him, with several gentlemen of our party, to see 
an excellent farm, about five miles distant from 
the Castle, called Napoleon. We went in the 
Governor’s carriages, each of them being drawn 
by four men of the Fanti Nation; rather a 
novel mode of conveyance, but by no means 
disagreeable, especially in the cool of the even- 
ing. There is no great choice left to any 
one who wishes to travel by land in these parts 
of Africa. There being no horses, one must 
either be carried in baskets, or drawn in car- 
riages by his fellow men, where the roads will 
admit of it. Several trials have been made by the

inhabitants to keep horses ; but it is said that none 
ever lived longer than about four months, owing 
to the bad quality of the grass on which they are 
fed. The farm referred to is the property of a 
merchant at Cape Coast. He has daily employ- 
ment on it for sixty men, each of whom receives 
twopence halfpenny sterling per day. It contains 
several thousand coffee-trees, planted in beautiful 
order, and full of fruit : there are many more 
young trees, fit for transplanting the next 
season. I here saw, for the first time, the bread- 
fruit-nut-tree, and several West-India plants, which 
I had long wished to see introduced into Western 
Africa. I am sorry to add, that the cultiva- 
tion of cotton has been relinquished, on account 
of the low price paid for it. One cannot but 
wish that all the settlements of Europeans on 
the western coast of Africa were in a similar 
state of cultivation ; as thereby its healthiness 
might be much improved, and many of the 
comforts of civilized life might be obtained 
without much trouble and at little expense ; 
and, in my opinion. Missionary Societies w’ould 
do well if they were to allow their agents to 
incur a moderate expense in agricultural pur- 
suits. But great care should always be taken 


20

respecting the choice of situations ; and such 
employments should never engage much of their 
mind or valuable time. The Missionary ought 
to be an example, in every thing that is good 
and laudable, to those to whom he is sent; and 
they will naturally look to him for direction 
and advice in all their temporal as well as spi- 
ritual concerns. But they will not — in fact, they 
cannot — believe him to be sincere, however much 
he may speak to them of the beneficial effects 
both on body and mind of the labours of the field, 
as long as they see his own garden overgrown 
with weeds, and full of every thing that is ob- 
noxious to health and comfort. 

I was much pleased with the Boys’ School, kept 
in the Fort, at the expense of the Governor. 
The scholars read remarkably well ; and answered 
my questions on Bible History and Arithmetic 
very correctly. It is attended by 150 scholars, 
of whom some are grown-up young men. The 
want of slates, to instruct beginners in the art 
of writing, is supplied by boxes filled with fine 
sand, in which they learn to form letters. The 
Wesleyan Missionaries have established a Girls’ 
School, under Mrs. Freeman, which is attended 
by 50 Girls of the Fanti Nation. The Missio- 


INTEREST EVINCED BY THE GOVERNOR. 


21 


naries address the Fanti People through inter- 
preters. Whether any of them had become con- 
verts to Christianity, I was not able to ascertain. 

Divine Service is performed every Lord’s- 
Day morning, in the Castle, by the Governor 
himself; but, at his request, I took the Service 
for him on Lord’s Day last. The congregation 
consisted of the soldiers, school-children, about 
forty Black people of the town, and two Europeans. 
The whole demeanour of the congregation evinced 
that they were in the habit of attending Divine 
Service regularly. The singing was good, and 
the responses of the congregation devotional. 

The Governor’s anxiety for the improvement of 
Africa is apparent in many things. He keeps a 
light-house on Fort William : has a small printing- 
press in the Castle, and a printer employed con- 
tinually. One of the printer’s former apprentices 
is now employed by the Expedition, without whose 
aid no use could be made of the printing-press 
on board. The Governor kindly allowed me to 
print an Address to the Chiefs and People ; which 
I translated into the Haussa Language, during 
my passage from Sierra Leone. Here a large 
field is open for Missionary labours. The Fanti 
and Ashantee Nations call upon the Christian

world, Come over and help us ! Although they do 
not actually use these words, yet should not their 
misery, and their bloody superstitions, loudly 
speak to the hearts of Christians ? 

The present season is considered to be the most 
unhealthy on shore. The rains are over ; and 
there is generally a heavy fog upon the hills in 
the morning, which gives them an aguish appear- 
ance. Every possible attention is paid to health 
on board our vessels : exposure to the sun, and 
the dews of the night, are most carefully avoided; 
and no one of the ship’s company is permitted 
to spend a night on shore. We have hitherto 
been highly favoured with health on hoard the 
“Albert” — not a single case of fever has oc- 
curred. I regret to add, that in the “ Wilber- 
force” there were twelve on the sick list last 
week, chiefly Black men; one died of apoplexy, 
another of fever, and the rest are considered con- 
valescent. It is supposed that exposure to heavy 
rain at Grand Bassa, where water and fire- wood 
were taken in, was the cause of the sickness. There 
has been one case of fever, too, on board the 
“ Soudan,” likewise of a Black man : he is now 
doing well. The sufferers are principally Blacks 
from the West Indies, or such as have been absent

from Africa for many years. — Our prayer to God 
is, that He may keep us and bless us in the work 
in which we are engaged ; and while we are daily 
reminded of the frailty of our nature — the liability 
to sickness and death — it is a great comfort to 
know that many of us are delivered from the fear 
of death, by faith in Him who tasted death for all 
men, and has brought life and immortality to light. 

July 29 — Mr. Walden, a Missionary of the 
Wesleyan Missionary Society, finished his earthly 
career this evening at Cape-Coast Town : he was 
ill but a few days. It is painful to observe, that 
almost every vessel carries home mournful tidings 
from this coast. How unsearchable are God's 
ways ! The field is prepared for labour ; yet 
scarcely have His servants entered upon it be- 
fore they are called hence. Truly, those who are 
anxious to engage in the Missionary work must 
not count their own lives dear unto themselves. 

July 30 — I left the “Albert” this morning, and 
took up my abode on board the “ Wilberforce.” 
The “Albert” and “ Soudan” left Cape Coast this 
evening. 

July 31 — The “ Wilberforce” left Cape Coast at 
9 o’clock P.M., and arrived at English Accra at 
2 o’clock p.M. on the following day. 


21 


VISIT TO ENGLISH ACCRA. 


Aug. 2 — Her Majesty’s Steamer “Pluto” ar- 
rived this morning at Accra, from Sierra Leone, 
and brought me a most welcome letter from my 
dear wife; which would have been much more 
so, had not its burden been a mournful one. It 
contained the intelligence of the death of Mrs. 
Schmid, the partner of a beloved Missionary 
Brother. Numerous as have been the calls on 
my sympathy during my residence at Sierra 
Leone, I am as susceptible as ever of the feel- 
ings which accounts of this kind are calculated 
to produce ; and while endeavouring to medi- 
tate upon the gain of the departed, the feelings 
of a bereaved husband present themselves con- 
tinually to my mind, reminding me of the duty 
of offering up prayers and supplications on his 
behalf. I am ever led to reflect on the deaths 
of Missionaries, in their connexion with the Mis- 
sionary work in Africa; and my unbelieving 
heart seems at times to discover nothing in them 
but discouragement. And here, where I am 
writing these lines, every thing appears pecu- 
liarly calculated to depress my spirits, and to 
keep my hopes of Missionary success extremely 
low. From the window of my cabin, I cast my 
eyes upon the Danish and English Settlements 


REFLECTIONS. 


25 


of Accra ; and the Missionary history of the 
former place presents itself to my remembrance, 
from an early period down to the present day. 
I see, as it were, the faithful Moravian Missio- 
naries suffer and die ; the Basle Missionaries 
struggle with difficulties, endure privations and 
hardships of every description for a few months — 
two only for a few years — and then, all but one, 
exchange time for eternity ; but can discover no 
fruit of their self-denying labours. 

I spent only a few hours on shore at English 
Accra; and returned to the vessel with a heavy 
heart, because ' of the misery, degradation, and 
superstition of the inhabitants. In one of the 
principal streets of the town there is a large 
Fetish, made of clay, in the shape of a human 
being, painted white on one side and red on 
the other, which is worshipped by the Natives. 
But shall these considerations weigh down my 
spirit ? Shall I allow myself to be overcome with 
grief and despondency ? Yea, if the work were 
of men, I might; but as it is the work of Him who 
must reign till He hath put all enemies under His 
feet, I dare not despair. Missionaries may die 
prematurely, to speak after the manner of man ; 
but their Captain dieth no more ; death hath no

more dominion over Him. He went forth conquer- 
ing in times past; has subdued many nations, 
countries, and tribes ; and is still going on con- 
quering, and will go on, until the earth shall he 
full of the knowledge of the Lord. The Spirit of the 
Lord has spoken it, and His testimony is true. 

Aug. 4: — We left Accra at 10 o’clock p.m., and 
proceeded with all possible speed toward the 
mouth of the river Nun. 

Aug. 8: Lord's Day — Since the last date, we 
have been favoured with beautiful weather until 
to-day, when a tornado made its appearance, 
about 1 1 o’clock a.m. I was engaged in perform- 
ing Dixdne Service ; but was obliged to stop, be- 
fore I had gone through the Prayers. It cleared 
up in the afternoon, and we were permitted to 
join in worship on deck. 

Aug. 9 — Rain falling in torrents all day. The 
sea beat through the port-hole of my cabin, 
thoroughly wetting my bed and cabin ; and not a 
dry spot could be found in the gun-room, to sit 
do^vn and engage in any thing. We cast anchor, 
about 8 o’clock a.m,, near the river Sangara, mis- 
taking it for the Nun : the error was not dis- 
covered until evening, when the rain ceased, and 
the sky became clear.

Awj. 10 — We left our anchoring- place early this 
morning for the river Nun, a few miles from 
Sangara. The other vessels being there, prepa- 
rations for entering the river were commenced’ 
by removing on board the Steamers the stores 
from the transport 'accompanying the Expedition 
to this place. As no assistance could be obtained 
from the Natives as at other places along the 
coast, and all had to be done by our own people, 
much delay was occasioned.

Aug.lb — To-day, about 10 o’clock a.m., the 
“ Wilberforce ” left her anchorage, and crossed the 
Bar safely, never having less than three fathoms 
of water; and anchored in the river Nun about 
2 o’clock p.M. All were in good health and 
spirits. The sailors gave three hearty cheers 
when we had crossed the Bar, and enter ed in the 
long-looked-for river. My own feelings differed 
not much from theirs, though I could not give vent

to them in a similar manner. Our situation had 
been any thing but comfortable for the last five 
or six days, the vessels rolling heavily ; but the 
want of water was the greatest inconvenience. 
We were sorry to learn that the “ Albert,” which 
with the “ Soudan ” had entered the river two 
days before, had lost Mr. Bach, by fever, this 
afternoon. One of our men was taken ill. 

Aug. 16 — I felt very anxious to see some of 
the Natives inhabiting the banks of the river ; and 
my curiosity was in some degree satisfied this 
forenoon. Two canoes came alongside, with a 
few oranges, limes, and cocoa-nuts. Their native 
language is the Brass; but they understand a 
little Spanish, showing with what people they 
used to have intercourse. Empty bottles were 
gladly received by them in exchange for their 
fruits : had they been filled with rum, they would 
have been still more welcome. A three-half- 
penny piece was a great curiosity to them : each 
was anxious to see it ; and having got it into 
his hands, was most reluctant to part with it. 
Though I have not engaged in the Expedition 
with a view of getting rich, I had the conscience 
to accept two cocoa-nuts, when offered to me in 
return for this piece of money. Rain fell in 


30 


ENTRANCE OF THE RIVER NUN. 


torrents this morning; but it was very welcome, 
as it supplied us with good water. 

A pilot came on board this evening, carrying 
his credentials with him in a peculiar manner, 
the first of the kind I have ever seen. Around 
the wrist of his left hand was a ring of ivory, on 
which the following words were engraved : — 
“ Jane Bart, a good pilot to the Crown. Pilot 

to the Nun River, R. H. Fuge, 1833.” I in- 

quired in vain how it could be removed ; since 
it was all one piece, and could not have been put 
on without causing him much pain and inconve- 
nience : there is no possibility of taking it oflF, 
without breaking it. 

The first thing which the Natives usually ask 
for, is their favourite rum ; and to this the pilot 
was not an exception : he could not be pre- 
vailed upon to leave till he had had a glass. 

But before he put it to his lips, he took care to 
pour out a few drops on deck, showing his atten- 
tion to the superstitious notions of his heart. 
Should this practice be objected to on account 
of its waste, it may, in their favour, be observed, 
that the waste is not great : they take good care 
not to deprive themselves of much. This custom 
prevails among many of the tribes of Africa, 


INSTANCES OF SUPERSTITION.

and is observed with religious punctuality. Its 
origin or intention is uncertain; but I am in- 
clined to think that the Sherbro People have 
given me the most satisfactory solution of it. In 
observing this ceremony, they generally say, 
“ Koo^bana ! ” (“To the old people !”) meaning their 
ancestors, now in another world. It thus appears 
that they consider them in need of their assist- 
ance ; which is further evident from several things 
which I have observed among the Sherbro People, 
and which I may here notice. They are in the 
habit of carrying rice and other eatables to the 
graves of their departed friends ; and frequently, 
in cold or wet nights, they will light a fire on them. 
Now, whatever the origin of such practices may 
be, it appears to me that they prove several things 
which ought not to be overlooked. In my judg- 
ment, it may fairly be concluded from them, 
first, that they believe in a future existence ; 
and, secondly, that there is the continuation of 
a certain relationship between the dead and the 
living. 

Aug. 20 — The long-looked-for day for entering 
upon our Mission has arrived. The preparations 
for ascending the river being completed, steam 
was got up early this morning, and we left our 


32 EXPEDITION COMMENDED TO GOD IN PRAYER. 

anchorage. A sensation of joy and gladness per- 
vaded the whole party ; all was life and aetivity 
in the vessels ; while, on the other hand, the im- 
portance of the undertaking was deeply felt, and 
the need of seeking counsel of Him, who is the 
only wise God, was not overlooked. I was deeply 
impressed with the necessity of dedicating myself 
anew to God, and of supplicating His blessing 
upon myself and all my companions ; and I trust 
I can truly say, that the joy which animated my 
soul was not merely that of the enterprising tra- 
veller in the prospect of seeing countries hitherto 
but little known, strange habits, and customs of 
the nations ; but that of the Missionary, who con- 
siders this undertaking as the first step toward 
the introduction of the glorious Gospel into the 
heart of Africa; — and oh that these hopes may 
soon be realized ! 

An excellent Prayer was composed by the Rev. 
T. Miiller, Chaplain to the Expedition, and oflFered 
up this morning on board all the vessels, by order 
of the Commander of the Expedition. It well 
deserves a page in my Journal, as it will show in 
what spirit the work was entereih^upon ; and 
therefore I subjoin a copy of it : — 


EXPEDITION COMMENDED TO GOD IN PRAYER. 33 

O Lord our God, the Father of all men, and in Jesus 
Christ our Father! we, thy unworthy servants, come before 
Thee tliis morning with a new song in our mouths— with 
prayer and thanksgiving to our God. Hitherto Thou hast 
not only holpen us ; but, as a father pitieth Ms children^ and 
as a shepherd feedeth and guideth his flock, so hast Thou 
been unto us a Merciful Father, a Good Shepherd, and an 
Ever-present-help in the time of need. Thy goodness and 
mercy have been new toward us every morning : blessed 
and praised be Thy holy name 1 We feel assm’ed. Al- 
mighty Father, that it were in vain to hope for success in 
our present undertaking, without asking counsel of the 
Lord, to whom belongeth wisdom and understanding ; and 
who, though He is sovereign in His testimonials, and giveth 
more than either we have desired or deserved, will still 
be inquired of for those things. As we are now entering 
upon the field of our labours — wliich we trust is a labour 
of love and faith — be pleased, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
to bless and direct both us Thy servants, and the work 
which Thou hast put in our hands, and afford us Thy pro- 
tection ! 

Our help is in Thee, O God! who hast made heaven 
and earth. Undertake Thou for us, and 6kss Thou the 
work of our hands. Give success to our endeavours to 
introduce civilization and Christianity into this benighted 
country. Thou hast promised, Ethiopia shall soon stretch

mental in f ulfillin g this Thy promise. 

We trust, O Lord, that the Expedition in which we arc

engaged is the work of Thy own hands, and the thought 
of Thy own heart : we would therefore plead Thy pro- 
mises of protection and guidance, with a peculiar confidence. 
Thou hast promised to be with Thy people even unto the 
ends of the world, and to be a refuge to all who put their 
trust in Thee. 

Behold ! we Thy unworthy servants do put our whole 
trust and confidence in Thy mercy. Be pleased, we be- 
seech Thee, O Lord, to defend us with Thy Almighty 
Power, as with a shield. Thou hast promised, in Thy word 
— TFAen thou passest through the waters, I will he with thee; 
and through the rivers, they shall not oversow thee: when 
thou walkest through the fire, thou shall not he burned, 
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee ; for I am the Lord 
thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. Be pleased, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, to fulfil aU Thy gracious promises in 
us for the time to come, as Thou hast done hitherto. Con- 
tinue, in mercy toward us, to be our hiding-place and covert 
from the tempest, and a comfortable shade in a dry and weary 
land ; for if Thou art with us, who can be against us ? Let 
no evil befal us, nor any plague come nigh our ships. Pre- 
serve our going out and our coming in, from henceforth and 
for evermore. And since it is Thy holy wiU, that aU Thy 
children should go through much tribulation into the king- 
dom of heaven, be pleased, O Lord, to bless and sanctify all 
our afflictions to Thy honour and glory. Give grace, wis- 
dom, and judgment to Thy servant, in whose hands Thou 
hast put the chief command and direction of this Expedition ; 
and to those who are associated with him, and appointed

to negociate conventions with the African Chiefs. Grant, we 
beseech Thee, that [each and all of us may be a light and a 
salt to the people of this benighted country, that they may 
see our good works, and praise Thee our Heavenly Father ! 

O Thou that rulest over all the kingdoms of the Heathen, 
and tumest the hearts of Kings whithersoever Thou wilt, 
dispose and turn Thou the hearts of the Chiefs of this 
country, that they may love the things which make for 
their temporal and eternal peace ; that the time may be 
hastened, when they may, according to Thy promises, heat 
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning- 
hooks, and nations no longer lift up sword against nation, 
neither learn war any more ! And Thou, O Lord our God ! 
who hast promised to hear the petitions of them who ask 
in Thy Son’s name, we humbly beseech Thee mercifully to 
incline Tliine ear to us who have now made our prayers and 
supplications to Thee, and grant that those things which 
we have faithfully asked according to Tliy will, may effec- 
tually be obtained, to the relief of our necessity, and to the 
setting forth of Thy gloiy, through Jesus Christ our Lord ! 
Amen. 

About 11 o’clock A.M. we overtook the “ Albert,” 
and the schooner *, which had left the Bar the day 
previous. A heavy shower of rain fell early this 
morning ; it soon cleared up, however, and we 
had most delightful weather the rest of the day.

Leone, for the purpose of conveying stores, &c.

COUNTRY THINLY PEOPLED. CULTIVATION. 


Tlie river is narrow, at some places perhaps not 
wider than three hundred yards, and the appear- 
ance of the shores or banks very agreeable. The 
mangroves extend no greater distance than about 
ten or twelve miles from the mouth of the river. 
After their disappearance, the banks assume 
a beautiful aspect; trees of various tints and 
shades cover them, and their luxuriant foliage 
proves pleasant to the eye, especially to mine, 
which at times are weak and painful under the 
hot sun of Africa. This part of the country must - 
be very thinly peopled, as only a few persons 
could be seen; and even at the place where w'e 
had been lying at anchor for some days, I suppose 
that we saw not more than twelve of them. In 
the dusk of the evening we passed a small village, 
and could hear the chattering voices of the people, 
but could not see any of them. We cast anchor 
about 7 o’clock p.m. The distance we made to- 
day was calculated at thirty-four miles. Parcels 
of ground are under cultivation on both sides 
of the river, especially the last ten or twelve 
miles. A great number of plantain and banana 
trees have been planted ; also yams a^d cocoas ; 
and several small patches of sugar-cane, which 
must have been done previously to the rising of

the river, as they are novF standing at the very 
edge of the water. 

Aug. 21 — By day-light this morning we were 
again on our way. The weather was fine ; and 
the sun shone upon us with all his African power, 
though not oppressive : it was even cool and 
comfortable under a single canvas awning. The 
scenery appeared to me every hour to become 
finer, as we ascended the river. We passed a 
large village about 7 o’clock p. m., the inhabitants 
of which came in large numbers on the bank : 
some were seen carrying muskets along with 
them. Several canoes came near us ; the largest 
being paddled by sixteen men, containing the 
Headman of the village. Our Brass Interpreter 
invited the Headman to come on board, and re- 
ceive a small “ dash” (present) ; but he could not 
be prevailed on : he was evidently much afraid, 
though he was repeatedly assured that we were 
his friends, and that, if we had any intention of 
hurting him, we might do so while he was in his 
canoe. When the Interpreter was repeatedly 
requested to assure him that we would do him no 
harm, he replied, in rather an angry manner, “ I 
done tell him all this already. I tell him. Suppose 
you go fire one big gun, him whole town go broke ;

VILLAGE OF OTUA. 


but he cannot hear At last, however, he ven- 
tured up, and sat down for a few moments on 
deck ; but his countenance betrayed the uneasi- 
ness of his mind. He received a handkerchief as 
a present : after which he made haste to get back 
into his canoe, where alone he deemed himself 
safe. 

At 2 o’cloek p.m., in consequence of a signal 
from the “ Albert,” we entered another branch of 
the river from that which the other vessels took. 
Soon after, we arrived at a village called Otua, * 
situated on the right bank of the river, and nearly 
surrounded with cocoa-nut trees. I was surprised, 
at first, that there should be only a few inha- 
bitants : with the aid of my glass, I could only 
discover a few, standing under the doors of their 
houses. As we drew near the village, our Inter- 
preter spoke to them in the Brass language. The 
first information which he was always anxious 
to convey to them was, that we were no Portu- 
guese, but that we came as friends to the Black 
people. No sooner had he delivered this intel- 
ligence, than, to our astonishment, we observed, 

* “ Hear,” is used by the Africans, in speaking English, for 
“ understand and obey.” 


VISIT OF THE CHIEF. 


39 


in less than five minutes — I speak in proper 
bounds — more than two hundred persons stand- 
ing at the water’s edge. The Chief was requested 
to come on board ; with which he complied, with 
great reluctance. He was distinguished from 
the rest of the people by the red shirt which 
he wore. The Interpreter, Marquis Gunby, 
from Sierra Leone, being most anxious that he 
should come, felt not a little annoyed when he 
observed that the Chief was willing, but that the 
people endeavoured to dissuade him from such a 
perilous undertaking. “ The King heart strong,” 
he said : “ no more only them people ; them 
coward too much.” However, he got into his 
large canoe, and approached the formidable vessel 
of the White Man. As we thought the to^vn 
might be Ayema, we asked whether he ever 
made w'ar with White men ; to which both him- 
self and the people replied again and again, that 
they had never seen White men before; which 
appeared to us almost incredible, as the town 
where poor Mr. Lander was attacked, robbed, 
and wounded, cannot possibly be far from hence. 
Possibly it may be on the branch which the 
“Albert” pursued; and the correctness of their 
assertion will be found out, when we meet again. 


40 


NOTICES OF VILLAGES. 


I suppose we made to-day the same distance as 
yesterday. 

Aug. 22 : Lord's Day — A shower of rain in the 
morning, but fine weather afterward. The sun 
was clouded all day, but the heat not very great. 

We are now convinced, from the unanimous 
testimony of the people, that we are the first 
Europeans, at least within their memory, that 
ever navigated this branch of the river. I am 
not aware that it affords any advantage over the 
other: it winds continually, and is, therefore, 
apparently, a much longer route than the branch 
pointed out by Capt. Wm. Allen’s Chart, and pur- 
sued by the Expedition which he accompanied 
some years ago. A more particular description 
of it does not belong to my province- as that 
will, no doubt, be given by persons properly 
qualified for the task. We passed several large 
villages, which appeared thickly peopled. One 
of them, which we passed about 7 o’clock a.m., is 
called Agobri, situated on the left bank of the 
river, and inhabited by people speaking the Brass 
language. We observed several empty puncheons 
of European manufacture, indicating that the de- 
moralizing liquor, rum, had found its way to 
this place ; but it is, perhaps, more charitable to 


LITTLE IBO. 


41 


suppose that they had been sent up empty, to be 
filled with palm-oil. The second village which 
we passed is called Abaddi; and the third at 
which we arrived, after joining the main river, 
is called Sobo Kriya. All our endeavours to 
persuade the Natives to come on board proved 
fruitless. — I held Divine Service to-day, once, on 
deck. 

The keeping of a Journal in this manner is 
a very dry piece of business ; but so long as we 
have no intercourse with Natives, I am unable 
to collect any information wliich might be of 
more importance. 

Aug. 23 — We passed “ Little Ibo,” so called by 
Mr. Laird, about 10 o’clock a.m. It was here that 
the Natives made an attack upon his Expedition. 
No signs of hostility were now shown ; but, on 
the contrary, some of the people came on board, 
with a present for the Captain, consisting of a 
duck and a bunch of plantains. A certain shy- 
ness was undoubtedly perceptible, arising, it may 
be supposed, from a consciousness of having done 
wrong on a former occasion. I cannot see the 
reason why the place should bear the name “ Lit- 
tle Ibo,” since the people do not belong to the Ibo 
Nation at all, and still speak the Brass language. 


42 


OPINIONS OF THE AFRICANS 


Only one of those who came on board was a real 
Ibo, employed, in the service of Obi, at this place. 
Simon Jonas, our Ibo Interpreter, and myself, 
had some conversation with him ; from which 
we gathered, that there was not much traffic in 
slaves carried on at present, and the people were 
chiefly engaged in preparing palm-oil. He ex- 
pressed no small degree of surprise when he was 
told by the Interpreter that he himself had been 
made a slave, but had been liberated and kindly 
treated by the English. The Ibo man could 
hardly credit it. He had hitherto believed that 
slaves were purchased by the White people to be 
killed and eaten, and that their blood was used to 
make red cloth. This notion is very prevalent 
among them. — Much rain in the afternoon, which 
continued to fall in torrents almost all night. 

j4ug. 24 — Rain till 9 o’clock a.m. At 10 o’clock, 
we arrived at a place where the river divides 
its waters into two branches, of almost equal 
quantity. The one running s.w. is marked, on 
Captain Allen’s Chart, the Benin Branch*. Near 
it, on the right bank of the main river, there is a

RESPECTING THE SLAVE-TRADE.

town named Anya — signifying “eye” in the Ibo 
language — from which the inhabitants flocked to 
us, in large numbers, in their canoes. All of them 
spoke Ibo, and are subject to Obi. They could 
not give us any other name for the Benin branch 
than “ Miri,” meaning water. They all agreed 
that the Nun led in a shorter time to “ Mirinu,” 
salt water, than the Benin branch. Their palm- 
oil, as well as their slaves, are said to be taken 
down the Benin branch, to a place called Egabo ; 
most probably a town of the Brass country : 
and there is nothing absurd in the supposition, 
that from thence they may find their way, or 
be conveyed to Lagas, or Whydda. There can 
be no doubt that there is much traffic in slaves 
carried on in this region. We had such proofs 
of it as cannot be contradicted : several little 
boys, of about nine or ten years of age, were 
even brought to our vessels and offered for sale : 
they were of the Yaruba nation. On reasoning 
with the man, in whose charge they were, on the 
sinfulness of his conduct, he readily admitted 
that the slave-trade was a bad thing ; but main- 
tained that it was an evil which could not be 
remedied, and which, according to his opinion, 
will never be given up. I trust he will, ere long. 


44 


natives’ opinion of the slave-trade. 


see cause to change his opinion, and be himself 
persuaded, or obliged, to give it up. 

Never has the slave-trade appeared so abomi- 
nable to me as to-day ; when I found that the 
Natives, in general, entertain the most fearful 
ideas of the miseries to which they expose the 
helpless victims of their avarice, by selling them. 
The circumstance by which this information was 
obtained, or rather confirmed — I having often 
heard it before — is too interesting to be omitted. 
Our Brass Interpreter was peculiarly anxious that 
one of the large number of persons who ^r- 
rounded our vessel this evening should come on 
•board, because he thought he recognised him. 
Though many years had elapsed since our Inter- 
preter was sold, and the other had, in the mean 
time, become an old man, they instantly re- 
cognised each other ; and I cannot describe the 
astonishment manifested by the Ibo man at 
seeing one whom he verily believed had long 
since been killed and eaten by the White people. 
His expressions of surprise were strong, but very 
significant. “ If God Himself,” he said, “ had 
told me this, I could not have believed \vhat my 
eyes now see.” The Interpreter then found out 
that Anya was the very place to which he had

45 


first been sold as a slave, and at which he had 
spent nine years of his early life ; and that the 
very person with whom he was speaking had 
been his doctor and nurse in a severe illness, on 
which account he had retained a thankful re- 
membrance of him. The Ibo man was kindly 
treated by the Captain, and his request to be 
allowed to accompany us to Obi was instantly 
granted. He calls himself brother to Obi ; but it 
is well known that the word ‘ Brother’ has a most 
extensive signification in Western Africa. When 
he was asked whether he thought that Obi would 
be glad to see White men, he gave a reply which 
I was not prepared to hear from the lips of a 
Pagan. “ These three months,” he said, “ we 
have been praying to God to send White man’s 
ship.” — Oh that I could believe and be convinced 
that this was something of the cry of the Mace- 
donians, Come over and help us! But a suspicious 
thought always intrudes itself on my mind, and 
makes me suppose that it is the desire of seeing 
a slave-dealer with his cargo, in exchange for 
their own flesh and blood. 

Aug. 25 — Hitherto the Lord hath helped us. 
By His gracious providence, we arrived at Ibo, 
and cast anchor at the mouth of the creek leading

SEASON SUITABLE FOR THE EXPEDITION. 


to the town, at half-past 7 o’clock p. m. The 
country generally deemed the most unhealthy 
is now behind us: and should we not speak of 
loving-kindness and tender mercy, seeing we are 
all still in the land of the living, and in the en- 
joyment of health? Every step of our journey 
has been blessed ; and past experience calls upon 
us to take courage, and to go on in humble de- 
pendence upon God’s continual help. 

Having now advanced thus far, it may per- 
haps be expected from me that I should take 
a retrospective view of our voyage to this place 
from the entrance of the river, and express an 
opinion as to the suitableness of the season 
chosen for our undertaking. To be certain on 
this subject is a point of very great importance. 
I shall, therefore, not be too ready in hastening 
to a conclusion. It is preferable to mention a 
few facts which cannot be contradicted, and to 
leave every one at liberty to form his own opi- 
nion. It appears to me that the season has been 
well chosen: I prefer however to say — provi- 
dentially directed. The degree of health with 
which we have hitherto been favoured, proves 
that it cannot be the most unhealthy season of 
the year ; and the quantity of water in the river. 


FRIENDLY RECEPTION AT IBO. 


47 


it being nearly as high as it is likely to rise, 
would also prove its suitableness in another 
respect. 

I was not a little mortified to-day, by observing 
that the dialect of the Ibo language, on which 
I had bestowed much labour in Sierra Leone, 
differs widely from that spoken and understood 
in this part of the country. It never escaped 
my observation, that a great diversity of dialects 
existed ; but I must blame myself much for not 
making stricter inquiries about that which would 
be most useful for the present occasion. 

Aucj. 26 — The weather was very fine this morn- 
ing; the air pure, and the sky clearer than we 
have seen it for some time. Ibo canoes and 
people surrounded us, in great numbers, early 
this morning. I was a little more pleased with 
them than yesterday ; because I perceived that 
I could make myself understood by them, and 
could understand more of their talk. After a 
short time I shall be able to understand them 
better. 

King Obi sent one of his sons to welcome the 
strangers : he was a very fine-looking young 
man, of about twenty years of age. Both him- 
self and his companions attended our morning 


48 


HUMAN SACRIFICES. 


devotions : after which, I told them what book it 
was of which I had been reading a portion, and 
that I had come to this country to tell the people 
what God had, in it, revealed to us. They were 
surprised, and could not well understand how it 
was possible that I should have no other object 
in view. They are sensible of their inferiority, 
in every respect, to White men, and can there- 
fore be easily led by them either to do evil or 
good. When I told one, this morning, that the 
slave-trade was a bad thing, and that White 
people wished to put an end to it altogether, he 
gave me an excellent answer : “ Well, if White 
people give up buying. Black people will give 
up selling slaves.” He assured me, too, that it 
had hitherto been his belief that it was the will 
of God that Black people should be slaves to 
White people. 

This afternoon, I satisfied myself of the cor- 
rectness of various particulars which I had pre- 
viously obtained of the Ibo people, respecting 
some of their superstitious practices. It appears 
to be but too true, that human sacrifices are 
oSered by them, and that in a most barbarous 
manner. The legs of the devoted victim are tied 
together, and he is dragged from place to place 


INFANTICIDE. 


49 


till he expires. The person who gave me this 
information told me that one man had been 
dragged about for nearly a whole day before his 
sufferings terminated in death : the body is after- 
ward cast into the river. Interment is always 
denied them : they must become food for alliga- 
tors or fishes. Sometimes people are fastened 
to trees, or to branches close to the river, until 
they are famished. While we were at anchor 
inside the Bar, the body of a young w’oman 
was found on the sand-bank, having been dead, 
apparently, only a few hours ; and as no external 
marks of injury were observed, except those pro- 
duced by a rope fastened around her loins, she 
may have been sacrificed in this manner. 

Infanticide of a peculiar nature likewise pre- 
vails among them : twins are never allowed to 
live. As soon as they are born, they are put 
into two earthen pots, and exposed to the beasts 
of the forest; and the unfortunate mother ever 
afterward endures great trouble and hardships. 
A small tent is built for her in the forest, in 
which she is obliged to dwell, and to undergo 
many ceremonies for her purification. She is 
separated from all society for a considerable 
time ; her conjugal alliance with her husband

50 


THEOLOGY OF THE IBOS. 


f is for ever dissolved; and she is never again 

permitted to sit down with other women in the 
same market or in the same house. To give 
) birth to twins is, therefore, considered to be the 
• greatest misfortune that can befal a woman 'of 
the Ibo nation. If any person wishes to annoy 
an Ibo woman, he lifts up two fingers, and says, 
“You gave birth to twins;” which is sure to 
make her almost mad. If a child should happen 
to cut its top teeth first, the poor infant is like- 
wise killed : it is considered to indicate that the 
child, were it allowed to live, would become a 
very bad person. To say to any person, “ You 
/ . cut your top teeth first,” is, therefore, as much 
as to say, “ Nothing good can be expected from 
you : you are born to do evil : it is impossible 
for you to act otherwise.” 

The Ibos are, in their way, a religious people. 
The word “ Tshuku” — God — is continually heard. 
Tshuku is supposed to do every thing. When 
a few bananas fell out of the hands of one in the 
water, he comforted himself by saying, “ God has 
I done it.” Their notions of some of the attributes 
of the Supreme Being are, in many respects, 
correct, and their manner of expressing them 
striking. “ God made every thing : He made 


I

both White and Black," is continually on their 
lips. Some of their parables are descriptive of / 
the perfections of God. When they say, for : 
instance, that God has two eyes or two ears, 
that the one is in heaven and the other on earth, 

I suppose the conclusion that they have an idea 
of God's omniscience and omnipresence cannot 
be disputed. On the death of a person who has, , 
in their estimation, been good, they will say, 
“He will see God;” while, of a wicked person, 
they say, “ He will go into fire.” I had frequent 
opportunities of hearing ^hese expressions at 
Sierra Leone ; but though I was assured that they 
had not learned them from Christians, I would 
not state them before I had satisfied myself, by 
inquiring of such as had never had any inter- 
course with Christians, that they possessed cor- 
rect ideas of a future state of reward and punish- 
ment. Truly God has not left Himself without 
witness ! 

Another subject on which they arc generally 
agreed — but which, I am sorry to say, I shall have 
no opportunity of pursuing any further — is the 
following: it is their common belief that there 
is a certain place or town in the I bo coun- 
try in which “Tshuku” dwells, and where he

delivers his oracles and answ^ers inquiries. Any 
matter of importance is left to his decision, and 
people travel to the place from every part of the 
country. It is said to be, in the rainy season, 
three months’ journey from this town ; but that, 
in the dry season, it could be made' by land in 
a much shorter time. I was informed to-day, 
that, last year, Tshuku had given sentence against 
the slave-trade. The person inquiring of him is 
placed on a piece of ground, which is immediately 
and miraculously surrounded by water. Tshuku 
cannot be seen by any human eye : his voice is 
heard from the ground. He speaks every lan- 
guage on earth ; makes known thieves ; and if 
there is fraud in the heart of the inquirer, he is 
sure to find it out ; and woe to such a person ! for 
he will never return. He hears every word that 
is said against him ; but can only revenge himself 
when persons come near him. — I once asked a 
man, “ Did the people never drive him out of 
his hole?” when he said to me, very seriously, 
“ Master, do not take such word : perhaps, by- 
and-bye, you go see the place, and Tshuku will 
kill you, ‘You here now ! You must dri^’^e me out 
of my hole!’ and the time he begin for talk, you 
no go open your mouth again.” They sincerely

53 


believe all these things, and many others, re- 
specting Tshuku, and obey his orders implicitly : 
and if it should be correct that he has said that 
they should give up the slave-trade, I have no 
doubt that they will do it at once. 

Obi came on board the “ Wilberforce” in the 
afternoon, with a present of a bullock and two 
hundred yams. The object of our visit was ex- 
plained to him. He was glad to learn that 
England was willing to trade with him : he was 
willing even to supply the English with slaves. 
The opinions which English People entertained 
of the slave-trade, and their desire to abolish 
it, were fully explained to him ; and our In- 
terpreter, Simon Jonas, spoke with much feeling 
of the miseries which arise from it. He did 
not omit relating to him much of the kindness 
of the people of England, who liberated him 
from slavery, and put him into a country where 
there is “ no war,” where every body is allowed 
“ to work for himself,” and where he had learned 
to worship God. The king appeared much in- 
terested, and considered all that had been told 
him to be very good. Nothing delighted him 
more than the news, that the Queen of England 
had sent out war ships along the coast, to watch

for slavers, to take their vessels and slaves, to 
destroy the one, and liberate the other. He 
laughed most heartily and immoderately at this ; 
admiring the power of England, which was 
greater than that of Spain and Portugal. I was, 
for my part, more pleased than discouraged 
when I heard him candidly admit that it was 
a hard thing to give up the slave-trade. The 
conversation was then postponed to the following 
day, when all the Commissioners w'ould be pre- 
sent. He repeatedly expressed his readiness to 
enter into a treaty, and to abolish the slave- 
trade. 

The other vessels composing the Expedition 
arrived at Ibo this evening. Much rain in the 
afternoon. 

Aug. 27 — The business with King Obi* was 

I have kept the name Obi, though it is not correct. Obi 
appears to be a title of royalty ; and he would be more properly 
called Onnese Obi Osai ; and his country and town, Aboh, instead 
of Ibo. Captain Trotter considers the Ibo, or, as it was written 
formerly, Eboe Country, to extend along the northern margin of 
tlie Delta, between the Old Calabar and Formosa Rivers. Ibo 
comprises the whole nation speaking the Ibo language ; while Obi’s 
part of the country is distinguished from the rest, by the name 
Aboh, or Aboh Country. 


INELIGIBILITY OF IBO FOR A MISSION STATION. 55 

resumed this morning, on board the “Albert.” 
Every thing was fully explained to him again; 
and his answers, and cautious inquiries into 
various things, showed that he entered into the 
spirit of it. After this was done, at the re- 
quest of Captain Trotter, I commenced reading 
a translation of the “ Address to the Chiefs and 
People of Africa,” which I had previously pre- 
pared in his own language. Instead of its ex- 
citing his curiosity, he soon felt tired. “ I under- 
stand all,” he said, “ and I am willing to do all 
that is in my power. What good can it do, to tell 
it to me so many times?” Perhaps the style of 
my translation was not sweet enough for his 
ears, and my tongue not sufficiently Ibonized. 
Obi was then informed that every thing would 
be ready the following morning, and that he 
would receive the presents after signing the 
treaty. He was anxious to go back to his own 
house, and was kind enough to allow me a pas- 
sage in his canoe. I was very glad of this oppor- 
tunity, as it enabled me, from personal ob- 
servation, to form an opinion of the eligibility 
of Ibo for a Missionary Station. It may be 
objected, that a question of so much importance 
could not, or should not, be decided by a single

visit; but from all I observed, I am convinced 
that the town and country must be very un- 
healthy. It is almost entirely under water: 
we were obliged to wade through the mud, 
up to our knees, to the palace of the king. 
It is true, this is the rainy season, and that a 
few months hence the whole ap23earanee would 
be much altered; but it is questionable whether 
it would be healthier. The Natives invariably 
agree that there is much sickness among them 
at the time the banks of the river begin to get 
dry ; and where there is such an enormous quan- 
tity of mud accumulated, and extent of country 
overflown, dryness is not accomplished in a few 
days, and perhaps never entirely, as the wet 
season seems to be much longer here than in 
Sierra Leone, or other places along the coast. 
Obi himself said, when it was mentioned to him, 
that White people might come and teach him and 
his subjects, and build houses in his country; — that 
he would point out to them a better place, be- 
cause there was too much water here. Where 
that better place is to be found, I am at a loss to 
say ; the whole country appearing, as fat^ as we 
could see, of the same character, everywhere low 
and swampy. 


INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF IBO.

I w'as introduced to the palace without much 
ceremony ; a clay bank, under the roof of one of 
the piazzas, being assigned to myself and com- 
panions, as seats. Obi’s one hundred and ten 
wives were gazing at us from their dwellings, 
and now and then had a hearty laugh at our 
expense. Just before us stood an idol made of 
wood, holding a pistol in his left hand, and a 
sword in his right. He is considered the God 
of War. In time of war, every soldier is obliged, 
before he departs for the fight, to lay his hands 
upon the idol, who preserves him, and enables 
him to return in safety. Obi could not devote 
much time to us. He expressed, in a hasty 
manner, to his wives, his surprise at the things 
which he had seen in the vessel ; and then 
quickly retired to perform his superstitious 
ceremonies, in which he was assisted by his 
Headmen or priests. I was told that he sacri- 
ficed several sheep. Their sacrifices are always 
divided among the people, and eaten. I re- 
turned to the vessel at 7 o’clock p. m., in the 
king’s canoe. The Interpreter had permission 
to spend the night on shore ; which was a 
plan well-arranged by Captain Trotter, as he 
could witness the proclamation of the treaty 
D 3 ' 


58 


INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF IBO. 


which Obi had entered into with England. Obi 
certainly fulfilled his promise ; and told his peo- 
ple that he had given up the slave-trade for ever : 
and prohibited all his subjects from engaging in 
it any more, threatening all, who should violate 
his contract with England, with severe punish- 
ment. 

A suspicion was expressed to the Interpreter, 
by one of the principal people of the town, as 
to the sincerity of our pretensions of having 
come to this country with the design of doing 
good to the Black people; arising from the fol- 
lowing observation, which he had made on one 
of our vessels. He happened to see, in the cabin 
of one of our medical officers, a human scull ; and 
concluded that it belonged to a Black man, who 
had been killed by us for the sake of obtain- 
ing his scull. Another objection which he found 
against us was, that we spoke against their 
“arrisi" (idols), while we kept idols in our own 
vessels ; the only difference being, that theirs were 
of a rude, while ours were of a fine make: — he 
meant, undoubtedly, the likenesses and pictures 
which he happened to see on board. I feared, 
beforehand, that such would be their impressions. 

'7^ We can hardly believe how ignorant they are.

and what singular conclusions they will draw 
from things they see or hear. When, for in- 
stance, the likenesses of the Queen and Prince 
Albert were shown to Obi, he seriously inquired 
which of them was the wife, and which the hus- 
band. This will hardly be credited ; but I was 
present when the important inquiry was made; 
and it must not be forgotten, that he had never 
seen a European lady. I believe our Interpreter 
succeeded in satisfying them that our likenesses 
were not idols, and that the scull was not ob- 
tained in the manner supposed. 

Aug. 2S — The business with Obi commenced 
again early this morning, on board the “ Albert.” 
The object for which I had come to this country 
was not forgotten : on the contrary, I admired 
Captain Trotter’s anxiety that all should be 
fully explained to him. Obi confessed tliat he 
did not know God, nor the right way of wor- 
shipping Him; and expressed an earnest desire 
that Teachers should be sent to him and his 
people. We could make him no decided pro- 
mise that White Missionaries would ever settle 
in his dominions ; but expressed our belief that 
we could get good people, who spoke his own 
language, and had learned to know God and 


60 obi’s desire for religious teachers. 

to worship Him at Sierra Leone; at which he 
was much pleased. An English and an Arabic 
Bible were presented to him, though he cannot 
read either of them : persons may come, how- 
ever, to his town who may be able to make 
proper use of them. I opened the English Bible, 
and made Simon Jonas read a few verses to him, 
and translate them into Ibo. The verses he read 
were some of the Beatitudes of our Saviour, in 
the fifth chapter of St. Matthew. Obi was un- 
commonly taken with this. That a White man 
could read and write, was a matter of course ; 
but that a Black man — an Ibo man — a slave in 
times past — should know these wonderful things 
too, was more than he could ever have antici- 
pated. He seized Simon’s hand, squeezed it most 
heartily, and said, “You must stop with me; 
you must teach me and my people. The White 
people can go up the river without you : they 
may leave you here until they return, or until 
other people come — and he would not be satis- 
fied, until Simon had made his desire known to 
Captain Trotter. After much consideration, it 
was agreed that he should remain here till our 
return from the interior. Simon was much 
afraid that he might be left here alone, — that the

vessels might return by another river ; and ex- 
pressed his opinion that he felt himself unequal 
to the task. But when he was assured that his 
fears were unfounded, and that I wished him to 
teach his country people chiefly by a holy and 
consistent life, he felt perfectly satisfied. Obi 
promised to treat him kindly. 

This occurrence appears to me of great im- 
portance, on various accounts ; though I have no 
enthusiastic hopes of great results arising from 
it. Enthusiasm is always far from me, and is 
never the extreme into which I am liable to fall ; 
but I do not despise the day of small thincjs, and 
can discover the leadings of Providence in things 
of this description. I drew several conclusions 
from it, which I consider legitimate. The desire 
expressed by Obi that Simon Jonas should re- 
main with him, proves the sincerity of his heart 
to perform the terms of the treaty into which he 
has entered. If he had any intention of evading 
them, he would not have expressed a desire to 
have a person around him who understands his 
own language, can watch over all his proceedings, 
and who, as he well knows, will join the Expe- 
dition again, and will be able to make his report 
of Obi’s conduct to the Commissioners. It

REMARKS ON THE CIVILIZATION 


further convinces me that the objection, so often 
raised, that Africans would not listen to their 
own country-people, especially to such as had 
previously been slaves, is perfectly gratuitous. 
The king of Ibo is not ashamed to confess his 
own ignorance ; nor too proud to sit down to 
one of his own countrymen and listen to his 
instructions, or to derive in any way some ad- 
vantage from the superior knowledge he has 
obtained by his intercourse with Europeans. 
Every thing tends to confirm my opinion of 
Sierra Leone and its destiny, that from thence the 
Gospel will proceed to numerous benighted tribes 
of Africa. There the commencement must be 
made for the dissemination of the Gospel ; and 
every human means ought to be employed, and 
carefully used, toward hastening the time, and 
facilitating the work. 

Perhaps I may be permitted to mention here 
a few things more. Though they have no ne- 
cessary cormexion with my Journal, they are 
connected with the plans under contemplation 
for the civilization and christianizing of Africa. 
West-Indian people may in many respects be 
better qualified than the Liberated Africans at 
Sierra Leone : they have seen more of European

habits; are better acquainted with agricultural 
labours ; and have a much greater taste for 
European comforts, if that be considered an ac- 
quisition. But it must not be overlooked, that 
there are many things which would prove a 
drawback, rather than a help. The high wages 
that they have been accustomed to receive, and 
the high notions which they have imbibed of 
their own importance, have, I am afraid, ren- 
dered them, in a great measure, unfitted for 
Africa. Add to this, that many may carry a 
recollection of the driver’s lashes with them; 
and many more have a disposition to inflict 
them on others : so that the one would not feel 
disposed to co-operate heartily with England, and 
the other would little recommend the civilization 
system by his conduct. And besides, it must 
never be thought that a black skin is a sufficient 
safeguard against diseases incident to the climate 
of Africa. 

It may be that I have wronged the West- 
Indian People in some things attributed to 
them: if that is the case, it is owing to my 
having compared them with the Free Blacks 
in the American Settlements of Liberia, of the 
greater number of whom my statement is

correct. The case is widely different with regard 
to the Liberated Africans. They are not spoiled 
by high wages ; they have obtained all they 
possess by their own exertions ; and entertain no 
other feelings for English People than those of 
kindness. I have witnessed, on several occa- 
sions, how feelingly they speak to their own 
country people of the miseries which slavery 
produces, and of the kindness shown to them in 
liberating them. And why should not such be 
sent forth, with the Gospel in their hands, and 
the love of Christ in their hearts ? Must the old 
objection continually operate against this plan, 
that they are not qualified, because they may not 
be able to compose sermons or write elaborate 
discourses ? Ought we not to consider, that the 
Gospel is the message of God to man ; and that 
God can bless it, when faithfully declared, whether 
it be by a White or a Black man ? Look at the 
condition of those to whom they are sent, or 
proposed to be sent; it is described in a few 
words — lost and buried in ignorance, supersti- 
tions — cruel superstitions — and vice, and bowing 
down before deaf and dumb idols. Is it possible 
to make them worse? Can a simple-hearted 
Christian, knowing nothing but how to read his 


SIGNING OF THE TREATY ENTERED INTO WITH OBI. G5 

Bible, do them harm ? or is he not sufficiently 
elevated above his hearers by human acquire- 
ments ? He is, in my opinion, as much above 
the level of his hearers, with regard to educa- 
tion, as the best-educated Minister in Europe is 
above his congregation. But much more might 
be done for them. They might be received 
under a course of instruction, and be led to 
understand how to reduce a language, and such 
like. 

I perceive, however, that instead of writing 
a .Journal, I have been giving opinions. This 
I cannot regret; for I may, perhaps, never be 
able to express my views by word of mouth, life 
being uncertain ; and I hope that they may, at 
least, lead to further inquiries and consideration 
on those subjects which appear to me of para- 
mount importance. 

I now return to my Journal. — Every thing 
being ready, and copies of the treaty lying on the 
table for signature. Obi was told that it was the 
custom of Christians to call upon God for His 
blessing, in all their undertakings ; and that we 
would now pray for a blessing upon ourselves 
and upon him, and in which we hoped he would 
join us. We accordingly fell on our knees, and

the Chaplain of the Expedition offered up a 
prayer to Almighty God. Obi knelt down, for the 
first time in his life. On getting up, he appeared 
extremely alarmed and agitated, trembling and 
shaking like a leaf, perspiration rolling down his 
cheeks: indeed, he appeared to be in agony of 
mind. He called so loudly for his “ arrisi ” — idol 
or charm — that his people who were on deck could 
hear him. Turning to the Interpreter, he told him 
of the agony of his mind, thinking that all this 
had been intended to hurt him. The charm was 
brought down ; and his Headman hastened to his 
relief, and was about to perform his superstitious 
ceremonies in the Commander’s apartments, when 
the Interpreter succeeded in removing his suspi- 
cions and quieting his mind. He told his Head- 
man how much he had been afraid, and that he 
now was convinced that there was no occasion 
for fear; requesting the Interpreter to explain 
more fully to them what the object of our 
prayer had been, and to satisfy them, too, that 
no harm was intended. Obi’s son then poured 
out a tumbler of palm-wine for liim, which 
soon restored his faculties ; and another one was 
lianded round, of which w’e all partook, to con- 
vince him that there was a feeling of cordiality

67 


and friendship existing between him and our- 
selves.* 

I may here remark that much depends on the 
manner in which the subject of slavery is laid 
before the Chiefs and People of Africa ; and there 
is no class of persons better qualified to speak of 
the horrors of slavery, of the benefit conferred 
upon them by their liberation by Great Britain, 
and of the advantages which would be derived by 
the nations of the interior of Africa by the abo- 
lition of the slave-trade, and a commercial inter- 
course with England, than the Liberated Africans 
at Sierra Leone. Nothing could equal the natural 
good sense and eloquence of Simon .Jonas, our Ibo 
Interpreter, in speaking to King Obi on the 
subject of slavery. When it was first broached to 
Obi that the object of our visit to him was the 
abolition of the slave-trade, he candidly confessed 
that he considered it a hard thing to give it up. 
This expression did not escape the notice of our 
Ibo Interpreter. He began in the most resj)ectful

Liberated Africans, attending Divine Service for the first time, 
felt greatly alarmed. It is ascribable to their notions of worship.

MISERIES OF SLAVERY. 


manner to convince the king that it was still 
harder to continue it : and of this he could speak, 
not merely as an eye-witness, but like one who 
had felt what it means, to be taken away from all 
that endears home, to be driven from place to 
place, and packed up in a slave-vessel. He com- 
menced by describing the miseries which the 
slave-trade produced in the Ibo Country; men- 
tioned the continual wars carried on for the 
purpose of capturing slaves ; how many parents 
became bereaved of their children, and children 
for ever separated from their parents; how the 
whole population was continually in a state of 
excitement and fear, and what an injurious effect 
this condition had on their own temporal con- 
cerns ; how their fields were neglected, and their 
houses left without inhabitants; how every one 
was afraid of his own neighbour, and none could 
place confidence in his own brother ; — and then 
went) on to relate his own experience, from the 
time he was made a slave, to the time he was 
speaking with the king. He mentioned, that 
there were more than 200 boys who were taken 
in war, but many of them died of hunger and 
fatigue before they reached Bonny ; — that many 
had been sacrificed by the King of Bonny ; and 


OBI IMPRESSED WITH THE BLESSINGS OF FREEDOM. G9 

others had committed suicide, to prevent that 
most horrible death of being eaten by tlie White 
people, which all of them firmly believed would 
be their lot. He did not forget to mention in 
what condition they were on board the slave- 
vessel ; spoke of bad provisions, bad water, and 
of the want of room ; that many soon died, and 
others fell sick, and were often thrown overboard 
before they had actually expired, and became food 
to the shark ; — and, when he had stated all these 
things, to which the king had listened with the 
greatest attention, he addressed himself to the 
king, and said, “ Do you not see that it is harder 
to continue it, than to give it up ? ” — and Obi 
admitted that it was harder to continue it. The 
Interpreter then told him of what different prin- 
ciples English People were, and how kindly they 
were treated by them ; — how they were instructed 
in the Schools at Sierra Leone, and learned to 
serve God ; — that there was no war in Sierra 
Leone, and that there were no slaves; that all 
were free people, and were happy together. This 
account pleased Obi very much : he stood up and 
shook hands with all the Europeans present, as 
if he meant to thank them for the kindness shown 
to Black people. I mention this circumstance so

fully, to show that Interpreters of this descrip- 
tion cannot but be doing a great deal of good, 
and be eminently useful in spreading a correct 
knowledge of the slave-trade among their own 
country people, in convincing them of the enor- 
mity of its crime, and in directing them to better 
things. I always observed, that whenever the 
motives were explained to them by which England 
or English People were actuated in their exer- 
tions to abolish the slave-trade, every advocate 
of it was silenced ; and those who had before 
defended it would stand before us convicted in 
their own consciences of crimes of the blackest 
tinge, and would blush as much as Black people 
can blush. “We knew no better,” they would 
often say : “ hitherto we thought it was so God’s 
will that Black people should be slaves to White 
people. White people first told us we should sell 
slaves to them, and we sold them; and White 
people are now telling us not to sell slaves, and 
we will not sell them again — and, as another 
justly added, “ If White people give up buying. 
Black people will give up selling.” 

I have hitherto endeavoured to comply with my 
instructions daily to write my Journal, but now 
found it irksome for the first time. It was late at 


ANECDOTE DESCRIPTIVE OF THE IBOS’ IDEAS OF GOD. 7 1 

night, and I felt fatigued. Before, however, I take 
leave of the Ibo People, I must relate a story, 
which I was told this evening, descriptive of their 
ideas of God, and of the feelings and thoughts 
which occupy their mind. Of such I always 
endeavour to lay hold. I have before mentioned 
that there is a town where Tshuku gives his 
oracles, and answers questions which are put to 
him on important subjects. An answer of this 
kind, to an interesting query, is what I have now 
to record. There was a man in this country 
possessed of great riches, and, like many of his 
friends or equals, unwilling to part with them. 
Troubled by the thought, which interrupted him 
in all his enjoyments, that he had to die, he 
resolved to consult Tshuku, “ took road,” and 
went to Tshuku’s place. He told Tshuku that he 
“ had plenty money, plenty wives, plenty things . 
to eat,” and that he was very unwilling to leave 
all behind and enter into an unknown world. 
He wished therefore to know whether Tshuku 
could tell him any thing that he might do, to 
live for ever. Tshuku told him, that there was 
but one thing required of him ; and if he would 
do that, he would be sure to live for ever. “ Good 
news!” replied the rich man ; “ only tell me what 


72 


THE IBOS’ IDEAS OF GOD. 


it is, and I will do it.” Tshuku told him, that he 
should never allow himslf to fall asleep. The 
rich man promised to do it ; returned to his house, 
called his friends together, and made a great 
feast ; “ killed cattle, got plenty palm-wine, plenty 
rum, plenty every thing.” Eating and drinking, 
music, singing and dancing, continued all night; 
and no sleep came in the rich man’s eyes. To- 
ward morning, however, just when “ big darkness 
come before light come,” he put a little rum 
in his tumbler, sat down on a bench, and took 
“ no more little rum ; his eyes begin fall ; he no 
closed them good fashion : him tumbler begin 
drop from him hand : he jump up and say, ‘ Ah ! 
I no been asleep ; I no sleep, no more only tumbler 
fall from my hand : Tshuku no can believe me 
sleep.’ ‘ Well,’ said his friends, ‘ you better go 
ask Tshuku again ;’ ” and he took road a second 
time for Tshuku’s place. When he arrived there, 
Tshuku said, “Now, rich man, how you do? 
Have you slept since you were here?” “No,” 
replied the rich man. “What!” said Tshuku, 
“did not tumbler fall from your hands ?” The 
rich man, “ he no open mouth again.” “ See 
rich man,” said Tshuku, “ this makes God to be 
God, because He never sleeps; and you to be

man, because you must sleep.” I have given it 
as much in the language as I thought would be in- 
telligible to persons not acquainted with African- 
English. 

The whole Expedition left Ibo — Aboh — at 
3 o’elock P.M., much pleased at the good success 
and favourable commencement of the under- 
taking. The weather was delightful ; and as it 
was a fine moonlight night, we did not cast 
anchor before 11 o’clock p.m. 

Au(j. 29 : Ltyrd's Day — We spent a quiet Sab- 
bath to-day on board, much more so than on 
the three preceding. We had Divine Service on 
deck in the forenoon. Much rain toward even- 
ing, so that we could not have a second Service. — 
Remained at anchor all day. 

Au(j. 30 — I learned to-day that the plan of 
leaving Simon Jonas at Ibo had been altered. 
He is first to accompany us as far as the Conflu- 
ence ; and from thence take charge of our letters, 
and deliver them to Obi, who has engaged to 
forward them to Bonny, by any English vessel 
which may happen to be there. I am glad of 
this arrangement. Accordingly, a few letters 
were sent off to-day, by one of Obi’s peoj)le, 
who had accompanied us thus far. As I am

desirous of finding out how this plan of com- 
munication will answer, I have thought it worth 
while to put the circumstance on record.* 

Aug. 31 — This was decidedly the finest day we 
have had since entering the river ; and a change 
in the scenery contributed in no small degree 
to make it much more pleasant. There was a 
little elevated land on the left bank of the river. 
We passed only a few small villages, but could 
not ascertain their names. I was chiefly occupied 
in correcting and improving a translation of the 
model treaty, in the Haussa Language. The set- 
ting of the sun to-day was grand and majestic, 
beyond description. 

Sept. 1 — This morning we passed Akamaka, a 
market-town situated on the right bank, and 
Bokeng, on the left bank of the river. The latter 
appeared altogether in a swamp. Both are 
market-places, visited by people from Iddah and 
the surrounding towns. The country is still 
Ibo, though no longer subject to Esseh Obi Osa'i 
of Aboh. 

I was much annoyed and grieved this morning,

on observing tliat many of my articles of clothing 
in my boxes had got wet, and had become useless. 
In preparing for the journey, I went as far as my 
means would allow me to have every thing com- 
fortably supplied, knowing that cleanliness is one 
of the principal preservatives of health ; but now 
I am afraid, if our stay in the interior should be 
at all prolonged, I shall be in distress. I would 
much recommend our Society to supply their 
servants with water-proof boxes for such or 
similar undertakings. They can always be pro- 
cured in England, but never in Sierra Leone. 

About noon, we passed Damugu, the place 
where the former Expedition had much sickness 
on board, and sustained many losses. It seems to 
be a populous village, but in an unhealthy situa- 
tion. The water came up to the doors of the 
houses — another proof that the river must have 
risen to its average height ; for if it were to rise 
a single foot higher, the houses would be ruined. 
We observed a large canoe, heavily laden, ascend- 
ing the river, and wished much that they would 
come near us, to enable us to make a few inqui- 
ries; but we could not persuade them. Heavy 
rain for some hours in the afternoon, accompa- 
nied with thunder and lightning. Before sun-set,

GENERAL REMARKS. 


however, it became clear again, and the night 
was very fine. We cast anchor at 10 o’clock p.m. 

Sept. 2 — I have little or nothing worthy of 
remark. On board a vessel, every day is so 
much alike, that if there is no intercourse with 
the Natives, there can of course be no infor- 
mation to record. I observed, with regret, that 
the soil is not so much under cultivation above 
Ibo as below it.* The country cannot, in my 
estimation, be healthier than the Delta : the few 
villages we saw were entirely inundated. The 
language now spoken is the Eggarra, or, as it is 
also called, the Igalla ; but having no Interpreter 
of that nation in the “ Wilberforce,” we could not 
even obtain the names of the different villages. 
Our journey became more agreeable as we ap- 
proached nearer the high land. The heat was 
great at noon, though the thermometer was not 
higher than 85“ in the shade. 

* The “ Wilberforce,” during this time, chiefly kept the right 
bank of the river. Captain Trotter, in the “ Albert,” had a better 
opportunity of observing tbe cultivation of the left bank ; and 
considered it to be more extensively carried on above Ibo, than 
at any place he had seen below that town.

Sept. 3 — Yesterday, at 7 o’clock p. m., we an- 
chored at Iddah. Captain Trotter, wlio always 
aflforded me every opportunity in his power to 
become acquainted with the people of this coun- 
try, sent for me early this morning on board the 
“Albert,” and requested me to accompany a mis- 
sion to the King of Iddah. The mission was com- 
posed of Dr. M'William, myself, and Mr. Brown, 
a native of Cape Coast, often mentioned in Mr. 
Laird’s Journal. Dr. Stanger, the Geologist,

afterward joined us. Our mission was simply 
to invite his Majesty on board the “Albert,” 
where the Commissioners of the Queen of England 
would deliver their message to him. The king, of 
course, cannot be approached by strangers without 
a proper introduction : it was therefore necessary 
first to call upon an official person, and to apply 
for an introduction. In this case, it was pointed 
out to us that the sister of the late king had 
first to be consulted ; and access to her was im- 
mediately obtained. I was almost impatient for 
a sight of the person whose power and influence 
was so great, and whose services were of such 
importance, that even the presents for the king 
had first to be seen by her, to receive her appro- 
bation. The passage to her dwelling led through 
several unoccupied houses, and, though nobody 
would imagine it, was rather dangerous, not on 
account of thieves and robbers, but from the pecu- 
liar construction of the houses. Instead of doors, 
they have merely holes ; to enter which, you must 
stoop or creep, as may be deemed most con- 
venient ; and scarcely is one entered than another 
presents itself before you. Being unaccustomed 
to this, I happened, on entering, to stand erect, 
or endeavoured to do so, too soon, and knocked

my head several times against the walls with 
such violence that I almost fainted : and singular 
enough, though those who took the lead always 
warned their followers against knocking their 
heads, none appeared to be sufficiently cautious 
until he had himself received a more impressive 
warning — a warning, too, which left marks on 
the forehead for several days. At last, however, 
we arrived at the dwelling of the princess, which 
was superior in nothing to the rest of the houses. 
We were invited to take our seats under the 
projecting roof of the house. The princess, 
stooping down at the hole of her house, gave us 
a friendly welcome. She appeared to be about 
fifty years old. Her head had lately been shaven ; 
and her nose and upper lips were blackened 
with some kind of colour, though naturally black 
enough. Her apparel consisted of a rough coun- 
try cloth around her loins, without any orna- 
ments or marks to indicate her royal descent. 
I began to question whether we had arrived at 
the right place, and were with the right person ; 
for her appearance — though I never expected to 
see great grandeur in African royalty — was more 
like that of a mean slave. My suspicions, how- 
ever, were soon removed. We were told that she 


80 


INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCESS. 


was in mourning for her husband. At such 
seasons they divest themselves of all ornaments, 
especially widows, and disfigure themselves in 
the manner just mentioned, A daughter of the 
late king was with her, a young woman about 
sixteen years of age, whose apparel formed a great 
contrast from that of the old princess. Both 
her arms were ornamented with brass rings, 
weighing at least six pounds on each arm. — What 
a tyrant is fashion, in every place in the world ! 

We waited patiently under the piazza, sur- 
rounded by crowds of people, and almost suffo- 
cated, for a considerable time; expecting every 
moment the return of the eunuch, who had been 
despatched to the king, to apprise him of our 
arrival, and of our desire to have a personal 
interview with him. They were not much con- 
cerned, however, about our loss of time. To our 
repeated inquiries whether the eunuch had re- 
turned, or would soon return, we were told that 
we should have patience. Having waited from 
7 to 10 o’clock in the morning, to no purpose, 
we expressed a wish to go and see the town ; 
to which the princess had no objection. We 
went to one of the markets, to purchase some- 
thing to eat, as we began to feel hungry ; but

unfortunately had brought no cowries with us. 
One of the Natives, observing our perplexity, 
presented me with several cowries. I could not 
but admire his conduct ; for he evidently endea- 
voured to do it so that nobody should observe 
him — that the White man should not be exposed 
to shame by receiving a present from a Black 
man. All our wants were now soon sup- 
plied. I bought some ground-nuts ; and my com- 
panions procured some cocoa-nuts, 'the milk of 
which was very sweet. Having spent more than 
an hour in looking at the people, and allowing 
ourselves to be looked and laughed at by them, 
we returned to the princess, supposing that the 
eunuch would certainly then have returned ; but 
we were again told that we should have pa- 
tience. The good princess had, in the meantime, 
provided a good breakfast for us, consisting of 
a stewed duck* and mashed yams, prepared in 
country style. The stew was served up in a 
wooden bowl, large enough to contain twenty 
times the quantity, and the yams in one of 

* There were some bones, with meat, uncommonly sweet, in 
the stew, such as I never before observed in stewed dishes. The 
taste of the meat was somewhat between pork and mutton ; and 
I cannot help thinking but that we were treated with a little 
puppy, a favourite dish with the Natives. 


82 


INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF IDDAH. 


smaller dimensions; a large brass basin, filled 
with clean water, being placed between them. 
Mats were spread on the ground in the yard, on 
which we seated ourselves. The princess, to 
show that there was no poison in the stew, took 
the first piece ; and, to teach us how to eat with 
decency, first carefully put her fingers into the 
water and washed them clean : after which she 
withdrew, and left us to enjoy ourselves as well 
as we could. As there was only one fork for the 
whole party, we were of course obliged to follow 
her example and make use of the means with 
which nature had provided us. 

At 1 o’clock p.M. the eunuch returned, with the 
message of the king; which was very welcome, 
the king being pleased to receive us; and the 
same eunuch showed us tlie road to the palace. 
I could not observe the slightest difference in 
the outward appearance of the king’s houses 
from those of the rest of the people*. They 
formed a cluster of conical huts, surrounded by 
a mud wall, which wanted repairs in many places. 
We were again told to wait in the open air for 

* Others, however, observed that one of the houses was 
considerably higher than the rest, having the appearance of a 
look-out house.

some time : after a while, we were led under the 
piazza of a house, and treated with the African 
luxury, the gora-nuts and palm-wine. It was 
well for me that I was used to the nuts : they 
are an excellent tonic, and supply the place of 
quinine. But nothing would please us, as we 
became impatient for the king’s coming. 

At 4 o’clock P.M., however, another eunuch 
came, with a message from the king, that he could 
not see us because it was raining, and that it was 
the law of the country “ that rain should never 
drop on the king’s head.” It had been raining 
a little through the day ; but at the time he sent 
this message, it was clear, and no appearance of 
rain. As we considered this a mere excuse, and 
apprehended that he would find a similar one on 
the following day, we requested the eunuch to tell 
the king, that if he could not see us now, the 
vessels would leave, and he would have no other 
opportunity of hearing the Queen’s message. This 
was enough: the eunuch returned instantly, as- 
suring us that the king was getting ready, and 
preparations were commenced in the yard for 
his reception. A throne was put up in the open 
air, made of some bamboo-sticks, and a white 
country cloth nailed over it. A large red carpet. 


84 


INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF IDDAH. 


which covered the ground for some yards, was 
spread over the throne, over which was another 
smaller carpet. About half an hour afterward, 
his majesty made his appearance, and took his 
seat upon the throne. His dress was splendid 
and ridiculous. I shall not attempt to describe 
it fully. The red velvet tobe was certainly im- 
posing ; while one could not help smiling at the 
bells around his legs, the large quantity of beads 
around his neck, and the carpet slippers, large 
enough to fit an elephant. He was accompanied 
by a band of musicians, and between forty and 
fifty eunuchs. All took their seats on the ground, 
turning their backs on his majesty, except a few 
persons who were fanning him. Permission was 
then given to us to deliver our message ; which 
we did as briefly as possible, seated on the 
ground, but upon carpets spread for us at the 
king’s request. Our message was delivered to 
him through our Interpreter, William Johnson, in 
the Eggarra language ; the king’s mouth* merely 
repeating the very same words, in a louder 
tone of voice. When our business was done, his 
majesty, addressing himself to the Interpreter, 

* The chief speaker, lawyer, or interpreter, is, in several 
countries, called the King’s Mouth. 


ANSWER OF THE KING OF IDDAH. 


85 


w'ho is not only a native of this town, but really 
related to the royal family now on the throne, 
was pleased to return the following most kingly 
answer : — “ You must thank God that your own 
family is now on the throne. I am much pleased 
to see White people, if they are pleased to see 
me. If they are my friends, they will believe 
my word. When White people were here be- 
fore, there w^as another king here. I have come 
to the throne since ; and I am glad to see White 
people again in my country. If White people 
are really anxious to have my friendship, they 
ought to be in no hurry to leave, because I like 
my friends to eat and drink with me for two 
or three days. If strangers come to me, they 
cannot go away until they have heard my answer. 
I did not want to come to-day; but as you said 
there would be no rain, I thought you had 
power to stop the rain. The river downwards 
and upwards belongs to me. Your Queen sent 
you : can I send to your Queen ? You brought a 
present, to see me : I have not seen it (regarded 
it). You come to make me a friend: the king 
has no friend. If any one comes from distant 
countries, like you, to see me, he ought to bring a 
present worthy of a king : this is only fit for my 


86 


ANSWER OF THE KING OF IDDAH. 


servants to wear. The king and God are some- 
thing alike, and the present ought to be worthy 
of the king and of God. (Here his majesty’s 
gravity was interrupted for a moment ; he having 
caught a glimpse of my spectacles, and expressed 
a wish to get a pair like them.) I am a king ; 
and a king never puts his foot into a canoe. 
(Immense cheering by his people, expressed by 
singing out, “ Lafia, Lafia.”) If the captain of 
the canoes wishes to see me, he must march on 
shore, or not see me at all ; the king follows 
nobody. God made the king to be like him- 
self : and ever since God made the king, it was 
never heard that the king went into a canoe. 
The king before me never went in the canoe of 
those White people who were here before. All 
people who have any business ought to come 
to me ; and if the captain has any thing to say, 
which is good for me and for him, he will come. 
If he wishes to speak to me privately, I will 
drive all my people away ; and if it is fit for 
every body to hear, then shall every body hear 
it.” — Was not this a kingly answer ? 

His Majesty wished now to learn whether Iris 
answer pleased us : to which we replied, that we 
were messengers, and would convey it to our 


REMARKS ON THE KINg’s ANSWER. 87 

Commander ; and that we had no doubt that the 
king would be much pleased to hear what he had 
to say to him. “ I wish to hear it first,” he said, 
“ before I can know whether it will please me or 
not, and whether it is good or bad. I want to 
see the captain himself : and if he cannot come, 
I don’t want to see another messenger.” 

I have given the king’s answer as literally as 
possible, and have not interrupted its logical 
arrangement by observations of my own, except 
where they served as an illustration of the mode 
of delivery ; but may now be permitted to make 
a few remarks on it. The king expressed an 
opinion of our power which might, at first sight, 
appear contemptuous : but several things have 
occurred to my mind, by which I am led to 
believe that the king was really serious when he 
said that he thought we had power to stop the 
rain. I have been repeatedly told by Heathens 
that there were great, clever, and powerful men 
in their own countries, who could at pleasure 
either procure or stop the rain ; and this notion 
prevails particularly among the Ibos, and the 
worshippers of thunder and lightning of other 
nations. Some years ago, when residing at 
Hastings, one of the Liberated African Villages 


88 


REMARKS ON THE INTERVIEW 


at Sierra Leone, while occupied in building a 
house there, using every exertion in my power 
to complete it previous to the falling of the rain, 
I was myself charged with the crime or skill, 
whatever it may be called, of staying the rain. 

The king objected to the presents, as being 
beneath his dignity. What they consisted of, 
I cannot say exactly ; but I know there was a large 
tobe among them of superfine blue cloth ; such as, 
at least, all the skill in his whole kingdom could 
not have produced, nor his treasures have pur- 
chased ; yet still, it was considered beneath his 
dignity. — What base ingratitude ! How arrogant, 
how proud, is man’s heart by nature ! Had he 
not appeared in the very tobe presented to him by 
the former Expedition, he could not have assumed 
such pomp and grandeur. 

The Interpreter introduced me as a Mallam — 
Teacher of the Christian Religion — which ex- 
cited the king’s curiosity. He inquired of him 
what the difference was between us and the 
Mahomedans : to which he replied, that we 
knew better what was the will of the only True 
God ; and that we were endeavouring to teach 
all people to know and to do His will. He 
then wished to know for what reason I had 


WITH THE KING OF IDDAH. 


89 


endeavoured to get some books from one of the 
Mahomedans of this town — whether it was not 
for the sake of learning something from them. 
These inquiries of the king betrayed something 
of his policy. This plainly showed that the visits 
which must always be first made to some head- 
man or head-woman are not intended as marks 
of respect to them, but are chiefly means through 
which the king collects information about the 
strangers, previous to their interview with him. 
Every word that is spoken, or every thing that is 
done by them, is carried to his ears. On walking 
through the streets, I happened to meet a Maho- 
medan, who had about twenty leaves of paper in 
his hands, beautifully written in Arabic ; and re- 
quested him to let me have some of them, for 
which I would let him have some paper again, on 
his coming to the vessel. Our Interpreter told 
him that the White Mallams knew the Maho- 
medan books well enough, and that they merely 
liked to have the things made by Black people to 
look at ; and that they wrote books about every 
thing they saw and heard. 

Another question was put to the Interpreter 
by the king, which is also interesting. The 
king wished to know whether the English were 


90 REMARKS ON THE FIRST INTERVIEW WITH OBI. 

the people who watched the sea-coast, taking- 
slave-vessels, and liberating the slaves. The 
question was no intricate one to a person who, 
like himself — I mean the Interpreter — was a 
living witness of the fact. He told the king 
much of the power of England, and of the 
good intentions of the English people toward the 
Blacks. Every thing of this kind confirms my 
opinion of Sierra Leone, and of the destiny of its 
inhabitants to become the messengers of the 
Gospel to their benighted countrymen in all parts 
of Western Africa. 

The Attah expressed the same wish as Obi did, 
that the Interpreter should remain with him, 
and teach him “ English fashion.” I always hear 
these expressions, not only with pleasure, but with 
sincere gratitude to Almighty God ; and take 
courage. 

The last inquiry of the Attah deserving notice 
was, whether the English People were con- 
tinually living on the water, or whether they 
possessed land and houses like other people. The 
description which the Interpreter gave him of the 
towns and cities of the English Nation, and their 
power and influence, might well have humbled 
the pride of the Negro king, and caused him to 


obi’s interview with the commissioners. 91 

form a proper estimate of his nothingness, rather 
than his power and greatness. I could not gather, 
from any observations made, what was the opi- 
nion of his Majesty, whether he approved or 
disapproved of the capturing of slaves ; but as 
he must have felt that it was against his own in- 
terests, his cautious silence may perhaps justly be 
construed as indicating a dislike to it. The whole 
transactions of the day, and the king’s reply, did 
not lead me to expect a favourable result from 
further negociations with him ; though, as the 
chief design of the Mission had not been even 
hinted at, it would have been wrong to have ex- 
pressed a decided opinion. The Commissioners, 
therefore, determined on a personal interview 
with him on the following day. 

Sept. A — The interview determined on yes- 
terday took place this afternoon, in the same 
court-yard as on the day previous. The cere- 
monies were the same as those described before, 
except that the king had the good sense not to 
let the Commissioners wait for his appearance, as 
we had done. As the king had assumed such 
a high air, it was deemed desirable to do every 
thing that could be devised to give him a deep 
impression of the importance of the Commission ; 


92 


INTERVIEW AND TREATY 


which therefore left the “ Albert” under a salute ; 
and six marines formed a guard of honour, one 
at the head blowing a bugle. The crowd of peo- 
ple was immense, all admiring the fine soldiers. 
The terms of the treaty were made known to 
the king, through our Interpreter, William John- 
son, who managed the business remarkably well, 
so that every body was pleased with his manner. 
It relieved me of many fears I had before enter- 
tained. The king agreed to all, without an ex- 
ception. He now and then made a remark, and 
inquired after things which, at first mentioning, 
did not appear clear to him ; and every word he 
said, or remark he made, fully proved that he 
understood what was said to him. He wished to 
know whether he might send two of his sons to 
England, to receive a better education ; and whe- 
ther they would be treated with kindness. When 
the subject of the abolition of human sacrifices 
was brought before him, he wished to learn what 
the opinions of the Commissioners were, in case 
his dominions should be invaded by another 
power, and he be obliged to make war, to prevent 
his own people being ill treated, carried away, or 
killed. The terms of the treaty were more fully 
explained to him. He was told that they did not 


WITH THE KING OF IDDAH. 


93 


mean to interfere with him in wars for his own 
defence, but merely to abolish the practice of 
sacrificing human beings for religious purposes. 
At this proposition one of the eunuchs laughed 
most heartily ; but as he expressed the emotions 
of his heart in no other manner, it is difficult to 
guess what occasioned it. Perhaps the custom of 
the country hitherto may throw some light on 
this ; for though the expression of his counte- 
nance, in laughing, gave me an impression that it 
had arisen from contempt, it may be that the 
prospect of gaining an earthly existence, or rather 
a duration of it for a short time longer, by this 
clause, caused his heart to cheer up. Hitherto it 
has been the custom of the country, at the death 
of every king, to sacrifice his favourite wife, and 
ten eunuchs, to secure society to the king in the 
next world. Whether they offer human sacrifices 
on any other occasion I cannot say with cer- 
tainty ; but I consider it very probable. 

The king was more condescending than yes- 
terday, and allowed the whole company to shake 
hands with him. When it came to my turn, I took 
the liberty of addressing him with the regular 
Haussa salutation addressed to great people and 
kings : “ Alla bah ka yawa rai !” — “ God give you 


94 


INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF IDDAH. 


long life !” — to which he replied, “ Amin, amin !” 
When all was over and settled, he called for the 
two White Mallams, Mr. Muller and myself. Mr. 
Muller took the opportunity of explaining to 
him why we could not go on with the business 
the following day, and why we kept that day 
holy; but the list of presents annexed to the 
treaty having been brought before him and 
explained, he became more interested in that 
than in the ordinances and institutions of our 
religion. The whole business might have been 
concluded this evening, if a light could have 
been procured ; but the king had not even a 
palm-oil lamp ; and candles could not be expected. 
Pieces of broken calabashes were smeared over 
with palm-oil, and lighted, which did not give 
light enough to write or read. The finishing of 
the palaver was therefore postponed till Monday 
next; and the “Albert” took us over to the oppo- 
site side of the river, where the “ Wilberforce” 
and “ Soudan” were at anchor, cutting fuel pre- 
paratory to proceeding higher up the river. 

Sept. 5 : Lord's Day — This day was kept holy 
by all the ship’s company; and seldom have I 
enjoyed a day of rest more than this. I en- 
gaged in the religious services with benefit to my

own soul ; and trust that, through the Divine 
Blessing, they served for the edification of others. 
The weather was fine ; sunshine all the day ; yet 
a cool air, so that it was very pleasant under the 
awning. ' Several cases of fever occurred in the 
“ Albert” and the “ Soudan” since Friday last : one 
man is in a dangerous state. No illness to speak of 
in our vessel- May the Lord be gracious unto us, 
and spare our lives to accomplish the work which 
He has put into our hands ! and, if it should please 
Him, who is all wise, to call us hence, may He 
prepare us for another and a better world ! 

Sept. 6 — I was called on board the “Albert” 
this morning, with the Haussa Interpreters. I 
cannot understand the people well, when they talk 
fast ; but trust my ears will soon become familiar 
with their sounds. The weather was gloomy ; my 
mind much depressed ; and I was brought still 
lower by a melancholy accident which took place. 
William Johnson, the Interpreter, fell overboard, 
and was drowned. I saw him struggling with the 
waves, and endeavouring to lay hold of a canoe ; 
but he could not succeed. Three canoes, con- 
taining nearly a hundred persons, were alongside ; 
but— oh the hardness of heart ! — none moved a 
finger to assist him. Our own people got into 


96 


DEATH OF WILLIAM JOHNSON. 


the boats, and did all they could ; but were too 
late : — he sunk ; and not even his body could be 
found. When he acted as Interpreter on Satur- 
day last, he gave much satisfaction to all. Though 
I felt gratified at the choice of Interpreters 
which I made, yet nothing was more painful to 
my mind than the recollection of having sent 
for him upon the arrival of the Expedition, and 
informing him that I was anxious he should be 
so employed. I felt, however, most of all grieved, 
fearing that he was not quite sober when so sud- 
denly called into eternity. I knew him for several 
years, as a communicant of our Church ; but I do 
not recollect that he was ever charged with, or 
suspected of, the crime of drunkenness. He left 
a daughter, about fifteen years of age, with one 
of our schoolmasters, John Attarra, at Welling- 
ton : she is his only child. I see how necessary 
it is to watch closely over this people. William 
Johnson remained on shore on Saturday even- 
ing, without permission; and was surrounded 
by friends and relations, who treated him, though 
without any evil intention, still very cruelly, by 
giving him too much palm-wine, or country beer, 
to drink. He had before been in a state of men- 
tal excitement, which various circumstances were 


DESCRIPTION OF IDDAH. 


97 


calculated to produce ; and was so betrayed into 
a weakness, by which he lost his life. 

I must now say a few words about the place 
and people. The kingdom under the king of 
Iddah is called Eggarra. I have frequently heard 
it called Igalla. Interchanging the letters r and I 
for each other is not at all uncommon among the 
tribes of Africa. Eggarra, however, seems most 
prevalent, and therefore must be considered the 
standard. The extent of liis kingdom has, I 
believe, not been sufficiently ascertained. It is a 
piece of information which is not easily obtained ; 
because those who are best qualified to give it 
cannot be asked without the risk of exciting some 
suspicious feeling in their minds: and, on the 
other hand, it is well known that each king or 
chief endeavours to make White people believe 
that himself is the greatest of all, and that all 
other kings are tributary to him. 

The town, Iddah*, is beautifully situated, on a 
hill, on the left bank of the river : its exact geo- 
graphical situation will be stated by persons better 

* The hill and clilFs upon which the town stands are very 
correctly delineated in Captain W. Allen’s beautiful “ Pic- 
turesque Views on the Niger,” p. 10, published by Murray, 
Albemarle Street.

qualified for it than myself. The population of 
Iddah is not overrated at five or six thousand. 
Their articles of trade are well described by 
Mr. Laird. No European articles of trade were 
exposed in the market. The houses are nearly all 
built of a conical shape ; some of bricks, made by 
the Natives, merely exposed to the sun and dried ; 
but as the clay seems of a good quality, the bricks 
might be much improved by European industry. 
A very few glasses, plates, or cups of European 
manufacture are seen in their houses ; and besides 
a hole to creep in, there is no other aperture 
through which either light or air is admitted. 
The walls are about twelve or fourteen inches 
thick, and covered with grass or bamboo. The 
roads, even in the town, are narrow ; and a rough 
grass, seven or eight feet high, grows on both 
sides. A few spots only of the soil are under cul- 
tivation, though it appears fertile. Stone houses 
might be built here, there being an abundance of 
sand-stone. None could be seen at Ibo. Whether 
lime can be procured, I cannot say. I have seen 
no oyster- shells, from which it might be made, as 
is done along the coast; neither do I suppose 
that the limestone can be found in the neigh- 
bourhood. 


AND ITS INHABITANTS.

The people seem harmless and good-natured. 
They never asked for rum ; all they begged for 
was writing-paper; but knowing for what pur- 
pose it was asked, I did not feel disposed to let 
them have any. If it had been for the purpose 
of learning to write, or to keep their accounts, 
I should have obliged them with much pleasure ; 
but to the system of selling charms I can render 
no assistance. I was frequently asked for a leaf 
of my pocket-book ; and one written over would 
have been a very valuable present, and, of course, 
a most effectual charm, being written by a White 
Mallam. The bulk of the people are pagans ; 
but the Mahomedans must have exercised a con- 
siderable influence over them, there being no 
idol publicly exposed at Iddah, though many 
other marks of superstition were observed. It 
does not appear as if the Mahomedans felt anxious 
to convert the lower classes to their belief ; pro- 
bably because they are not able to pay them well 
for their charms, and for offering up prayers in 
their behalf. They have many converts among 
the higher classes; who have, at least, learned 
how to despise others, and to speak contemptibly 
of them, as Kafris. None of the Mallams I met 
with at Iddah are capable of teaching. Not one

of the king’s own Mallams was able to sign his 
name to the treaty ; and the king escaped the 
exposure of his ignorance by saying “ That a 
king never did any thing so servile or menial as 
to write his own name.” The Mallams are not 
merely teachers, they also carry on trade : their 
former occupation, however, is undoubtedly the 
most lucrative of the two, since their ministerial 
labours consist chiefly in selling charms. Though 
Christians and Mahomedans differ widely in their 
respective creeds, there is, at least, one point 
in which both agree — the abhorrence of human 
sacrifices. Great pleasure was manifested when 
the subject was introduced, and the king pledged 
his word to abolish them : they shook the Inter- 
preter’s hand most heartily, in expression of their 
approbation of the measure. 

The people, in general, appear very healthy, 
and of a strong constitution. Our medical men 
were on shore, and inquired at two or three places 
whether there were any sick people to whom 
they might administer medicine ; but there were 
none to be found, except such as were troubled 
with yaws and craw-craw, diseases very com- 
mon, but not much feared by the Black people. 
Whether the situation of Iddah would agree wdth 


FOR A MISSIONARY STATION. 


101 


Europeans, is another question, no trial having 
ever been made. The situation is much better 
than Ibo : yet even this proves little ; for though 
the town itself stands on elevated ground, it is 
almost surrounded by swamps ; and I have no 
hesitation in saying that the dry season must be 
very unhealthy. At present there is little or no 
malaria, the Avhole surface of the country being 
covered with water; but when the water shall 
recede, and the sun begin to operate on the mud, 
there will be much malaria created. There is, 
therefore, no ground on which I could consist- 
ently recommend it as a Missionary Establish- 
ment for European Agents. Here, again, we feel 
our helplessness, and need of Native assistance. 
Something, however, is gained by the treaty 
wliich the Attah has signed; by which he is 
bound, not only to tolerate Christian Teachers, 
of whatever complexion, but to protect them 
and their property. I am extremely tired and 
sleepy: it is late. Our vessel is aground*. —

OBSERVATIONS 


Sept. 7 — Every possible exertion was made to- 
day to get the “ Wilberforce” afloat again; but in 
vain. I got up this morning with much head- 
ache, a little fever, and prostration of strength — 
foreboding illness. The heat was great, and the 
cabin too close to spend the day in it. A simple 
dose of medicine relieved me much; so that in 
the afternoon I could apply myself to the study 
of the Haussa. One man finished his earthly 
career on board the “ Albert ” last night. Our 
hopes of getting the vessel oflF again are very 
low. The only prospect which we have left us, 
humanly speaking, is the rising of the river. 

Sept. 8 — Much rain through the night. The 
“ Wilberforce” was afloat again before breakfast ; 
and we returned thanks to God, who had mer- 
cifully delivered us from our distressing situa- 
tion. The river appears to have risen in the 
night about six inches. 

In the hasty description of Iddah, and of the 
transaction with the king, I omitted to give an 
opinion about something which struck me at 
the time the king expressed his desire of send- 
ing two of his sons to England , for education. 
I am aware that my advice is not needed 
in the matter, and that the entire omission 


ON THE EDUCATION OF NATIVE PRINCES. 


103 


would be no great loss; yet I may as well 
state it, though superfluous. The proposal is of 
such a nature as appears, at first hearing, most 
desirable; yet the results, in various instances, 
have shown that those benefits have not been 
obtained by it which had been so fondly antici- 
pated. But if future trials of this kind should 
be in contemplation, it should be borne in mind, 
that, in many of the kingdoms of Africa, the 
eldest son is not necessarily heir to the throne. 
I have heard at this place that the king chooses 
and appoints his own successor; and another 
account was, that his eldest brother always suc- 
ceeds him ; but which of the two is correct, I am 
unable to decide. The information which I have 
been able to collect on this subject, from the 
Bulloms and Sherbros, plainly proves that the 
people would be too much prejudiced in favour 
of their long-accustomed habits and superstitions 
than to select a king whose views would differ 
so widely from their own, wherever an elective 
power is lodged in them. The hopes, therefore, 
of seeing an educated Christian king ascend the 
throne of an African kingdom would almost con- 
tinually be disappointed. But as they would still 
be numbered among the principal people, and 


104

would have opportunities of doing good, it is 
very desirable that the means of raising them 
above the common level should, as far as pru- 
dent, be used ; and settlements along the coast 
would perhaps offer greater facilities, and be 
more appropriate than England. 

We were favoured with a strong tornado* this 
evening. They are not pleasant at the time, but 
confer a great blessing upon us : we always bail 
their appearance with joy. — Some of our own 
people very ill with fever. I felt truly' thank- * 
ful at seeing that we are nearly ready for our 
departure from this place, because w^e may hope 
that we shall enjoy better health in the hilly 
country, near the Confluence. 

Sept. 9 — Early this morning we left Iddah, and 
proceeded up the river. The country every 
moment becomes finer in appearance, and, it may 
be hoped, healthier also. Oh, may the change of 
air and scenery prove beneficial to our poor suf- 
ferers ! I was much pleased with their conver- 
sation this morning : their hearts were open 
towards me ; and they were convinced that I bore

them in mind at the Throne of Grace. How 
pleasing it was to hear them express their strong 
confidence in God, and acknowledge Him as the 
only Helper and Healer ! They appeared to take 
courage, when I told them through how many 
fevers I had graciously been preserved, by God’s 
Almighty arm. 

I feel that I ought to say a few words about the 
country and people inhabiting the banks of the 
river opposite Iddah; but having had no oppor- 
tunity of landing there, I can state nothing from 
personal observation. With the kind permission 
of Dr. Pritchett, I make use of his notes, which 
contain the sum and substance of all I could col- 
lect from other persons, and which I here lite- 
rally quote : — 

“ The ‘ Wilberforce’ moved from her anchorage 
near Iddah, September 4th, to the opposite side 
of the river, for the purpose of obtaining wood ; 
our coals getting short. This shore is low and 
swampy ; but abounds with trees, which we com- 
menced cutting. However, about noon, a number 
of Natives, armed with bows and arrows, and 
short broad knives stuck in a girdle, made their 
appearance, and seemed inclined to make some 
resistance. One of our men, understanding their

language, Benin, made them acquainted with our 
peaceful objects and our want of wood, and that 
we intended them no harm ; at which they were 
satisfied. We proceeded to the town, about five 
miles distant. On landing near the river, we had 
to wade through mud and swamp ; but the road 
very soon improved, and we passed through a 
fine dry country, remarkably well cultivated, and 
in excellent order ; plantains, yams, Indian-corn, 
and cotton being the principal occupants of the 
soil. We were met on the road by numerous 
parties of inhabitants, bringing goats, yams, &c. 
for sale. One of the principal men showed us 
the way to Wappa, the chief town, which we 
reached in about an hour and a half ; when we 
were requested to wait under a large tree at the 
entrance of the village, while our arrival was 
announced to the Chief of the town, who soon 
after sent to express his willingness to receive 
us. We were here surrounded by some hundreds 
of a most savage-looking and well-armed race, 
bearing poisoned arrows and large knives. Their 
object appeared to be curiosity to see the White 
People, whom they had never seen before. The_ 
Chief shook hands with us, and expressed his 
great pleasure at seeing White People in his 


ARMED NATIVES AT VVAPPA. 


107 


country. He hoped we would return to him by 
and bye ; when he would get plenty of wood, and 
every thing else ready for us that we might 
require. The Chief’s name, as given by himself, 
is Egada Yabulama; and, from the information 
we could obtain, he appears to be under the juris- 
diction of the King of Benin, whose name is 
Obah, and who sacrifices three human beings 
every day ; one at sun-rise, the other at noon, and 
the third at sun-set. From the number of armed 
able-bodied men which we saw, this would appear 
to be a most powerful people; but from their 
having so confined ideas about numbers, this could 
not be ascertained ; though the Interpreter stated 
that 10,000 armed men could be raised, if required.” 

The heat was very great to-day ; the thermo- 
meter 86° in the afternoon ; but a tornado cooled 
the air much. The scenery was delightful all 
day, but more especially toward the evening, as 
we approached the mountains* and could inhale 
cooler air. Several canoes, containing about forty 
or fifty persons each, passed us, going down the 
river. One came to us, offering a miserable horse,

and a dog of the same description, for sale. What 
use they thought we could make of the former, 
I am at a loss to say ; and of the latter, we were 
not in need for food, and therefore gladly left 
tliem such luxuries. Several villages were seen 
of a better appearance than those below ; but we 
had no intercourse with the Natives. 

Sept. 10 — We were again on our way early 
this morning. The scenery made me for a 
moment forget that I was in Africa. The high 
and rocky hills, both near and at a distance, put 
me in mind of the ruined castles on the Rhine, 
to which they bore a greater resemblance than 
any thing I have ever seen. But what a pity 
that they are so barren and unfruitful ! The 
whole aspect was uncommonly pleasing to the 
eye ; but not so to the mind that wishes well to 
Africa and to her children, which could receive 
no other impression than that of disappointment, 
at the barrenness of the country, and of the 
impossibility of improvement by the hand of 
industry. The country appears thickly peopled ; 
but nothing but yams and Indian-corn is cul- 
tivated, and that only on a few spots close to the 
river. Whole villages were inundated ; and the 
roofs of the houses were either resting on the 


BEAUFORT ISLAND.

ground or swimming in the water. The Natives 
must either live a migratory kind of life, and 
build houses at different places for the two sea- 
sons in which the year naturally divides itself 
in Africa ; or the river must be unusually high, 
and have driven them from their abodes. The 
former supposition seems most probable *. 

At this moment, I o’clock p.m., we are at anchor 
near Beaufort Island, which is almost overflown. 
It cannot, at any spot, be more than twenty or 
twenty-five feet from the water t, and only a few 
dry spots between the rocks are under cultiva- 
tion. There are two or three villages on it; 
from which the inhabitants came to us in little 
canoes, with yams, eggs, and a little rice, taste- 
fully packed up in small bags made of grass. 
They speak the Nufi language. Their apparel 
was a country cloth around their loins, with 
which all, whom we saw, were provided. It was 
somewhat different below this place ; the children 
of both sexes, about twelve years of age, or even 
to fourteen, being almost invariably in a state

ARRIVAL AT ADDA KUDDU. 


of nature, I feel strongly impressed that the 
country in which we now are is the healthiest 
we have seen, since entering the river. The 
banks above Beaufort Island are high and rocky, 
so that no malaria can rise from them ; and if, 
as is said, the bed of the river consists of sand 
instead of mud, nothing is to be apprehended 
at the receding of the water. 

Still much sickness in all our vessels. Some 
of our people appear improving, but two or three 
are dangerously ill. I feel glad in the anticipa- 
tion that we shall arrive at the Confluence to- 
morrow. As long as I am merely in the vessel, 
and looking at the country and people from a 
distance, I feel as if I were not in the path of 
duty, and my time spent to no purpose. 

Sept. 11 — About 8 o’clock this morning we cast 
anchor, at Adda Kuddu, one of the places pro- 
posed to be purchased from the King of Iddah ; 
and are now within four or five miles from the 
Confluence of the Tshadda and the River Niger. 
The immediate neighbourhood, or banks of the 
river, do not appear well suited for cultivation, 
consisting of large rocks. There is not any town— 
or village, as I can find, near our anchorage. 
Toward noon, however, large canoes, full of people. 


ADDA KUDDU.

approached us, the first who have as yet come 
near us ; and in one of the canoes was the 
Chief of the town called Shimri, on the opposite 
or Tshadda side. He was accompanied by his 
musicians, and several eunuchs. It appears, from 
their statement, that a few months since they 
were driven away from this side by the Fula- 
tahs ; who committed great ravages, and carried 
away many of the inhabitants as slaves, obliging 
the rest to seek for shelter on the other side of 
the Tshadda, or the “ Black Water*,” as they call 
it. — A site for the intended Model Farm was 
partially inspected to-day ; but I believe that 
the Commissioners arrived at no decision. 

I have before mentioned, that from the cir- 
cumstance of the houses being built in such 
situations as to be liable to be washed away 
when the river rises, I drew the conclusion that 
they were merely intended for the dry season ; 
but to-day I learned that the river has not been 
so high as it is at present for the last twenty 
years. For this information I am indebted to 
the Mallam on board the “ Albert,” on whose 
authority this is now stated.

INCREASED SICKNESS AND DEATHS 


I was sorry to learn, on meeting the other 
vessels, that the “ Soudan” had lost one man by 
fever, on the 9th instant. Another followed him 
from the “ Wilberforce” this evening ; and the 
lives of several more are still in the most pre- 
carious condition : — another fresh case of fever 
on board the “ Wilberforce.” The country we 
are now in, the clear air, and dry atmosphere 
we enjoy, would cause us to doubt that the 
climate could be dangerous, were it not for the 
sick and the dying by whom we are surrounded. 
I pray for them ; I pray with them ; and their 
sick beds have taught me many a lesson. I can- 
not speak of decided cases of sick or death-bed 
conversions ; but I have had pleasing proofs 
that my feeble assistance was acceptable, and, 
I trust, blessed by God to them. Of some, I 
am certain that they have not engaged in this 
Expedition for the sake of double pay, but were 
actuated by better and nobler motives ; and to 
them belongs the promise of the Saviour, that 
they shall in no wise lose their reward. I feel 
much supported by the assurance that many 
prayers are offered up in distant lands, on our 
behalf, by the friends of the great cause in which 
we have the honour to be engaged. 


ON BOARD THE VESSELS. 


113 


The heat to-day was great — 87° at 5 p.m. — 
but by no means oppressive. I was very well all 
day. The only inconvenience I felt arose from 
the want of sound sleep. I am covered with 
the prickly-heat, which made me feel all night 
as if I was lying on needles. 

Sept. 12: Lord's Day — Another death on board 
the “ Albert” last night, and several persons still 
very ill in each of our vessels. There is no 
knowing what another day may bring forth. 
If ever I felt the importance and responsibility 
of a Minister of the Gospel, it was to-day. Our 
Service was, to my mind, a solemn one. I ad- 
ministered the Sacrament, for the first time, on 
board the “ Wilberforce.” The Service was held 
on the quarter-deck : behind me was the lifeless 

corpse of N , a sailor, who expired last night ; 

before me an attentive audience, of as many as 
could be spared from their work ; on deck were 
the carpenters making a coffin ; on the forepart 
of the vessel were seven persons dangerously ill 
of fever; and at a few yards from us was the 
“Albert” lying, with the usual sign of mourning 
— a lowered flag. I spoke on the right state of 
mind which we ought to possess at the approach 
of death. My text was taken from the Acts, 7th 


114 


MODEL FARM. 


chapter, the last two verses. It was not a studied 
sermon : it came from the heart, and, if I am 
not mistaken, found its way to the heart. The 
sailor was buried by myself, at Adda Kuddu, 
this evening. I heard of no new case of sickness 
to-day; and was thankful when I observed that 
some of our people were, to all appearance, im- 
proving. I could truly and fully enter into the 
feelings of one man, when he told me that he 
hoped, by God’s mercy, to be spared and per- 
mitted to see his wife and child once more : the 
chord of sympathy was powerfully touched by this 
expression of his desire. The Natives were very 
quiet; not a single person was seen near us. 
They were told yesterday that we kept this day 
holy. The heat was great, the thermometer 
being 87° late in the evening in the shade. 

Sejyt. 13 — We were all permitted once more] to 
open our eyes in the land of the living. To have 
heard of the departure of one or more would have 
been less unexpected, than to learn that all were 
still alive. No improvement, however, since this 
morning, in any of the sick. We remained at 
our anchorage till late in the evening ; when we 
removed to Sterling Hill, and inspected the long- 
looked-for place for a Model Farm : it was not. 


COMMISSION FROM THE KING OF IDDAH. 


115 


I believe, decided whether a trial should be made 
here. I regret to say, that it does not appear to 
me well suited for the purpose ; though it is cer- 
tainly the best site, close to the river, which we 
have seen. The place would answer well enough 
for a fort. 

The King of Iddah has sent his second Judge, 
agreeably to his promise, to see how matters 
stood — and also to receive the payment of 
cowries which had been promised, after the land 
had been selected by the Commissioners, and 
made over to the Queen. His Honour appears 
to be very sensitive. He considered himself 
slighted, not being made so much of as he had 
expected : his feelings were so much wrought 
upon, that tears were in his eyes, though there 
was not the slightest occasion for it. Our vessel 
was in great confusion, by the concourse of 
Natives from all directions : the noise was very 
bad for our poor invalids. They brought but a 
few things for sale — chickens, ducks, goats ; beer 
made of Guinea-corn, none of which was pur- 
chased ; and a few eggs. The best of all was honey 
— to my taste as delicious as any I ever tasted, 
and in considerable quantity. I inquired after 
bees-wax, but could not ascertain whether they 


116 


NATIVE SILK MANUFACTURE. 


had any : a little, no doubt, they must have had. 
Their language was chiefly Nufi; a few only 
spoke Haussa, and they were strangers at the 
place. I w'as not a little surpi'ised on observing 
that one of the Mallams wore a silk tobe of 
native manufacture. The weaving was done re- 
markably well, but the cloth was only three 
inches wide; the needle- work on it was done 
very tastefully. I was told that the silk was the 
produce of the Bornou country ; that the tobe 
had been made there also; and that the price 
paid for it was 30,000 cowries. The silk could 
not weigh less than seven or eight pounds. 

I felt the heat very much all day: a strong 
wind in the evening was very welcome. I was 
glad of the opportunity of learning a few Haussa 
words from our visiters. My ears have become 
gradually acquainted with the sound ; and I was 
able to take down many sentences of their 
conversation, which confirmed the correctness of 
my grammatical observations. I long for the 
time when I shall be chiefly surrounded by 
Haussa People, and have opportunities enough 
to enlarge my Vocabulary and correct and im- 
prove my translations. 

Sept. 14 — Another death on board the “Albert” 


SETTLEMENT OF LAND FOR THE MODEL FARM. 117 

last night; and one of our men on board the 
“ Wilberforce” expired at 8 o’clock this morning. 
Several new cases of fever. It is impossible to say 
to what the unhealthiness of the country must be 
ascribed. The appearance of it is very pleasant. 
The morning was delightfully cool : toward noon, 
however, it became hot, and continued so till after 
sun-set. I really envied the Natives, who could 
through the heat of the day stretch themselves 
on deck, under the awning, without committing 
a breach of good manners. It required exertion 
to speak or to walk about slowly. Sitting down 
in the cabin was like being in an oven. I do not 
recollect that I ever felt any thing equal to the 
heat in Sierra Leone. 

The bargain for the land for the Queen was 
concluded to-day. The accredited agents of the 
Attah made over to the Crown of England the 
land from Beaufort Island to Sterling Hill inclu- 
sive, an extent of about twenty-five miles, with 
the right of the river, or the free navigation of it. 
It may be hoped that sufficient of suitable land 
will be found in this district for cultivation. 
A few weeks’ trial will show whether a Model 
Farm can be commenced here with a reasonable 
hope of success. My hopes are still low. The 


118 BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPTABLE TO NATIVES. 

opinion of the cotton-planter is favourable. He 
considers it as good as the soil in America ; and 
if cotton will grow, the end of its establishment 
may be obtained ; and there is every probability 
that coffee will grow on the hills. At present 
there is no coffee in this country ; and it must be 
very scarce in the interior, as no name can be 
found for it in the Haussa Language. The inha- 
bitants of the adjacent towns and villages have 
expressed, their joy and gladness at the prospect 
of seeing a British Establishment near them, 
anticipating many beneficial results to them- 
selves : and one cannot help wishing and praying 
that God may bless the small beginning, and 
make it a blessing to the people. They have 
been much harassed and troubled for some time 
by the Fulatahs, and on such an establishment 
expect protection against them. 

Several difficulties present themselves to my 
mind, when looking at it as a Missionary Station ; 
which I shall mention, as they present them- 
selves. The Native population is small; and 
those who would visit the Settlement, or to whom 
Missionaries might find access in the immediate 
vicinity, speak several different languages. The 
Eggarra is chiefly spoken on the left bank of 


CONFUSION OF NATIVE LANGUAGES, 


119 


the river, up to the Tshadda : above the Conflu- 
ence, on the same side, the Nufi Language is 
spoken to a considerable distance, even beyond 
Rabba. The inhabitants of the hills and country 
behind Sterling Hill speak Bunu ; and on the 
right bank of the river, nearly to Egga, from and 
below the Confluence, the Kakanda Language is 
most generally spoken and understood. That 
this confusion or concourse of many languages 
presents a great obstacle, and is greatly calcu- 
lated to retard the Missionary work, nobody will 
doubt. To study all of them, and reduce them 
to writing, is almost impracticable. Besides, if 
all were reduced, it would perhaps be found that 
not one of them would be rich enough to admit 
of a translation of the Scriptures being made : 
the Natives could, therefore, only be instructed 
and addressed for a considerable time through 
Interpreters, Possibly, Natives of all these lan- 
guages might be induced to leave Sierra Leone, 
and become teachers of their own country-people, 
and in this manner great assistance would be 
rendered to Missionaries ; but as long as there 
is no translation of the Word of Life to read and 
explain to them, great results cannot, humanly 
speaking, be expected. Shall English be intro-

duced ? If that should be deemed proper, 
I would, at all events, suggest that the Native 
Languages should be reduced so far as to enable 
the teacher to explain and circumscribe the mean- 
ing of the English in their own languages. Or 
should one of the Native Languages be well cul- 
tivated, and become the general language of 
instruction ? This would, in my opinion, be 
easier and preferable to the introduction of En- 
glish ; and as the Haussa is now, to these parts 
of Africa, what the French is to Europe, I cannot 
see why that should not become the standard. 
It is partly reduced. Haussa People, or such as 
have obtained a knowledge of that language, are 
found in almost every village from Iddah ; and 
the more you advance, the more general it 
becomes. The Haussa, too, does not labour un- 
der the difficulties as do other languages. It is 
rich, and admits of additional number of words 
being formed legitimately ; and the influence 
which Mahomedanism has gained over the people 
in the interior has supplied it with many reli- 
gious terms and words which we sought for in 
vain among the vocabularies of Pagan nations. 

At present, I can only speak of these obstacles : 
time will show whether the place is healthy; 


ANTICIPATIONS. 


121 


whether protection will be afforded to Missio- 
naries; and whether access to the place can be 
readily obtained. All I can say of the people is 
in their favour. Many tribulations and distresses 
which they have suffered from their oppressors, 
and the temporal advantages of peace and security 
which they would derive in the event of a Settle 
ment being formed here, might be considered as 
the harbingers of the Gospel. This has ever been 
the method of God. Sometimes He prepared the 
way before His servants by wars, to bring low 
every thing that exalteth itself in His sight ; and 
at other times, by sending deliverance in a man- 
ner that could not have been anticipated, and 
thus making known His mercy and love to the 
children of men.

14 [continued^ — Arrangements are now 


making for the “ Wilberforce” to enter the 
Tshadda, and for the “Albert” and “Soudan” to 
proceed up the Niger. The novelty attending 
a journey to people and countries hitherto not 
visited by Europeans tempted me much to continue 


MR. SCHON REJOINS THE “ ALBERT.” 123 

in the “ Wilberforce but when I considered 
that the Niger would, in all probability, present 
better places for Missionary labours, I deemed it 
best to pursue the course which duty pointed 
out to me, and therefore proposed to Captain 
Trotter to rejoin the “ Albert.” The other Com- 
missioners, having perused my Instructions, gave 
it as their opinion that the Niger fell more within 
my sphere than the Tshadda. As Mr. Muller 
made no objection to an interchange of place and 
duties, and all other objections being removed, 
I to-day, took up my abode on board the “Albert,” 
and Mr. Muller went on board the “ Wilberforce.” 
Should any thing occur of interest to the Mis- 
sionary world in the Tshadda, it will not be lost, 
as Mr. Muller feels equally interested in the great 
Cause, and will no doubt give a correct account 
of what may take place. I feel anxious now to 
leave, and proceed more into the interior. 

SeptAb — We were all permitted once more to 
open our eyes in the land of the living. I feel 
generally no small degree of anxiety till the first 
question, “How are the sick this morning?” is 
answered. I saw the whole of them ; and admi- 
nistered consolation, as far as I was able. It 
grieved me much to learn that it had been said 
G 2 


124 


HEADMAN OF GANDEH. 


by several persons, that to be seriously spoken to 
was not calculated to encourage sick people to 
hope for recovery. Yet the Minister’s duty is 
plain ; and wofully deceived must that mind be, 
to whom a word of comfort and consolation, 
spoken, as it were, on the brink of the grave, 
proves a source of annoyance ! Spirit from on 
high, be Thou our Teacher ! 

Another Headman from the side of the Tshadda 
came on hoard this morning. He is Chief of a 
town called Gandeh ; his name is Sumobu. He 
confirmed the statement of others respecting the 
Tshadda being an inconsiderable river in the 
dry season, and so much reduced that a person 
can wade through it. The town of Gandeh has 
been but lately built, and cannot be in a pro- 
sperous state. The Chief was anxious to learn 
whether the English would permit them to return, 
under their protection, to the country which had 
just been purchased. It is a testimony in favour 
of the situation chosen for a farm, that all the 
Natives prefer it, on account of its fertility, to 
the other side, which they say is not good. 

Though the people here, and especially those 
of the higher classes, bear some external marks 
which show that the religion of the False Prophet 


ILLNESS OF MR. NIGHTINGALE.

has gained some influence over them, yet they 
are generally found to know very little of that 
system, and have no historical knowledge what- 
ever of its founder : their opposition to Chris- 
tianity will, therefore, never be great. They are 
anxious to learn something better, and it does 
not matter much to them from whom they learn 
it. The Fulatahs have lately told them that they 
will soon be troubled on every side ; that the White 
People will come upon them from the sea, and 
themselves from the interior. They are, however, 
now fully convinced that they have nothing to 
fear from us. It must be evident to them that we 
are their friends ; and their expressions toward 
us fully show that they appreciate the friendship 
of England. 

Another ministerial experience. Since I wrote 
the above, Mr. Nightingale, Assistant Surgeon of 
the “ Albert,” sent for me. He was very ill, and 
could say but little expressive of his hope of a 
future life. I engaged with him in pnayer to 
Almighty God. Sickness is increasing; but I trust 
that it has a salutary influence upon us. The 
means of Grace are more improved, our Morning 
and Evening Prayers being attended by all. 

The articles belonging to the Model Farm

were partly landed to-day; and the tents put up, 
which give the hill a very fine appearance. 

Sept. 16 — Mr. Nightingale in a dying state; 
Mr. W getting worse every hour ; and se- 

veral seamen appear near the grave. New cases 
of fever occurred in the course of the day, both on 
board the “ Wilberforce” and the “ Soudan.” There 
are now forty-seven Europeans, two West Indians, 
and one East Indian, laid up with fever. A de- 
scription of the fevers does not belong to my 
province: it will undoubtedly be given by our 
excellent Medical Officers in due time, if they 
should be spared. They are unremitting in their 
exertions ; exposing themselves so much, that 
serious apprehensions are entertained for their 
safety. But, as I cannot be an unconcerned spec- 
tator, and as I am continually looking at each 
event in its bearing upon Missionary under- 
takings, and in writing have nothing more in 
view than the information of a Missionary Com- 
mittee, I shall be excused a few remarks of my 
own on the fevers existing here. The general 
character of the fever appears to me to be what 
in Sierra Leone is always considered a very bad 
type. Perhaps Dr. Fergusson would call it the 
“River Fever.” The heat of the skin is not very 


REMARKS ON THE CASES OF FEVER. 


127 


great, the fever being low and almost without 
any intermission, attended with entire prostra- 
don of strength, in general without much pain. 
Calomel does not produce salivation, at least 
I have not seen a single case of it. Persons reco- 
vering from it continue extremely weak, and as 
helpless as infants, for a long time ; and are very 
liable to relapses, by the least exposure. 

The Commissioners have hitherto been favoured 
with good health ; and our prayer to God is, that 
they may be preserved, and enabled to go on in 
their important work. At present, our prosjjects 
are dismal and gloomy ; but the Lord is our light, 
and He will direct our paths. I cannot be thank- 
ful enough to the Author and Giver of every 
good gift for the measure of health I enjoy. 

I feel, at times, that I am in Africa, and not 
altogether free from the effects of an enervating 
climate; but I have never been obliged to lay 
by, or to have recourse to strong remedies. 

I merely take simple aperients, and now and 
then quinine. Were I to follow the natural de- 
sire of my heart, I should be about, among the 
people, all day, while lying at anchor at this 
place ; but as I daily witness the bad effects of 
exposure, I deem caution to be not misapplied. 


128 


DEATH OF MR. NIGHTINGALE. 


We may hope that, through God’s tender mercy, 
better days will come ; and that, after a night of 
darkness, the sun will rise again upon us. 

Sept. 17 — Early this morning, as was fully 
expected yesterday, Mr. Nightingale finished his 
earthly career, and entered, I humbly trust, the 
mansions in our Father’s house above. He was an 
amiable young man ; and, from several conversa- 
tions which I had with him, I am led to believe 
that his hope for acceptance with God was in 
Jesus Christ. How uncertain is every thing in 
this world ! It is but a short time since I was 
congratulating him on his healthy appearance. 
Africa seemed to agree with him very well ; 
but how soon was it otherwise ! Fifty-five this 
morning were on the sick list, and no decided 
marks of improvement, in any case. Another 
seaman expired at noon : I buried him and 
Mr. Nightingale this evening. Their graves are 
close to the palm-trees, near Stirling Hill, so 
beautifully^represented in Captain Wm. Allen’s 
“ Views of the Niger.” Two were buried there 
a few days ago; and two at a place lower down, 
called Adda Kuddu ; so that the remains of six 
now rest in the ground which has been purchased 
for England from the Attah of Iddah. 


RETURN OF THE “ SOUDAN ” TO THE SEA. 129 

A solemn feeling pervades our morning and 
evening devotions, which are regularly kept up, 
and provp a blessing, I trust, to all of us. This 
evening, before Prayers, we sang the beautiful 
hymn. 

Why do we mourn departing friends. 

Or shake at death’s alarms ? 

’Tis but the voice that Jesus sends, 

To call them to his arms. 

The singing was led by an old weather-beaten 
sailor, and all present joined in it with feelings 
of no common nature. Never was music more 
charming to my heart ! 

No change for the better in any of the sick this 
evening; and I am much afraid that the com- 
plaints of several more will terminate in fever. 
To whom shall we seek for refuge, O Lord, but 
unto Thee, who for our sins art justly displeased ! 

I learned this evening that Captain Trotter had 
resolved to send one of the vessels, with all the 
invalids, to the sea ; while the others are to pursue 
their course as soon and as far as they shall be 
able. The “ Albert” is fixed upon to return ; so 
I shall take up my abode on board the “ Soudan.” 

I am truly glad of this opportunity afforded to 
the poor sufferers, by which many are likely to 


130 RETURN OF THE “ SOUDAN ” TO THE SEA. 

be benefitted. May the Lord of all mercy cause 
the light of His countenance to shine upon them, 
that they may be healed ! 

Sept, 18 — Another arrangement this morning. 
The “ Soudan” will return, instead of the “ Albert 
the former was at first considered not large 
enough to contain all the sick comfortably. It 
was a day of much excitement on board all the 

vessels. I was called upon to see Mr. W , 

in the “ Soudan,” who was very ill both in body 
and mind. What shall I do to inherit eternal life ? 
was the chief concern of his heart. I trust that 
he received some consolation from the sweet and 
precious promises of Scripture ; attesting, as they 
so frequently do, that God has no pleasure in the 
death of a sinner, and that none who come to 
Christ, truly penitent, shall be cast out. 

New cases of fever. Our minds and our time 
are almost wholly occupied with the sick; and yet 
how little is it that we can do for them ! I feel 
more of my own insufficiency every day. Our 
situation becomes more perplexing every hour : 
it is difficult to know what to do. 

Sept. 19 — The “ Soudan” left this afternoon for 
the sea. We hope and pray that this change 
may prove beneficial to them. Divine Service 


INDISPOSITION OF CAPTAINS ALLEN AND COOK. 131 

was held, twice, on board the “Albert.” The con- 
gregations were small, but attentive and devout. 
Several cases of indisposition have terminated in 
fever, of a type equally as bad as the rest. 

The increase of the number of invalids deter- 
mined the Commissioners to send the “ Wilber- 
force” also down to the coast; and the “Albert,” 
though thinly manned, will proceed up the Niger. 
I cannot express, in words, my feelings of dis- 
appointment at these events ; for if my anticipa- 
tions prove correct, we shall all soon be on our 
way back to the coast, without accomplishing the 
object of our Mission. The river is said to be 
falling : if so, it must be inconsiderable ; for it 
appears to me that a little rain always brings it 
to its former height. It is almost certain, that 
if the Expedition should be obliged now to with- 
draw, it could not re-ascend the river for at least 
eight or ten months : and whether it would then 
take place under more favourable circumstances, 
appears to me very doubtful. 

Sept. 20 — I am sorry to record, that two of the 
Commissioners, Captain Wm. Allen and Captain 
Cook, are ailing. Two engineers on board the 
“ Wilber force,” and one on board the “Albert,” 
have been seized with fever. It was thought 


132 


GLOOMY PROSPECTS. 


this morning, that both the “ Albert” and “ Wil- 
berforce” must return immediately to the sea. 
This plan, however, was not found necessary ; 
and it was determined that the “ Albert” should 
remain up the river some time longer, and pro- 
ceed, if possible, as far as Rabba. The patients 
are more likely to improve by moving, than by 
lying at anchor at a place against which tlieir 
minds are so much, and perhaps justly, prejudiced. 
I am, at all events, glad that I can continue on 
board the vessel which will remain the longest 
time up the river, to do what I can under all the 
disadvantages of our situation : and while my heart 
is broken at the gloomy prospects before us, I feel 
some consolation in knowing that I have done what 
I could. Against nature, climate, and illness, it 
is in vain to strive. I am seeking, in public and 
in private prayer, God’s direction ; and trust He 
will guide us in the right way, and give us grace 
to submit to His sovereign will and pleasure. 
It is difficult to own that to be right which is 
apparently opposed to all our plans and hopes ; 
and submission in all things is no easy task. 

The “ Wilberforce” could not get ready for her 
departure to-day, but will leave early to-morrow 
morning. She has more the appearance of a 


AFFLICTIVE APPEARANCE OF THE “ WILBERFORCE.” 133 

hospital than that of a man-of-war. The quarter- 
deck, as well as the fore-castle and the cabins 
of the gun-room, are full of patients. The sight 
of them is enough to move a heart of stone. 
The active botanist, the ever-stirring mineralo- 
gist, the robust engineer, officers of every rank, 
and sailors who have long faced every danger, 
are brought low by the overpowering influence 
of an unhealthy climate; and the few persons 
who are able to be on their legs are barely 
sufficient to render the sick that assistance which 
they so much need. And to-day we had three 
new cases of fever. I would venture to hope, 
that though the fever is severe, it is not so fatal 
in its results as might be supposed. No deaths 
since the 17th instant : what may have occurred 
on board the “ Soudan” I am unable to say. We 
had much rain to-day. I felt feverish, but soon 
got better. 

I heard to-day, with much pleasure, that the 
“Albert” will leave to-morrow, and proceed up the 
Niger. In my humble judgment, this is preferable 
to remaining where we are. The disadvantages 
arising from the consumption of fuel may be 
obviated by proper arrangements with the Na- 
tives to prepare fire-wood for us in time. 


134 


SIMON JONAS LEAVES FOR ABOH. 


I should have mentioned yesterday that Simon 
Jonas, the Ibo Interpreter, was sent down with 
the “ Soudan” to Obi of Aboh, who wished so 
much to have him for some time. My prayer is, 
that he may be preserved from falling into any 
sin, and thus preach by liis life and conversa- 
tion. Thomas King, our Native Schoolmaster, 
will be left at the Model Farm, to which he was 
appointed at Sierra Leone. He will not be the 
only Religious Teacher ; as there is a gentleman, 
Mr. Kingdon, who came out in the “ Soudan ” 
with a view to make himself useful to the Natives, 
wherever he should find an opening. He is in 
connexion with the Baptists, but not sent by 
them as a Missionary. Thomas King will have 
an opportunity for a trial until we may return, 
when his information will point out to me what 
is best to be done in his case. He may also 
collect some information, in the mean time, 
which may be useful. I directed him to apply 
himself as much as he could to the study of the 
Kakanda Language, and gave him some direc- 
tions how to proceed in it; and it being, as 
Samuel Crowther tells us, a dialect of the Yaruba, 
which is Thomas King’s native language, he will 
not find it very difficult. If the Baptist Missiona- 


RETURN OF THE “ WILBERFORCE^’ TO THE SEA. 135 

ries, who are at present at Fernando Po, should 
ascend the Niger by the “Soudan’s” return, 
they might occupy this place as a Missionary 
Station at once. They would have the advan- 
tage of meeting with a person of their own 
persuasion, already employed as a Religious 
Teacher; and the question of its eligibility for 
a Missionary Station by our Society would 
soon be decided, by its admirable rule of non- 
interference with any Protestant Missionary 
Society. I have ever been doubtful of its eligi- 
bility ; and perhaps the description of the occur- 
rences of the last few days, and the repeated 
new cases of illness taking place here, will form 
another objection to those already mentioned. If 
the Baptists should occupy this Station, I cannot 
but wish them, from my heart, prosperity. Our 
Society might perhaps find a better place, further 
removed from the river, in the hilly parts of the 
country, should no opening present itself more 
in the interior, with fairer jjrospects. 

Sept.2 \ — Early this morning, as was antici- 
pated yesterday, the “ Wilberforce” left for the sea. 
She will proceed to Ascension as early as conve- 
nient ; while we in the “Albert” are about to 
proceed up the Niger, in humble dependence on 


136

the help of Almighty God. We were ready for 
our departure early. The rattling of the paddle- 
wheels was fine music to our ears. The morning 
was very fine ; our invalids seemed to enjoy it 
very much, and every thing was calculated to 
inspire us with new hopes. Our vessel is thinly 
manned. No more than six persons, Europeans, 
are able to do duty ; and before night had closed 
upon us, even some of these complained of illness : 
Captain Bird Allen * is one of the number. Thus 
our hopes of advancing and accomplishing our ob- 
jects are again involved in clouds of uncertainty. 
Possibly we shall soon be obliged to return on 
account of illness, attributable to the climate. The 
river is high enough; and the many villages under 
water prove that it must be higher than could have 
been anticipated. If this Expedition fail, which 
came out furnished with all that human inge- 
nuity could devise for the preservation of health, 
and conducted in every respect with judgment, 
care, and caution, what other Expedition will 
succeed ? Gloomy forebodings fill my mind : 
yet the Lord is able to bring light out of dark-

ness. He is not bound, if this plan fail : He can 
point out another for the regeneration of Africa, 
and give His blessing to rest on it. 

The banks of the river, as far as we have seen 
them to-day, must have been better peopled than 
below the Cpnfluence, as there are a great many 
villages ; though forsaken, partly because of the 
overflow of the river, and partly for fear of the 
Fulatahs, 

Kelebeh, on the right bank, at which we ar- 
rived at 3 o’clock P.M., is one of the most consi- 
derable villages. Two of the villagers came on 
board, offering to pilot the vessel to Bunu and 
show us a place where we might procure fire- 
wood, They spoke of several villages, whose 
inhabitants were desirous of settling near our 
own Establishment, expecting protection against 
the Fulatahs. It may be that the population of 
Stirling Hill, or the Farm, will soon become more 
numerous ; and there be one objection less against 
its suitableness as a Missionary Station. 

We anchored about 7 o’clock p.m. near a town 
called Lilemu, also on the right bank. The town 
opposite, on the left bank, is called Atshiba. A 
heavy tornado, accompanied with much rain, was 
very welcome this evening. The inhabitants of 


138 


NOTICES OF LILEMU. 


the right bank are subject to the Attah, as far as 
Buddu, formerly called Kakanda. The Chief of 
Buddu is appointed by the Attah, and has the 
right of appointing Headmen of the smaller 
towns. They profess Mahomedanism, carry but 
few charms about their persons, have no idols 
publicly exposed, and “ pray only to God.” They 
feel indignant that tliey should be considered 
Kafris, or Gentiles. Mahomedan teachers from 
Egga and other towns higher up carry on a Mis- 
sionary work among them, visiting them from 
time to time, circumcising the boys — sometimes 
this is done by barbers — when they are about 
three or four months old, and teaching them how 
to pray. The prayers of the Mallams are not 
understood by the Natives ; and all that they seem 
to learn, is, at certain stages of their worship 
to bow their heads to the ground and stretch 
out their arms. The Mallams receive payment 
for their services ; and whenever the rite of cir- 
cumcision is performed, they make great feasts, 
killing sheep, goats, and fowls. Their accounts 
of the ravages committed by the Fulatahs all 
agree ; and, according to their statement, the 
Fulatah army is at present encamped only about 
a few days’ journey from Kelebeh, having a great

number of horses, guns, cutlases, bows, and 
arrows. They are said to have killed many 
people ; and carried away many more, as slaves, 
to Rabba; from whence they are most probably 
sold to Katanga, finding their way through Yaruba 
to the sea-coast, as nearly all the Nufi and Ka- 
kanda people who were liberated at Sierra Leone 
were carried that way. The people are well 
aware of the superior strength of the Fulatahs, 
and therefore never offer any resistance. The 
Fulatahs have been described as great cowards ; 
but the description I have heard hitherto given 
of them by the Natives would show the contrary. 
“ They eat no bread, they drink no water, while 
they are fighting,” is the common expression 
about them; meaning, that they do not allow 
themselves to be interrupted by any thing. 

Sept. 22 — We remained at anchor, to procure 
fire-wood from the Natives ; and were fortunate 
enough to obtain two canoe-loads. The river pre- 
sented a very lively appearance, by many canoes 
going up to attend Gori market, held on an 
island. It is inferior to Keri market, but better 
than that at Buddu. It is kept every thirteenth 
day, and lasts about two days. We were told 
that we could easily procure fire-wood there. It

is much to be regretted that we have no means 
of making our want of this article known to the 
Natives beforehand ; as they would willingly get 
it ready, and supply it at a reasonable price, 
and thus spare our people much labour and 
exposure, and save the Expedition the loss of 
much valuable time. The place we are now 
lying at anchor at is marked Lelem, on Captain 
W. Allen’s map*; but the Natives generally call 
it Lilemu. Opposite Lilemu, on the left bank 
of the river, is a nice little town, called Agiba. 
Barker’s Mountain is called Dolli, and Elden Hills 
are termed Jegila. 

The chief of Muye, named Aggiddi, came on 
board this morning. The Muye here mentioned 
is probably the Omeh of Captain Allen. It con- 
tains, according to the Chief’s account, 2000 inha- 
bitants, which may be nearly correct. The Chiefs 
of these towns are appointed by the Governor 
of Buddu, or Kakanda ; and the Attah appoints 
the Governor for life. At the death of the 
Governor, his successor is chosen by the people, 
without any regard to the family of the late 
Governor, but subject to the approbation of the 

* Chart of tlie “ Quorra,” published by the Admiralty, and 
sold by Bates, Poultry, London.

Attah. The river is not expected to rise higher 
this season, and it is said that in three months 
hence it will be quite low. The Natives suffer 
much in the dry season from fever, the small- 
pox, and dysentery ; for which they prepare a 
medicine of roots and leaves, called Saboji. 

The canoes which passed this morning for 
Gori market had but few articles of trade ; such 
as, tobacco — grown in the country and inge- 
niously rolled together, — a little camwood, and 
ivory. They use the camwood chiefly to decorate 
their skin. It is mixed with clay, then beaten 
into a fine powder, and made up into balls of the 
size of a large egg, and dried in the sun. The 
hand is made wet, and a little of the ball rubbed 
oflf and smeared on the whole body, which gives 
the skin, if too much is not put on, a soft ap- 
pearance. It is chiefly used by females. Fresh 
provisions are very scarce. We could scarcely 
procure fowls, ducks, and goats enough for our 
invalids. It is well that we are not dependent on 
the Natives for such things for our own main- 
tenance. No fruit of any kind could be obtained, 
and yams were by no means plentiful. I was 
rather disappointed, having heard and read so 
much of the excellent Shea butter, so much

superior to English butter, without ever seeing 
any that I could make up my mind to taste. 
A little was now and then brought on board 
by the Natives ; but always in dirty-looking cala- 
bashes, and continually pressed smooth by their 
hands. 

About 4 o’clock p. m. we cast anchor near Gori 
(not marked on Captain Wm. Allen’s map), on the 
right bank ; and immediately got into our boats, 
to see the much-famed market. There are no 
more than eighty or ninety houses, which are 
built close together, leaving only a narrow foot- 
path between them ; which continually winding, 
you are, after a few minutes’ walk, unaware of 
your position, and can only ascertain it by the 
use of the compass. The water comes up close 
to the houses; some are even standing in it. 
The concourse of people was immense, as well as 
the number of canoes. I was much disappointed 
with the market. I had expected to find some 
English articles of commerce, indicative of some 
little civilization; but there was nothing of the 
kind. The articles exposed for sale were — salt, 
packed in grass bags, said to have come down 
from Rabba ; straw-hats, some as wide as a com- 
mon umbrella ; a little camwood, brought, it may

be, to this place from the Ibo country; several 
large grass bags of cotton, in its raw state, with 
its seeds, a great deal of which is consumed in 
their own manufacture of cloth. Though I was 
not able to ascertain the price of cotton, I have 
no hesitation in saying that it could not be 
purchased here cheaper than in England : it is 
true that they might grow ten thousand times 
the quantity they are now growing; but until 
that is done, it would not be a profitable market 
for England. There were also some nicely-made 
tobes, carved calabashes, country pots, yams, 
Indian-corn, and Guinea-corn in abundance. 

The number of people which surrounded us 
from the towns around could not have been less 
than 1400 or 1500 . It was maintained by some, 
that people from Rabba came to visit this market, 
but contradicted again by others. The town and 
people are independent of any other King or Chief, 
except their own. The Chief, who is an old man, 
never said a single word all the time we were 
with him ; but his deficiency was fully made up 
by his “ Mouth,” as his speaker is emphatically 
called. There are four other towns connected 
with this independent State, the names of which 
are as follows : Akoku, Atshira, Egbu and Arra. 


144 ARTICLES OF TRADE IN THE MARKET AT GORI. 

Besides the articles, above mentioned, exposed 
for sale, there were also several calabashes of 
Shea butter, and one of cow butter; and an egg 
was oflfered to me in exchange for a silk handker- 
chief of the value of four shillings : the temptation 
of turning trader was therefore easily overcome. 
Tiiey also candidly admitted that they had slaves 
for sale, but we could not persuade them to 
show them to us. In fact, the King’s “Mouth” got 
up, to lead us, as we expected, to the place where 
they were exposed ; but instead of which, he* 
showed us other places, or detachments of the 
market, always leaving us under the impression 
that we should see them soon ; till at last he said 
that there were none ; and that if there had been 
any at the place through the day, they would 
now be in the canoes. I should not be surprised 
that they had heard before what opinion we en- 
tertained concerning the slave-trade, and were 
either ashamed of it, or afraid of us. 

Sept. 23 — I am obliged to contradict some of 
the statements of yesterday ; which I regret, as 
they are already confused enough. But it is now 
the time of collecting ; and all I can do, is, to put 
down the occurrences at the close of each day. 
Many an hour I can do nothing. I cannot sit

down in niy cabin, the heat being too great : at 
other times I have an opportunity of conversing 
with the Natives who come on board, through tlie 
medium of Interpreters ; and sometimes I liave 
a chance of hearing some people speak Haussa, 
and engage myself in the conversation, and col- 
lect a few words and phrases in that language : 
and then at night, when all is quiet around me, 
I sit down in my cabin, and commit to paper 
what I have collected through the day. 

The statement that Gori forms an independent 
State is not correct, though it has been made by 
the high authority of the King’s “ Mouth.” The 
Chief acknowledged, this morning, that he was 
subject to the Attah of Iddah. Adaku, the son 
of the Attah, arrived this morning on board the 
“ Albert and the Chief of Gori acknowledged, 
in his presence, his dependence on the Attah. 
Gori, though in the Attah’s dominions, pays a 
tribute to the King of the Fulatahs, annually, of 
360,000 cow'ries ; and the Attah receives no more 
than one horse yearly from Gori and the other 
four towns above mentioned. The Attah may 
levy troops at Gori ; and in seasons of distress, 
Gori calls upon the Attah for protection. This 
fully proves their dependence on the Attah, and 
n

also shows the wide extent of his influence. It 
may further be mentioned, in confirmation of 
their subjection to the Attah, that Adaku pro- 
claimed to the Headman, the Judge, the King’s 
Mouth, and the Chief Messenger, with a few more 
of the principal people of Gori, the law which 
his father made relative to the slave trade ; and 
they all promised to obey it*. I mention these 
particulars to show the extent of the dominions 
of the Attah, and the importance of the treaty 
entered into with him. 

The Chief Mallam stated, that the market-fees 
paid to the Chief of Gori were fifty cowries for 
each man coming in a canoe : and another state- 
ment was, that, on salt only, a market-fee was paid 
of fifty cowries on each bag, containing about 
40 lb. weight: the value of a bag I could not 
ascertain. Slaves are brought to Gori market 
from all the surrounding towns : there were five 
sold yesterday as we were told. 

About 1 1 o’clock A. M. a large canoe, coming down 
the river, came alongside of us. The Headman 
and some of the people came on board, without 

* Adaku left Iddah two days before us with orders from the 
Attah to promulgate the law of Abolition, and ought to have 
done so at Gori at least a week before our arrival.

the slightest apprehension of the danger into 
which they were running. The canoe contained 
three horses — miserable creatures — many cala- 
bashes, Indian-corn, and three slaves — two wo- 
men and one man. The Headman was requested 
to let us see the slaves ; who instantly, and without 
any suspicion, ordered them on board. The canoe 
belonged to the Headman of Muye, named Aggiddi ; 
the captain was his own son, called Ajimba. The 
Headman first stated, that he paid for the strongest 
and healthiest woman 40,000 cowries, and for the 
rest 20,000 each ; he afterward said that he paid 
for the whole, six muskets, one keg of powder, and 
three fathoms of red cloth. The value of the 
cowries, or of the other articles, may be estimated 
at bl. or 6/. sterling. The slaves were purchased 
but yesterday, at Egga, from one Shem, who had 
many more to dispose of. They were, however, 
liberated by Captain Trotter, for the following rea- 
sons : — The Chief of Muye is subject to the Attah, 
who entered into a treaty seventeen days ago to 
abolish the slave-trade throughout his dominions, 
and promised that he would publish the law im- 
mediately after the treaty was signed ; and tliere 
was therefore time enough for its publication. 
The Attah’s son was himself present at the inves- 
u 2

tigation. The captain of the canoe, Ajiinba, had 
nothing to say in his own defence ; but pleaded 
ignorance of the law, saying, that he had been at 
Egga three weeks ; and that if his father or himself 
had known any thing of the Attah’s prohibition of 
the slave-trade, neither of them would have en- 
gaged in it. He was, on that account, treated 
with much lenity. According to the terms of the 
ti’eaty, he had forfeited the canoe and all that 
was in it ; but all these things were left to him, 
and he lost only the slaves. 

Captain Trotter gave the slaves names : the man 
he called Albert Gori ; one of the women, Hannah 
Buxton ; and the other, Elizabeth Fry. When the 
women first came on board, tears rolled down their 
cheeks ; and they sat down, never venturing to lift 
up their eyes. One of them had been in slavery for 
three years : her own husband, being jealous of her, 
sold her : she has been sold nine times, and trans- 
ported from place to place. No doubt she thought 
that she had now fallen into worse hands than 
ever before, when she saw herself on a British 
man-of-war, and surrounded by beings she had 
never before seen. They were not, however, left 
long under such harassing thoughts, but were 
made acquainted with their condition, through

an Interpreter; were cleanly dressed and well 
fed ; and their countenances soon began to cheer 
up. 

Sept. 24 — Early this morning we were again 
on our way. The weather was fine, but unusually 
hot — 88° in my cabin. The country was much 
of the same character as the Delta. The river 
spread over a large tract of land — whole villages 
overflown and desolate, and the river was difficult 
to navigate : the vessel touched the ground several 
times. About 11 o’clock a.m. we arrived at a 
village on the left bank, called Bezzani ; and as 
we were in want of fire-wood, we anchored close 
to it : some of us landed. Bezzani is as miserable 
a place as any I ever saw, containing about 200 
inhabitants, who speak the Nufi Language : they 
are extremely poor. Grown-up young men and 
young women were walking about in a state of 
nudity. The village is not above thirty yards 
wide, and at this season of the year it forms a 
complete little island. It is tributary to the Fii- 
latahs. Here, as at other places, the Natives 
instantly began to talk of the h’ulatahs, and to tell 
us that they were continually kept in a state of 
excitement on their account; but for what reason 
they told us I cannot say. They must either 


150 


APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTRY. 


suppose that we can give them protection against 
their fierce enemies, or that it is their intention to 
warn us against them. 

On our returning to the “ Albert,” one of the 
Kroomen fell overboard, and the stream took him 
down with great rapidity. Many of the Natives 
were close to him in their canoes, but none moved 
a finger to save his life ; our own boat brought 
him back, safe and sound. This is a bad feature in 
their character. They might always be sure of a 
reward for any service of this kind ; but unless a 
bargain can be made with them beforehand, they 
wdll do nothing. How depraved, how hard-hearted 
is man by nature ! How little does life appear to 
be valued ! 

We had not left Bezzani for more than an hour, 
when we run aground ; but after a short time, 
we proceeded on our way, through a country 
which assumed a more pleasant appearance. The 
land on the left bank of the river is high for several 
miles distant, and apparently fertile; while the 
bank on the right forms a complete swamp several 
miles wide, and at least twelve miles in length. 
The villages become more numerous; and it af- 
fords us no small pleasure to see some of them 
built on elevated spots, which must be much more

healthy than those in the marshes, and may be 
inhabited through all seasons of the year. 

We cast anchor, at half past six o’clock p. m., 
within a few miles of Egga. — I hope that some 
of our patients are convalescent. New cases of 
fever to-day. Captain B. Allen is apparently im- 
proving. I feel anew, every day, my obligation 
to be very grateful to Almighty God for the health 
I have enjoyed ever since I joined the Expedition. 
I am unworthy of this great mercy. It sometimes 
seems to be intended to point out to me, and, 
no doubt, to other persons also, that the only way 
to the interior, and the best preparation for it, is 
to become first seasoned along the coast, or in an 
European Settlement in Western Africa. I am 
afraid that I shall have no opportunity of seeing 
the country at some distance from the river, and 
thus be disqualified to give a correct and just 
opinion on its eligibility for Missionary Stations. 
I have not hitherto been able to speak, with any 
thing like satisfaction or confidence, of any suit- 
able place. Along the river it will always be 
unhealthy, while the country may be much better 
ten or fifteen miles from it. I sincerely pray that 
we may be able to proceed as far as Rabba, from 
whence I hope to make excursions in all directions.

NOTICES RESPECTING KINAMI. 


Sej)t. 25 — Our sick people were no worse tins 
morning. The fever appears to me to be of a 
milder type than when it first broke out. God is 
dealing with us in much mercy : He knows our 
weakness and our small force. He lays by one, 
and raises up another, to enable us to carry on our 
work. We can approach His throne of grace with 
confidence, being employed in His service, and 
anxious to do His will. Were we to apply carnal 
reasoning, or to allow ourselves to be actuated by 
worldly motives or those of worldly comfort, we 
should all be withdrawing our hands from this 
most important work. But, blessed be God ! He 
renews our strength, and causes us to run, and 
not be weary, to walk, and not faint. 

We remained at our anchorage this morning 
for the purpose of obtaining fire-wood, near a 
large village called Kinami, situated on the right 
bank. A few of the people came on board, with 
fowls, sheep, goats, eggs, ground-nuts, beans, and 
country cloths. I endeavoured to get some 
information from them ; which was no easy task, 
as the Interpreter was very much inferior to the 
rest, frequently misunderstanding my English, 
though I spoke as much in Negro-English as I 
possibly could. I will state a few particulars. 


OPPRESSION OF THE FULATAHS. 


153 


Kinami is subject to the king of the Fulatahs, 
in right of conquest. He levies an annual tax on 
the inhabitants of 20,000 cowries, the payment 
of which is rigidly exacted from them by the 
king’s messengers. At the time it is collected, 
the poor people, in order to raise the sum 
demanded of them, are frequently obliged to sell 
the very clothes from their backs, as well as 
the few tools which they so much need for the 
cultivation of the soil. The deficiency is gene- 
rally made up by the Fulatahs carrying away 
some of them as slaves. Though thus in sub- 
mission to the Fulatahs, they derive no advan- 
tage from them; but, on the contrary, are kej)t 
in constant fear of them ; and do not venture to 
leave their own town, nor build better houses, 
nor cultivate more land than what will afford 
them a scanty subsistence; apprehending that 
any improvements on their part would the more 
excite the rapacity of their haughty conquerors. 
I can never listen to the complaints of these 
oppressed countries and nations, without the 
greatest sympathy for them, and indignation at 
the proud and arrogant worshipjiers of the False 
Prophet. Truly Mahomcdanism can never re- 
commend itself much to the acceptance of the 


154 


DOMESTIC SLA\T:RY. 


hearts of pagans, as long as it extends its in- 
fluence in this manner ! What a contrast would 
Christian Missionaries create in such a troubled 
nation ! and, to every reflecting mind, how dis- 
gusting would Mahomedanism soon appear ! — the 
one bringing peace and good-will to all men — 
dispensing blessings both temporal and spiritual 
— softening the heart of men — and in nothing 
seeking external advantages : the other com- 
mencing its work of conversion by the spear 
and arrow — terrifying the poor and helpless — and 
seeking nothing but its own aggrandisement. 

There are no slaves exposed for sale at Kinami ; 
and if they want any for their own work, they go 
to Egga, to purchase them at the market, which 
is held every fifth day. A boy was lately taken 
from this place, as a slave, by some Fulatahs, and 
carried away to Egga. The friends of the poor 
boy collected as many cowries as they could, 
and carried them to Egga to redeem him from 
slavery; but the sum was not sufficient: and 
when they offered to return and procure more, 
they were told that it was of no use, he should 
not be ransomed ; and that if they were to return 
again to Egga on his behalf, they would be made 
slaves also. The mother of the boy cried bitterly. 


NUFI OPINIONS UESPECTING THE SOUE. 


155 


when she was informed of the sad result of her 
friends’ endeavours. 

Domestic slaves are kept in every village and 
town, and their condition differs little from that 
of their own proprietors. No other punishment 
can be inflicted by the master, for any offence, 
than that of flogging. In case the slave tries 
to make his escape, or if he commit theft or 
other offences more than once, he may be sold. 
Mutilation is not allowed here, as in the Ashanti 
and other countries. Murder is punished with 
death, both in a slave and a freeman ; and if 
a slave commits murder, his master is fined a 
heavy sum of money, besides the loss of his 
slave. Sometimes, when a master happens to 
kill one of liis slaves, he may, contrary to ge- 
neral rule, escape death by paying a great sum of 
cowries. 

I made it my endeavour to find out what 
notions the Nufi People entertain respecting the 
immortality of the soul and a future state of 
existence. It is not easy to find out such things, 
unless you are acquainted with the language of 
those with whom you are conversing; which, in 
this instance, was not the case with me. To the 
question, “ What would become of them after 


156 


OPINIONS OF THE NIIFI PEOPLE. 


death ?” they replied, “ The good man would 
take road again ; but that the bad man could not 
take road again.” To what place the good man 
would take I’oad again, or what would become of 
the bad man, they could not tell me. That a 
good man was better off than a bad man after death, 
and that therefore this life had an intimate con- 
nexion with the life to come, they all agreed ; 
but their opinion, as to whether there was a re- 
ward for the good, and a punishment reserved for 
the bad, I could not learn. At last, I wished 
them to tell me what they thought of such a 
case as the following : — Should a person commit 
murder, which all admit to be a great crime and 
deserving severe punishment, and neither the 
crime nor the person be discovered in this world, 
and he should therefore escape punishment, would 
he never be punished for it after death ? They 
answered, that God, who knew all things, would 
make the murderer and the murdered person 
appear before Him ; and that the former would 
be punished for his sin by God himself. — They 
listened to me most attentively while I explained 
to them the leading doctrines of the Christian 
Religion on these topics ; and they were glad to 
hear that people would be sent to them who 


INCREASED CASES OF FEVER. 


157 


could teach them much more than I could tell 
them in a short conversation. 

Our men were on shore nearly all day, pro- 
curing wood: they returned with hearts moved 
with pity toward their own country-people, on 
account of the troubles which they have to endure 
from the Fulatahs. It was a favourable oppor- 
tunity for them — some are Nufi People — to tell 
them much of the good-will of the English Nation 
toward the Africans ; and it was improved by 
them for that purpose. The inhabitants of Ki- 
nami were rejoiced to learn that the English had 
formed a Settlement at the Confluence, expecting 
to derive protection from it against the Fulatahs, 
and expressed their desire to remove to the 
place and settle there. 

I feel grieved to add, that several new cases 
of fever occurred to-day. There are now eighteen 
on the sick list, and only four or five Europeans 
of the ship’s company able to perform duty. A 
heavy burden consequently falls on them ; under 
which, humanly speaking, they cannot long resist 
the influence of this debilitating climate. It is 
well for us that the Fulatahs are not aware of our 
condition, as we might become an easy prey to 
them: but we have an Almighty Protector and

Keeper, who ever cares for and watches over us. 
We are brought low, but are brought nearer to 
Him. He is sought of us in public and in pri- 
vate ; and His dispensations, though not joyous, 
hut grievous, have wrought in several of our 
suffering companions a change of sentiment, and 
repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord 
Jesus Christ. “ Man’s extremity is God’s oppor- 
tunity.” 

Sept. 26 : Lord's Day — We remained at anchor 
all day, it being the day of rest by God ap- 
pointed. The heat was great and oppressive. 
There was much thunder and lightning toward 
evening, at a distance from us ; by which we were 
much relieved. Our patients have not improved 
at all to-day. The stillness of death prevailed 
around us : hardly a canoe or a human being 
besides ourselves could be seen all day. The 
Natives need only be told that this day is set 
apart for rest and divine worship, and none will 
think of coming near us. Oh that they knew 
what it means to spend a Christian Sabbath as 
a type of the Rest which remaineth to the people 
of God! 

Sept. 27 — The population of Kinami is about 
1000. The district in which it is situated is 


PRODUCE OF THE COUNTRY. 


159 


called Bushi, commencing opposite Bachinku, and 
extending as far as Egga. The district contains 
between thirty and forty towns and villages, the 
inhabitants of whom are said to amount to about 
30 , 000 , all of the Nufi Nation. They are an 
industrious people. They make a considerable 
number of country-cloths, the weaving of which 
is excellent, considering the imperfect tools and 
instruments with which they work. The cotton 
is purchased from the left bank of the river, 
where it is said to grow in great abundance : the 
Bushi district does not produce much. They 
commence planting it after the first fall of rain, 
and five months afterward it is fit for use. The 
value of a bag, « containing about a pound and 
a half, with the seeds still in it, is 400 cowries, or 
sixpence English money*. They also collect a 
small quantity of bees’-wax. Much rice is planted 
every year in the Bushi district ; but this year's 
crop was destroyed by the unusual height of the 
river. Though there are plenty of elephants in 
the forest, according to the statement of the 
people, they have not much ivory for sale ; as 
they have no means of killing them, and to tame

where their price varies considerably.

them is never attempted. They sell yams, sheep, 
and goats, at Egga and other towns ; and obtain 
salt from Dohma. The Rabba People are said 
to obtain salt from Yauri, to which place it is 
brought from the interior of the Haussa Country. 
The price of a bag, containing, as near as I can 
guess, about a bushel, is 11,000 cowries. But 
I suspect the correctness of this information ; for, 
considering the distance from whieh it comes, 
and the many hands through which it passes, it 
cannot, as far as I can judge, be sold so eheap. 
The Null Country is said to commence at Jiria, 
a place not marked on Captain W. Allen’s Chart, 
nor was it possible for me to find out its correct 
situation ; and extends beyond Rabba, under two 
kings or chiefs ; one being called Ezu-Issa, and 
the other Mamaj ia. The former resides at Barra, 
about a day’s journey from Egga; and the 
latter at Sukuma, a day’s journey beyond Rabba*. 
Though both of them are called kings, they 


* I feel satisfied that the spelling here introduced of the 
names of the two Nufi kings is preferable to that adopted by 
Lander, Laird, and Oldfield. They call the King of Barra, 
Ederisa — a sweet-sounding name to a polite ear ; but this very 
circumstance renders it suspicious of being an African word or 
name. Issa is a proper name ; and Ezu means “ king,” in the 
Nufi Language : Ezu-Issa is, therefore. King Issa. Majia is

have nothing more left to them than the mere 
title; both being tributary to Sumo Sariki, the 
king of the Fulatahs, residing at Rabba. I may 
here again justify the spelling I have adopted of 
this name. It is usually written Sumozaki. 
Sumo seems to be his proper name ; Sariki sig- 
nifying “ king, ’ in the Haussa Language, which 
is much spoken by the Fulatahs: literally, “Sumo 
the King.” And when I asked the people whether 
Mamajia sold many slaves, they all burst out 
laughing, and said, “ How can he sell slaves, 
being a slave himself to the Fulatahs.^” 

Their religion consists of a mixture of pagan- 
ism and Mahomedanism. The latter seems to 
have banished idols from their towns and houses ; 
instead of which it has supplied them with a few 
prayers, the meaning of which is not known. 
Other pagan practices are still retained. They 
marry as many wives as they are able to pur- 
chase. The price of one is 20,000 cowries, or 
25.S. ; which sum is paid to the parents. The 
maiden’s consent is never asked for; and the 

seldom heard by the people with whom I have conversed, but 
always Mamajia, wliich is abridged for Mallam Majia ; Itlajia 
being a proper name, and Mallam his title or name of his 
office. 


162 


CUSTOMS OF THE NUFI PEOPLE. 


payment of the stipulated sum, together with 
eating and drinking, constitute the marriage : no 
other ceremonies are observed on these occasions. 
The husband is permitted to send his wife back 
to her parents, if he chooses to do so, but may 
never sell her as a slave. The Fulatahs marry 
Nufi women, but never give their women in 
marriage to Nufi men; not, as might be sup- 
posed, from scruples of conscience, but from a 
dislike to the poverty of the Nufi People. The 
Mahomedans appear to adhere to the precepts 
of the Koran, with regard to the number of wives 
they take ; and therefore are said to take only 
four wives. Undoubtedly, some privileged per- 
sons among them will now and then be favoured 
with special dispensations to add a few more, 
according to the example of the head of their 
system of lies. The Mallams are said to so- 
lemnize the marriages of the Fulatahs by offering 
up prayers. 

As they had told me so much of their customs, 
I informed them that Christians never took more 
than one wife, and that such was the order and 
institution of God. They were much surprised 
at this; and I was particularly struck with the 
inquiries of one man, who asked again and again 


POLYGAMY.

whether we were telling the truth, and whether 
God had appointed it to be so. I generally 
received other answers, whenever I made an 
observation of the kind to the Sherbro People. 
I could scarcely ever mention the subject without 
exposing myself to ridicule ; and if they would 
listen to any thing else, and believe it to be 
God’s will and ordinance, they would never admit 
that God could ever have intended to restrict 
them to one wife; it appeared to them the ab- 
surdest thing in the world. Though the subject 
is one of great importance, and admits of no 
compromise, I hardly ever think it worth while 
to speak to pagans on it. It is one of the many 
things which they can only arrive at by degrees : 
and where the Spirit and the Word of God have 
once begun to enlighten the heart, such things 
will and must be found out by themselves, as 
contrary to the will of God, and averse to real 
happiness in this life. Polygamy has existed in 
many countries before Christianity was intro- 
duced ; but as far as I recollect, it is never men- 
tioned in history to have proved so serious an 
obstacle to the introduction and spread of the 
Gospel as might be supposed.

Sept. 27 — We left Kinami this evening, and are 
now at anchor in sight of Egga. I am sorry to 
be under the necessity of recording the death of 
another of our seamen, John Fuge : he departed 
this life about 8 o’clock p. m. I saw him a few 
hours before, when he was able to listen to my 
prayer. Several on board are still dangerously ill. 
Captain Bird Allen, though a little better, is not 
yet, as far as I can j udge, out of danger. 

Seft. 28 — I buried John Fuge early this 
morning. An old man was present when the 
grave was dug by our Kroomen ; and when I 
arrived, accompanied by an Interpreter, he ex- 
pressed his surprise at the liberty taken by our

people in digging a grave, without previously 
obtaining the Headman’s permission, and paying 
for the place 7000 cowries. I made the Inter- 
preter tell him our object in coming to Black 
man’s country, and that the very person who 
was to be buried in their sand had left his 
parents, wife, and child, to come and do them 
good ; — and then wished him to tell me whether 
they were doing well in making much palaver 
about a spot where his body might rest. He was 
now joined by a great number of his country- 
people, who replied, as with one voice, “ No, no ; 
we don’t want to make any talk, and do not come 
for money and the Headman sent three persons 
on board to express his regret to the Captain and 
people at the loss they had sustained. They were 
all standing near us while I read the Funeral Ser- 
vice. Nothing appeared to be new to them ; and 
the surplice, being so much like the dress of the 
Mallams on solemn occasions, did not strike their 
attention much. They bury their dead without 
any ceremony whatever, while the Mahomedans 
offer up prayers. 

I am truly thankful to say that several of our 
invalids appear much better this morning. May 
God in mercy complete their recovery, and further

ARRIVAL AT EGGA. 


US in our undertaking ! We are still faint, yet 
pursuing, and hope shortly to cast anchor at Egga. 

Samuel Crowther was sent yesterday to Egga, to 
purchase mats ; and to acquaint the Chief of Egga, 
and, if possible, of Barra also, of our arrival, and 
the intentions of our visit. The testimony of the 
people here agrees with that so often heard and 
made, that the rainy season is the healthiest of the 
two ; and that there is generally much sickness, 
even among the Natives, at the time that the river 
begins to fall. Whether this is the case in towns 
situated more inland, and at a greater distance 
from the river, I could not sufficiently ascertain. 

For the last two or three days I felt now and 
then severe acute pains in the spleen, which is 
much enlarged. It disturbs my rest in the 
night very frequently, and leaves a feverish sen- 
sation for some time ; but a few grains of quinine 
I generally find sufficient to restore me again. 

We arrived at Egga at noon. Our only engi- 
neer was taken ill. Since the other two were laid 
up, he had had hard work : it can therefore be 
no matter of surprise that he should feel the 
effects of it. It afforded us some consolation to 
see that the others were getting better, though 
unfit for hard labour for several days longer. 


INTERVIEW with THE CHIEF. 


167 


Captain Trotter kindly provided an opportunity 
for me to go on shore at Egga, soon after our 
arrival. Dr. Stanger and myself carried a mes- 
sage to the Chief, called Rogang. He is a Nufi 
by birth, but under the controul of the king of 
the Fulatahs. We had to submit, as at other 
places, to the same tedious ceremonies — of wait- 
ing a long time, amidst a crowd of people gazing 
on us from all directions, and even preventing 
us, at times, getting a breath of air. We were 
glad, therefore, when we observed that arrange- 
ments were made which indicated that the Chief 
was approaching. These occupy but a little 
time; and consist in preparing a place for the 
King, or Chief, to sit or lie down, as may be 
most agreeable to him, during the interview. A 
large mat was spread upon a mud bank, raised 
above the level of the floor of the house about 
twelve or fifteen inches. Over the mat was a 
large leopard skin, on which were tw'o cushions 
of leather stuSed with cotton ; the one used to 
support his elbows, and the other to rest liis 
legs upon. On the floor of the room another 
large mat and a bolster were spread, which 
were occupied by Dr. Stanger and myself : the 
bolster supported our elbows, while our legs 


168 


INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF OF EGGA. 


rested on the mat stretched out toward the king. 
Such a position cannot be called very polite; 
but no objection can be made against it on ac- 
count of the inconvenience to which one is 
exposed. It is the most convenient way of trans- 
acting business in a tropical climate. An hour’s 
walk or exposure to the sun often makes me long 
for a mat to lie down on, and for the cool shade 
afforded by a grass roof. We were much more 
polite than the king; for we kept our shoes and 
stockings on our feet, while he pulled off his 
sandals, and during the time we were talking with 
him was scratching his toes and chewing gora- 
nuts. We inquired after his health, and invited 
him, in the name of Captain Trotter, to come on 
board the “Albert.” He made no reply in the 
presence of the people ; but told us, after we had 
delivered our message, that it was now time to 
drink water with him, and wished us to follow 
him to his private apartments. The king’s 
houses differ in nothing from the rest but in 
number, and a stranger is seldom admitted to 
them. All their Courts are held in the open 
air. We were led through a house into an open 
space of about twelve feet long and seven feet 
wide, comfortably shaded, it being surrounded 


FRIENDLY RECEPTION. 


109 


by houses; and there took our seats on mats 
spread on the ground, the Chief being on tlie 
same level with ourselves. Only three of his 
people were admitted, whose external appearance 
was more that of servants than of counsellors ; 
but as they said now and then a word, and were 
listened to by the Chief, they must be the latter. 
The good old Chief told us candidly that he was 
himself very anxious to see Captain Trotter — that 
he had heard of our coming before, and was very 
glad to hear that we had not come to make war 
with the people, but to establish peace — and that 
he would most willingly co-operate with us in 
every thing, were he not prevented and hindered 
by the Fulatahs. But he added, that if he should 
come on board, the news would instantly reach 
Rabba; and Sumo Sariki, who is so much afraid 
of the White people, would instantly say, “ Ah ! 
Rogang has joined the White people;” and as 
soon as they should have returned to the sea, the 
Fulatahs would cause him to regret his conduct. 

We now explained more fully to the Chief what 
our object was in coming to his country. He 
expressed himself willing to suppress the slave- 
trade as far as he was concerned, or as far as his 
influence extended ; but he thought that until 


170 


FRIENDLY INTERVIEW 


Sumo Sariki himself had decided the question, 
nothing could be done by himself or any other 
dependent Chief; and his opinion was, that the 
Fulatahs would not like to give up the slave- 
trade, nor could easily be prevailed upon by any 
other earthly power. “ God only can do it,” he 
said ; “ and may the hand of God be with you ! 
May God bring it to pass ! ” He hates the king, 
and the Fulatah People; and would, no doubt, be 
very glad if their influence and power could 
receive a check. All my endeavours to prevail 
on him to let us see the slaves were in vain. The 
report of our having liberated three had reached 
his ears, though no post is established in this 
country; and he was afraid that we should libe- 
rate those at Egga also. My assurances, that we 
would take none, were not believed. “ You have 
taken some,” he said : “ how shall I know that you 
will not take more, if you see them?” I trust, 
however, that a full and correct explanation of 
the capturing of them satisfied him that we had 
acted justly, and that no force had been used ; 
and that the agreement had been broken by the 
Attah’s people, and not by us. 

There were only a few Fulatahs present at the 
opening of the interview, and none in the private

yard of the Chief. Those whom we saw did not 
come to us in that friendly manner in which the 
Nufi People always do; but stood aloof, having 
the appearance of spies, or of people whose con- 
sciences bore them no testimony to the goodness 
of their cause. The colour of the Fulatahs is a 
little darker than that of the Spaniards. We 
commenced the conversation with the Chief in 
Haussa ; but he did not understand that language, 
and therefore inquired for a Nufi Interpreter. 
James Macaulay, a Liberated African from Sierra 
Leone, acted as such, and acquitted himself very 
well. As night was approaching, we left the 
friendly Chief, who shook hands with us most 
heartily, and made us a present of two country- 
made lamps ; and offered us several jars of beer, 
which we refused. 

Sept. 29 — As it was market-day at Egga to-day, 
and a favourable opportunity for collecting some 
information and obtaining some knowledge of 
their commercial transactions, early this morning 
I left the vessel again for Egga, in coinjiany with 
Dr. Stanger. On our arrival at Egga, we were 
told that a full explanation of the objects of the 
Expedition had been given to the Chief, who had 
expressed his readiness to enter into a treaty 

I 2 


172 


FURTHER INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF. 


with England, and said that his situation at Egga 
was such as to qualify him to act independently 
of Sumo Sariki in such cases. We received the 
account with suspicion, not only because it was in 
direct contradiction to all that the Chief had told 
us the evening before, but because it came from 
a person who is always prepared to give such 
information on any subject as he knows will please 
most. We determined, however, on seeking an- 
other interview with the Chief, and therefore pro- 
ceeded to his palace. On our arrival, the Chief, 
who had some of his counsellors with him, re- 
quested us to wait in the same house in which 
he received us on the evening before, which we 
did for several hours. The crowd of people was 
immense ; we could not hear our own words for 
the noise they made, each wanting to be nearest 
to us, and be first in selling the few curiosities 
they had ; and though very eager to sell, they 
never charged too little. I committed a great 
error in not providing myself with cowries be- 
fore I entered the river. I well knew that I 
should be in want of them ; but was advised not 
to purchase any, because there w^as no room in 
the vessel. My cabin might have contained 
100,000, and without any inconvenience to any 


MARKETS AND MANUFACTURES OF EGGA. 


173 


person but myself ; — and oh that I had filled it ! 
I would advise Missionaries and other people to 
provide themselves with plenty of them, when 
attempting to enter into the interior of Africa. 
I much wished to purchase some curiosities, 
which were expensive for Africa, but not for 
England ; but was prevented, because I had no 
cowries, and could obtain none at the place. 

We waited in the room to which we were 
directed, for several hours, to no purpose, as the 
Chief did not arrive ; and then left to see the 
various markets and manufactures of the town. 
Among the latter, the manufacturing of country 
cloths deserves the first notice : with nothing, of 
African industry I ever saw, was I more pleased. 
There are no less than about 200 looms employed 
in various parts of the town, and sometimes as 
many as ten in one place. The looms are very 
simple ; and the cloth made is uncommonly neat, 
never being wider than three inches. Some is 
quite white ; some striped white, blue, and red. 
They make the pieces about fifty or sixty yards 
long, which are afterward sewn together, to any 
length or width which may be required. In this 
simple manner they provide themselves witli all 
the clothing recjuired. They make tobes of them 


174 


NOTICES OF THE MARKETS 


which require no less than fifteen or sixteen 
yards of calico ; and smaller cloths for their 
heads, and to cast around their shoulders. The 
dye is likewise made by themselves. The blue 
colour is made with indigo, of which they possess 
a large quantity : dye-pits are seen everywhere, 
and perceived from a distance by the bad smell 
they produce. The red colour is obtained from 
camwood; but in what manner I am unable to say : 
there is very little of it to be seen here, which 
is probably imported from other places. The 
Natives use it for other purposes than dyeing 
cloth. It is beaten by women to powder, in large 
mortars; while the weaving of cloth is always 
performed by men. There are generally four 
women standing around a mortar, with heavy 
wooden pestles in their hands, and keeping time 
together ; so that from a distance you fancy you 
hear four men threshing corn. The powder thus 
obtained is mixed with clay, made into balls of 
the size of a large English apple, and dried in 
the sun : it is chiefly used by females to orna- 
ment their skin. They make large earthen pots 
of clay, and use them as cooking utensils : they 
have the appearance of cast iron. No real iron 
pots can be seen here. Along the coast, iron

pots form a chief article of commerce, at least 
at some places where I have been. The earthen 
pots cannot be very strong, as heaps of them, 
broken, can be seen in almost every corner of 
the streets. Sometimes the broken pots are used 
to pave the floors of their houses, and are cer- 
tainly a great improvement. I observed one 
single oyster-shell exposed for sale ; which leads 
me to think that they must be uncommonly 
scarce, and that there is no probability of pro- 
curing white lime in these parts of Africa. The 
market is inferior to that of Gori in many 
respects, though nearly the same articles were 
exposed for sale. The only European articles 
we saw, were, a piece of cotton handkerchief, 
some beads, and gunpowder carelessly packed in 
grass bags. There were about twelve or fifteen 
horses in the market, and a very little rice. I do 
not suppose that ten bushels of rice could be 
obtained in the whole town. There is a great 
abundance of Guinea-corn, of four diflerent kinds, 
as regards colour and size. It is ground by 
women between two stones, afterwards boiled, 
and buttered with Shea butter and eaten. Small 
portions of it are packed up in leaves, and sold 
at the market and in the streets. There were 


176 


MARKETS OF EGGA. 


great quantities of yams, calabashes of various 
sizes, and Indian-corn; some raw silk, and a 
little dyed red — both said to have come from 
the Haussa Country. I obtained a specimen of 
the latter, though I had no cowries. No fire- 
arms of any kind or description were seen. Their 
weapons are arrows, spears, and broad-swords, 
made in this country of iron. 

In our rambling through the town, we happened 
to put our heads under the low roof of a shed 
about twenty feet long and ten feet wide, full of 
people. As we seated ourselves under the roof, 
we soon discovered, on looking at the people, that 
some of them were slaves. We addressed the 
vender in the Haussa Language, who readily 
answered every question, and never attempted 
to deny that they were slaves. He was not the 
proprietor of them, but acted merely as agent. 
The number was, twelve women, and three chil- 
dren, boys, about seven years old. All of them 
had been taken in war, by the Fulatahs, The 
price charged for one of the adults was 40,000 
cowries, and for each of the children 20,000. 
The vender told us that there were not many 
sold at present ; that they formerly sold many 
to Kerri and Gori market, but of late very few ; 


SLAVE-MARKET AT EGGA. 


177 


and that all of them would have to be sent to 
Rabba, the principal slave-market at present in 
the interior of Africa. What feelings must have 
been produced in our hearts, by the sight of fifteen 
of our fellow-creatures exposed like cattle for sale, 
can easily be perceived ; but the expediency of 
making them known at the place, and in the pre- 
sence of the slaves, might perhaps be questioned. 
Expediency, however, was not the rule which 
guided me ; but from a sense of duty I expressed 
my feelings to all who were present under the 
shed. I informed them, that the chief design of 
our Expedition was to put an end to the trade in 
human flesh and blood ; and expatiated on the 
sinfulness of the practice, it being against the 
laws of God and the laws of the most enlightened 
kingdoms of the world, and productive of in- 
numerable evils among themselves. Conscious 
of the justness of the cause I was expounding, 
I could do it with perfect calmness of mind, 
and free from the apprehension of the displea- 
sure of those against whose interest I was speak- 
ing. When I had finished my address, which 
I carried on in the Haussa Language, employing 
the Interpreter whenever T was in uncertainty, 
the slave-vender replied, that he could make no 


178 


SLAVE-MARKET AT EGGA. 


objection to all I had said — that every word 
I had said was very true, but still that it was 
not against the laws of this country and their 
king — that if the king of Rabba would make 
a law against the slave-trade, he would be as 
glad of it as any person, and that the people in 
general would willingly give it up. To gain 
over the Fulatahs to the Abolition party is cer- 
tainly the most desirable thing, as there the axe 
would be laid to the root of the slave-trade. 
The slave- vender told us, that neither Rogang 
nor Ezu-Issa, alias Ederisa, maintained such posi- 
tions as to qualify them to enter into a treaty 
with England. He expressed as much as this, 
that Ezu-Issa could make laws, but they were 
always subject to the approval of the king of the 
F ulatahs. 

Near the slaves there was a sheep of the largest 
size I ever saw offered for sale, said to have come 
from the Haussa Country : the back was covered 
with wool, and the neck and feet with hair like 
goats. 

When we had finished at the slave-market, we 
returned again to the king’s departments, and 
were glad at his making his appearance soon 
after. We wished to hear once more, from his

own lips, whether he really would or could enter 
into a treaty ; but, as was anticipated, a decided 
negative was his reply. We wished further to 
know whether he would send a messenger to 
Rabba, with a message from the Commissioners 
to Sumo Sariki ; to which also he expressed his 
regret that he could not do it, since the king 
would instantly say that he had joined the White 
people. From observations like these, it cannot 
be difficult to arriv^e at a correct conclusion of 
Rogang’s opinion of the Fulatahs, and of the fate 
the proposals of the Commissioners are likely to 
meet with. The White people must be con- 
sidered by the Fulatahs as their enemies ; and 
their feelings therefore toward us can by no 
means be friendly. A proper explanation of our 
design would no doubt remove much of that 
suspicion which at present occupies their minds. 
Rogang believes that Sumo Sariki w^ould enter 
into a treaty, and would perform its conditions 
as long as the vessels would be in his dominions ; 
but at their removal he would recommence his 
ravages with greater fury. It certainly is very 
desirable that one vessel should, at least once a 
year, visit Rabba ; and very much would thereby 
be done toward abolishing the slave-trade, and

REMARKS ON THE PEOPLE 


ameliorating the condition of several tribes of 
Natives who are now oppressed by the Fulatahs. 

Having noticed the articles of trade, their 
provisions, slaves, &c., I now endeavour to make 
a few more remarks on the town and people. 
The latter always occupy most of my attention. 

Egga is undoubtedly the largest town we have 
yet seen on the banks of the river : the popula- 
tion may safely be stated at 7000, or 8000. Nufi 
is the language of the country, though many 
others are extensively spoken and understood ; 
as Yaruba, Haussa, Fulatah, Kakanda, Eggarra, 
Bornou, and several others. Katanga, the capital 
of Yaruba, is said to be fifteen days journey from 
Egga. People of many of these nations have 
joined the Fulatahs, some of their own accord ; 
others were forced to it ; but many have come to 
Egga for purposes of trade. The houses at Egga 
are a little superior to those of Iddah, all of a 
conical shape : the doors are higher, which is no 
small improvement. I could walk in and out 
without knocking my head against the lintel. The 
walls are all of clay ; which is mixed with straw cut 
sliort, by which they are rendered more durable. 
Some are about fifteen inches, others only six 
inches thick. A few of the houses are painted

with indigo, and quite smooth ; and if the colour 
could be made lighter, it would be as good as our 
English white-lead paint: it turns quite hard; 
and no impression can be made on it by the 
nail of the finger, and remains so for several 
years. Sometimes two walls are built for the 
same house, about two feet distant from each 
other; the outer wall forming a kind of veran- 
dah, calculated to keep the inside both dry and 
cool. These verandahs would be a much greater 
improvement if they were built at a greater 
distance from the inner wall, and if there were 
a few avenues in them to admit light and air. 
Generally, the houses have but one door : win- 
dows have not yet been introduced. The Natives 
must first see houses of European construction 
before they will ever be induced to believe or to 
perceive that theirs arc comfortless holes, only fit 
for rats*. 

Egga appears to be entirely surrounded by 
water; and the swamps behind it extend to a 
considerable distance. The whole country may

UNHEALTHIN'ESS OF THE TOWN OF EGGA : 


become perfectly dry in the dry season; but it 
is a question whether the healthiness of the town 
would be advanced by it. The unanimous tes- 
timony of the Natives is, that the dry season is 
very unliealthy, and that fever, small-pox, and 
dysentery, carry off large numbers, even of those 
bom and brought up at the place. 

I spent the whole day on shore, walking from 
place to place in the heat of the sun ; and the 
horrible stench, arising at certain places, for 
reasons which I do not know how to express in 
language without offending the ear even of the 
deaf, might be considered enough to give fever to 
any person ; yet I returned well, feeling no other 
inconvenience than that of fatigue. If another 
testimony of the unhealthiness of Egga is re- 
quired, I mention one who must be considered 
a judge in the case. When there was a doubt 
whether I should be able to return at night on 
board the vessel, on the first evening of our 
arrival. Dr. M'William strongly objected to my 
landing, being convinced that I should suffer for it. 

The answer to the question, whether ^ga 
might be considered a suitable station for Eu- 
ropean Missionaries, is obvious. It is much 
more objectionable than Iddah, because much

more unhealthy. Ha\'ing now advanced upward 
of 300 miles into the interior, in search of com- 
paratively healthier stations than those along the 
coast, and being obliged to sum up my investiga- 
tions in this single sentence, “ I have seen none,” 
I feel no small portion of grief and sorrow, 
especially when 1 consider that the people, to all 
appearance, would be ready to receive the Gospel 
of our salvation with open arms and hearts. 
They are prepared by those means which God, 
in His pro\’idence, has often sent as the fore- 
runners of the Gospel — trials and troubles. Tliey 
liave suffered oppression and hardships, for many 
years, from a haughty people; and the delive- 
rance from the chains of slavery, which would 
attend British intercourse with them, would be 
the best recommendation for the introduction of 
the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the 
Religion which we profess. How shall it be 
accomplished ? He knows, who reigneth on high, 
and who has promised to be with His Church 
even unto the end of the world. He will find 
means, when all human plans are disappointeil ; 
that all the glory may redound unto Him. 

The Egga people, not including the strangers 
from various other kingdoms, differ in nothing 


184

from those below, as regards their religion. The 
same mixture of Paganism and Mahomedanism 
is everywhere observed. There are, however, 
fewer charms, and other marks of superstition, to 
be seen than in the towns below Iddah. 

I was in the chief Mallam’s house at Egga, who 
had several books and separate leaves, all written 
most beautifully in Arabic ; but he was not able to 
read any, except those which he had written him- 
self. This is not an inference of my own ; he 
confessed to me himself that he could not ; and I 
know that others who may read them with much 
fluency are not able to understand the meaning of 
the words. Reading and writing is praying or 
worshipping, in their opinion — a fault and error 
of which these professed Mahomedans are not 
the only persons who are guilty. It appears to 
me to be of very great importance, to ascertain 
how far they are acquainted with the doctrines 
of the Koran, and what feelings they entertain 
toward Christians ; as from such information 
Missionaries may be directed in their labours 
among them. To their praise I must state, 
that I never heard an ofiensive word spoken by 
any against Christians, or the Christian Re- 
ligion ; and the same modesty ought, in my 


KNOWLEDGE OF ARABIC DESIRABLE. 


185 


judgment, to be observed by Christian Missiona- 
ries toward tliem. Disputing ouglit never to be 
courted; and, as far as consistent, without compro- 
mise, should always be avoided. They ought to 
be led to find out the superiority of our Holy Reli- 
gion, before their systems of men are denounced 
and contradicted. I very much (piestion wliether 
a certain Missionary has acted up to the Saviour s 
instruction, who called them reprobates, and their 
prophet a liar and a cheat in the lowest hell, 
because they did not believe his doctrine after he 
had preached to them once or twice. A knowledge 
of Arabic is desirable, but by no means of that 
importance as is supposed liy some. It would he 
well for every Missionary if he were to learn to 
read and write it with fluency; as it would enalih; 
him to communicate with tliem in other lan- 
guages, by the use of Arabic charactiirs. 

As I do not anticipate many more ojiportiinitics 
of seeing the Nuli Rinijile, their manners and ciis- 
toms, I shall put down a few jiarticiilars now. It 
appears to be a very large nation. 'I'li. ir language 
is spoken at the Confluence of the Tshadda and 
Niger, on the left bank of the river all the way to 
Rabba, and even lieyond it. The Nufi nation must 
comprise more than 100,000 persons. ^\'hat a

CUSTOMS OF THE NUFI PEOPLE. 


large field for Missionary labours ! They are a 
harmless, teachable, and industrious people here ; 
and such is their character at Sierra Leone. There 
they are called Tapuas ; but for what reason I 
am at a loss to say. There is one of this nation, 
Joseph Bartholomew, em^fioyed by our Society 
as schoolmaster, at Sierra Leone. Might not he 
become a Missionary to his own country-people ? 

The custom of painting their eyelids black with 
sulphuret of lead, which is found in the country 
and beaten to a fine powder before it is applied, 
prevails much here. It illustrates several pas- 
sages of Scripture. Compare Jeremiah iv. 30. and 
2 Kings ix. 30. in the original. The word “eye” 
being rendered “ face” in the translation, the 
beauty and applicability is lost in a great mea- 
sure. Their eyes are naturally black enough ; 
but the still darker narrow brim gives them really 
a mild and softened appearance. Another orna- 
ment is used by them for the nails of their fingers, 
which are dyed red, by a small leaf called lalleh 
in the Haussa and Nufi Languages, and henna in 
the Arabic. 

Sepi. 30 — I remained on board all day, and 
employed my time in writing some of the above 
particulars. I felt so much fatigued last night. 


DOMESTIC SLAVERY. 


187 


that I deemed it more prudent to remain quiet, 
than expose myself again. I trust I am correct in 
saying that some of our patients are getting better. 
Captain Bird Allen is still very ill ; but his mind 
is firmly fixed on those things which are above. 

Oct. 1 — I have not been able to obtain much 
information to-day, as I did not leave the vessel. 
A few particulars, however, relative to domestic 
slavery may be noticed in my journal. It docs 
not appear that the number of domestic slaves 
is as great as has been stated, bearing a propor- 
tion of three to one freeman. As there is little of 
the soil under cultivation, proper employment 
could not be found for many. The Egga people 
seldom make or purchase slaves from their own, 
that is, the Nufi nation ; but always prefer pur- 
chasing such whose native countries are far away, 
because they are considered less liable to effect 
their escape. Their description of the condition 
of domestic slaves is so favourable, that, at first, 
I doubted its correctness; and, to ascertain the 
truth, I inquired of several persons, whose accounts 
always agreed in the main points. The slave is 
allowed half of his time, to work for himself; and 
the other half he must spend in his masters ser- 
vice, for which he receives food and clothing, 


188 


TREATMENT OP SLAVES. 


both of which are very cheap. The clothing con- 
sists of a narrow piece of cloth around the loins ; 
and the food is chiefly such as the owners culti- 
vate by the labour of their slaves. The slave is 
allowed to sell the produce of his farm, after his 
master has disposed of his own ; and if he is 
engaged in trading, and employed in canoes visit- 
ing the various market-places, he may have his 
own articles of commerce, and dispose of them to 
his own advantage. He is permitted to purchase 
as many wives as his means will allow ; and his 
offspring are free. This circumstance accounts, 
in some measure, for the continuance of the 
internal slave-trade. If the slave can produce 
money enough, it not unfrequently happens that 
he purchases his own liberty ; after which, he is 
allowed to remain unmolested at the place where 
he has before been a slave ; or, if he chooses, he 
may return to his own country. The former is 
done more frequently than the latter. A domestic 
slave is only allowed to be sold if guilty of a crime ; 
and none taken for the debts of their masters can 
be sold out of the country, without causing much 
trouble to those who violate this law. The term 
“ domestic slaves” requires an explanation here. 
It is obvious, that when they purchase slaves. 


INCREASED CONFIDENCE OF THE NATIVES. 189 

they are at liberty to sell them again, or to em- 
ploy them for their own w^ork, as they find most 
convenient for themselves, and most to their own 
interest; and that, at the time the bargain is 
made, they never pledge themselves in any way, 
whether they are intended for domestic use or 
for a foreign market. When, therefore, they 
speak of domestic slaves, and of the limits under 
which they are with regard to the infliction of 
punishment or the re-selling of them, they can 
only speak of such slaves as have been long at the 
place, and entered into the relations of life through 
marriages, &c., and have thus become members 
of the community from which they cannot be 
separated so easily. 

Our vessel is now filled with fire-wood ; and we 
might leave for Rabba any moment we liked, 
if all our engineers were not still ill. It may be 
that all of them are getting better ; but there is 
no prospect of their becoming able to undertake 
so laborious a work for some days to come. I 
was glad to observe to-day that more of the 
Natives came near us and our vessel than before : 
they are gaining confidence in us. A canoe came 
early this morning with fire-wood ; and, unfortu- 
nately, coming under the paddle-wheel, was broken, 


190 


NUFI KINGS THEIR DISCONTENT 


and the wood lost, but no lives. One of the men 
laid hold on the steps, and the other swam to 
another canoe. — Our patients seem no worse 
to-day. 

Oct. 2 — I was occupied this morning by making 
some inquiries about the Nufi kings ; there being 
two at present bearing that name, though pos- 
sessed of no power; but whether I succeeded in 
finding out the origin of their separate existence, 
and of the influence of the Fulatahs over them, 
will be seen hereafter. To become clear about 
this question is, at the present moment, a matter 
of great importance, in various respects. All 
matters of importance are referred to the Court 
of Rabba ; and no Chief, whatever his hereditary 
right may be, ventures to enter into any treaty 
with England ; while, on the other hand, they 
make no secret of the real feelings of their hearts 
towards Sumo Sariki, the king of the Fulatahs, 
whom they look at as an usurper, and from whom 
they are anxious to become independent again. 

I was informed this morning by one of our 
Interpreters, that he learned, from one of his 
countrymen, that Mamajia, Ezu-Issa, and the 
Chief of Egga, together with the youngest brother 
of Sumo Sariki, had entered into a conspiracy 


UNDER THE YOKE OF THE FULATAHS. 


101 


against Sumo Sariki ; and that it was their inten- 
tion, next month, to make an attack upon Rabha 
with a considerable force. The Yaruba people also 
informed Samuel Crowther of similar attempts 
being in contemplation, for the attainment of 
their former independence from the yoke of the 
Fulatahs. Little as I am inclined to favour revo- 
lutions, I must say that I wish them good success ; 
for the Fulatahs have been a great plague and 
scourge to these countries for many years. They 
obtained power over the Nufi country in the follow- 
ing manner, according to information I received 
here. About twenty-three years ago, Nasa, king 
of the Nufi country, died ; when, as is no rare case, 
a contest took place respecting the proper person 
who should be his successor. His son, Mamajia, 
laid claim to the throne ; and his nephew, called 
.Jemata, son of his eldest sister, advanced the same 
claim. Mamajia called upon the Fulatalis to assist 
him. Jemata was killed ; but Issa, his son, car- 
ried on the war; and after some time tlie country 
was divided between the two ; while tlie Fulatahs 
made both tributary to them, and subject to their 
king. 

Several intelligent men came on board this 
evening, who were called Mallams; but they 


192

themselves said that they could lay no claim to 
such titles, being unable either to read or write. 
One of them spoke the Haussa Language wonder- 
fully well, though a Nufi by birth. I wish I could 
be in his company for a few weeks, and correct 
my Haussa translations. I long for such an 
opportunity the mere, as it would afford me the 
best opportunity of speaking to them on the 
principles and doctrines of our Holy Religion. 
I introduced myself to them" as a Mallam of the 
Christian Religion, and endeavoured to find out 
how far they were acquainted with the doctrines 
of the Koran. Several questions which I put to 
them, and the answers I received, convinced me 
that they knew nothing about them. I told them 
for what purpose we had come to this country, and 
that our object was to establish peace and good- 
will with all men ; and wished them to tell me 
whether they thought the people would be willing 
to receive teachers and listen to them. The 
Haussa speaker replied, “ This must be of God ; 
for when we heard before that White people were 
coming with large canoes, we were afraid of war; 
but since we see that you have come for peace, we 
rejoice. This must be of God ; for the Mallam of 
Sokoto has sent letters, entreating all Fulatahs to 


INCREASED CASES OF ILLNESS. 


193 


give up fighting, and sit down quietly. Now, the 
White people, too, are saying the same : this must 
be of God. May God bless you ! may God go 
with you ! may God give you long life ! ” One 
of these men was anxious to accompany us to 
Rabba, whither I hope we may be able to pro- 
ceed. A few days in his company, with more of 
such speakers, would soon enable me to speak the 
Haussa well. 

All our engineers are ill ; Captain Bird Allen is 
by no means out of danger; and there are not 
three of the ship’s company, the Blacks excepted, 
able to do duty. The river begins to fall, and the 
season will become much more unhealthy than 
even it now is. Considering all things, I cannot 
but think that it would be prudent to return to 
the sea ; — this seems to be the course pointed out 
to us by Providence. It is rather mortifying to us, 
our wishes and desires being disappointed; but 
still there is some satisfaction in knowing that 
we have done what w^e could. We have shunned 
no difficulty; but, on the contrary, have willingly 
endured all things, and, were it practicable, would 
most readily go on further. Another of our sea- 
men, George Syme, died this evening, of fever. 

I will now give a few more detached pieces of 

K

FURTHER NOTICES OF EGGA. 


information as I have obtained them ; and if any 
thing should now escape my memory respecting 
any point, I must communicate it when it shall 
occur to me. I inquired whether there was much 
ivory sold at Egga ; and was told, very little. 
Human sacrifices are held in great abhorrence 
here : the people are aware of their existence in 
other countries, but deny that their own nation has 
ever practised such atrocities. If this assertion 
be correct, it will deprive Mahomedanism of the 
credit of having abolished them. Egga pays an 
annual tribute to Sumo Sariki of 400,000 cowries; 
and a still larger sum is annually exacted from 
them under various pretences, chiefly as fines for 
real or alleged oflences. They only paid 50,000 
cowries to their own king, before the Fulatahs 
obtained power over them. It is said that Sumo 
Sariki allowed his warriors to keep half the 
number of slaves captured in war, or to dispose 
of them to their own advantage, which in no 
small degree accounts for the zeal they manifest 
in their iniquitous pursuits. 

Oct. 3 — I buried George Syme this morning, 
on the left bank of the river. Had Service 
on board, and administered the Sacrament to 
a small but devout congregation. The heat was 


EXCESSIVE HEAT OF THE WEATHER. 195 

unusually oppressive; the thermometer 88° in 
my cabin, and 90“ on deck, I never remember 
having felt the heat so much before in my life ; 
I shall ever think of this day, as the hot Sunday. 
A strong tornado in the evening produced a 
wonderful change in the atmosphere, and the 
thermometer fell to 83°. We have been favoured 
with tornadoes, having one almost every evening 
since lying at anchor at this place ; and if it 
were not for them, I suppose it would not be 
possible to live in these countries at all. 

Captain B. Allen more comfortable to-day than 
yesterday : our other patients do not appear 
worse. Little as I can do for them, I humbly 
trust that God has blessed the word of consolation 
and direction now and then spoken. The sickly 
state in which we now are tends to impress the 
hearts of several, and cause them to ask this most 
important of all questions, H'hat shall I do that 
I may inherit eternal life? and the Gosjicl of the 
grace of God proves now, as it ever has, the pou er 
of God unto salvation, to every one that helieveth.

Oct. 4 — Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, 
was the message of this morning. ‘ Draw up the 
anchor, and return to the sea as fast as possible.’ — 
I always apprehended this. My feelings na- 
turally opposed it continually, and the thought 
of it grieved my heart ; but now I feel reconciled 
to it, seeing that it is the only resource left to 
us. Captain Trotter was taken ill last evening ; 
and the symptoms of fever were too plain this 
morning to favour the hope that it was merely a 
momentary indisposition. Only one European 
officer was able to perform duty on board. The 


MESSAGE TO THE KING OF RABBA. 


197 


fever in the others was not subdued; and not 
one will be able to do duty for some time, even 
should their lives be spared, which, at present, 
appears very doubtful. 

It might now be expected that I should express 
my opinion on the whole undertaking ; — but 
I cannot : I dare not allow the feeling of the 
moment, and that one of distress, to predominate 
over my judgment. I will give it a calm and 
prayerful consideration : I will wait for opportu- 
nities of comparing my own thoughts with those 
of others, and so proht by the suggestions of those 
to whose superiority of judgment I would pay 
all due deference; when I will sum up the results 
of this undertaking, and state the prospects open 
for future Missionary enterprise. May God direct 
us aright ! Oh ! may He enlighten our darkness, 
and show us the way we know not ! 

There being no prospect of our reaching Rabba 
this season, a message was sent to the king, 
informing him that the Messengers of the (iucen 
of England were prevented from seeing him at 
present, partly on account of illness, and partly 
on account of the fall of the river; but that 
they expected to return next season, and would 
then deliver their message from the (iueen of 


198 


NOTICES OF THE KING OF RABBA. 


England ; — that the principal thing for which they 
had come, was to prevent the exportation of slaves, 
and to establish a friendly and commercial inter- 
course between Great Britain and the countries 
in the vicinity of the River Niger. A drawing 
was sent to him of the vessels composing the 
Expedition, with a rich velvet tobe, and a hand- 
somely bound Arabic Bible. He was also in- 
formed that the English had formed a Settlement 
at Addu Kuddu ; and was requested not to allow 
his warriors to come near that settlement. 

The present king of Rabba is the son of 
Mallam Dendo. The name of the Chief Mallam 
of Rabba is Musa; commonly speaking, called 
Mamusa, abridged for Mallam Musa. Andi Bossu 
is the head of the war department. Mamadu is 
another very influential person at Rabba. He is 
said to be the king’s brother, and a great favourite, 
doing whatever he pleases, and always having 
the king’s approbation. Aliluh is king of Sokotu, 
in place of his father Bello. Atibah is king of 
Yaruba; and Sita, king of Illoring or Illorin — 
generally marked Allorie on the maps. Sita’s 
right is disputed by the Yaruba people ; and pro- 
perly speaking, he can only be called King of the 
Fulatah party. 


THE RIVER GINDI. 


199 


According to information received to-day, there 
is a river called Gindi, flowing from Sokotu, 
and emptying itself into the Niger, at a town 
called Gomba, on the left bank of the I’iver. 
Our informant, a Yaruba man, told us that the 
“ Albert” might, in the rainy season, advance 
within three days’ journey of Sokotu, and that 
canoes can always pass from Youri to Sokotu in 
fifteen days, even when the river is at its lowest. 
The Niger bears at this place the name of Egga ; 
and higher up, Edu — a Null word signifying 
“ Great Water.” Canoes can pass from Rabba to 
Youri at any season of the year. 

We made but little progress to-day, in our 
return to the sea, as there was some business 
going on at Egga; and the engineers being still 
ill, steam could not be got up. Captain Trotter, 
I am thankful to say, appeared better this aftiT- 
noon ; but the other invalids, I am sorry to add, 
were apparently no better. May their valuable 
lives be preserved, for the good of the causi; in 
which they are so zealously labouring ! 

Od. All of us were disturbed last night by 
the illness of several of our companions ; Imt 
especially by one, who, in a state of delirium, 
continued making a great noise up to one o’clock 


200 


NOTICES RESPECTING THE SICK. 


this morning. In the gun-room, we surrounded 
the dying-bed of Lieutenant Stenhouse, expecting 
every moment to see him yield up his spirit unto 
God who gave it. He was partially delirious ; 
but there was a great contrast in his conduct 
to that of the other. The former cried, “ We are 
all damned — we are all lost — God Almighty has 
said it ! ” while the Lieutenant was as meek and 
gentle as a lamb, and his expressions betrayed 
grief on account of sin, and at times indicated 
some enjoyment of the consolations of the Gospel. 
He said, “ God has been merciful to me” — “ Christ 
died for me” — “ Thy kingdom come !” Seizing 
my hand, he said, “ God bless you ! God be with 
you ! I thank you.” 

Captain B. Allen seemed better in health this 
morning. He is always in an excellent frame of 
mind : all the Christian graces shine in him. He 
says, and, with the Apostle, feels what he says to 
be true — For me to live is Christ, and to die is 
gain : and if there be a prevailing desire in his 
mind, it certainly is, rather to be absent from the 
body, and to be present with the Lord. O enviable 
state of mind ! May my soul be seeking more 
and more to be in such a state ! 

Captain Trotter was worse this morning ; but 


CAPT. trotter’s approbation of the journal. 201 

his mind and heart were fixed upon better 
things. Feeling his danger, and considering that 
it might please God to call him hence, he expressed 
to me a wish — which, on account of the uncer- 
tainty of my own life, I shall here notice, that it 
may be complied with in case of any accident 
to myself — that my Journal, which he thinks 
contains much valuable information, may be 
transmitted to the Secretary of State, through the 
Parent Committee. I have no such opinion of 
my Journal : all my thoughts and remarks are 
put down in a confused manner, and resemble 
the state of our vessels since the commencement 
of sickness ; but still I must express my desire, 
should there be any thing in my Journal worthy 
the notice of the Secretary of State, that Cap- 
tain Trotter’s request should be complied with. 
If health and time be given me by the Author 
and Giver of every good gift, it is my intention 
to copy out whatever may be deemed useful, 
and deliver it to Captain Trotter myself; but at 
present I cannot undertake it. I feel I cannot 
apply myself to work so much here as in Ku- 
rope, or even in Sierra Leone. Our strength is 
but weakness. 

The river is falling rapidly; sand-banks and 
K 3 


202 


ROGAJJG, THE CHIEF OF EGGA, 


mud-banks begin to make their appearance in 
every direction : it must have fallen several feet * 
since we went up only eight or nine days ago. The 
season will become still more unhealthy. How- 
ever, we are in the hands of a gracious God, who 
will take care of us. 

Mr. Brown, who was sent to Egga last evening, 
to request Rogang, the Chief, to forward the 
message and presents to the king of the Fulatahs, 
returned this evening. Rogang was much pleased 
with the presents sent to him, and expressed his 
pleasure and satisfaction at the message sent to 
Sumo Sariki. Rogang thought this a wise ar- 
rangement of the Commander, and but for which he 
was afraid that Sumo Sariki would have suspected 
him of having prejudiced the Captain’s mind 
against him. He wished that the Captain miglit 
soon recover, and use speed in returning, as the 
river would be high enough to ascend again with 
our vessels seven months hence. According to 
Rogang’s account, there are rocks in the Niger, 
between Rabba and Bussa, over which the water 
falls. Canoes cannot pass the rocks either when 
the river is in its highest or lowest state ; 

* Dr. Stanger, by actual measurement, found that it had only 
fallen about fourteen inches. 


APPROVES OF AN ENGLISH ESTABLISHMENT. 203 

consequently the people always travel by land at 
these seasons, and get their goods carried from 
one place to another. Rogang was requested to 
send a man down with us, for some distance, to 
show us the different villages, and tell us their 
names; but the people were all afraid of being 
taken to sea; and as there were none of his 
servants or slaves acquainted with the places, he 
regretted that he could not oblige us in this 
instance. Rogang says that it is impossible at 
any time of the year for canoes to pass from 
Rabba to Youri ; which contradicts a statement 
of yesterday. The journey is generally made by 
land in six days. 

The Egga inhabitants get their cotton from the 
opposite shore, where a considerable quantity is 
planted. Rogang would be glad were the English 
to establish themselves there ; but he thinks tliat 
the king of Rabba ought first to be consulted, 
who, as Rogang supposes, would be willing to let 
them occupy any quantity of land they might 
wish ; though lie does not apprehend that the 
king would raise any objection, even should his 
sanction not have been previously obtained. 

Having had no opportunity of seeing much of 
the left bank of the river ojiposite Egga, 1 have

omitted hitherto saying any thing about it ; — 
a few remarks, therefore, may now be made. Its 
external appearance conveys the impression that 
it is much healthier than the low and marshy 
bank of Egga. It is raised and hilly, and appears 
better calculated for agricultural pursuits, cotton 
being grown there. Yet a settlement ought to be 
at a considerable distance from the river, behind 
the first range of hills, so as to be sheltered from 
the rising of the miasma from the banks of the 
river, at the subsidence of the waters. I am 
not sure that I am correct in my supposition 
that fresh-water situations are very unhealthy in 
Africa, but such has always been my impression. 

This evening, James Macaulay, our Nufi Inter- 
preter, brought his sister with him to the “Albert,” 
from Egga. They had not seen or heard of 
each other from the time he was a slave to 
this day, about twenty years since. They were 
so much alike in appearance, that I believe, had 
I met her in the streets, I should have known 
her as his sister. Both of them wished me to 
entreat Captain Trotter to interest himself on her 
behalf; since the Fulatahs have taken two of her 
children in their wars, and carried them away to 
Sokoto. But as Captain Trotter was too ill to be 


EDDOJI. 


205 


spoken to, I could only comfort her by telling her, 
that on his return to Egga, next season, she might 
come ; and that I had no doubt that something 
would be done for her, if it w'ere possible. 

We were lying at anchor all day off Eddoji, a 
few miles below Kinami, awaitmg Mr. Brown’s 
return from Egga. The heat was great, and 
caused us to long for a refreshing tornado, which 
came on in the evening, and greatly cooled the 
air. Captain Trotter suffered much to-day. Mr. 
Stenhouse and Captain B. Allen were both a little 
better. Some Natives came on board, with a few 
bunches of plantains, which were no small treat 
to us. Fruits are extremely scarce. 

Oct. 6 — Much rain till late at night. It pro- 
duced a wonderful change in the atmosphere. 
The thermometer was 78® in my cabin, early this 
morning : the air is now delightfully sweet and 
cool. Steam is being got up. One of our engi- 
neers being a little better, he will make a trial ; 
and Dr. Stanger will assist liim in the engine- 
room. Our patients were no worse this morning; 
and we hope that, with the blessing of God, the 
change in the weather will prove beneficial to 
them. We left our anchorage off Eddoji about 
9 A.M., and proceeded most delightfully for about

an hour and a half ; when we got into shallow 
water, and were obliged to cast anchor until we 
sounded and found a deeper channel. We cast 
anchor for the night, near Buddu, on the right, 
and Riggido, on the left bank of the river. 

Ocf. 7 — After breakfast. Dr. M' William and 
I went on shore at Buddu, the chief town of 
Kakanda, or of the district bearing that name. 
There is no separate town of the name of Kakanda; 
and the same nation which is called Kakanda by 
the Nufi People is called Shabi by the Eggara 
People. The Kakanda country contains six towns, 
besides Buddu ; and for the last four years has been 
subject to the Attah of Iddah, who receives an 
annual tribute of one horse. The people, evidently, 
could not mean to say that the Attah had only ob- 
tained the sovereignty of the place for the last four 
years; but only referred to the present Attah’s 
ascending the throne : for when they were asked 
how long they had been in the habit of paying 
this tribute to the Attah, they replied, “ From the 
beginning of the world." The Fulatah army 
was in this town only three months ago ; but as 
it was agreed to pay them an annual tribute of 
100,000 cowries, of which Riggido pays a propor- 
tionate sum, they killed nobody, and took no slaves. 


POWER OF THE FULATAHS. 


207 


According to the statement we heard to-day, every 
Fulatah is armed with a gun. They have plenty of 
swords, spears, and arrows, and a great number of 
horses. In case of non-payment of the tribute, the 
Fulatahs are said to pay themselves, by capturing, 
as slaves, whoever happens to come into their 
hands ; not allowing the towns or the State to 
enter into any agreement with them as to the 
number or the individuals which should be taken. 
In this manner the Fulatahs are sure of making 
great profit, since they always carry away some 
persons, for whose redemption they can exact a 
large sum; and therefore the slave-trade must 
continue so long as they carry on their ravages, 
because the friends and relations of the captured 
will purchase them back from the Fulatahs, or 
from those into whose hands they may have 
fallen. Any case of this nature well deserves the 
special attention of such African kings in the 
interior, and of English cruisers, as have entered 
into treaty; as such are-purchase of slaves would, 
in reality, be a liberation from slavery. 

The Attah has faithfully published the Aboli- 
tion Law at Buddu; and the inhabitants, who sur- 
rounded us in great numbers, candidly admitted 
that Buddu had ever been a great slave-market ; 


208 


THE LAW OF ABOLITION OF SLAVERY 


but that from the time they had heard that the 
Attah had abolished the slave-trade they had 
relinquished it entirely. They possess domestic 
slaves; but are not allowed to sell any of them, 
or, in future, to purchase others for their own 
work. — I am much afraid that this last condition 
of the law had not, before, been fully understood 
by them. The Buddu People do not grow cotton ; 
but purchase all they want from the opposite 
bank, which is also subject to the Fulatahs to a 
considerable extent inland. We inquired of the 
inhabitants whether they had heard of our having 
captured and liberated three slaves; and learned 
that some had heard of it, and others had not. 
We were anxious to know what they thought of 
our conduct, and questioned them in various ways. 
The first reply was, that we were stronger than 
they, and therefore could do what we liked. This 
gave us the looked-for opportunity of explaining 
to them the circumstances under which the slaves 
had been liberated ; and that, as far as the Expe- 
dition had been concerned, it had not been an 
act of force, but of strict justice. As they paid 
great attention to what we said, and appeared 
anxious to hear more, I requested them to be 
quiet while I told them some very important

209 


things. Generally, after having been seriously 
entreated to be silent, you must not expect even 
to hear your own voice for a few minutes; for 
each of them will cry out as loudly as he can, 
“ Keep silence ! keep silence ! ” When silence was 
obtained, I explained to the people why the White 
people did not like slavery ; and why they exposed 
themselves to many trials, troubles, and privations, 
for the purpose of making the Black people free ; 
— that it was in obedience to God’s Word, which 
taught them to love God above all things, and 
their neighbour as themselves. I then enlarged 
on the miseries which the slave-trade produced 
in various ways, &c. ; — all of which they admitted 
to be very true; and said, that, as far as they 
were concerned, it was no hard thing to give it 
up ; but that the Fulatahs were the persons who 
ought first to be induced to relinquish it. They 
denied that human sacrihces had ever been of- 
fered, either by them or by their ancestors, long 
before Mahomedanism had been introduced. This 
I am inclined to believe to be quite correct. 
They were glad to hear that an English Settle- 
ment had been commenced at the Confluence : 
and said, that they would go and see how 
White people built houses and made farms; and 


210 


VACCINATION INTRODUCED AT BUDDU. 


they would settle near them, to be protected 
against the Fulatahs. They confirmed the state- 
ment so often heard and noticed, that the dry 
season is generally very unhealthy to the Natives ; 
and that the small-pox, dysentery, and fever, 
carry oflf great numbers, at every return of the 
season. Dr. M'William vaccinated several ; and 
taught one of them how to perform the operation, 
provided him with lancets and pus, and directed 
him how to make use of the pus, which those who 
had been vaccinated to-day would produce eight 
days hence. They made no objection to being 
vaccinated; on the contrary, they most readily 
submitted to it, being confident that the White 
people would do them no harm. Dr. M' William 
instantly gained their confidence, and was con- 
sulted by one of the men about different com- 
plaints. 

Our Interpreter, James Macaulay, had been a 
slave for some time at this town, and showed me 
the person who sold him to Rabba; she was a 
woman of respectable appearance. While we were 
standing at the landing-place, waiting till the boat 
was ready, the Interpreter brought her to me; 
saying, “ Master, this is the womau who sold me. 
She wishes me to go home with her, to eat and 


JAMES MACAULAY, A NATIVE OF BUDDU. 211 

drink ; but I told her I had no time.” While I was 
speaking to her about the slave-trade, she ad- 
mitted that she had sold Macaulay ; but at that 
time did not know it was wrong ; and that her 
husband had more to do in it than herself. 
She asked me whether Macaulay could not wait 
a few hours longer, as she wished to make 
him a present of some fowls ; and was evi- 
dently grieved that she had no opportunity of 
doing something for him. Scenes like these are 
always very interesting to me. I cannot but 
believe that it is ordered by Divine Providence, 
in order to lay it most strikingly before my mind, 
that persons of this description should be sent to 
inform their own country-people of the miseries of 
slavery on the one hand, and the kindness of Eng- 
land in liberating them on the other. And when- 
ever I expressed a hope that Teachers of their 
own country would be sent to them, they received 
the intelligence with much gladness. 

We left our anchorage about 12 at noon. We 
were partly drifted down the river till 6 o’clock 
p. M. ; when we cast anchor for the night, 
near a village called Muye, about twenty miles 
above the Confluence. The river is falling fast ; 
navigation becomes tedious and dangerous; and

the greatest care is necessary, to prevent our 
running aground. In such a case we should be 
badly oflP, as no one on board would be able to 
stand the fatigue of getting us off again. The 
only remaining officer* in health has been com- 
plaining for the last two or three days: the 
symptoms are such as indicate an approach of 
fever. Captain B. Allen appears to me not likely 
to live twenty-four hours ; and Captain Trotter 
gave me some directions to-day, in case of his 
own departure. One of the officers is, also, appa- 
rently dying : many are still suffering ; and others, 
though free of fever, are in such a state of debi- 
lity, that they will not be able to do duty for a 
considerable time. To return to the sea for 
healthier regions is the only alternative left to 
us. May the Lord be our guide ! — My feelings 
are indescribable. I am well in body ; but ex- 
tremely nervous at times, owing to much excite- 
ment and anxiety of mind. 

Oct. 8 — We were all much disturbed last 
night. Mr. W., who has been in a state of 
delirium for several days, jumped into the 
river, through the port-hole, about midnight. 


Mr. Willie, Mate. 


DISTRESSING STATE OF THE SICK. 


213 


Thomas Guy*, a Black man, had the presence 
of mind to jump overboard from the quarter- 
deck, laid hold of him, and saved him : the cur- 
rent was running about four miles an hour. The 
boat was lowered, and both were brought back 
unhurt. This was a merciful interposition of Pro- 
vidence. Another of our poor sufferers gave us 
reason to apprehend that he would follow the 
example of Mr. W. : he was therefore secured. 

Captain B. Allen rallied a little this morning ; 
and Captain Trotter was much better. One of 
our engineers, the person who attempted to jump 
overboard last night, effected his purpose to-day 
at noon. At a moment when our attention 
was occupied with the shallowness of the river, 
he rose from his bed, on the quarter-deck, and 
got overboard — how and where is not known, as 
he was not observed by any person before he 
was actually in the water. He kept up for a short 
time ; but sunk before the boat could reach him, 
and was not afterward seen. I again felt the 
nervousness which I have before mentioned, and 
was unable, for some hours after the accident

native of Gambia, jumped overboard on this occasion. The

had happened, to compose myself sufficiently 
to be able to read or write. It was most dis- 
tressing to witness the poor man’s struggles for 
life, and yet sink and perish. No other impres- 
sion is intended to be conveyed, than that he was 
in a state of delirium, not conscious of what he 
was doing. I long for better days, and for a 
change in our condition. I have endured jiersonal 
sufferings, family afflictions sore and grievous, 
and witnessed and shared in the trials of others, 
during my residence of about eight years in 
Sierra Leone ; but nothing that I have hitherto 
seen or felt can be compared with our present 
condition. Pain of body, distress of mind, weak- 
ness, sorrow, sobbing and crying, surround us 
on all sides. The healthy, if so they may be 
called, are more like walking shadows than men 
of enterprise. Truly Africa is an unhealthy 
country ! When will her redemption draw nigh ! 
All human skill is baffled — all human means fall 
short. Forgive us, O God, if on them we have 
depended, and been forgetful of Thee ; and let 
the light of Thy countenance again shine upon 
us, that we may be healed ! 

We anchored about six miles above the Con- 
fluence, as night was approaching. 


ARRIVAL AT THE CONFLUENCE. 


215 


Thomas Guy was offered a reward for risking 
his life to save that of his fellow- creatui’es ; 
but he nobly refused it, saying, that lie had done 
only what was his duty, and was not entitled to 
reward. This answer deserves notice in my 
Journal, particularly as it came from a Black 
man, and betrays so different a feeling from 
that usually manifested by his countrymen, under 
similar circumstances. 

Oct. 9 — About 9 o’clock a. m. we arrived at 
the Confluence ; and anchored near the schooner 
“ Amelia,” opposite the Model Farm. The two 
Europeans, and Mr. Carr, a West Indian, who had 
been left here, we found so seriously indisposed, 
suffering from fever, that our medical attendant 
considered it necessary to order them on board 
the “ Albert,” with a view to their recovery at 
sea, or in some healthier region. Under these 
circumstances, I deemed it my duty to agree to 
the arrangement, and even to encourage Thomas 
King, our Native Schoolmaster, to remain at the 
place, though my mind was still undecided with 
regard to its eligibility as a Missionary Station. 
He will have enough to do, having charge of the 
schooner, and about twelve men on board of her ; 
and will be the only person able to administer 


216 


SCARCITY OF PROVISIONS. 


religious instruction to either the erew or the 
people at the Model Farm. I was glad to see his 
willingness to do whatever might be in his power, 
for the furtherance of our objects. During our 
absence, he had made several excursions to some 
of the villages in the neighbourhood, and found 
the inliabitants always friendly, and favourably 
disposed toward our objects and people. Three 
different languages are spoken by those who visit 
our Settlement; namely, the Nu6, Kakanda, and 
Bunu ; and besides these, the people on the left 
bank of the river, below the Confluence of the 
Tshadda and Niger, speak chiefly the Eggarra 
Language. 

In the course of the day, nine months’ pro- 
visions will be landed for the people at the Model 
Farm and in the schooner ; it being fully expected 
that, at or before that time, another vessel will be 
up again. But it is necessary to use every pre- 
caution, as regards provisions for the people. 

Here I am led to offer a few remarks, which 
are of general application. From the mouth of 
the river, as far as we have come, provisions 
are very scarce. Even if we were to put aside 
English notions of the things requisite to make 
one comfortable, and be content with the mere

217 


necessaries of life, I cannot see how even these 
could be obtained, independent of civilised coun- 
tries. A district of ten square miles does not 
contain sufficient provisions in meat to maintain 
our three ships’ company for even one month. 
There are at present twenty men employed at the 
Model Farm, and all of them are Black Men; but 
the whole neighbourhood is insufficient to sup- 
ply provisions for their maintenance. Europeans 
would have to obtain every thing from Europe ; 
and a regular intercourse between Europe and 
these parts of the globe would have to be esta- 
blished, before Europeans could, with safety, un- 
dertake a settlement in these regions. The mode 
of living between Europeans and Natives is very 
different. The Natives live on yams, onions, 
dried fish, snails, corn, beer made of Guinea-corn, 
and but seldom on animal food. But why should 
not Missionaries live so too ? I know what are 
the opinions of many good people in Europe on 
this subject. Many will consider the Missionary 
carnally minded who mentions such things as dif- 
ficulties and hindrances in his way, and that he, 
in the prosecution of his work of faith and labour 
of love, ought to endure all things, and to bear all 
things. All I would say, in reply to those friends, 

L

REMARKS. 


is this, that no one can feel more distressed that 
such things should prove real difficulties in the 
way of the spread of the Gospel than the Missio- 
nary himself ; and gladly would I paint my skin 
black, if by that means I should be able to live 
on Black Man’s food, and to expose myself to 
the rays of his burning sun, his heavy rain, and 
to his marshy habitations, with as little risk of 
life as he himself. But personal experience and 
observation have convinced me, that it is im- 
possible for Europeans to live as Black people 
do. Their strength would soon be gone ; their 
posts be forsaken; nothing be gained, but every 
thing lost. In fact, I am sure that it would 
be just as easy to make fishes live in air, and 
birds in water, as for White people, in general, to 
live in Black Man’s style. I consider the above re- 
marks called for, though not necessarily belonging 
to a Journal ; as a knowledge of all these things 
is necessary, and deserves a proper consideration, 
by every Missionary Society, before new Stations 
are determined upon. 

I can devote but a few more moments to my 
Journal this evening. My time has been much 
occupied through the day with our poor suf- 
ferers ; and I only regret that I can do so little for

them. I witnessed an affecting scene. Captain 
B, Allen and Captain Trotter are both very ill : the 
former can only be restored to health by miraculous 
interposition. They took leave of each other this 
afternoon. Captain Allen was not quite collected ; 
his mind was wandering more or less all day. The 
innocent expressions which he used, in that state, 
betrayed the same spirit which animated his noble 
mind when in health — a tender concern for others, 
resignation to the will of God, and a sweet assu- 
rance of his acceptance with Him. He can truly 
say, with the Apostle, For me to live is Christ, and 
to die is gain. Dr. M'William, besides the care 
of twenty-six patients, has to attend to various 
other things. Dr. Stanger has, by day, acted as 
engineer, since we left Egga; and assisted Dr. 
M'^William, in his medical duties, at night. The 
engineer, though recovering, cannot yet bear 
much fatigue. 

Oct. 10; Lord's Day — All hands at work, in 
order to be able to leave as early as possible. Pro- 
visions were landed ; and the gentlemen found ill 
here were brought on board, where they will have 
the advantage of medical attendance, and the fair 
prospect of reaching, ere long, a healthier climate. 

Being anxious to go to Atshara, a small village 
L 2 


220 


VISIT TO ATSHARA ; 


about two miles distant from the Model Farm — 
at which, according to Thomas King’s informa- 
tion, several slaves had been exposed for sale, 
a few days ago — an opportunity was therefore 
afforded me for doing so. I thought, that could 
I do nothing for them but persuade their owners 
to take the chains from off their feet and treat 
them humanely, it would be something done ; 
and my journey for such a purpose could not be 
considered a profanation of the Sabbath. On our 
arrival, we were told that they had two slaves 
last week — a young man about sixteen years of 
age, and a child only eighteen months old. The 
child they instantly showed me; but I was told 
that the young man had since been ransomed by 
his country-people, having previously been taken 
as security for the payment of a debt of 30,000 
cowries. Whether the whole truth was told me 
or not, I cannot say. I learned that the law rela- 
tive to the Abolition of Slavery had been duly pub- 
lished by the Attah ; and that all the inhabitants 
of the village approved of it, as a good law. 
They confirmed what has so often been stated — 
that the slave-trade would not cease until the 
Fulatahs were gained over to the Slave-Trade 
Abolition party. 


COOTERSATIONS. 


221 


I had a long conversation with the people on 
the diSerence between our Religion and their own. 
In reply to my inquiries, they denied ever having 
sacrificed human beings. As I could hardly credit 
them, I addressed a few words to them on the 
sinfulness of such a practice. At this they were 
startled ; and the Headman told me, that if I 
were so to speak to the Attah, he would be very 
angry with me, as he was in the habit of sacri- 
ficing a slave every year ; and that at the death 
of the Attah, twenty free persons were sacrificed. 
The number here stated is larger than we were 
told at Iddah : which statement is correct, I am 
unable to say. Astonishment was perceptible on 
every countenance, when they were informed that 
the Attah had been told that the practice was 
sinful, and that he had agreed to abandon it. 
These people are Pagans: no mixture of Maho- 
medanism is observable in their customs. They 
showed me their gods. Under a small shade, 
erected before almost every house, were broken 
|X)ts, pieces of yams, feathers of fowls, horns of 
animals, broken bows and arrows, knives and 
spears. Such were their gods ! — While it is easy 
to attack idols, or to expose them to ridicule, it is 
difficult to eradicate out of the heart of man the 


222 


DEFENCE OF IDOLATRY, 


superstitious belief placed in them. The old 
argument was again brought forward — that this 
fashion of worship was good for Black Men, 
though it might not suit White people ; that the 
same God who had given us The Book had given 
to them their country-fashion. I endeavoured to 
convince them of the sinfulness of idolatry ; and 
directed them to the only true and living God, 
who had made Himself known unto us by Jesus 
Christ. An old man then rose to defend their 
customs, declaring that they would never leave 
them — that as they found things when they en- 
tered this world, so would they retain them and 
continue in them — that whatever White Man 
might talk, they were convinced that their gods 
were very good to them. “ Suppose,” said he, 
“ a serpent should bite me ; I have only to put 
my leg under this god” — the shade — “ and I can- 
not die. Suppose sickness should come upon me ; 
I go to my god, and soon get better. From death 
alone he cannot deliver me : I must die when my 
time shall come. But White Men’s Book cannot 
save them from death : they, too, must all die.” 
On this last expression he laid peculiar stress ; and 
many of the by-standers hurst out into laughter, 
considering it peculiarly convincing and conclusive. 


AND DESIRE FOR INSTRUCTION. 


223 


I took occasion from this, to put before them, 
in as simple language as I thought myNufi Inter- 
preter capable of translating, the cause of death, 
and the Christian’s hope and consolation in death ; 
and then wished the old man to tell me whether 
he or the Christian would be the happy man ; 
representing the one as an obedient, the other as a 
disobedient child, before the Judgment-seat of the 
Almighty. The old man said, that, as far as he 
was concerned, he would remain in his old habits, 
till he should die ; but the Headman of the town 
made a long and excellent reply. It was to 
tills effect, as well as I can recollect: — “ Before 
time, we were told to sell slaves, because White 
people wanted them ; and we sold plenty. This 
time, they come and tell us, ‘ You no must sell 
slaves again,’ and we no sell slaves again: and 
suppose you come and teach us your Book, we 
cannot refuse to learn. “See” — pointing to 
Thomas King — “ this man is a Black Man ; and 
before he went to White Man’s country he did the 
same as we do; but now he knows better. You 
must not say that we are not willing to learn. Any 
thing which White Man will teach us to do, w'e 
can do. I will give my owm two sons to Thomas 
King; and he must teach them the Book, and any 


224 


ESTIMATION IN WHICH THOMAS KING 


thing he likes; and that is better than to sit 
down and know nothing. Last week this man 
(Thomas King) came ; liis word and the White 
Man’s word are all one [agree] ; and nobody 
shall say that Black people are not willing to 
learn from White people, or from Black people 
who can teach them.” On my way back to the 
vessel I had time to consider this reply, and it 
proved a great consolation to my mind. 

I felt very much at leaving Thomas King, not 
knowing whether I should ever see him again in 
this life. My mind was wounded to such a degree, 
that I could scarcely refrain from tears; while 
the following and many other anxious thoughts 
tended to disturb me still more. — Will he be 
faithful to his God and Saviour? Will he con- 
tinue to care for his own soul? Will he labour 
for the good of others ? The Headman’s speech, 
however, occurring to my mind, comforted me. 
He said, that Thomas King had learned better 
things ; that though his skin was black, his mind 
and heart were different from those of his be- 
nighted country-people ; and that he had become 
so through the influence of the Gospel. I cannot 
entertain the fear and doubt as to whether he 
will be faithful ; for the Black Man told me 


IS HELD BY THE NATIVES. 


225 


that he had already made attempts to teach his 
country -people. He knows whose grace is suffi- 
cient, and where to seek for help. Oh, may he 
be kept from the evil that is in the world, and 
be made an instrument of much good to poor 
and perishing sinners ! I am more and more 
convinced, that the only means available to us 
for the diffusion of the knowledge of the Gospel 
in Africa, is the sending forth her own sons into 
her several districts and countries. It may be 
that the Lord will show us, by a few instances of 
this kind, that such is His will and pleasure ; and 
that difficulties, which now appear to us insur- 
mountable, He, in a short time, will altogether 
remove : — for this I daily pray. 

I feel the great responsibility of my present situ- 
ation. It seems to be my task, at present, to look 
at things as they occur, and to draw inferences 
from them, which may assist in the arrangement 
of future measures. The former I will do as 
long as I can; I will record as much as I am 
able : the inferences, however, I consider best to 
postpone. At present, I can only come to one 
conclusion; and the result of the Expedition seems 
to me summed up in this single sentence — It

failed. Not in its primary objects — forming 
treaties with the kings, and abolishing the slave- 
trade — but, as the result of all the information I 
have obtained shows, that no commercial inter- 
course between the interior of Africa and England 
will unite the two countries, and so facilitate that 
access for which Missionaries are looking and 
longing; and that the extreme unhealthiness of 
the river will ever prove a great barrier to 
all the undertakings, on its banks, of European 
Agents. 

Captain Bird Allen is still alive, and appears 
somewhat better. Captain Trotter convalescent. 
We left the Confluence about 10 o’clock a.m. ; and 
had a fine day’s voyage, arriving at Iddah before 
6 o’clock p.M. All hands being at work, we could 
not have Service before the evening, when, after 
sun-set, we assembled on the quarter-deck. 

Oct. 1 1 — I got up this morning, after a restless 
night, with much headache, a foul tongue, and 
great langour — the usual symptoms of the ap- 
proach of fever. I took some medicine early ; 
but felt the same symptoms, more or less, all day. 
I was unfit for any employment, and retired 
immediately after Prayers, apprehending more 
illness. 


ARRIVAL AT IBO. 


227 


Oct.\'2 — Through the tender mercy of God, 
I was better this morning. I found that we had 
anchored, last night, near Keri — more properly 
called Onye Market. The Attah’s dominions ex- 
tend to this place; where, also. Obi’s territory 
commences. About 9 o’clock a.m. a heavy rain 
came on, which detained us for about an liour. 
The disadvantage to which we were thus subjected 
was sufficiently atoned for by the cool air which 
followed, and which is the only thing that can 
prove beneficial to our invalids. We arrived at 
Aboh, or Ibo, about 5 o’clock p.m. I went on 
shore immediately, to see Obi and Simon Jonas. 
Obi had cut fire-wood for us ; and I entreated 
him to get it sent on board very early next 
morning, that we might not be delayed. I was 
not a little surprised to observe that the river 
at Aboh had actually risen since we left, owing 
to the heavy rain which falls in October, in 
this region ; though the rainy season may be 
said to be over in the interior. We got along, 
in our boat, to the very entrance of Obi’s pa- 
lace ; which we could not do when we were 
here before. The water must have risen at 
least three feet. The inhabitants are at present 
obliged, if they wish to go from one house to

the other, either to wade through the water up 
to their knees, or to use their little canoes. 
Their yards, which are generally very small, are 
a complete morass. Their houses are built on 
banks of clay, about two or three feet above 
the water and mud. They must be somewhat 
of an amphibious nature ; since it is evident that 
they can live both on dry land and in mud and 
filth, if not actually in water ; and yet they are 
a strong and healthy-looking people. They con- 
sider this season the healthiest for them; and 
dread very much the approach of the dry season, 
as they are then subject to much disease. 

Obi reminded me of my promise to send him 
Teachers; and offered to get a better place for 
them than the town in which he is living. 
May the Lord put it into the hearts of some Ibo 
peojfie at Sierra Leone to go and preach Christ 
Jesus to their benighted countrymen ! It is to 
such persons that we must look, and whom we 
must e.vpect to become the Messengers of Peace 
throughout Africa. 

We returned to the “ Albert” about S o’clock 
p.M. and, I am sorry to state, found Mr. King- 
don, who was taken on board at the Confluence, 
suffering severely from fever, and in a dying state. 


ON THE RETURN OF THE “ ALBERT.^ 


229 


Captain Bird Allen was very weak, but, as usual, 
in a happy frame of mind. Mr. Kingdon ex- 
changed, about midnight, a world of sorrow and 
trouble for one of never-ending joy. 

Oct. 13 — Obi faithfully performed his promise. 
Early this morning several canoes arrived with 
fire-wood. Obi came on board ; and, by his kind 
assistance, our vessel was soon supplied, not 
only with fire-wood, but also with fowls, goats, 
yams, and plantains in great abundance : no 
delay was occasioned. I went, early this morn- 
ing, to the opposite island, in search of a dry 
spot, where to deposit the mortal remains of 
the late Mr. Kingdon ; but the water covered 
the whole island, and it was impossible to land. 
We were therefore obliged to seek for a place 
on the main land ; and two men, in a native 
canoe, assisted us. We advanced a considerable 
distance, through a narrow creek, until we ar- 
rived at a tree of an immense size, the largest 
I have ever seen in Africa; under which there 
were many native canoes, full of people, who, 
at our approach, ran off in great confusion. I 
remained under the tree, while our Kroomen 
went in search of a dry spot, fit to receive the 
remains of a brother in Christ, till the time when

all shall rise to a glorious immortality. Afterward, 
the Natives took courage, and returned in great 
numbers around me. I could understand almost 
all they said, though the dialect differed much from 
that of which I had acquired some knowledge. 
They said among themselves, that, as we were 
Obi’s friends, they could charge us nothing for 
the burial-place ; but that we should pay some 
rum to the Moa-Tshuku — Spirit of God — under 
the large tree, which is held by all in supersti- 
tious veneration, so that the spirit of the White 
Man might not hurt them nor their children. 
As I had no Interpreter with me, I could not say 
much to them ; but I believe I satisfied them, 
that they had nothing to fear from the spirit 
of the White Man, who I knew was happy with 
God in heaven. The Kroomen succeeded in 
finding a place, in a very small village called 
Barra ; and the people allowed them, most readily, 
to dig a grave between two houses, in which 
Mr. Kingdon was buried. They stood around 
us in silent amazement, while I read the Funeral 
Service. 

On our return, at 10 o’clock a.m. we found 
the vessel ready to leave. Captain B. Allen 
appeared a little better, as also Captain Trotter ;

and several of the sailors had left their ham- 
mocks, and were moving about a little. I felt 
very anxious to see the salt-water again, on 
account of the sick ; though it cost me much to 
make up my mind or to be reconciled to our 
return. 

I learned, from Simon Jonas, a few more parti- 
culars, in addition to those before mentioned, of 
the Ibo People, which I will here state. — Simon 
Jonas has been with Obi for about three weeks, 
during which time Obi treated him kindly. Simon 
employed his time, partly in making clothes 
for the king, and teaching others the art of 
sewing; and, partly, in teaching children En- 
glish, and speaking to old and young about the 
Christian Religion. He was quite delighted with 
his employment, and only regretted that he had 
no elementary books with him. The children, 
he said, flocked around him daily, to learn some-, 
thing from him ; and he estimates their number 
to be about 2000, The population he could not 
state exactly ; but he was confident that there 
were more than 2000 school-children, boys and 
girls. The number of domestic slaves, accord- 
ing to his testimony, is greater than tlie num- 
ber of free people ; and the treatment they 


232 


CUSTOMS OF THE IBO PEOPLE. 


receive at the hands of their masters is humane 
and kind. They are allowed, after some years’ 
service, to build houses for themselves, to ac- 
cumulate property, and to marry wives ; and 
some are said to have married as many as five 
or six, which is the surest sign of their in- 
crease in wealth. When they have built their 
own houses, they are considered free, and cannot 
again be called upon to work for Obi, or for their 
former proprietors ; but an annual tax is levied 
upon them by Obi. Each has to pay forty yams 
to Obi, in the yam season ; and those who have 
acquired many sheep and goats must pay him 
some of them also. The people from Bonny 
come up as far as Ibo, for palm-oil ; for which 
they pay, chiefly, rum, gunpowder, and guns. 
Very few European articles of clothing find their 
way here. Obi has a large quantity of rum 
and powder, and is said to be very liberal in 
the distribution of the rum. It is the custom of 
the principal people of the town to wait on him 
every morning, in several divisions, each of 
which comprises six persons ; and each party re- 
ceives a bottle of rum. Obi’s beverage consists, 
chiefly, of palm-wine : now and then he takes 
a little rum. The domestic slaves of Obi, and of

other people, belong to various nations : a great 
number of them are Ibos ; others are Nufi, Ka- 
kanda, or Haussa People. 

About 2 o’clock p.m. we were suddenly cheered 
with the news, that the “ Soudan” was in sight. 
All were sure of receiving letters from England ; 
but we were particularly anxious to hear how 
the invalids were getting on, who went down on 
board of her. However, it was not the “ Soudan,” 
but the “ Ethiope,” Captain Beecroft. No letters 
from England ; but mournful tidings from Fer- 
nando Po, of mortality among our friends and 
companions. We learned, from several letters, 
that the “ Soudan” reached the mouth of the 
river two days after her departure from the 
Confluence; and much praise is due to Lieut. 
Fishbourne, for his exertions in conveying the 
sufferers, with almost incredible speed, to healthier 
regions. Several, however, had finished their 
earthly career before her arrival at sea ; and 
some died soon after they had reached Fernando 
Po. I will mention their names, and the vessels 
to which they belonged.

The “ Soudan” met H.M. ship “ Dolphin” at the 
mouth of the river ; and thirty-eight sufferers were 
immediately put on board of her, and conveyed to 
Ascension Island. Amidst these painful circum- 
stances, it was to us a source of consolation to 
hear that, at the time the letters left Fernando 
Po, the patients of the “ Wilberforce ” were, with one 
exception, improving. Captain Beecroft kindly 
offered us every assistance in his power, and 
proved a friend in need. I shall ever think of 
him with much pleasure, and implore a blessing 
on his head. By his arrival, our minds were 
relieved from many fearful and painful appre- 
hensions. Dr. Stanger was, as I have before men- 
tioned, engineer by day ; and assisted Dr. M'Wil- 
liam, at night, in attending to the invalids. His 
exposure had been so great, that we had some 
apprehensions as to his safety ; and, no doubt, a 
few days’ longer exposure of the same kind, in a 
climate like this, would have brought on fever, and 
then there would have been no one to work the 
engine. Before us was the dangerous Bar, of 


OF THE RIVER NUN. 


235 


which we could not think but with fear. Our 
fears were, however, all removed, in a way we 
did not anticipate. Captain Beecroft was sent 
to our deliverance. His first engineer came on 
board ; and by his help we reached the mouth 
of the Nun, contrary to all expectation, on 
the evening of the 14th of October. Captain 
B. Allen was in a very low state, till late at 
night. I was prepared for his removal to a 
better world. 

Oct. 15 — We remained at anchor, inside the 
Bar, and procured fuel. 

Oct. 16 — We crossed the Bar in safety, early 
this morning. Captain Beecroft, himself, was on 
board ; and took us over. On him, and on his 
exertion, our safety, and the safety of the “Albert,” 
under God, depended. We met the “Soudan” out- 
side the Bar ; and learned from those on board, that 
the “ Wilberforce” had already left Fernando Po 
for Ascension. Cole, one of our marines, breathed 
his last to-day. We perceived a wonderful change 
for the better in the atmosphere, soon after we 
had got to sea; and I should have enjoyed it 
much more, had I not again been troubled with 
sea-sickness; the difference in the temperature 
was not less than 10°. Captain Trotter was able

to come on deck now and then, for a few minutes, 
during the day. 

Oct. 17 : Lord's Day — We cast anchor at Fer- 
nando Po, at 4 o’clock p.m. Our medical men 
went on shore immediately, to make arrange- 
ments for the accommodation of our invalids in 
the morning. To some, it is hoped that a change 
may still prove beneficial ; while others are in so 
debilitated a condition, that there is no probabi- 
lity of their being benefitted by it. We had one 
Service on deck in the forenoon ; the congrega- 
tion was very small, but attentive and devout. 

Oct. 18 — Twenty- eight invalids were carried on 
shore, in the forenoon : one of them, Mr. Willie, 
mate of the “ Albert,” died in the evening. Poor 
fellow ! he kept up the longest, and was the only 
officer for some time who could do duty ; but 
who, having rendered assistance to all, was yet 
the first that departed ! 

As there is every probability that our stay 
at this place will be prolonged for some time, 
I thought it advisable to hire a house for the 
accommodation of myself and Mr. Samuel Crow- 
ther ; where we might spend a few hours of the 
day together, in prosecuting our studies, and 
arranging our papers, which are at present in

great confusion. There is a learned Mallam 
here, a native of the Haussa Country, with whom 
I hope to arrange my Haussa papers. My Journal 
will now be di^icontinued ; but a few more re- 
marks on Fernando Po will be given.

A FEW observations on Fernando Po will appro- 
priately follow my Journal. In the first place, 
I consider a public expression of gratitude due 
to Mr. White, the Agent of the Fernando Po 
Company, for favours personally shown to me, 
as well as for the obliging and generous manner 
in which he endeavoured to render all possible 
assistance to our suffering companions. We all 
found accommodation in the Company’s Build- 
ings ; and under Mr. White’s hospitable roof 
I spent five pleasant weeks, the recollection of 
which will ever be sweet to my memory. Having 
been on board ship for nearly four months, to 
which I became daily less attached, I felt grateful 


MORTALITY WHILE AT FERNANDO PO. 


239 


when I was permitted to put my foot on solid 
ground. The eool and refreshing sea-breeze which 
we enjoyed, was a striking contrast to the air 
we inhaled in the valley of the Niger ; and the 
excellent oranges, pine-apples, sour-sops, &c., with 
which Mr. White’s gardens abounded, w’ere un- 
commonly welcome to all of us. But most of all 
consoling to our minds was the thought, that 
our invalids had reached a more genial clime, and 
found better accommodations than a vessel, how- 
ever commodious, can afford. The change proved 
beneficial to those whose disease had not already 
assumed too serious a character to be aided 
by any human means. The recovery of them, 
however, was not so rapid as I had fondly hoped 
it would be ; owing, no doubt, to the malignity of 
the fever under which they had been labouring. 
But it is a cause of gratitude, to state, that on 
the 23d of November, the day of our embarkation 
for England, there was only one left on shore, with 
an ulcerated leg; all the rest, exclusive of six who 
had returned to England, were so far restored, as 
to be able to resume, after a short time, their 
respective duties on board. This, of course, refers 
only to those who recovered ; for I have still a 
painful duty to discharge; that is, of adding

another catalogue of wortliy men to that before 
given, who terminated their earthly career at 
Fernando Po, and whose mortal remains are 
deposited at that place, near the resting-place of 
the zealous and indefatigable African Traveller, 
Mr. Richard Lander, as pledges of the love that 
England bears to Africa. This spot, which con- 
tains the ashes of much- valued and esteemed 
friends, will ever be sacred to my memory. 

The following are the names of the persons 
just alluded to ; — 

Captain Bird Allen, of the “ Soudan.” 

Mr. Willie, Mate of the “ Albert.” 

Mr. H. D. Stenhouse, Second Lieutenant of ditto. 

Mr. Woodhouse, Assistant Surgeon of ditto. 

Mr. J. A. Wilmet, Clerk of ditto. 

Mr. Mihvard, Purser’s Steward of ditto. 

M’Lintick, Stoker of ditto. 

Morgan Kingston, Marine of ditto. 

It is doubtful whether the two last-mentioned 
deaths can fairly be attributed to the African 
climate. 

I dare not leave this statement, without a re- 
mark or two relative to the character and dis- 
position manifested by some of these persons ; 


DEATH OF CAPTAIN BIRD ALLEN. 


241 


though I know that they ’ are far above my 
praise. 

Captain B. Allen expired on the 25th of October, 
at 10 o’clock A.M., and was buried by myself late 
in the evening of the same day. Of him it can 
be said, with perfect truth. To live is Christ, and 
to die is (jain. His patience under sufferings, his 
resignation to the will of God, and his firm but 
humble assurance of his acceptance with God 
through Jesus Christ, made his position truly 
enviable, and demanded from all who witnessed 
him the sincere prayer, Let my last end be like 
his ! With him fell another sacrifice for the 
cause of Africa; but it was a free-will offering 
to Him who gave Himself a ransom for all. I 
spent many an hour by his bed-side, reading 
the Word of God to liim, in which he always 
felt great delight, and commending him in prayer 
to the care and mercy of Almighty God. His 
humility — his faith in God’s word — his love un- 
feigned — his tender concern for every one in the 
Expedition, and especially for his companions in 
tribulation — his mild and charitable judgment in 
all things, will, I trust, be ever before my eyes, 
as worthy of imitation. 

Lieut. Stenhouse and Mr.Woodhouse were most 

M 


242 OTHER DEATHS AT THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION. 

amiable and pious young men. With Lieut. 
Stenhouse I had many conversations on religion, 
while together on board the “Albert,” which, I 
have reason to believe, were blessed to his soul. 
Mr. Woodhouse’s illness assumed a most serious 
character soon after he was brought on shore 
from the “ Soudan.” He could not, therefore, say 
much; but all that he did say indicated that his 
mind was fixed on those things which are above. 
At his request, I administered the Sacrament of 
the Lord’s Supper to him a day or two before his 
dissolution, to his great comfort. 

Before I leave the account of the sick and 
dead, I may just mention, that on our arrival at 
Prince’s Island, on our passage to England, in the 
“ Warree,” we received the mournful intelligence 
that eight of our friends, who were taken on 
board the “Dolphin” from the “ Soudan,” had 
finished their earthly pilgrimage on her way to 
Ascension, and that several others had been or- 
dered home for the recovery of their health. 

It has been my endeavour, in the preceding 
pages, to give a correct account of our condition — 
to describe things as they occurred, without inter- 
spersing many reflections or remarks of my own. 
But this account of the sick and dead demands 


MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION. 2 13 

a different course. A feeling of regard for those 
who fell, and the stigma thrown upon them as 
“misguided men” — a sense of duty to those 
under whose auspices they embarked in the 
Expedition, and the sympathy I feel with the 
bereaved — seem to call for a few remarks. 

The term “ misguided ” does not ajiply to any 
of those whom I attended in their sickness and 
at their death. There was not one but who 
knew perfectly well that the climate of Africa 
was dangerous in the extreme, and had counted 
the cost before engaging in the hazardous under- 
taking. As far as their motives for engaging in 
it are concerned, it is, perhaps, not for us to 
judge. It may be, that double pay was an in- 
centive to one, and the prospect of promotion 
to another — as human infirmities will necessarily 
be mixed up with all human undertakings ; but 
to state that such were the motives which 
influenced the majority, or even any con- 
siderable number, would be to state what is 
contradicted by known facts. Had temporal 
interest been their motive, is it not probable 
that an expression of disappointment would 
have escaped the lips of one or the other of 
them, at a time when it must have been evident 
M 2 


244 


FERNANDO PO. 


to each that their anticipations would not be 
realized? But, to their honour be it mentioned, 
no expression of disappointment or regret did 
I ever hear: on the contrary, they appeared, in 
general, to derive no small consolation from the 
conscious purity of their motives, and the good- 
ness of the cause in which they had voluntarily 
embarked. 

I must now return to Fernando Po. Much of 
the interest I had felt in this island is taken away 
by the intelligence that the British Government 
has relinquished the negociation with Spain for 
its possession. It is to be regretted that this 
beautiful island seems doomed still to remain in 
the hands of the Spaniards, and the inhabitants 
to the darkness of their own minds and the 
superstitions of their ancestors. The Spaniards 
are doing nothing for them, nor can Spain derive 
any advantage from the island. By retaining 
the sovereignty, however, other countries are pre- 
vented from occupying the island, for the purposes 
for which it is so advantageously situated ; viz. 
the location of Liberated Africans upon it — the 
extinction of the slave-trade — and the extending 
of British commerce to the interior of the vast 
continent of Africa, by the Niger and other 


THE INTERIOR OF FERNANDO PO. 


245 


rivers, which are connected with it. I question, 
however, whether the possession of the island 
is absolutely necessary for the attainment of 
the two last-mentioned purposes. A small 
British Establishment exists on it already, 
by the sanction, I presume, of the Spanish Go- 
vernment. The larger buildings were chiefly 
erected by the British Government some years 
ago, when the removal of the Mixed-Commission 
Court from Sierra Leone to this place was in 
contemplation : they are now in the possession 
of the Fernando-Po Company. The beautiful 
harbour will admit British men-of-war, as well 
as merchant vessels; and might not repositories 
for African commerce be established on a more 
extensive scale, and the naval establishment be 
considerably increased, without purchasing, at an 
enormous cost, the whole island ? Tlie decision 
of this question I must leave with those who 
are better versed in political alTairs than myself. 
If, however, my supposition be correct, that the 
land at present possessed by the Fernando-Po 
Company is sanctioned by the Spanish Govern- 
ment, and if it might be laid out to the best 
advantage, I can see no obstacle to the realization 
of the great objects referred to above. 


246 


FERNANDO PO. 


There is one village on the island which is 
principally occupied by persons connected with 
the Fernando-Po Company. The inhabitants, in- 
cluding Kroomen, who are chiefly employed on 
the timber-ground, amount to about 900. Se- 
veral of the people formerly resided at Sierra 
Leone ; others have come from other Settlements 
along the Coast ; and a few have come from the 
opposite shore, partly for the sake of employ- 
ment, and partly to escape slavery. 

I was glad to meet with one instance of the 
fruit of Missionary labour among the inhabitants, 
in one of the principal persons in the Settlement. 
I refer to Mr. Scott, who was brought up by 
the late Rev. G. R. Nylander, a Missionary of the 
Church Missionary Society, at Sierra Leone. At 
Fernando Po he holds a responsible office, under 
the Company ; for which, through the instruction 
which he received from Mr. Nylander, many years 
ago, he seems qualified. He spoke of Mr. Nylan- 
der with much afiection and esteem. He, with 
several others, entreated me repeatedly to plead 
their cause with the Church Missionary Society 
for a Missionary. The people were for a long 
time destitute of all religious instruction. Since 
January 1841, there have been two Baptist Missio- 


BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT AT FERNANDO PO. 


247 


naries residing there — Dr. Prince, and the Rev. 
Mr.Clarke, who have solemnized marriages among 
them, and held Religious Services, both on Sun- 
days and week-days : their congregations are 
encouraging. While I resided on the island, they 
admitted five persons to Church Communion by 
Baptism. I performed Divine Service in one of 
the Company’s houses every Lord’s Day during 
my stay there: the Services were well attended. 
At the earnest request of the parents, I baptized 
seventy-seven infants. 

There is a day-school at the place, kept by a 
young man from Cape Coast, who obtains his 
livelihood by giving instruction. The school is 
attended by forty or forty-five children of both 
sexes. He receives as much as sixpence a-week 
for some of the children ; others pay only three- 
pence or fourpence ; and a few receive their 
instruction gratis. A present of school-books 
would be very acceptable to him, and to the 
inhabitants at large. I supplied them with as 
many school-books as I could spare, and Lieu- 
tenant Fishbourne gave them some also. It is 
truly gratifying to see that the Negroes have a 
desire for the instruction of their children, and 
that they embrace every opportunity that presents

itself to raise their offspring from a state of 
ignorance and vice. May the time soon come, 
when those who have been benefitted by the Gospel 
and by Christian instruction shall be mixed up 
with the whole mass, and, as a leaven, diffuse a 
regenerating influence over the whole ! I look at 
each such attempt, however small, with gratitude 
to Him who has begun His work, and will carry 
it on to the end of days. 

The Bubies, or the Aborigines of Fernando Po, 
are a very peculiar set of people. The appellation 
“ Bubie,” given them by Europeans, is probably 
taken from a salutation with which, on meeting, 
they accost each other. A Bubie would then be 
as much as, “ How do you do ?” Several nations 
have, in like manner, acquired their names ; for 
instance, the Akoos, in Sierra Leone : the name 
would not be known in the Akoo Country if ap- 
plied to them as a people, but merely as a saluta- 
tion. Mr. Laird states the number of the Bubies 
to be about 5000 — evidently much below the mark. 
Captain Beecroft estimates them at 10,000. The 
Baptist Missionaries, who have visited many of 
their villages, and made it their business to in- 
quire as to every thing relating to them, consider 
that there must be more than 15,000 on the whole

island. Every village has its own Headman, and 
forms a State in itself. Mr, Clarke was engaged, 
at the time I was there, in reducing their lan- 
guage to writing, and had great hopes soon 
to commence Missionary labours among them. 
Hitherto little progress has been made in civi- 
lization ; they are satisfied with their own habits 
and customs, which are by no means commenda- 
ble. Never before did I so regret my want of 
the art of drawing as at this place, A correct 
drawing of a Bubie would be a curiosity. Wear- 
ing of clothes has not yet become th(? fashion 
among them. They make small hats of grass; 
which they pin to their hair, that the wind 
may not blow them off. They allow their hair 
to grow ; and when it is as long as a finger, they 
dress it in the most ridiculous manner. About 
as much hair as a lady would take to make a 
fine curl is separated from the rest, and rolled 
up in clay, softened by palm-oil or some other 
grease, until it is about the thickness of a cigar ; 
and when the hair has undergone this operation,

a long stick, or rather spear, is always seen in 
their hands. But though their appearance is 
very savage, they are said to be harmless and 
inoffensive, and of so cowardly a spirit, that 
half-a-dozen Kroomen would drive a whole vil- 
lage before them. They cultivate great quan- 
tities of yams, of a most excellent quality ; and 
prepare palm-oil, which they exchange for rum 
and tobacco. It does not appear that they are 
at all fond of a pastoral life : they rear no cattle, 
though they are fond of meat ; and pay well for it, 
when it can be obtained. Their laws are severe. 
Offences in children are punished by an incision 
in the arm or leg, with a knife. In cases of adul- 
tery, the female offender is severely punished. 
For the first offence, the right hand is cut off; 
and for the second, the left. I saw a woman at 
Clarence deprived of both hands, and cohabiting 
with a Krooman. She said, in my presence, that 
the Bubies would kill her, if she returned to them ; 
— she probably meant, for her last offence. The 
surgical operation of cutting off their hands is, of 
course, performed by the Bubies themselves, and, 
as I was told, with a common knife. The poor 
woman said she had suffered great pain, and was 
obliged to keep her arms lifted up for several

days. No other remedies are applied for the 
healing of the wound than such as are prepared 
by the Bubies. 

I have carefully perused Sir T. Fowell Buxton’s 
remarks on Fernando Po, in his excellent work 
on the Slave-trade, with all of which I perfectly 
agree. I believe the island would be healthier 
than any other place along the coast, if it were 
entirely cleared of underwood, and its soil were 
cultivated ; and if buildings were erected on 
the mountains, an asylum might be found for 
invalids. At the same time, I believe that we can 
only speak of it as comparatively healthier than 
other places ; for there is nothing which could war- 
rant the supposition that it would be altogether 
free from fever. In its present state, and from 
the experience we had for several years, it must 
be said to be unhealthy. From my own observa- 
tion, and from inquiries which I made at various 
Settlements, I have come to the conclusion — in 
which I believe I shall be borne out by the closest 
investigation — that there is no material difference 
between any of the Settlements, from the Gambia 
to Fernando Po, with regard to their salubrity. It 
may be, that for one season there is less of ague 
and intermittent fever in one place than there is 


252 FURTHER NOTICE RESPECTING FERNANDO PO. 

in another; but an average comparison of ten 
years would, in my opinion, show them to be all 
equally unhealthy. As regards the character of 
the remittent, the country, or the seasoning fever, 
by whatever name it may be called, — with which 
every European must expect to be visited, — 
I believe it to be essentially the same as that on 
the whole of the Western coast of Africa. It was 
fondly hoped, some years ago, that the climate 
of Sierra Leone was much improved — that the 
clearing of the ground, and the erection of better 
dwelling-houses, had made the place much more 
salubrious. But what say the annual lists of 
deaths to this theory ? They flatly contradict it. 
— I must repeat what I have said above, that there 
may be less of intermittent fever and ague, but 
that the fevers of Africa are all essentially the 
same. Nothing would cheer me more than to 
see this statement proved erroneous, and con- 
tradicted, not by theories, but by facts. 

The above remarks seemed to be necessary, 
and called for, under existing circumstances. Va- 
rious reasons — private interest, love of change, 
and the charm attending new schemes, have often 
been the cause of extolling one Settlement un- 
duly, and depreciating another unjustly. I readily 


MR. SCHON’s concluding REMARKS. 


253 


admit that salubrity of situation is of paramount 
importance ; and that the most salubrious spot 
deserves the greatest attention, and holds out the 
fairest prospects of success. But so long as there 
is no positive proof that one place possesses this 
advantage over another, in an eminent degree, 
it will be the wisdom of Missionary Societies, as 
well as of other Institutions, to improve the 
opportunities of carrying their intentions into 
effect by the means now presenting themselves 
in the Settlements already existing, instead of 
wasting time, money, and strength, in making 
experiments. 

I might now conclude my account of the Niger 
Expedition, as my connection with it terminated 
at the time of my departure from Fernando Po. 
But I should be ungrateful, were I not to notice 
the kindness and good-will manifested toward me, 
by all the Officers composing the Expedition, and 
especially by Captain Trotter. By liis uniform 
kindness and attention, my situation was rendered 
comfortable, and the expense to tlie Society con- 
siderably less than it otherwise would have been. 
And while I tender my hearty thanks to eacli 
of the Officers, may I be allowed to express a wish 
that the words 'of admonition and consolation

spoken, and the prayers offered up, in much 
weakness, and in a season of great distress, may 
not be forgotten in brighter days, but bring forth 
fruit unto life eternal.

•June 24, 1841 — This morning, the "Albert,” the 
first vessel of the long-expected Expedition, 
arrived. We have a long time waited for the 
Expedition ; but I hope that, in consequence of 
the delay, we^are the better prepared, by prayer 
to God for His direction, for the undertaking ;

and have also been taught patiently to wait 
on Him, with submission to His will. While 
preparations were making to join her, the “Wil- 
berforce” and the “ Soudan” also arrived. The 
steamers composing the Expedition, while lying 
at anchor, graced the harbour of Freetown. They 
also excited a very great interest among the in- 
habitants, and were visited, from curiosity, by 
many persons. 

June 30 — To-day, the Teachers’ Meeting was 
held at Fourah Bay*. Captain Bird Allen, Com- 
mander of the “ Soudan,” was present. After he 
had heard some of the Monitors read, he went out 
of the school-room, and made a proposal to the 
Missionaries, that some of the Monitors should 
be taken on board the steamers, in order to be 
trained up as engineers, &c. This proposal was 
approved of ; so that those boys whose parents 
were willing, and whose health was good, the 
Missionaries readily permitted to be taken. 

An arrangement was made this morning, at 
the request of Captain B. Allen, that I should go 

* The Teachers’ Meeting is held every Quarter. Six of the 
Monitors of each School are sent to Fourah Bay, where they are 
examined ; receive small presents of clothing ; and are encou- 
raged to go on in their exertions and studies, by a suitable 
address from one of the Missionaries. — (Rev. J. F. Schbn.)

on board the “ Soudan.” The Rev. J. F. Schon 
and myself felt this separation; especially as we 
had thought we should be together, on board the 
“ Albert,” to prosecute our study of the Haussa 
Language. Thomas King was appointed to join 
the Expedition, and to remain for a time at the 
Model Farm. 

July I — This morning I took my boxes on board 
the “ Soudan,” Mrs. Crowther and several of my 
friends accompanying me. I afterward returned 
on shore, to spend the remainder of the day with 
them, as the vessel was not to get under weigh 
that evening. About 5 o’clock I took an affec- 
tionate leave of my wife, children, and friends. In 
the vessel, I was placed in the engineers’ mess. 

July 2 — To-day, about 1 1 o’clock, the “ Soudan ” 
got under weigh for the Niger, the highway into 
the heart of Africa. She was soon followed by 
the “ Wilberforce which took her in tow, in 
order to save fuel. When I looked back on the 
colony in which I had spent nineteen years — the 
happiest part of my life, because there I was 
brought acquainted with the saving knowledge 
of Jesus Christ, leaving my wife, who was near 
her confinement, and four children behind — 
I could not but feel pain, and some anxiety, for

a time, at the separation. May the Lord, who 
has been my guide from my youth up until now, 
keep them and me, and make me neither barren 
nor unf ruitful in His service ! 

July 3 — I attempted to-day, on deck, to fill 
up the Yaruba column of the Vocabulary of 
the African Languages ; but being unaccustomed 
to the motion of the vessel, and feeling inclina- 
tion to sea-sickness, I was obliged to give up the 
attempt. 

July 4 — This being the Lord’s Day, Captain 
Bird Allen conducted the Services according to 
the Order of the Church of England. He read a 
sermon at each Service. Besides the Lord’s-Day 
Services, he has prayer regularly every evening, 
on the lower deck : he reads a portion of Scrip- 
ture, makes practical observations on it, and 
concludes with prayer. — I find many valuable 
friends among the Officers on board: their con- 
duct answers to their Christian profession. After 
the evening prayer, the Officers have a Bible Class 
in the steerage, for about an hour : — a short 
prayer is first offered up for a blessing on what 
is about to be read ; and a portion of Scripture 
is then read, during which any one may make 
remarks on what strikes him. I had the honour 


PRIVILEGE OF WRITING IN THE CAPTAIn’s CABIN. 261 

of being asked to join this class, which I did with 
great pleasure. 

July 5 — To-day we arrived at Monrovia. The 
“ Soudan” did not stop for many hours here, 
before she got under weigh for Cape-Coast Castle ; 
leaving the “ Albert,” the “ Wilberforce,” and the 
“ Amelia ” tender, at this place. 

July 6 — Very rainy to-day. When the awnings 
were put up, our berth was so dark that I could 
not see to read, much less to write. I did not 
like to tell the Captain, as I thought that I should 
do better when I became more acquainted with 
the state of things in the ship ; but as the Captain 
sent for me to ask me some questions, and as 
our conversation led to the subject of writing, 
I took the opportunity of telling him of the dif- 
ficulty I found in writing on board, and especially 
on deck, where I was frequently disturbed by the 
sailors. He very kindly offered me his cabin to 
do my writing business in, any time after break- 
fast. He was very anxious that the Yaruba 
column of the Vocabulary should be filled up, as 
he wished to send it to England, from Cape-Coast 
Castle, by the first opportunity. 

July 7 — This morning I commenced my trans- 
lation, having with me the Yaruba Interpreter, 


2G2 


PROVIDENTIAL PRESERVATION. 


Henry Clark. The Captain treated us with great 
kindness. 

July 8 — To-day I was busily employed at the 
translation. This evening we had the Bible Class, 
as usual. When I returned, I said to one of my 
shipmates, “ What do you think of our Bible 
Class His answer showed that he cared for 
none of these things. Surely he that walketh with 
wise men shall be wise ; but a companion of fools shall 
be destroyed. I hope the Lord will enable me to 
walk as a Christian. 

July 10 — While we were at dinner to-day, the 
glass called “the bull’s-eye” fell from its fastening, 
on my head, and then on the two plates in which 
I was taking my dinner, and dashed them to 
pieces. Providentially, tliis heavy glass, weighing 
about five pounds, did not fall perpendicularly on 
me. At night, also, my hammock, in consequence 
of its not being properly fastened, gave way 
at the foot, when I fell and got a slight stroke on 
my head. Had the lash given way from the head 
of the hammock, I should have suffered seriously. 
I mention these trifling circumstances, as, without 
God’s watchful care over us, how soon may we, by 
such small accidents, be humbled to the dust ! 

July l\’. Lord's Day — We had Service to-day. 


YARABU VOCABULARY AND TRANSLATION. 


263 


as usual : I acted as Clerk. I had the pleasure of 
making a trial to teach the Kroomen the alphabet ; 
while Mr. Kingdon, the schoolmaster, took the 
Bible Class of the sailors. 

July\'2 — To-day I got through filling up of the 
blanks in the Yaruba column of the Vocabulary, 
and correcting the printed translations. In the 
evening, the Captain having previously desired 
me to engage in prayer after he had made his 
observations, I did so ; and I hope with all lowli- 
ness and self-abasement before God. 

July 1 3 — I spent part of the day with Dr. Mar- 
shall, whom Captain Allen wished to examine my 
translation. I commenced filling up another blank 
book, sent to me by the Captain in the course of 
the day; but I could not do as I wished in my 
writing, as the hatches were taken up to clean 
the hold of the ship. I took the evening prayer 
on the lower deck ; and made remarks on what 
was read, according to Captain Allen’s plan. 

July 14 — This evening Captain Allen read the 
latter part of the 7th chapter of the Acts ; and 
requested me to make observations on it, which 
I did, and concluded with prayer. About 10 o’clock 
we anchored opposite Elmina, a Dutch settlement, 
about ten miles from Cape-Coast Castle. 


264 


SCHOOL AT CAPE-COAST CASTLE. 


July 15 — This morning, at 9 o’clock, we an- 
chored off Cape-Coast Castle. I went on shore 
with Dr. Marshall. We went into the Castle, to 
the Government House ; but as the Governor 
was not at home, we left, in company with a gen- 
tleman whom we had met there, for the house of 
the Rev. T. B. Freeman, Wesleyan Missionary, 
who very kindly received us. As Mrs. Freeman 
had been laid on a bed of sickness for some 
time, the arrival of Dr. Marshall was very sea- 
sonable. On his return to the Government House, 
he advised me to remain at Mr. Freeman’s, where 
he thought I could spend my time more agree- 
ably. In this he was not mistaken ; as Mr. 
Freeman took me to his library, and permitted 
me to make use of any books I liked. 

July 16 — This morning I accompanied the 
Captain, Dr. Marshall, and Mr. Waters the purser, 
on shore. Dr. Marshall and myself went to the 
Castle, to visit the Government School, con- 
taining 170 boys. The first class consists of 26 
boys, who read very well, and answered satis- 
factorily several questions which were put to 
them. Dr. Marshall distributed Tracts among 
them, with which they were highly pleased. The 
school is conducted by a Native of this place. 


MONUMENT OF THE MISSIONARY, PHILIP QUAQUE. 265 

who was very attentive to his pupils. After we 
had left the school, we came to the yard of the 
Castle, where the monument-stones showed that 
the bodies of several persons were deposited here, 
till the last tribunal. While Dr. Marshall was 
taking a sketch of the monument of Mrs. M'Lean, 
who died very shortly after her arrival at this 
place, he requested me to copy for him, from 
another monument, the following Inscription ; —

Afterward, I was taken about the town by Mr. 
Freeman’s Interpreter, whom he was so kind as 
to allow me for the purpose of explaining any 
thing I should wish to know. I returned on board 
with the Captain, much gratified. 

July 17 — I felt very anxious to-day for the 
arrival of the “Albert” and the “ Wilberforce 
as I was desirous of seeing Mr. Schbn, in hopes 
of being able to spend a little time together 
while the steamers were taking in their cargo 
from the “ Harriet ; ” especially as the plan we 
had made was entirely baffled by our separation. 
I spent part of my time to-day in reading the 
Scriptures to a sick Coloured sailor. He was 
attentive to what was said, and gave me many 
thanks for my kind attention. During the time 
w'e were lying at Cape Coast, wliich was about 
two weeks, I had got ready all my Yaruba 
Translations ; which Captain Allen sent off from 
this place, by a vessel bound direct for England. 
After this I got some writing work, in Haussa, 
from Mr. Schbn. 

July 25 : Lord's Day — This afternoon I had the 
opportunity of going to Mr. Freeman’s Meeting, 
at this place. It was interesting to me, as it 
was the first time I had heard a Sermon preached 


PREACHING THROUGH AN INTERPRETER. 


267 


through an Interpreter. The Service vpas con- 
ducted according to the Order of the Church of 
England. After Prayers were read, the Minister 
went into the pulpit ; when he gave out a hymn, 
before Sermon ; and while the last verse was being 
sung, the Interpreter joined him in the pulpit. The 
Minister read his text in English, and sat down ; 
then the Interpreter rose, and read the same in 
the Fanti, or Cape-Coast Language, as the people 
distinguish it. The Minister then stood up and 
preached in English for about ten minutes, and sat 
down ; when the Interpreter rose, and spoke to the 
same effect to the people. Frequently, the Inter- 
preter occupied more time than the Minister ; on 
which account the Sermon oceupiedalong time, and 
consequently must be tedious to English hearers. 
The attention of a great part of the Congregation 
was pleasing ; while others appeared to have been 
brought there merely from curiosity. I had the 
opportunity of comparing preaching through the 
medium of an Interpreter with that of preaching 
direct in the language of the people. How much 
of the meaning is lost by the interruption, I know 
by experience; unless the Interpreter is a well- 
qualified person, as I have every reason to be- 
lieve the one at this place is. To act as Inter- 


268 


COSTUME OF THE NATIVES. 


preter in preaching, is no easy task. Though 
the preacher may not be able to deliver so long 
Sermon as he might wish in the language of 
the people, yet there is this satisfaction, that 
the spirit of his short discourse is not liable 
to be lost, as we may have reason to fear 
may be the case through the medium of an In- 
terpreter. The plan of studying the language 
of the people, and translating the Scriptures into 
it, ought to be immediately adopted by every 
Missionary sent into the heathen world. Although 
this is a tedious and difficult work, as it takes 
years to bring it to perfection, yet, when once the 
foundation is laid, the top-stones will gradually 
follow each other, till the work is completed, to 
the great advantage of the people, and the faci- 
lity of succeeding Missionaries. 

It was very amusing to see the different dresses 
in which the Natives came to the Meeting, 
especially the women. Some were in English 
dresses, and others merely with their country 
cloths thrown across their shoulders, or tied around 
their loins. Most of them had their heads shaven, 
leaving bits of hair, in the form of a circle, 
on the crown of the head, for ornament. The 
Chapel is built of clay, called hrish ; with thatched

roof, neatly plastered and whitewashed, which 
gives it a beautiful appearance. Almost all the 
native houses are built of the same material. 
Those which are well finished are very comfort- 
able, and not very much inferior to stone buildings. 

The men, in general, are well dressed, and are 
in many respects much superior to the women. 
They are very muscular, and make a good crew ; 
which was perceived in the skilful management 
of their peculiar canoes in the tremendous surf 
at this place. 

July 30 — About 6 o’clock in the evening we 
got under weigh for Accra, about seventy miles, 
leaving the “Albert” and “ Wilberforce” still at 
Cape Coast. 

July 31 — About mid-day we came to anchor at 
Accra. The English, Dutch, and Danish flags 
were hoisted here. The three Settlements give 
a beautiful appearance, when viewed at sea ; they 
are supposed to contain from 14,000 to 15,000 in- 
habitants. 

Au(j. 1 ; Lord’s Day — We had Service as usual. 
I was unwell in the evening, being attacked with 
fits of ague. 

Au(j. 2 — I was very much revived to-day by 
a letter from my son, brought by the “ Pluto” 


270 


AT THE MOUTH OF THE NIGER. 


from Sierra Leone. Among other news, it con- 
veyed the |iainful and unexpected death of Mrs. 
Schmid, which took place the sixth day after our 
embarkation. 

Aug. 3 — I took the opportunity of writing to 
Sierra Leone; Captain Allen kindly promising 
to give the letter to Governor M'Lean, to forward 
it by the first opportunity. 

Aug. — This ev’ening we got under weigh for 
the mouth of the river, to complete our cargo 
from the “ Harriet.” 

Aug. 8 : Lord's Day — We were interrupted in 
our Services to-day by rain. In the evening we 
had a very heavy sea, owing to our drawing near 
the mouth of the river, where the surf is uncom- 
monly great. At night, the canoe we had in tow 
sunk : so we were obliged to drop anchor, to get 
it up. 

Aug. 9 — To-day we arrived at the mouth of 
the long-looked-for Niger; and dropped anchor 
outside the Bar, to take in a full supply of stores. 

Aug. 10 — This evening our attention was en- 
gaged by a most beautiful phaenomenon at this 
place. At ebb-tide, the river flows into the sea. 
The junction of the two waters — the one being 
blue, and the other yellow or muddy colour, could 


CROSSING OF THE BAR. 


271 


be distinguished, even to the point of a needle, 
almost in a straight line, for many miles along 
the coast. As the blue water retires, so the other 
flows for miles into the ocean, till the flood tide. 
About this time there is a very great agitation 
of the sea. Our vessel being small and flat- 
bottomed, rolled so much, that she frequently got 
her sponsons into the water. 

Aug.l ], — This morning I went on board the 
“ Wilberforce,” to ask Mr. Schdn whether any of 
the writing w'ork I had received from him was 
to be sent from hence to England. I wrote 
another letter to Sierra Leone, which was taken 
by the Captain of the “Buzzard,” a man-of-war, 
stationed here to keep off Slavers from coming in 
to carry away their living cargo. 

Aug. 13 — We crossed the famous Bar this 
morning, without any danger whatever. The 
“Albert” led the way. Every one on board 
prepared to meet the results which might attend 
the crossing of the Bar; but we got over so 
nicely, that many on board did not know when 
we passed the fearful spot till we were told, and so 
could scarcely believe we had done so. ITdherto 
hath the Lord helped us! 

We now got into the mouth of the magnificent

Niger. The “ Soudan,” with Captain Trotter on 
board, went to search some of the creeks at the 
entrance. In doing so, she ran aground ; but was 
soon got off again. She continued her course, 
and ran aground the second time ; when she got 
fast in the mud, and could not be got afloat until 
the next day. Captain Trotter searched the creek 
in a boat, and returned to his own ship at night. 

Aug. 14 — Having got the “ Soudan” afloat this 
morning, we dropped dowm to the mouth of the 
river, wdiere the “Albert” and the Tender were 

lying- 

Aug. 15: Lord's Day — This day we had the 
pleasure of commemorating the death of our Lord 
and Saviour Jesus Christ, by receiving the Sacra- 
ment of the Lord’s Supper, administered by the 
Rev. T. Muller, the Chaplain of the Expedition. 
Seven officers, three Coloured men, and the Cap- 
tain himself, eleven in number, surrounded the 
Table of the Lord, in deep humility, contrition 
for sin, and earnest desire for amendment of life. 
He that humhleth himself shall he exalted . — We 
always esteemed our Captain and his Officers 
honourable ; but we did much more so, when we 
saw them humbling themselves before the Lord. 
May this refreshing feast strengthen us to serve

273 


the Lord our God more actively than we have 
done hitherto! — The “ Wilberforce” arrived, to- 
day, inside the river. 

Aucj. 16 — The “ Soudan” went out of the 
Bar this morning, to get more stores from the 
“ Harriet.” We had a very great sea, owing to our 
going out at low water, with a very strong wind 
against us. This time was chosen, I suppose, to 
ascertain the depth of the water over the Bar, as 
well as to try the power of the engine. The sea 
being high, and the wind against us, the engine 
stopped many times : however, through the guid- 
ance of our God, we went across safely. 

Aug. 17 — Having taken in our stores, we set out 
at high water, having wind and tide in our favour. 
We re- crossed the Bar still better than at first. 

Aug. 18 — The “ Soudan” was run aground this 
morning, in order to repair her rudder. I took 
a walk this morning along the sand beach, for 
a considerable distance. The coast, as far as 
I went, was low and swamp^ ; which is very much 
against this highly-interesting part of it, as here 
ought to be a sea-port, where goods from Eng- 
land might be landed, as well for shipping off the 
produce from the Niger. The people here are very 
timid. We could not make any thing out of

them, as vre had none on board who could speak 
to them. Their village is said to contain 500 
inhabitants. They have abundance of cocoa-nuts, 
some of which they brought on board to sell. 

Aug. 19 — This evening Captain Allen took the 
evening prayer at the low deck ; when he offered 
up a beautiful prayer for Divine protection, and 
for the success of the Expedition, composed for 
that purpose. The “ Albert,” with the Tender in 
tow, ascended the river this evening. 

Aug. 20 — The “ Wilberforce” and the “ Soudan” 
got under weigh this morning, in pursuit of the 
“ Albert;” and in about two hours we lost sight 
of the sea, and were completely surrounded by 
thick mangroves, on both sides of the creek. Ap- 
parent satisfaction was seen in every countenance, 
that we had now commenced our river naviga- 
tion ; although some could not help remarking, 
that they were going to their graves. 

Aug. 21 — We were gradually introduced from 
the mangroves into a forest of palm and bamboo 
trees, embellished with large cotton-trees, of cu- 
rious shapes, interspersed among them on both 
sides of the river, and with other lofty trees of 
beautiful foliage. All hands were invited on deck 
by this new scenery; and the day was spent with 


NOVEL APPEARANCE OF THE SCENERY. 275 

great interest at this novel appearance. We 
passed, on both sides of the river, several planta- 
tions of bananas, plantains, sugar-cane, cocoa or 
kalahe, so called by the Americans ; and now and 
then some huts, and Natives in them. The 
Natives were so timid, that they several times 
pulled their canoes ashore, and ran away into 
the bush ; where they hid themselves among the 
grass, and peeped at the steamer with fear and 
great astonishment. We got opposite to a village 
containing about seven or eight huts, where the 
inhabitants, in very great earnest, armed them- 
selves with sticks and country bill-hooks, and ran 
along the bank to a neighbouring village, to ap- 
prise the villagers of the dreadful approach of our 
wonderful floating and self-moving habitation. 
These villagers also followed the example of their 
informers : having armed themselves in like 
manner, they betook themselves to the next vil- 
lage, to bring them the same tidings. When they 
were encouraged to come on board, it was dif- 
ficult to find persons brave enough to do so. 
Those who ventured to come near, took care 
not to go further from shore than the distance 
of a leap from their canoe, in case there should 
be cause for it. The Captain, perceiving some

of them inclined to come off, stopped the engine, 
and persuaded them to come near us. In the 
mean time we had come opposite to a larger 
village, into which all the former villagers had 
collected themselves. There was a little boy who 
acted as their Interpreter, because he understood 
two English words, “ Yes,” and “ Tabac,” which 
he had picked up at some place. They con- 
stantly told him something to tell us ; hut he 
could not say any thing else besides his “Yes,” 
and “ Tabac.” 

After much hesitation, a large canoe came off, 
with no less than forty-three persons in it. It 
was with great difficulty that some of them were 
persuaded to come on board. My expectation 
was greatly raised, when I found among them 
a Yaruba boy of about thirteen years of age, from 
whom I thought we could get some information 
about this people ; but the poor little fellow had 
almost lost his native language, through his 
lonely situation among them. He could not 
even understand me very well, when I asked 
about his father, mother, and his own town. He 
must have travelled hundreds of miles, before he 
got into this secret part of Africa. 

Here we were overtaken by the “ Albert” and 


PROGRESS UP THE NIGER, 


277 


“ Wilberforce.” The latter took another branch 
of the river this evening, to prove its course. 
The “Albert” and the “Soudan” dropped anchors 
about ten miles from the branch taken by the 
“ Wilberforce,” to spend the first Sabbath of our 
ascent up the Niger. Plenty of cocoa-nut trees 
vv^ere seen in many of the villages to-day. 

Aug. 22-. Lord's Day — We are now below a 
small village, quietly enjoying the Christian Sab- 
bath. Not more than two furlongs from us are 
a people who know no heaven, fear no hell, and 
who are strangers from the covenant of promise, 
having no hope, and without God in the u'orld. 
How inexcusable art thou, O man, who art living 
in a place where the Gospel of Christ is preached 
every Sabbath, yet who preferrest to live in dark- 
ness, in ignorance of God, of Christ, and of the 
state of thine own soul, to being made wise unto 
salvation by the saving knowledge of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ ! Take care lest these people rise 
up in judgment against thee and condemn thee, 
because thou rejectest the counsel of God against 
thyself ! 

After the Evening Service, Captain Trotter, 
Lieut. Fishbourne, and the Rev. T. Muller, went 
to the village, with Interpreters; but could not

make any thing out of them, except by three Ibo 
slaves, who had come from Brass River, to trade 
in palm-oil. — The Natives are Brass. 

Aug. 23 — This morning, about half-past 5 o’clock, 
we got under weigh ; leaving the “ Albert” behind, 
as she was waiting the return of the “ Wilber- 
force.” * We continued to pass several huts, and 
plantations of sugar-canes, bananas, and plantains. 
Many Natives made their appearance, and came 
up to us in their canoes ; some being dressed in 
old soldiers’ and drummers’ coats, having on old 
common black hats. You scarcely can imagine 
how they looked in these dresses, having on neither 
shirt nor trowsers, with the exception of a piece of 
cloth or a handkerchief around their waists. As 
their coats were red and showy, they took a very 
great pride in their whimsical dresses. A blue 
flag, with fanciful figures of man, monkey, bottle, 
&c., was flying in one of their canoes. They were 
not afraid of us ; for they came of their own 
accord, with their notes of recommendation from 
the Captains of former steamers. After we had 
steamed for about two hours, we came to another

bert,” a few hours afterward, returned down the river to look 
for her.

large village, from whence the Natives soon came 
around us, with plenty of bananas and plantains. 
The people here scarcely want any thing else in 
exchange for their fruits besides rum, for which 
they constantly called out, “ Vlolo ! vlolo ! " at the 
same time applying their hands to their mouths, 
intimating to us that they wanted something to 
drink. But as Captain Allen would not counte- 
nance any thing of the kind, we could buy very 
little of their things. 

Captain Allen, having received a letter this 
morning, from one of the Natives left here by 
the “ Wilberforce” — to apprise him that she has 
succeeded in coming through the creek, which 
forms an island, and that she has passed on — the 
“ Soudan” returned, to bring the “Albert” the 
news. We glided down the river like a fish, from 
6 till 8 o’clock, the engine working only at half 
speed. While we were at prayer, the ship ran 
aground ; in the mean time, the “ Albert” came 
up to us. As we could not get her off that night, 
we were obliged to remain there till the next 
morning, the “Albert” waiting to clear her off. 

Auf/. 24 — Having been put to rights by the 
“ Albert” this morning, she went before us ; as we 
had to search for an anchor which we had lost. 


280 


LAND LOW AND SWAMPY. 


When we had found it, we got under weigh at 12 
o’clock ; and could not make back our voyage of 
two hours' down last night, in five hours to-day, 
the engine working at full power. We came 
to the “ Albert” at the place whence we returned 
last evening. We dropped anchor for the night 
a little above the village ; — the scenery still the 
same ; the land low and swampy ; the plantations, 
which are only to be seen in small spots along 
the banks, are no better ; and the huts rude, and 
very close to each other. 

Aug. 26 — We set out this morning for Ibo. 
We have always been very free in steering the 
course of our ship : having sufficient water, we 
sometimes got so near to the shore as to pluck 
up grass from the side of the ship. To-day we 
came near enough to run against a very strong 
bough of a green tree, which seemed deter- 
mined to rebuke us for our insult in depriving 
it of a large branch ; in seeming retaliation for 
which, it broke our fore-topsail yard, and tore 
in pieces part of the fore topsail. A little be- 
fore we came to the Benin branch, the appear- 
ance of the river was very splendid, it being of 
a good width. After we had passed the Benin 
branch, we were very soon surrounded by a 


NATIVE FEMALES MANAGE THE CANOES. 


281 


group of about fifty canoes, containing between 
two and three hundred people. It was very 
amusing, to see men in their canoes, and women 
in theirs, each contending who should out-paddle 
the other ; for women, sometimes, are not infe- 
rior in the management of the canoes. Fre- 
quently the crew is composed of both sexes, even 
to a girl of twelve years of age; while many 
strons: men sit in the canoes with their arms 
folded. The water is so smooth, that almost 
every thing which floats, and is sufficient to buoy 
up a man, may be embarked in for a voyage. 
Some of these canoes will not hold more than one 
man, while others will conveniently hold upward of 
fifty persons. They are all so low, that the edges 
are not more than one or two inches above the 
water. It appears that here there are not those 
aquatic monsters, the enemies of man, or the 
Natives would not have been so free as they 
were. How happy were this people at seeing the 
steamers ! They gazed at them with wonder, yet 
with joy and delight; for one of the people in the 
canoes could not help putting aside his own paddle 
to dance to the movement of that of the “ Soudan,” 
which served him as a drum ; while they conti- 
nued following us for several miles, to gratify

cheerful on board our ship, looking forward to 
the Attah’s territory. 

yiug. 29 : Lord's Day — Lay at anchor yesterday, 
a little above Ibo, to enjoy the Sabbath — an

of God. 

Aug. 30 — Got under weigh this morning about 
half- past 5 o’clock; the “Albert” taking the 
“ Soudan” in tow through a narrow creek, which 
forms a large island: the “ Wilberforce,” with 
the Tender in tow, took the main river. Here 
we came to a large village of considerable length, 
containing only one row of houses and one street ; 
it was more peopled than any we had yet met with 
since we entered the river. Captains Trotter 
and B. Allen, with some officers, went ashore, 
but returned in a short time. Passed another 
village, where was a number of canoes on the 
landing-place, which led us to suppose that it 
was a market-town. As we steamed along, the 
Natives gazed at the steamers with wonder; while 
some of them were so amused, that they would 
not lose this favourable opportunity of dancing to 
the beats of the paddles ; keeping up along with 
the steamers, as far as they could make their way. 
Besides the pleasant scenery about the banks 


DEAD BODIES SEEN IN THE RIVER. 


285 


of the Niger, there are not wanting those 
of a humiliating nature. Many canoes were 
seen gliding along with the current ; and the 
positions of some passengers in them led us to 
suspect that they were slaves. There was an- 
other circumstance which damped my spirits, and 
tarnished my amusement at the pleasing sight of 
the villagers above mentioned. Among the specta- 
tors of our steamers was an old woman, who was 
bowing down to the ground, kissing her hands, 
and then looking up with great seriousness, 
as if she was asking for 'some protection from 
the gods. Whether she was performing this 
act of worship to the figure in the front of the 
ship, or to the steamer itself, was not certain ; 
however, it sufficiently shows into what degree of 
superstition this people are sunk. Moreover, we 
had to witness the naked bodies of our fellow- 
creatures floating along our side, or washed about 
the banks of this splendid river. This is the third 
time we have seen such unpleasant sights, since 
we have entered this river. If they were slaves, 
whose circumstances could not allow them a 
burial, it is much more to be lamented. 

Aug.3\ — Got under weigh this morning as 
usual, the “ Albert” taking the “Soudan” in tow. 


286 


THE LAND BECOMES MORE ELEVATED. 


There was a great change in the scenery to-day. 
Elevated land was gradually peeping behind the 
thick bushes on the banks of the river ; and the 
faces of all were bright at the sight of these 
long-looked-for places. Not many huts about the 
banks. — We came to a creek, where the steamers 
parted company, the “ Soudan” taking the creek ; 
and, as it was a long one, we could not come 
together in the main river that night. The 
steamers ascertained the situation of each other, 
on the opposite sides of this long island, by firing 
rockets. 

Sept. 1 — To-day the “ Soudan” went to search 
a river* on the right bank of the Niger; the 
“ Albert” waiting at the entrance. The stream 
became wider as we proceeded; but coming to 
a place where it branched into two parts, we 
took that to the left; till at last we came to 
still water of three fathoms ; and the creek became 
so narrow, that it was resolved to return from 
the search, as it was impossible to go on. The 
“ Soudan” had no small difficulty to return, as she 
became entangled fore and aft in the woods. Our 
boats were frequently in danger of being broken,

in Captain W. Allen’s Chart of the Quorra. 


SPEAKING HAUSSA.

as they came in contact with branches of trees, 
some of which the boats many times tore away. 
About 8 o'clock we returned from the narrow 
and long creek into the main river; which, as 
the light of the moon greatly heightened its splen- 
dour, appeared to us like the ocean. 

Sept. 2 — I had an opportunity to-day of proving 
what I had learned of the Haussa Language. We 
came to a village called Doko Abbokkoh, where 
we saw a yam-canoe. Captain Allen ordered it 
to be called alongside. There was a man in it 
who spoke Haussa ; and, as we had no Interpreter 
on board who could speak to him, I acted as inter- 
preter of that language for the first time. I was 
glad that I could make out a great deal of what 
he said, especially as my knowledge of that lan- 
guage is very limited; and he had- no difficulty 
to understand me. After we had bought some 
yams from them we started off, as the Captain 
was desirous of getting to Iddah to-day. The 
scenery is still improving, as now and then 
ranges of hills are discovering themselves to us 
on every side.

Sept. 3 — We anchored opposite Iddah at half- 
past 10 o’clock A.M., to get wood. The “Albert” 
and the Tender were lying near the town, where 
all the Captains and OEBcers were busy making 
the treaty with the Attah. 

Sept. 4 — To-day, about 1 o’clock, I went on 
shore with Dr. Marshall and Mr. Kingdon ; where 


VISIT TO WAPPA. 


289 


we met a number of men, upward of a hundred, 
all armed with bows, arrows, and spears. These 
men were placed here as guards, by a Chief of 
Benin, from a suspicion that we had come to help 
the Attah to take away his country ; as they two 
have a quarrel or war between them about a 
certain part of the country. Some officers from 
the “ Wilberforce” went to their town, Wappa. 
They were about to be shot at by the people at 
their first landing, before the Interpreter called 
and stopped them from their aim. We intended 
to reach this town, which is about five miles from 
the river ; but another guard party, of about 
thirty or forty men, who were coming back with 
the officers from the “Wilberforce,” insisted upon 
our return, as no person might go to the town in 
their absence. Doctor Marshall determined to 
go on, as we had come half the way; but they 
insisted upon our return ; and, as I could not 
speak to them, I thought it better to return, and 
not act contrary to the order which they had no 
doubt received from their Chief : so we had to come 
back, without having our curiosity gratified at the 
sight of the town. They had on a great number 
of charms and greegrees about their hair, necks, 
wrists, and waists, decorated with beads and many

cowries. Some had only dirty bits of cloth about 
their waists, and others about their shoulders ; 
which, together with their smoky bows and arrows, 
and their dirty hair, plaited in different forms, 
gave them a complete appearance of barbarity. 
Doctor Marshall would have taken a sketch of 
two or three of them ; but when they perceived 
that he was now and then looking at them, and at 
the same time writing something in his book, 
they very soon got out of his way. A sketch of 
two spears stuck in the ground would have been 
taken, but they had not confidence enough in 
the White Man to let him make his charm on 
their weapons. They took a liking to almost 
any thing they saw of a European dress. My 
shoes, which I held in my hand — as we all had 
to take them off in crossing a marshy spot, — my 
striped jacket, watch-guard, &c., would have met 
with a ready sale, if I had been willing to ex- 
change them for some of their arrows or eggs; 
but their lean goats and sheep, which looked bad 
enough, were too valuable for any of our dress, 
which they still were very anxious to obtain. 
As they were rude in their appearance, so were 
they in their manners ; for they made it no matter 
of consideration whatever to put their hands to

any part of our dress, which, considering how 
dirty they were, was not at all agreeable. Fearing 
lest my watch-guard should be broken through 
their rough handling of it, and thereby my watch 
be damaged, I was obliged to deliver it into the 
custody of Dr. Marshall, as he was more decided 
in the denial of their fanciful requests. If I had 
met with a wild people before, this was one of 
that kind. 

After crossing the marsh, the land was dry 
and sandy. We saw a beautiful plantation of 
yams, among which cotton-plants and Guinea- 
corn were scattered about. Having got sufficient 
wood, we dropped into the main river, as there 
was more air. 

Sept. 5: Lord's Day — The Rev. T. Muller 
preached on Rev. hi. 1 — 6, at the Evening Service. 
After Service, I took some books to Mr. Schdn, 
on board the “ Wilberforce and, as I had no 
opportunity of returning, I stopped over night, 
with the second engineer of our ship, who also 
went to the “ Wilberforce.” 

Sept. 6 — I could not get the opportunity of re- 
turning to our ship to-day till about 12 o’clock, 
when a boat was sent for us. The treaty-palaver 
(conversation) was carrying on, on board the

THE IGALLA INTERPRETER DROWNED. 


“Albert.” As the Attah thought it was beneath 
his dignity to go into a canoe, the Commander of 
the Expedition, and his friends, were obliged to go 
to his majesty. I had been very anxious to go on 
shore at this place ; but an accident of a most 
painful nature took place, which deprived me of 
the opportunity. The Igalla Interpreter, whose 
services were mostly needed at this place, acci- 
dentally fell overboard from the “ Albert,” and 
was drowned. I was just on the way to ask per- 
mission to go on board the “ Albert,” as she was 
going nearer the town, with all who were desirous 
of going on shore ; wdien she got under weigh, in 
search of this 'poor man, who had made himself 
very useful in this country. The Lord seeth not 
as man seeth. Trust not in man, whose breath is 
in his nostrils : for wherein is he to be accounted of? 

In the evening we got under weigh, leaving the 
“Albert” at Iddah. The First Lieutenant, and 
some of our men, were taken ill here. Dr. Mar- 
shall returned from the “Albert:” he appeared 
unwell. As I could not go on shore here, I turned 
my attention to reading to the sick men on board, 
and cheering up their spirits. 

Sept. 7 — The scenery to-day was the most pic- 
turesque we had seen since we entered the river. 


PICTURESQUE SCENERY. 


293 


From Iddah, ridges of mountains bui’st into view; 
and on coming near them, others again discovered 
themselves behind them. As the river winds, 
many of the mountains which we had passed were 
seen behind us: in a few words, we were com- 
pletely surrounded by mountains, most of which 
are very rocky, and we had to encounter a very 
strong current between them. 

I visited the patients frequently to-day; and 
read portions of Scripture to them, as long as 
they could bear it. 

Sept. 8 — Passed Keri market : a great number 
of people were seen busying themselves about. — 
We steamed right between mountains to-day, with 
a very strong current against us. 

Sept. 9 — This morning the steward of the 
“ Soudan” breathed his last. His soul took its 
flight, I trust, to be with Jesus, whom he had 
continually before his eyes as his only hope. In the 
forenoon, I buried him in a small island on the 
Niger, where he must lie till the Resurrection Day. 

Sept. 10 — This morning the “ Albert” and the 
“ Wilberforce” came up to us, where we were 
getting wood. Captain B. Allen immediately 
came to his ship. He took all his unexpected 
afflictions with Christian resignation. I went with 


294 


DESIRE OF NATIVES FOR TEACHERS. 


Mr. Sidney, one of the officers, to a village on 
the top of the hill, below which we were wood- 
ing. These villagers are refugees from the town 
of Addu Kuddu, on the right side of the river at 
the Confluence, having been driven away by the 
Fulatahs. From the top of the hill, you may see 
three other villages at the foot. The one on 
the top of the hill contains 200 inhabitants : the 
four together contain 800, at an average. The 
people are Kakandas. As I could understand 
them a little, I mentioned to them the design of 
the Expedition, at which they were transported 
with joy. One of them was so confident, that he 
wished to go with the White Men altogether. 
I asked them whether they would like me to stay 
among them, and teach them about God ? — they 
all answered in the affirmative. 

The Chief of this village, an old man about 
sixty, had been sacrificing a fowl to his idol this 
morning. The blood he sprinkled on his fore- 
head, to which were attached a few of the fowl’s 
feathers. His idol is rather difficult to describe, 
as it was a mixture of some sort of grass or 
palm-leaves, clay, and broken pieces of cala- 
bashes ; to which feathers of fowls were fastened 
by means of blood. I shook my head, indicating 


VILLAGE FARMS OF GUINEA- CORN. 


295 


that it was not good ; at the same time pointing 
my finger to Heaven, directing him to worship the 
only True God. He did not pay much attention. 
They all took fright at Mr. Sidney’s instrument 
to take the distances ; but their fears soon sub- 
sided. Their huts are built in the same form as 
those of Iddah — a circular form ; and they are so 
low and close to each other, that if a fire should 
break out in one, the whole village of about 
sixty huts would be consumed in a moment. 
The village is so filthy, that the stench of it was 
insufferable. The spot where it stands is one of 
the most airy, eight miles below the Confluence : 
it commands an extensive view. The villagers 
have large farms of Guinea-corn, which grows 
beautifully : it does credit to their industry. They 
have been here only three years. — We got under 
weigh for the Confluence. 

Sept. 11 — This morning we anchored near a 
village about a mile from the Confluence, nearly 
opposite the ruins of Addu Kuddu, to take in the 
Chief, who, with his people, had taken refuge 
here. As he delayed his coming, I took the 
opportunity, in company with some officers from 
our ship, to visit the village. It is in the same 
condition as that on the hill, except that it is more 


296 


VISIT OF A CHIEF, ON BOARD. 


populous, and on a low land. There are a few 
persons here who speak Haussa. I mentioned 
to them the object of the Expedition ; but it 
seemed to them as an idle tale : they would hear 
it again, lest their ears should have deceived 
them at what I told them. There are, perhaps, 
1000 inhabitants in this village. They seemed to 
have been greatly impoverished through their 
desertion : they are very ragged and dirty indeed. 
We returned from this unpleasant village in a 
short time. 

The Chief, for whom we had been waiting, 
came at last, with a band of musicians, attended 
by three of his eunuchs; and a servant at his side, 
who continually kept fanning him. He felt him- 
self greatly honoured that he was taken on board 
the steamer, while he ordered his canoe away. 
His music was not welcome, as we then had many 
sick persons on board. We lay at anchor near 
the ruins of Addu Kuddu, as that spot was first 
pitched upon for the new Settlement. I went on 
shore with Mr. Webb, who went a shooting, as 
the Guinea-fowls were flying wild in all direc- 
tions. The town appeared to have been large : it 
is now overgrown with bushes, so that it was 
impossible to go round it. It is fortified by a 


DYEING POTS AT ADDU KUDDU.

mud wall ; and a trench, in the form of a semi- 
circle, as the river fortified the front. From 
the number of large country pots buried in the 
ground (or may properly be called pot-ponds), 
each containing from fifty to one hundred gallons 
of water, it appears that the dyeing-trade was 
carried on here to a great extent. I counted fifty- 
five of the larger of these ponds, about six feet in 
the ground, and about three feet in diameter. 
The first tent veas pitched on the heap of potash- 
ashes, in the midst of the ruins. After we had 
wearied ourselves in disentangling ourselves from 
the thick bushes, we sat and rested awhile under 
a large monkey bread-tree, where it appears the 
elders of this town used to pass some of their 
time in pleasant conversation. We returned to 
our ship about sun-set. 

Sept.\2-. Lord's Day — This evening the Rev. 
T. Muller kept the Evening Service : our congre- 
gation was very small, owing to so many being 
taken ill at once. Still we have cause for thank- 
fulness that no other one has yet been removed 
by death in our ship. Dr. Marshall and Lieu- 
tenant Ellis are still very ill. 

Sept. 13 — The number of our sick greatly in- 
creased. We have now sixteen on the list, all

cases of fever : however, some of those who were 
first taken ill are nicely recovering. The two 
engineers are added to the list. 

We shifted our anchorage to the new spot 
pitched upon for the Settlement. I went this 
morning, accompanied by Mr. Waters the Purser, 
to a village at the foot of Sterling Mountain, to 
engage the Natives to get wood. As they were 
not aware of this, and as the villagers were not 
at home, they could not be got till to-morrow : 
they are Kakandas. I had an Haussa man in the 
village, who acted as Interpreter. 

Sept. 14 — 16 — It was no small difficulty to get 
those men whom we went to hire, because no 
present was first made to the Chief. After many 
shiftings and excuses, the bargain was made for 
500 cowries each man ; and then twenty-one men 
were sent to work. I was pleased to see them set 
to work cheerfully. One or two first gave the 
stroke, then the rest followed their example. Could 
plenty of wood have been got hereabout, they 
would have cut as much as we wanted. They 
worked only half the day, in consequence of rain ; 
but were paid, according to agreement. Being 
paid off in the evening, we gave the Headman to 
understand, that as we had paid his men liberally 


NATIVES CHARACTERIZED FOR HONESTY. 


299 


for their half day’s work, they ought to come 
readily to-morrow, in case we should want them 
again. He assured us of their readiness to come ; 
but in the morning, when I was requested by 
Captain Allen to call the men to work again, 
they could not be found. After I had waited for 
more than an hour, five unhealthy persons were 
brought, to go to work with our men, for 400 
cowries each ; and as I had no prospect of getting 
others, I refused them altogether, and returned 
to the ship. 

Sept. 17 — As I was busy purchasing for the 
Purser, who himself is now laid up with fever, 
I was robbed of some handkerchiefs, with which 
I was bartering ; for there were many people 
about me in the ship. I must say, that this peo- 
ple, generally speaking, are honest ; and I rather 
wonder that such acts of dishonesty were not 
more common with them, as they were exposed to 
many temptations on board the ship, where many 
things were lying about. We buy of them by 
certain measures of cowries, which we told them 
contained a certain number; but as they would 
take the trouble of counting thousands of 
cowries, placing them in heaps of one or two 
hundred, they very honestly returned the over- 


300 


NATIVE BARTERING FOR COWRIES. 


plus, which of course we never took from them. 
They count by fives, with the same quickness as 
we count by twos. Under a pretence of distrust, 
we counted some of these heaps of one or two 
hundred after them, which w'e always found to 
be quite right. If there should be found one dis- 
honest person among this people, that should not 
be the reason of charging the whole with guilt. 
For their articles they charge most extravagantly : 
for what they want 1000 cowries — the most rea- 
sonable price — they will at first ask 7 or 8000 ; 
and if one is not aware of this trick, he will very 
soon empty his ship-load of cowries for their 
canoe-cargo. So fond are this people of cowries, 
that when they would not take a handkerchief 
of five-pence value, they would readily take 150 
cowries, scarcely valuing two-pence farthing, at 
the rate of 860 cowries for a shilling. They love 
to give presents, because they expect to receive 
in return twice as much. They are very fond 
of looking-glasses. 

Sept. 18 — It being decided that the “Soudan” 
should return to the sea with the patients from 
on board all the ships, preparations were made for 
her immediate departure. A little time makes a 
great change. The little vessel in a short time 


RETURN OF THE “ SOUDAN ” TO THE SEA. 301 

was converted into an hospital, completely filled, 
fore and aft, with sick men. There was a great 
deal of dissatisfaction, low-spiritedness, and de- 
spondency, in the minds of many in connexion 
with the Expedition. I removed to the “ Albert” 
this evening. 

Sept. 19 : Lord's Day — About 1 o’clock to-day 
the “ Soudan,” now commanded by Lieutenant 
Fishbourne, having completed her cargo of in- 
valids, Captain B. Allen joined the “'Albert 
when she glided down the river with the current, 
and was immediately out of sight. I hope the 
Lord will be with them, and preserve their lives 
for future usefulness. The remaining part of this 
day was passed in suspense, whether the “Albert” 
and the “ Wilberforce” should go up, or also re- 
turn to the sea. The Rev. J. F. Schon preached 
this morning, on John xiv. 1, 2, 3. 

Sept. 20 — It being concluded that the “Wilber- 
force” should return to the sea with the fresh 
patients, all this day was again spent in making 
arrangements to that effect. 

Sept. 21 — Brother Thomas King left the 
“ Albert,” to remain at the Model Farm till our 
return. About 6 o’clock we got under weigh for 
the Quorra. After the changes, all was lively, and 


302 THE “albert” proceeds UP THE NIGER. 

every thing went on satisfactorily; for Captain 
Trotter, Captain B. Allen, and many other officers, 
prefer ascending the river as far as they can, to 
returning to the sea. We passed many villages 
buried under water. As the building of these 
huts costs the Natives very little labour, it seems 
they do not care much on what spot they build, if 
they can but inhabit them only for a short 
time. If this be owing to an unusual rise of the 
river, it must have been very great this year. 
About 5 o’clock we came to a town called Muye, 
on the right side of the river, a great part of 
which was completely under water: the inha- 
bitants had to wade from one house to another ; 
and some were seen in canoes, which served 
them for bridges in removing from one place 
to another. The houses are built in the same 
crowded manner as before mentioned ; with 
the exception, that many here are larger and 
higher. We had time to-day to collect a few 
words and sentences in the Haussa Language, 
from the Interpreter. 

We came to an anchor this evening a little 
above Muye, as the Natives were to bring us 
some wood. We took on board two men, inha- 
bitants of this town, from the Settlement, to 


VISIT TO GORI MARKET. 


303 


show us the villages. They place a very great 
confidence in the White Men, and were quite free 
in the ship. 

Sej)t. 22 — We came to an anchor at Gori 
market about 4 o’clock this afternoon. Captain 
Trotter, Dr. M'William, Dr. Stanger, Mr. Schdn, 
Mr. Brown, and myself, went on shore. The 
market was almost broken up when we got there. 
We were led to the house of the Chief; where the 
gentlemen of the Expedition were seated on mats, 
in the court-yard, about twelve feet by eight, 
and formed by five huts, in the shape of casks 
placed in an oval form. The Chief is about 
seventy years of age. He appeared to have been 
so frightened at the sudden appearance of the 
White Men, that he could not speak a word, and 
was thought to be deaf and dumb. There was 
one who acted as his Mouth [or speaker], who 
answered with gi’eat reserve every question put to 
him, especially such as related to the slave-trade. 
He denied knowing the number of slaves brought 
to market to-day, and their being the Attah’s 
subjects. The heat from the crowd, by which we 
were blocked up in this narrow spot, was suffo- 
cating : besides, the noise was so great, not only 
from the spectators, but from the Headmen them- 


304 


GORI MARKET. 


selves, that it was almost enough to deafen any 
one else but themselves. When one Headman 
calls out for silence, it takes him nearly five 
minutes to complete his palavering with the 
people; and when he is on the point of holding 
his tongue, he is never in want of three or four 
seconders, who also must scold the people ; so that 
instead of obtaining quietness, both the Headman 
and the people make more noise and create greater 
confusion than ever, till perhaps, after a quarter 
of an hour, there is silence for a time. 

The houses are not different. The streets, if they 
deserve the name, are so narrow, that in many 
places they are not wide enough to allow two per- 
sons to give passage to one another at meeting ; 
and they are so irregular, crooked, and puzzling, 
that after a stranger has changed his situation for 
a few minutes, he cannot find his way back with- 
out a guide. The streets are very muddy and 
filthy. It was very amusing to see our gallant 
Captain Trotter making his way, in the midst of 
the suffocating crowd, by suddenly opening his 
umbrella at the people; when, with shouts, and 
wonder at this novelty, they gave him passage 
for a time. After we had gone about the town, 
and visited the market, which was still crowded. 


ARTICLES OF TRADE. 


305 


we returned to the house of the Chief, when 
Captain Trotter invited him to come on board 
the next morning. 

The trade of dyeing, blue, is carried on here : 
plenty of country-cloths and raw cotton were 
seen in the market. The blacksmith was busy 
at his anvil, and the grinders of the Guinea-corn 
at the stones. In a word, this people are pro- 
vided with many necessary articles for their use, 
if they were only put in a better way of pre- 
paring them. The crowd followed us to the 
boat. As all the crew were not present, and we 
had to wait for them, the Natives came about 
the boat in great numbers ; offering for sale, 
even to Captain Trotter himself, smoked dried 
fish, limes, small bags made of grass, &c. As 
I could not bear this act of rudeness, which I well 
knew proceeded from ignorance, T was obliged 
to frighten them away from him by the boat- 
hook. — Captain Allen was taken ill to-day. 

Sept. 23 — Etshikung, the Chief of Gori, came 
on board this morning, according to promise. 
Yesterday, his spokesman denied their being the 
Attah’s subjects. At one time, he said that they 
were independent people of themselves ; and at 
another time, that they were subject to the 


306 


VISIT OF THE CHIEF OF GORI. 


Fulatahs, to whom they pay a yearly tax of 
360,000 cowries ; but, happily, the Attah’s son 
was on board to-day, and the Chief then readily 
acknowledged that he was the Attah’s subject. 
Notwithstanding the proclamation of the law 
which was made by the Prince among his father’s 
subjects, the Chief acknowledged that there were 
five slaves sold in the market yesterday*. 

An opportunity was offered to-day of showing 
the people, by example, the true design of the 
Expedition. A canoe, owned by a Native of 
Muye, came alongside from Egga, with three 
slaves and three colts on board. According to 
his statement, at one time he had been absent 
from home about twenty-one days, and at another 
time about three months ; and that he did not 
have an opportunity of hearing the law, as his 
father, whose was the canoe with the property, 
did not send a message to him about it. After 
a fair trial before the Prince, the Chief of 
Gori, and many others, the three slaves were 
liberated ; and the canoe with the cargo, was left 
to him, to excuse his ignorance of the law ; or 
otherwise the whole would have been forfeited. 

* The selling of the five slaves took place before the procla- 
mation. — J. F. S. 


LIBERATION OF SLAVES. 


307 


In the presence of the Prince, the Chief of Gori, 
and the owner of the slaves, a new suit of clothes 
was given to each of the slaves ; when their dirty 
and threadworn-out clothes were taken from 
them, and committed to the stream of the Niger, 
the rapid messenger ; by them to proclaim, to as 
many as might see them, the benevolent inten- 
tion of the Queen of Great Britain in sending 
out this Expedition, The poor slaves fell on 
their knees, in token of gratitude for their libe- 
ration. Two of the slaves are Yagba women : 
the Yagba is a dialect of Yaruba. They calculated 
their country to be about nine days’ journey to 
this place from the interior. The young man is 
a Bunu : the dialect between Nufi and Kakanda. 
One of the women was asked whether she w'ould 
prefer returning to her country, if there was an 
opportunity to do so. “ No,” said she ; “ there is 
no more safety in my home than it was before 
I was liberated.” She was first sold by her hus- 
band, through jealousy, three years ago, as it 
appears from her own statement ; and since 
that time she had been sold four times. She 
prefers remaining in the English Settlement. The 
other two were kidnapped. Ibodung is at jire- 
sent the limit of the Attah’s territory, although 


308 ARRIVAL AT BEZZANI. 

it extended before as far as Rabba*. The Prince 
was not well pleased, as his plea for the owners of 
the slaves was not listened to. The fright he 
took at Captain Trotter’s asking him to go with 
him as far as Egga and Rabba, and his sub- 
sequent impatience at hailing his canoe along- 
side, especially as we had gone beyond Ibodung, 
showed his dreadful fear of the Fulatahs. The 
people here are a mixture of Kakandas and pro- 
vincial Nufis, as they are called. 

Sept. 24 — Got under weigh about 6 o’clock this 
morning, and dropped anchor for a short time 
at a village called Bezzani, on the left side of 
the river, to buy wood. Went on shore with 
Mr. Schdn and Dr. Stanger. This village also 
was inundated, on account of which it was very 
filthy and muddy. Some of the houses had 
fallen in ; others were ready to fall ; and others 
were no better than pigsties, for their mud- 
diness. The best and driest was the blacksmith’s 
shop : it is roomy, and would have been com- 
fortable if kept clean. The inhabitants, about 
150, are in a miserable condition. Poor fellows! 
They are greatly impoverished by the Fulatahs, 
to whom they told us they pay a monthly tax : 


Very doubtful. — J. F. S. 


DREAD OF THE FDLATAHS. 


309 


and when they cannot afford to pay it, they 
must run away into the bush, to prevent their 
being taken away to be sold. They considered 
themselves already as slaves of the Fulatahs, 
because they are entirely under their power. 
They pointed out a village not far from theirs, 
on the right side of the river, where they said 
the Fulatahs were. 

There are many fetishes in this village, as in 
many others, consisting of cowries, palm-leaves, 
and other things, bedaubed with blood and chewed 
kola, and then covered up with calabashes. Their 
principal god is called “ Tshagiri.” They invoke 
it to prevent war and sickness. Got under weigh 
this evening, and came to anchor at a village on the 
right side of the river, called Kinami, to get wood. 

Sept. 25 — As the ship was wooding here, it was 
proposed by Captain Trotter that I should go to 
Egga, about four or five miles from Kinami, to 
tell the Chief of our approach to his town, and to 
invite him on board , as well as to collect every 
information I could. At one o’clock, having two 
Interpreters with me, one a Fulatah, the other a 
Nufi, we left the steamer, with the hope of getting 
to Egga in two or three hours, as we had to stem 
the current; but, contrary to my expectations, 


310 


OPPRESSION OF THE FULATAHS. 


when we got to Kinami, the village of our canoe- 
men, they refused to go any further — their heart 
failed them. They consulted the Chief; but he 
could not sanction their taking us to Egga, till he 
had also consulted two other Chiefs ; one living 
near Egga, and the other on the opposite side of 
the river. The fears of this people plainly showed 
us in what state of oppression they are under to 
the Fulatahs. The. Chief said that he was quite 
sure that the men who were to take us to Egga 
would not return ; that he considered them al- 
ready as slaves ; and that his town would be 
burnt by the Fulatahs, and his people taken in 
slavery, as soon as the steamer leaves the river, 
because the Fulatahs would surely consider them as 
the betrayers of Egga into the hands of the White 
Men. Notwithstanding all our persuasions, that 
we were not going to Egga as enemies, but as 
friends ; that the Expedition was sent out on pur- 
pose to persuade all the Chiefs of Africa to do away 
with war and slave-trade ; to make treaties with 
them to that effect ; and that his men who were 
to take us to Egga would surely return with us ; 
his fear of the Fulatahs was so great, and the ap- 
prehensions of what would follow were so strong, 
that he said, in conclusion, that if we would 


FRIENDLY RECEPTION AT KINAMI. 


311 


persuade him to send his men to take us to Egga, 
we had better take him, his children, and his 
people, and throw them all into the water, 
rather than expose them to a greater calamity. 
It was about two hours before the messengers 
returned from the Chief near Egga. He wished 
first to see me, before he gave his opinion about 
our being taken to Egga. As we had been in the 
village already three hours, spending the time 
in nothing else but in persuasion, I thought it 
better to apprise Captain Trotter of those three 
hours’ employment, before I proceeded any fur- 
ther. He was very sorry that I could not get to 
Egga ; and as there was no other opportunity, the 
attempt was given up for the day. 

The Chief and the people of Kinami were very 
glad to hear of the design of the Expedition : they 
could scarcely believe all the news that we told 
them, about many of their country-people’s wish 
to return to their country. They were quite glad 
to hear that the White Men were come to do 
them good. They said, that if they should be 
much oppressed in future, they would remove 
to the White Men’s settlement at Addu Kuddu ; 
and heartily expressed their wishes for this 
good work.

LECTURE TO THE KROOMEN. 


Sept. 26: Lord's Day — Captain Trotter re- 
quested me to give the Kroomen, and some others 
who do not understand our Church Service, a 
Lecture on the principles of the Christian Reli- 
gion ; which I did, catechetically, from John iii. 
1 to 20. I hope by this means some may be led 
to Christ, the Lamb of God.

Sept. 27 — To-day we succeeded in getting a 
canoe to take us to Egga. We started from the 
ship at ten minutes past 1 1 o’clock, and arrived at 
Egga at nearly ten minutes past 1 o’clock. As 
our dresses were different from those of the Na- 
tives, we soon attracted their attention as cur 
canoe approached the town, and became objects 
of curiosity to the spectators on shore. On land- 
ing, many youngsters ran away, being afraid of 
us. I left the Fulatah Interpreter in the canoe, 

p 


314

to keep watch over our things ; and took the Nufi 
Interpreter with me. We were first led to a 
man’s house whose name is Aruna — he is consi- 
dered as a gentleman in the town — who would give 
us directions. Aruna led us to two elderly men, 
Legamah and Lusah. After I had briefly ex- 
plained to them the objects of my coming, they 
introduced me to Rogang the Chief. After a long 
walk through narrow and crooked streets, we 
came to Rogang’s palace ; and in about half an 
hour’s time he made his appearance. After a 
hearty salutation, by shaking of hands in the 
name of the King of the ship, and telling him 
the reasons why the ship could not then come 
near, I commenced my message — That the Queen 
of the country called Great Britain has sent the 
King of the ship to all the Chiefs of Africa, 
to make treaties with them to give up war and 
the slave-trade — to encourage all their people 
to the cultivation of the soil — and to mind all 
that the White People say to them ; as they 
wish to teach them many things, and particu- 
larly the Book which God gives, which will make 
all men happy. I added, likewise, that there are 
many Nufi, Haussa, and Yaruba people in the 
White-Men’s country, who have been liberated 


INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF OF EGGA. 


315 


from the Portuguese and Spanish slave-ships ; 
that they are now living like White Men ; that 
they pray to God, and learn His book ; and con- 
sequently are living a happier life than when 
they were in their own country, and much better 
off than their country -people are at present. 
To this many of them said, that they could judge 
of their happy state merely by my appearance. 
I added, moreover, that our country people in 
White-Men’s country had written a Letter to the 
Queen who lives in Great Britain, expressing 
their wish to return to their country, if she Avould 
send White Men along with them ; but the Queen, 
who loves us all as her children, told them to 
stop till she had first sent her ships to the Chiefs 
of Africa, to persuade them to give up war and 
the slave-trade ; and if they consented to her pro- 
posals, she would readily grant the request of our 
country-people. The ships are now come; the 
King of Ibo, and the Attah, king of Igalla, had con- 
sented to all that the Queen of Great Britain sent 
the King of the ship to say to them ; and that if 
all the other Chiefs would consent to do the same, 
they would soon see their people, whom they had 
lost for many years and supposed to have been 
dead, come up in this river with their property, 

p 2 


316 FRIENDLY RECEPTION. 

and some even in their own ships, to carry on 
legitimate trade with them, as they do in the 
White-Men’s country. Rogang, the Chief, was 
very much pleased to hear this good news ; but 
as he is only a Chief under Sumoh Zakki — pro- 
perly Sumo Sariki — the Fulatah king of Rabba, 
he deferred giving me an answer to the principal 
subjects of my message till he had called me to 
his court-yard, admitting no more than about 
five of his friends besides Legamah and Lusah, 
when he ordered the gate to be shut. He said 
that he was very glad to hear all that the White 
Men have come to do : and as for his part, he 
would have very readily and gladly done as they 
wish, had it been in his power; but that before 
any thing of the kind could be done, it must be 
referred to Sumo Sariki at Rabba, as whatever 
he says is the law. He answered, very readily, 
many questions put to him ; but was exceedingly 
shy in answering those which related to the 
Fulatahs. He frequently referred me to Rabba, 
where he said we could get all the information 
about them much better. He received the pre- 
sents which I brought him fi’om the Captain with 
gratitude. These consisted of an Arabic Bible, 
which I first gave him, assuring him, that if he

and his people would but mind what this book 
teaches, it would bring peace into the country, 
and make them a happy people. I then gave 
him the remainder of the presents ; which were, 
two yards of fine scarlet cloth, a looking-glass 
with gilt frame, and a case of knives, razors, &c. 
He presented me with some Gora-nuts, and coun- 
try beer made of Guinea-corn, of which I drank 
very little. It was about 5 o’clock before we 
came to a conclusion ; when we returned to 
Aruna’s house, where we took up our lodging. 

Contrary to my expectation, I met here many 
Yaruba People who have come from the interior; 
some only twelve days ago ; and others altogether 
reside here on purpose to trade. I made inquiry 
respecting the interior ; when I received the 
following information. War is still carried on. 
Katunga, the capital of Yaruba, was deserted after 
the death of Abiohdung, the king of Yaruba. 
Atiba, the heir to the throne, removed the seat of 
government from Katunga to Aggoh, because the 
former was too near to Illorrin ; while Oluyorle, 
the commander of the soldiers, or head warrior, 
took his seat at Kishi, otherwise called Ajanna, 
in confederacy with Ibariba, a people on the 
border of Yaruba, nearly speaking the same Ian-

guage. Tliey have since had three battles ; one 
at Igbodo, about seven years ago ; and another at 
Oshogbo, about three years ago ; in both of which 
Illorrin, headed by Sitah, a Fulatah, was defeated 
with great loss. They have stripped Illorrin of 
all its dependencies. The last battle took place 
at Wodikura, when Atiba made sure of complete 
victory over Sitah, the head of the Fulatahs; 
but Atiba lost the battle at this time: his con- 
federate Eledueh, the king of Ibariba, and his 
brother Oluewu, being killed, the battle was broken 
up. They are still harassing the people of Illor- 
rin, catching them wherever they are met with. 
Last year they were reduced to great extremity, 
being closely confined by Atiba ; in consequence 
of which they suffered much from scarcity of 
food. Many of the people of Illorrin, on account 
of this, found their way here or to Rabba, they 
being Mahomedans, on the side of the Fulatahs. 

The principal towns in the country of Yaruba 
are the following : — Aggoh, Kishi, Ibaddang, 
Issehin, Shakki, Igboho, Ijaye, Iwo, Eddeh, Os- 
hogbo, Rlah, Awaye, and Wahsimi, belonging to 
Atiba; and Illorrin, belonging to the Fulatahs.

people did not understand Nufi, so as to know 
of what I was talking with Rogang through the 
Interpreter, I took the opportunity of their visit 
to tell them every thing concerning our coming, 
and concerning all the Nufi, Haussa, and Yaruba 
people in the country from which I came. When 
some expressed their wish that war and the 
slave-trade, with all the troubles in connexion 
with them, would cease ; others, who were in con- 
federacy with theFiilatahs, expressed the impossi- 
bility of putting an end to war and the slave- 
trade, except God, who sanctioned war and the 
slave-trade, should put an end to them Himself. 
As these men were Mahomedans, and perceiving 
that they were about to refer me to the Koran — 
for which they have a superstitious regard, be- 
cause it sanctioned war and slavery — I waived all 
disputes whether God sanctioned the slave-trade 
or not ; but simply told them, that if any body 
had told me this day last year, when I was in 
White-Men’s country, that I should be at Egga 
to-day — should speak, eat, and drink with them — 
I would not have believed it ; and that the same 
God who had brought us thus far was able to do 
greater things than those which we had seen and 
witnessed already. Against this they had nothing 


320 


VISIT OF ARABS FROM IIXORRIN. 


to say, or else they would limit the power of God 
whom they profess to worship. The people left 
our lodging about 7 o’clock in the evening, with 
a promise to return in the morning. 

Two Arabs visited me to-day; both of them 
from Illorrin, where they reside. They came 
here on purpose to trade. As there were many 
people about me, they did not stop long. 

Sept. 28 — The Arabs of yesterday repeated their 
visit this morning. I thought it was time, then, to 
tell them of the objects of the Steamer’s coming; 
for they thought she was a trading-ship. Their 
slave, a Yaruba man, who speaks Haussa, was my 
Interpreter, as they also speak Haussa. When they 
heard that the Expedition was against the slave- 
trade, they manifested a very great indifference. 
The report of the three slaves who were liberated 
at Gori market had reached here some days 
before us ; and those who earned their living by 
this trade are prejudiced against us. The Arabs 
would have been glad to go on board the ship, to 
see her, if she had been near; but she was still 
lying at Kinami. Their Yaruba slave informed 
me, on inquiry, that the Arabs very often carry 
away many slaves from hence and Rabba, across 
the Desert ; some owning forty, fifty, and some a

hundred, each one according to his circumstances. 
I had the chance of seeing the Arabs at their 
lodging : they were putting their merchandise 
in order, and reckoning their cowries. When 
I saw among their goods a small piece of hand- 
kerchief which I knew well to be of the same 
pattern as we had bartered for yams down the 
river, as well as some satin stripe of English 
manufacture, I said, “ This is English cloth 
which they repeated, laughing, “ English cloth ! 
English cloth!” I asked where they got them: 
they said from Kakanda. 

Two Fulatahs sent their compliments to me 
yesterday by the Fulatah Interpreter, to tell me 
that they wished to go on board with me, when 
I returned. I was very glad to hear this ; but as 
I was not ready to return on board yesterday, 
I promised to take them with me this morning. 
To-day they sent messages again and again, to 
know whether I was ready to go or not ; as they 
were prevented by my promise from going with 
the troops, which went yesterday to supply the 
place of those who returned from the Kakanda 
war; and that they were very anxious for my 
taking them on board soon, that they might go 
to their war-men at Kakanda. As I was still 
p 3 


322 INQUIRIES OF FULATAHS RESPECTING SLAVES. 

not ready, and had not ascertained who these 
Fulatahs were, I sent the Interpreter to call them 
to me, as I should see and know who they were, 
before I sent them on board with him. He was 
absent about an hour and a half, when I set out 
in quest of him. I found him in the court-yard 
of Obadanwaki, a Yaruba man, the head of the 
war-men of this place. He was dressed in a tur- 
ban, as he is now called a Fulatah. This man 
speaks Haussa and Nufi with great fluency; and 
appears to understand the Fulatah Language but 
very little, if at all. They were questioning the In- 
terpreter very closely about the three slaves who 
were liberated at Gori market. As they were 
speaking of the matter, through an Interpreter 
who speaks Fulatah and Haussa, to Obandawaki, 
and perceiving that they were confused at my 
unexpected coming, I stood there looking at them 
with smiles, while their eyes were sparkling with 
rage and vexation at our proceedings, because 
the owner of the slaves pays tax to the Fulatahs. 
They appeared to think that the Interpreter had 
given them some hopes of getting the slaves from 
Captain Trotter; but the Interpreter denied it. 
As he is a Mahomedan, and his character is 
somewhat doubtful, I was sorry that I brought 


THEIR VEXATION AT THE RELEASE OF THE SLAVES. 323 

him with me. When they had finished their 
discourse, I said to Obandawaki, in the Yaruba 
Language, that whatever the Interpreter had 
said to them was not to be taken as correct; 
that if he wished to know any thing about our 
coming and proceedings, he should come to me. 
I told them that the White Men had not wronged 
any of them ; — that the man from whom the slaves 
were taken belonged to the Attah’s territory ; — 
and that the trial took place on board our ship, 
in the presence of the Attah’s son, the Prince 
who was sent to proclaim the law among his 
father’s subjects. I added, that if any one wanted 
any further information, as I was ready to go on 
board, I would take him off with me, especially as 
the slaves were still on board our ship. One 
in the assembly was so angry, that he spoke 
abusive language against the Attah : he said, 
moreover, that such laws should not proceed 
higher up the river than the Attah’s territory ; 
after which they broke up with vexation. The 
man spoke in Nufi. When the Nufi Interpreter 
was about to tell me what the man had said, 
Obandawaki wished him to tell me that the man 
was only jesting. I afterward told Obandawaki 
every thing concerning the Expedition, and our

country people in White-Men’s country. He 
appeared to be struck at hearing the news, which 
I hope he will think well on. In the mean time, 
our ship has come up opposite Egga, about two 
miles and a half off, wooding. I got ready about 
three hours after; but the Fulatahs, who had 
been so anxious to go on board, never made their 
appearance. I invited Rogang the Chief, and the 
Headmen Legamah and Lusah, and my landlord 
Aruna, to come on board with me ; telling them 
that the King of the ship would be glad to see 
them ; but they all refused, being afraid, lest they 
should be called in question by the Fulatah king 
at Rabba after our departure. 

Yesterday evening some soldiers returned from 
the war with the Bunu, a people between Kakanda 
and Null : some were taken captive, and others 
driven into the bush or to the opposite side of 
the river. It is said by a Fulatah slave in this 
place — for from such we received much true 
information, as the masters or headmen were 
always shy — that there were sent to Rabba last 
month, 4000 Bunu and Kakanda slaves, 1000 black 
cattle, and 1000 measures of cowries, being 
plunder taken from the countries of these people. 
The taxes are collected by the Fulatahs, which 


INQUIRIES INTO THE PLUNDERING OF THE BUNUS. 325 

they send to Rabba: they are very oppressive. 
They took away yesterday from a woman an 
ivory ornament, which some people would not sell 
under 2000 or 3000 cowries; but as it was de- 
manded by the common oppressors of her country, 
she readily let it go. The Fulatah Interpreter 
succeeded in getting this ivory ornament, to show 
Captain Trotter. This is not the only case ; for 
all the people bitterly complain of the Fulatahs, 
on account of oppressions of this kind : their 
goats, sheep, and cloths, are not excepted. 

About 5 o'clock this evening I returned to 
the ship. Mr. Schon and Dr. Stanger went on 
shore ; but they did not meet me. — A sailor was 
buried to-day. 

Sept. 29 — To-day, Captain Trotter wished me 
to go to Egga, with additional inquiries ; as well 
as to prove and correct those of yesterday, by 
cross questions. I went along with Mr. Schon 
and Dr. Stanger. They went to the Chief; and 
I took another way. My informers, perceiving 
I was getting too particular about certain names 
and persons in connexion with the Fulatahs, with- 
drew ; and deferred giving me any more answers 
till the evening, if I should not go off; for they 
knew who were about them. As I mentioned the 


326 INQUIRIES INTO THE PLUNDERING OF THE BUNUS. 

name of Usumani Jahki, a Fulatah, who all the 
time was sitting in the room as a mere spectator, 
immediately asked me to show him the paper 
I had in my hand. I made him to understand, 
that, as he could not read it, it was of no use to 
him : however, he expressed his wish to see it ; 
but I refused to give it to him. About two or 
three minutes after, he and two others went out 
of the room. I tried to get my inquiries an- 
swered by Aruna, my landlord, in a private room ; 
taking care to let nobody else in but his Yaruba 
slave, in whom he trusted, as my Interpreter : 
but he also was afraid to go on, as he found I was 
particular about the Fulatahs ; — so I returned on 
board with very little information. 

Sept. 30 — I was supplied with additional in- 
quiries; and received orders to take as many 
cowries as I wanted, to reward my informers. 
I was very fortunate to get all my inquiries 
answered to-day, in the private house of Rogang 
the Cliief : there were five of his friends with him. 
As I perceived that writing before them excited 
some fears, I put all my papers by, and com- 
menced conversation with them as a mere visiter. 
I had the Nufi Interpreter with me. I ordered 
some cowries to be counted, in heaps of fifties and 


rogang’s fear of the fulatahs. 


327 


hundreds, before them. At seeing this, they were 
put off their guard, even the Chief himself not 
excepted ; when they gave answers to my ques- 
tions very readily, and gave me much information 
besides. After I had gained my point, I gave 
some cowries to each of them, paying regard to 
their age, as the eldest should receive the most ; 
for they consider elder persons as superior, under 
whatever circumstances they may be. After this, 
we parted with good wishes. 

As I wished to buy some articles for curiosity, 
and the people were generally so much about me 
that I could scarcely move, I sent the Interpreter 
to ask Rogang if he would permit me to buy what 
I wanted, in his porch — an entrance leading from 
the street to his yard — where only a few persons 
might be admitted. He sent word back, that he 
would not have had the least objection to do so ; 
but he was afraid lest the Fulatahs should say 
that he had given his house for a market to the 
White Men. In private conversation, Rogang 
asked the Interpreter if he had rum to sell — 
a bottle or two of which he would be very glad to 
buy. He said that the rum which comes to them 
from the coast is almost converted to water ; yet 
they paid 4 or 5000 cowries for a bottle. 


328 A NUFI MAHOMEDAN INDULGES IN SPIRITS. 

My Yaruba visiters, being Mahomedans, were 
surprised to see me, as they considered me an 
English Mallam, drink country-beer made of 
Guinea-corn— a stuff which is held in great ab- 
horrence by the Mahomedans ; yet they think it 
not contrary to the precepts of the Koran to 
drink any kind of spirits. When they came on 
board, they asked me to give them some rum to 
drink, if it were but a small drop. As I took no 
grog, I told them that I had none. At leaving, my 
Mahomedan friends did not forget, among many 
other things, to remind me, when we came this 
way again, not to forget to bring plenty of dollars, 
and a large quantity of rum. 

I have just one account of this kind to relate:* — 
As we were lying near the village of the refugees 
on the hill, a Nufi Mahomedan, who was return- 
ing from Keri market, came alongside. He spoke 
a little Haussa. As he made himself very friendly, 
Mr. Waters, the Purser, treated him and his wife 
with great kindness. He took them down to the 
gun-room ; gave them biscuits, and set a de- 
canter of wine before them. Whether the woman 
had taken any wine before I came in or not, 

* The circumstance about to be related happened in the 
“ Soudan,” a fortnight before this period.

329 


I could not tell. Her husband placed the biscuits 
before her, and he himself took possession of the 
wine. He had taken some before I went in. As 
it was time for them to go, he was desired to do 
so. He then took a glass of wine, and asked me 
if Mr.Waters could not supply him with some for 
his journey. He was answered in the negative. 
He again took another glass. When he was upon 
the point of rising, still squeezing the decanter as 
tight as he could, he took another glass. Mr.Waters 
and the woman had gone up : and I was upon 
the ladder, thinking, as there was no person in 
the cabin, he would not stay any longer. When 
he was rising, he took another glass. As I was 
going up, the servant, who stood on the ladder, 
said, “ Mr. Crowther, he is taking another glass : 
he will finish the wine.” After he had taken 
this, he came up to us. — It is difficult to say 
in what state of mind this man left the cabin, 
whether with gratitude and satisfaction for the 
kind treatment, which he greatly abused, or with 
great regret that he could not get a supply of 
wine for his journey. He said that be belonged 
to Kattam Karifi, a village on the Niger. He was 
told to go and get plenty of wood ready against 
our coming : so he left the ship that evening,

quite warm at his canoe crew. He had two 
slaves on board. Early the next morning, con- 
trary to our expectation, this man was seen 
alongside, and he soon found his way into the 
ship : but to-day he met with an ill reception, as 
he was not allowed to stay on board for five 
minutes. 

Oct. 3 : Lord's Day — Captain Trotter, on whom 
all the duties of the ship fell since all the ofiicers 
have been taken ill, with the exception of one, 
was very unwell to-day. He had not been quite 
well some time before ; still he was making pre- 
parations for Rabba. Captain Allen, for whose 
recovery he has been anxiously looking forward, 
is still very ill. To-day I gave the men a Lecture 
on Matt. ii. — Another sailor was buried to-day. 

Oct. 4 — Had several persons on board to-day 
from Egga, to sell their articles. Three of my 
Yaruba visiters were among them. The eldest 
and foremost of them was he who expressed the 
impossibility of putting an end to war and the 
slave-trade, except God, who sanctioned war and 
the slave-trade, should put an end to them Him- 
self. After they had walked about the ship, and 
seen the engine-room, they were astonished, and 
said that we were living in a town rather than

a canoe, comparing it with theirs. I showed 
them the three slaves who were liberated at 
Gori market : they said that the proceedings of 
the White Men were right and good. I asked 
them whether was it better, to trade in goods, 
as they were then doing, when all were lively and 
cheerful ; or to trade in slaves, when the buyer 
and seller rejoice, and the purchased, our fellow- 
creatures, enshackled, sit mournfully : they said, 
they preferred legitimate trade. They were very 
anxious to do something for me, as I have been 
so friendly with them. They desired me to tell 
them what kind of country cloth I should like, 
that they might get it ready against our coming 
this way again. I remembered then that I had an 
Arabic Testament in my trunk : this I presented 
to the eldest, as he said that his brother 
could read Arabic well. I told them that what 
I wanted them to do for me, was, to mind what 
that Book, which I believe came from God, tells 
them ; and also to report, at their return to the 
interior, every thing that I had told them con- 
cerning the coming of the White Men ; — all which 
they promised to do. 

Captain Trotter was confined to bed part of this 
morning : he passed the remainder of the day in 


332 


ILLNESS OF CAPTAIN TROTTER. 


making inquiries from the people on board : — it 
was too much for him in that state of health. There 
remaining but one officer to carry on the ship 
duties, the last engineer who brought the ship 
to Egga being also taken ill, it was thought time 
to return, as it was impossible to go up. This 
evening we dropped down to Kinami, without 
steam. 

Oct. 5 — To-day, Captain Trotter was altogether 
laid up, beside his valuable friend Captain B. Allen, 
for whose recovery he has been looking out a 
long time. The ship duties now fell on Mr.Willie, 
Mate, the only remaining officer not on the sick 
list. Dr. Stanger takes a part in the engine- 
room, to relieve Mr. Brown, the third engineer, 
who is convalescent. 

Oct. 6 — We commenced dropping down from 
Kinami as well as we could ; sometimes with 
steam, and sometimes without. 

Oct. 7 — About 10 o’clock in the night, the 
Captain’s clerk, who has been raving for some 
days, threw himself overboard from a port-hole 
in the Captain’s cabin. Providentially he was 
caught by a Black sailor, who immediately flew 
overboard in pursuit of him. A boat was soon 
sent after them; and they were safely brought 


ARRIVAL AT THE CONFLUENCE. 


333 


on board ; yet not without great difficulty, as he 
attempted to escape from him many times. He 
was wonderfully saved. This circumstance ex- 
cited all the sick on board, and was calculated to 
make them worse. After he was secured in a 
hammock, it was thought necessary to take the 
precaution of securing the second engineer also 
for the night. This took place a little below 
Muye, where we were lying at anchor. 

Ocf.8 — About 10 o’clock a. m., a little after we 
had got under weigh, the engineer, who was this 
morning relieved of his yesterday’s confinement, 
sought for an opportunity, when no notice was 
taken of him, and jumped overboard : two boats, 
which were examining the soundings, went imme- 
diately in search of him ; but he had gone down, 
and could not be found. This having twice oc- 
curred, it increased the distressful state of the 
ship, and cast gloominess upon the brightest 
prospects. 

Oct. 9 — This morning we got to the Confluence, 
after many struggles over banks and shoals. We 
did not find the gentlemen at the Model Farm in 
a better condition than our own officers ; for they 
were all three taken ill almost the same week we 
left them. Captain Allen, for whose recovery we 


334 


ARRIVAL AT IDDAH. 


have been entertaining cheering hopes, was so 
low to-day, that, according to human judgment, 
there was no hope of his living till the next hour. 
I kept up with him till 12 o’clock at night: he 
was still very low. Dr. M‘ William has had charge 
of the ship the last day or two; Mr. Willie being 
laid up with fever. 

Oct. 10 : Lord's Day — That Captain Allen was 
still alive, and better, was a mysterious work 
of the Lord. Necessary arrangements having 
been made with the Coloured men who were left 
at the Model Farm — Thomas King being put in 
charge — the three sick gentlemen were taken on 
board ; when we got under weigh at half past 
10 o’clock A.M. for Iddah; where we succeeded in 
getting to very nicely at six in the evening, and 
dropped anchor for the night. 

Oct.ll — As a message to the Attah was not 
advisable at this time, on account of his majesty’s 
unpleasant custom of detaining messengers, none 
was sent to him ; for the present state of the ship 
could not admit of an unnecessary delay. As 
I was very anxious to know what the Attah thought 
of the three slaves who were taken from his 
people at Gori market, I have been looking out 
for the coming of his messengers since this 


ARRIVAL AT IBO. 


335 


morning. Just about ten minutes before we got 
under weigh, the Prince and the Mall am came 
off. When Dr. M° William asked the Prince if 
his father approved of their proceedings in libe- 
rating the three slaves, I was glad to hear him de- 
clare his approbation. The Mallam promised to 
take a bullock and some vegetables to our men at 
the Model Farm, when he goes to Keri market. 

Oct. 12 — About 5 o’clock this afternoon we an- 
chored off Aboh, or Ibo. Mr. Schdn, Mr. Brown, 
and myself, went on shore. We could see but 
very little of the town, as it was getting dark 
before we got there. The water has risen here 
a good deal since we left, while it has very much 
fallen in the upper part. Many houses which 
were then in mud at Aboh are now nearly under 
water. The Natives have to make a kind of scaf- 
fold attached to the outside of their huts, on which 
they sit to enjoy themselves in the evening, or 
expose to sale their fruits to the buyers who wade 
thither ; or, if the water be too deep, they come 
in their canoes. We were kindly received by 
king Obi. The Interpreter who was left here by 
the “ Soudan," on her way to the sea, was very 
well treated by him. Obi is very anxious that the 
White Men should come and build the house for 


336 obi’s visit to captains trotter and ALLEN. 

which they asked him a place, as he has found a 
good spot of land for them, for that purpose. He 
wished also that a large trading ship should be 
sent to deal with his people ; and desires also to 
have Teachers among them. Before the Steamer 
lay at anchor, about thirty canoes had come off 
to meet her, in order to sell their fruits and 
country cloths, &c. They are now getting very 
familiar with us, and are very noisy people. 

Oct. 13 — Mr, Kingdon, one of the gentlemen 
taken on board from the Model Farm, having 
died on Tuesday night, was buried this morning 
by the Rev. J. F. Schiin. 

King Obi got all the things that were wanted, 
with readiness : he himself came on board to see 
his honourable friends. Captain Trotter and Cap- 
tain B. Allen, who wei’e both very sick, and he 
was sorry to see them so : still, he could not help 
asking for many things which he wanted, when 
he was told to wait till Captain Trotter should 
return. He brought one of his Tshukus with 
him. When Captain Trotter was told that that 
was one of his gods, he gave Obi a Bible instead 
of it, and told the king that his god was of no use. 
— He asked for one of Captain Trotter’s chairs, 
which was given him. 


ARRIVAI, AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER. 


337 


We got under weigh about 10 o’clock; and met 
the “ Ethiope,” Captain Beecroft, about 3 o’clock : 
he was coming to see after the “Albert.” Pain- 
ful intelligence was brought by him of the deaths 
of eight of the sick friends who were sent to 
the sea ; among whom were Dr. Marshall, Dr. 
Coleman, the Assistant Surgeon, and Mr. Waters, 
the Purser of the “ Soudan.” 

Oct. 14 — Being supplied with the first engineer 
of the “ Ethiope,” we started from our anchorage 
with her at 7 o’clock this morning, and reached 
the mouth of the river at 6 in the evening. The 
men were transported with joy at seeing the 
salt-water again; and many of the sick seemed 
revived in their hammocks merely at the sight. 
Surely the Lord has been with us, and delivered 
us from many dangers, both seen and unseen ! 
When we left the Confluence, we had many rocks, 
which were partially covered with water, to avoid, 
and from Iddah to Ibo many shallow parts of the 
river to shun ; and Mr. Brown, a Native of Cape- 
Coast Castle, who has some knowledge of this 
river, has assisted Dr. M^William in piloting the 
ship with safety. 

Oct. 1 5 — The rigging of the ship was put to 
rights, to fit her for the sea ; while the men were 
cutting wood. 

Q

ARRIVAL AT- FERNANDO PO. 


Cct. 16 — Captain Beecroft himself came on 
board the “ Albert when we got under weigh, 
about 6 o’clock this morning, and crossed the Bar 
in calm water very safely, and the Steamer was 
making her way to Fernando Po at a good rate. 
The “ Soudan,” commanded by Lieut. Strange, 
was met at the Bar, going up the Niger to meet 
the “ Albert.” She returned to Fernando Po with 
us. This night a marine, called Cole, died ; and 
Mr. Willie, the only officer who had held out 
longer than the rest, is now very dangerously ill. 

Oct. 17 : Lord' s Day — At half past 7 o’clock this 
morning the body of Cole, the marine, was com- 
mitted to the deep by the Rev. J. F. Schdn, till 
the sea shall give up the dead which are in it. 
We anchored off Fernando Po about 4 o’clock in 
the afternoon. 

Oct. 18 — To-day all the sick were landed, and 
lodged in different private houses ; hoping, by the 
blessing of God, the change may prove beneficial 
to their recovery. Captain Trotter has been im- 
proving since last Saturday, and I hope he will 
soon be restored to his wonted health. 

Oct. 19 — Mr. Willie died last night, and was 
buried to-day by Mr. Schdn. The Purser’s Steward 
died also a few days after. 


DEATH OF CAPTAIN B. ALLEN. 


339 


Ocl. 25 — Captain B. Allen breathed his last at 
10 o’clock this morning; when Captain Trotter, 
with tears, closed the eyes of his departed friend. 
In him he lost an active companion ; and his 
ship’s company a kind and liumane Captain. He 
was buried in the evening, by the Rev. J. F. Schbn ; 
when liis corpse was followed to the grave-yard 
by all the ship’s company who were able, the 
the Agent and many of the inhabitants of this 
place — lamented by all. 

Since the death of Captain B. Allen, to the 
7th of November, three officers and a marine have 
been buried. 

Oct. 28 — Many persons brought their children, 
to have their names written down, in order to 
their being baptized. Some adults also aj)plicd 
for baptism. As their application gave us an 
opportunity of doing some good among them, 
we embraced the same. In the evening I com- 
menced keeping a Class of Candidates of seven 
persons ; and on the 1.3th of November the number 
was increased to thirty-six. The Meeting was 
held at 7 o’clock every evening, in our liouse. 
The foundation of my discourse was Baptism, 
I endeavoured to exphain to them what that Ordi- 
nance is ; and what is required of us, before wo

are admitted by it, as members, into Christ’s 
Church. I chose the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, 
and the Ten Commandments, for my texts. Their 
regular attendance, and their attention to what 
I expounded to them, pleased me well ; and I was 
led to think that they are truly hungering and 
thirsting after righteousness. There was a great 
hindrance in the way of our applicants ; for many 
of them have been living together for years 
without being married : however, I think this is 
chiefly owing to their want of opportunity, there 
being no Clergyman in the island. Two Bap- 
tist Missionaries arrived here in January last. 
Since that time about fifty have been married. 
Besides, as our residence in the island was very 
short, and consequently could know but very little 
of this people, Mr. Schon could not conscientiously 
baptize them. He hoped the Lord will provide 
them means whereby they will be made more to 
understand the nature of the solemn vow, pro- 
mise, and profession which they, he feared, were 
ignorantly wishing to make to God. Among our 
candidates w’as a young woman, a native of the 
Island, living with a woman a settler, one of the 
applicants : she resolves not to return to her 
country- people again, to live in the way they do.

Although I cannot think that she knew what she 
came for, or what baptism is, yet her disposition 
to follow the good examples of others is worthy 
of our notice. 

Cc<. 31: Lord's Day — After Service, the Rev. 
J. F. Schon baptized forty-four children ; and on 
the 7th of November he baptized thirty more. 

The Natives of Fernando Po, generally called 
Rubies, are the most singular people I have ever 
met with. They will have nothing to do with 
clothes. They are quite satisBed with their 
grass leaves, beads, fowls’ feathers, and some hits 
of monkey’s skin, which they tie about their legs, 
waists, arms, necks, and other parts of their naked 
bodies. The rich among them have, in addi- 
tion to these, some lumps of fat sewed uj), exactly 
like large sausages, on their necks, and a very 
large lump of red clay fastened to the hair of their 
heads on the back part; while the whole hair and 
their bodies are rubbed over with the same stufi' 
mixed with palm-oil. As fat is a very rare 
article among them, the rich alone are able to 
procure it, to use for rubbing instead of palm-oil, 
and to wear in the manner above mentioned. 
They do not wash any more when they come to 
a certain age; they only keep continually to use 


342 


NATIVES OF FERNANDO PO. 


the red clay and grease. On account of this 
stupid and dirty custom, as it may be expected, 
their stench is intolerable. Guns, powder, shot, 
pipes and tobacco, and knives, are the articles 
which they chiefly want in exchange for their 
yams, fowls, palm-wine and oil. They are very 
fond of rum. Sheep and dogs are very valuable 
creatures which they eagerly seek after. A good 
sheep or dog will fetch about 4/. worth of palm- 
oil in exchange; and perhaps five or six pounds of 
lard will not fetch much less. They are very 
fond of hunting snakes. When the husband is 
digging a hole where there is a snake, the wife 
stands with a stick in her hand, watching to give 
it a blow when it comes out. After the flesh is 
eaten, the vertebrae serve for necklaces. As is 
the character of many other nations of Africa, so 
it is with this people : they love to give presents, 
because they expect to receive more ; and not only 
so, they will never be pleased with whatever you 
may give them, if you cannot give them the 
thing which they at that time are very anxious 
to have. Their peculiar straw hats, which are 
always studded with feathers, horns, and many 
other fanciful things, and their rope-chain, are 
very neatly plaited; which show that this sin- 


SCHOOL AT FERNANDO PO. 


343 


gular people are not totally devoid of ingenuity. 
The sin of adultery is very severely punished 
among them. Whatever person is guilty of it 
has no other alternative but must have both 
hands cut off from the wrists : sometimes one only 
is taken away. There are two Bubie women now 
in the settlement who have suffered this severe 
and cruel punishment: both their hands were 
cut off. , 

There is a School here, of about forty children 
of the settlers, kept in the house of the School- 
master, a native of Cape Coast. Its confused state 
is not so much from the ill management of the 
master, as from want of proper books to teach 
them. The master tries all his best to supply those 
lessons which he cannot get in any other way. 
He wrote out the alphabet and lessons of two and 
three letters for his pupils ; and these lessons are 
so closely written for want of paper, that in some 
parts they are scarcely distinguishable. His first 
class of seven children read in the New Tes- 
tament, and spell tolerably. They must write 
only three lines in the week, to save pencils ; as he 
has no prospect of getting more, when tho.se short 
ones are used out. There is some relief for 
lesson-books now, as Lieutenant Fishbourne lias 


344 


SCHOOL AT FERNANDO PO. 


distributed many of this kind among the inhabi- 
tants, who flocked to him to receive them with 
great eagerness. The inhabitants are supposed 
to be between six and seven hundred. The 
Schoolmaster is supported by the parents of the 
children, who pay him from one penny to six- 
pence per week, according to the improvement of 
the child.

APPENDIX L 


Phe following Letter was addressed by Mr. Samuel 
Crowther to the Secretaries, on transmitting to 
them his Journal. It is valuable, as a furtlier 
illustration of African Character, under sortie ad- 
vantages, though scanty ones, for intellectual and 
religious improvement. It is interesting also, as 
detailing the views of a Native on the results of 
the Niger Expedition, and on the manner best 
suited to promote the evangelization and social 
improvement of his countrymen. 

DEAR SIRS, Fernando Fo, Nov. 2, 1841. 

I uEREwiTH send you my Journal, which I was requested to 
keep during the Expedition up the Niger. I feel it rather 
awkward, that when there arc so many abler persons who 
will give competent information of every thing, I should be 
required to do the same : however, according to your desire, 

I have kept one ; and though the expressions used arc 
imperfect and homely, I yet hope it will not be altogether 
useless. Although I thought, at first, I should have nothing 
else to say, but a few words to introduce my Journal, cir- 
cumstances lead me to change my mind, and to say a word 
or two. 

Whoever reads the accounts written by different persons 
in connexion with the Expedition will see a great contrast 


348 


APPENDIX I. 


in its going up and coining down the river. The Expedi- 
tion has met with success, as far as it has been able to go on 
with its grand object — the abolition of the Slave-trade. Obi, 
king of Aboh, and the Attah of Eggarra, have very readily 
entered into treaties to that effect; and sold, or promised, 
land for Settlements of Europeans or Natives among their 
people, and are very desirous to be led in a better way. A 
Model Farm is commenced at the foot of Stirling Hill, at 
the Confluence. Many of the Natives begin to look up to 
tliat place as an asylum from the oppressions of their vora- 
cious enemies, the F ulatahs ; though they do not as yet see 
that, if it prospers, they will derive other benefits from it. 

As far as I can recollect, we have met with no opposition 
from any of the Chiefs to whom we came ; but, on the con- 
trary, all were ready to receive the ^Fhite Men, and were 
happy to see them their friends. 

But in the midst of success and anticipation of victory, 
they were at once attacked by the irresistible foe of Eu- 
ropeans — the deadly influence of the climate ; so that their . 
progress was impeded. Oh that the friends of Africa could 
but have cast their eyes on the condition of the ships, and 
the helpless state of their inmates, when they were lying at 
the Confluence ! I think they would have pitied them, and 
raised their hearts to God in supplications on their behalf ; 
and thus have been labouring for Africa, whose welfare they 
have at heart. 

There is no difficulty, however great, but our excellent 
Commanders, and their friends, would set their face to 
encounter. When the “ Soudan” and the “ Wilberforce” 
were sent back to the sea. Captain Trotter and Captain 
Bird AUen continued to pursue their great work ; but 
almost aU the Officers were laid up in the same week. Capt. 

B. Allen was able to keep up only the day we left the 


MR. CROWTHER’s letter. 


349 


Confluence; and, since that time, lingered on a bed of 
sickness till the 25th of October, when he died. On 
the 3d of October Captain Trotter himself was added to 
the sick list ; but now, thanks be to God ! he is convalescent. 
— Great Britain is willing to do what she can for Africa ; 
but the obstacles are very great, because of the insalubrity 
of the climate. 

As regards Missionary labours on the banks of the Niger 
and in the Interior of Africa, I think the Committee will 
see, from the condition of the Expedition, that very little 
can be done by European Missionaries, except by such as 
have, before ascending the river, become inured to the cli- 
mate of Africa. W e hope that there will be some commu- 
nication between England and Africa, by which a European 
Missionary may have an opportunity, when sickness should 
render it necessary, to leave the river for the benefit of his 
health ; for if there should be no such communication, he 
would be left in a helpless state. However, I do not limit 
the power of the Lord of the Vineyard, who has com- 
manded, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to 
every creature : neither do I distrust His jJromise, Lo ! 
I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Still, 
I am reluctantly led to adopt the opinion, that Africa can 
chiefly be benefitted by her own Children. 

I have read, in Sir T. F. Buxton’s work on the “ Slave-T rade 
and its Remedies,” that some promising Youths among the 
Children of Africa should be sent to England for education ; 
who would afterward hold situations in their countries, and 
whose conduct would have a beneficial influence upon their 
country-people. If such a plan be in contemplation for 
other employments, could it not be adopted for preparing 
Missionaries, too, from the Coast of Africa, who might be- 
come useful among their countrymen? When I saw the 


350 


APPENDIX I. 


engi'aving which I inserted in my Journal* at Cape-Coast 
Castle, I could not but think how many African Missiona- 
ries, whose constitution is suited to the climate, might now 
be employed in this part of the Lord’s Vineyard. Who the 
individual was, I know not ; neither have I ever heard any 
thing of him, except from his monument. What attracted 
my attention was, that he was a Native of that place — sent 
to England for education— received Holy Orders— and was 
employed in his own country upward fifty years! 

But at the same time, I still hope and pray that Eu- 
ropean Missionaries may be able to bestow their valuable 
labours upon the Nations of the interior, and lay the foun- 
dation of the Church of Christ. I always feel that myself 
and my Brethren of the Natives are not sufficiently qua- 
lified for so great a work ; and I cannot but express a wish 
that the means of improvement should be afforded to some 
of us, to make us fit instruments in the service of God. 

At the same time, I am fully aware that human learning 
will be of very little avail, if the heart is not inspired by 
the Holy Spirit from above, with love for the salvation of 
souls, and the extension of Christ’s Kingdom on earth. 

That the Lord may raise up fit Instruments, who may be 
usefully employed in this extensive part of His Vineyard, 
is the hearty desire and earnest prayer of your humble 
and obedient servant, 

Samuel Crowther.

Church Missionary Society.

VIE^VS WITH REGARD TO THE CARRYING ON OF MISSIONARY 

OPERATIONS IN WEST AFRICA, IN FUTURE ; IN A LETTER 

FROM THE REV. JAMES F. SCHON TO THE LAY-SECRETARY OF 
THE CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY. 

MY DEAR SIB, 

When I delivered to you my Journal of the Niger 
Expedition, I intended to leave it in the hands of the Com- 
mittee, without any further remark or explanation ; and to 
wait until they should have formed their own judgment on 
the practicability of establishing Missionary Stations on the 
banks of the Niger and in its immediate vicinity, and on the 
probable course of Missionary operations to which the infor- 
mation contained in my Journal would give rise. I enter- 
tained no doubt but that a perusal of it, together with the 
information obtained from other persons who have been 
connected with the Expedition, would lead the Committee 
to the same conclusion as that at which I had previously 
arrived ; and that any thing which I could afterward add, 
would only be confiimatory of, and an enlargement upon, 
the statements and hints already given. The subject has, 
however, engaged my mind ever since; and I beg leave now 
to state my views on the Niger Expedition — of the advan- 
tages arising from it — and of the measures which I would 
recommend to the Society for the extension of Missionary 


352 


RESULTS OK THE EXPEDITION. 


Labours in W estern Africa, humbly praying for that wisdom 
that is from above, for my guidance. 

In taking a retrospective view of the Niger Expedition, 

I must, in the first place, express my firm pei’suasion, that ' 
whatever may be the estimate of its utility, and whatever 
opinion may be formed of its bearing on the objects for 
which it was undertaken, the advantages which it has un- 
folded, and the light which it has thrown on the future 
operations of Christian Missions, deserve to be highly appre- 
ciated. With regard to its primary intention, I have reason 
to believe that the blessing of the Lord has rested upon it. 
To prove this, it will not be requisite to enter again into 
the particulars recorded in my Journal. A mere reference to 
the account therein given of the transactions with Obi and 
the Attah, the only two African kings we had any dealings 
with, and whose influence extends over an immense popu- 
lation and tract of land, sufficiently proves the practicability 
of the main object of the Expedition. Both of those Chiefs 
entered into treaties for the abolition of the Slave-trade, 
after a full explanation had been given them of the crimi- 
nality of it on the one hand, and the advantages on the 
other which would accrue to themselves and their subjects 
by the abolition of it, and by turning their attention to a 
more profitable and legitimate commerce. The only things 
which appear to me necessary to secure the fulfilment of 
these treaties, are, a regular intercourse with the nations 
with whom they were made, and facilities for carrying on a 
legitimate commerce with England. 

The advantages to be expected from such a commerce, in 
a financial point of view, would perhaps not be great for 
some years ; but it would become profitable, in proportion 
as the attention of the Natives was directed toward it. It 
is my impression, that the most profitable trade for a few 


ITS BEARING ON COMMERCE. 


353 


years would be that in palm-oil, which might be obtained at 
various places in the Delta, and especially at Aboh, in great 
abundance. I saw but very little ivory in the interior. As 
the Expedition was in no wise engaged in trade, the Natives 
had no inducement to show us what they possessed. We 
were, however, told that they had a great deal of ivory. 

The land is by no means so fertile as it has been repre- 
sented by some persons ; but it is the opinion of the Cotton 
Planters left at the Model Farm, that cotton will grow 
there. Indeed, it must at present be grown to a considerable 
amount, as is evident from the quantity of “ country cloth ” 
manufactured, for their own use, as well as for exportation. 
An enormous quantity of this cloth finds it way to the 
coast, and is sold at a high price in the various settlements. 
If the Natives could be prevailed upon to exchange the raw 
material for British manufacture, a great quantity might 
now be obtained for our markets; and there can be no 
doubt but that, in a few years, it might be largely increased. 
I can see no reason why it might not be so with other 
articles; such as, coffee, indigo, ginger, and aiTow-root. It 
is evident that the land, by care and attention, would yield 
those articles in much greater abundance, as it now pro- 
duces them spontaneously. 

To any future commercial enterprise the Expedition has 
rendered great services. It has prepared the way, by ex- 
pressing the wish of the English Nation for the abolition 
of the Slave-trade, and showing to them how much more 
profitable legitimate commerce would prove to the Natives 
of Africa than that iniquitous traffic. It has given them, 
too, an idea of the greatness and power of the nation with 
whom they would be brought into contact; and the im- 
pression made on them by tliis would operate beneficially 
for those who might continue a commercial intercourse with 


354 ON THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE-TRADE. 

the interior. It does not perhaps appear, from my Journal, 
so prominently as it should, that the Slave-trade — for the mi- 
series wliich it has inflicted on the nations in the interior — 
has never yet rendered any equivalent, by supplying them, 
to any degree worth speaking of, with European comforts 
and manufactures. The abolition of the Slave-trade, even if 
no legitimate commerce were substituted for it, would, not- 
witlistanding, prove a blessing to those countries, and would 
lay its inhabitants under infinite obligations to the nation 
which put an end to it. Through the Delta, and as far as 
Aboh, we had opportunities to observe that but a few articles 
of clothing of European manufacture had reached them. 
Above Aboh I do not remember that, with the exception of 
a few guns and a little gunpowder, we observed even a single 
red shirt or any other European article. It is therefore dif- 
ficult to perceive how the abolition of the Slave-trade could 
have any injurious effect upon them. But I have no doubt 
in my mind, that if European articles were offered to them 
in exchange for them produce, they would gladly avail them- 
selves of such opportunities, and thereby improve their own 
condition ; while England would, in time and by degrees, 
derive no small advantage from her intercourse with Central 
Africa. 

I must now come to another subject, on wliich, but for the 
light thrown upon it by the advantages afforded to me in the 
Niger Expedition, I should not have been able to give any 
distinct information: I allude to the geographical position 
-of the various countries, and the different languages spoken 
on the banks of the Niger and in its immediate vicinity. 
This subject is of paramount importance. It directs the 
attention of Missionary Societies to those preparatory labours, 
for the introduction of the Gospel into Central Africa, which 
are absolutely necessary ; namely, the reduction of their 


LANGUAGES OF THE COUNTRIES VISITED. 


355 


languages to writing, and the translation into them of por- 
tions of the Scriptures. It affords me no small consolation, 
to know, that though there may he no immediate prospect 
of entering upon the Missionary work in the interior, much 
may be done in a preparatory way, by which the work of 
Evangelization would be advanced, whenever an opportunity 
should present itself to disperse the Messengers of the 
Gospel in all directions. I have alluded in my Journal 
to the different languages which are spoken by the nations 
with whom we came into contact; but may now give a 
summary view of them. 

The first is the Benin Language, commonly called the 
Brass. It is spoken from the mouth of the river to Anya, 
a distance of about 100 miles through the Delta. 

The second is the Ibo, the language of Obi’s people and 
country. I have paid some attention to this language, and 
have collected a considerable Vocabulary, and also attempted 
some translations into it ; but deem it proper to defer the 
publication of them, until I shall have had another oppor- 
tunity of connecting them by the assistance of Natives, and 
of collecting more information on the various dialects spoken 
by the Ibos. 

With regard to the two languages just mentioned, I would 
observe, that though the nations speaking them are easy of 
access, insuperable difficulties are presented to European 
agents, fi’om the unhealthiness of the regions they inhabit. 
The work must chiefly be carried on by native agency. Yet 
their languages might be reduced to writing by Europeans, 
and portions of Scripture might be translated into them for 
the use of Native Missionaries. 

The third language is the Eggarra, which is also called 
the Igalla Language. It is spoken in the Attah’s domi- 
nions. It commences below Iddah; and extends beyond the 


356 


LANGUAGES OF THE COUNTRIES VISITED. 


Confluence of the Niger and the Tshadda, especially on the 
left bank of the river. It deserves much attention, because 
it is spoken by a great nation. I regret to say, that there 
are very few persons at Sierra Leone of this nation from 
whom a correct knowledge of the language might be ob- 
tained. 

Opposite to Iddah, the Benin or Brass is again spoken; 
but to what extent I am at a loss to say. It is however 
certain that it is not understood at Addu Kuddu. 

The fourth, and one of no small importance, is the Nufi 
Language. At Sierra Leone it is called Tapua. It is 
spoken by a great nation inhabiting the left bank of the 
Niger, and in some other places; as, for instance, Kinami, 
Egga, &c. &c. On the right bank, it begins at or near 
the Confluence, and extends beyond Rabbah. They have 
many words in common with the Haussa. The mtercourse 
between these two nations must have been considerable, 
since nearly all the Nufi people at Sierra Leone under- 
stand the Haussa Language. It may be, that, as they were 
nearly all transported through the Yaruba country, they 
had previously been kept for some time at Rabbah, Bussa, 
and other places ; but in their own country, Haussa is un- 
derstood by a great number. 

The fifth would be the Fulatah Language, which, as far 
as I have been able to ascertain, is essentially the same 
with the Foolah, and is of course spoken by the Fulatahs, 
wherever they are met with. It might be reduced to 
writing at Port Lokkoh, in the Timmanee country, many 
Foolahs residing there. Something has already been done, 
in this and in the Mandingo Language, by IVIr. Macbrair, 
Wesleyan Missionary at the Gambia. I expect that, on Mr. 
Thomson’s return from Timbo, we shall hear much more of 
the utility and extensive use of this language. 


LANGUAGES OF THE COUNTRIES VISITED. 


357 


The sixth is the Haussa. I mention this last, following 
the geographical position of the various nations. In point 
of importance, it claims the first place and attention ; since 
an acquaintance with it would open a door for communica- 
tion with an immense population, and over a vast tract of 
country. At Aboh we met Haussa slaves ; and Obi had a 
freeman of this nation in his employment, as interpreter. 
At Iddah there were many who spoke Haussa; and the 
further we advanced toward the interior, the more nume- 
rous were the persons conversant with it. At Egga we met 
persons of the Yaruba, Bornou, and other countries, who 
spoke Haussa with fluency ; and, according to Mr. Laird, all 
transactions were carried on in it at Fundah. Among my 
Teachers at Sierra Leone, there ivere some who came from 
Bussa: others from Yauri and Sokutu : others, again, from 
Kabi and Guber, extensive provinces of the Haussa country. 
It appears, too, that this language has been adopted in a 
great measure by the Fulatahs, as it is the principal lan- 
guage spoken at Ilabbah. The wide extent to which this 
language is spread seems to be attributable to the com- 
mercial intercourse which is kept up between the Haussa 
and various other nations. The Haussas manufacture a 
great quantity of cotton- cloths, with which they supply 
many other nations. According to the unanimous testimony 
of travellers, they have advanced more than the surrounding 
nations in agricultural pursuits. Their language, too, proves 
them a superior people to any of the African nations that 
I have any knowledge of. It is rich in words; and its 
grammatical structure is easy and beautiful, which may 
also account for its being so generally adopted. As I intend 
to lay an extensive Vocabulary, Collections of Phrases, and 
Specimens of Translations, shortly before the Committee, 
I need not dwell any longer on this subject at present. 


358 INTRODUCTION OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 

It will be seen, from the above remarks, that there is a 
wide field open for preparatory labour for the introduction 
of the Gospel into Africa. It appears to me obvious, that 
not much good can be expected to result from Missionary 
labours unless the various nations are addressed in their own 
languages, and portions of the Sacred Volume are put into 
their hands. It has often been proposed to introduce English 
entirely, with a view to supersede all Native Languages. No 
one can doubt, that if this were practicable, the advantages 
arising from it would be incalculably great ; for as soon as 
a knowledge of this language should have been acquired, the 
whole treasure of English Literature would be open to the 
Natives of Africa, and the laborious work of executing 
Translations, and of forming new terms and expressions for 
Religious purposes, would be unnecessary. It might also be 
said, that it could' be effected with less inconvenience in 
Africa, where the language has less hold on the minds of 
the people than it has on those whose languages have long 
since been reduced to writing, and who possess an extensive 
literature in it. But however plausible this may appear in 
theory, I must question its practicability. I am not aware 
that a single instance can be produced, to show that any 
language has ever been entirely superseded. The plan has 
had a fair trial at Sierra Leone. English has been the only 
language ever employed in the Colony for conveying Reli- 
gious instruction to the people, and for the transacting of all 
business — it being impossible to obtain a knowledge of about 
thirty-six languages and dialects, which are spoken by 
different Natives in Sierra Leone, for those purposes : but to 
this day not one of these languages and dialects has been set 
aside or forgotten by the Natives: on the contrary, the 
children of the Liberated Africans speak the language of 
their parents with fluency and correctness. Instead of 


STUDY OF THE NATIVE LANGUAGES. 


359 


regretting this circumstance, I rejoice at it ; since they will 
the sooner be qualified to dispense the blessings of the Gospel 
to their countrymen, when the Lord shall be pleased to 
open the way before them. AU I could advise would be 
this, that in whatever country a Mission may be established, 
English should be introduced ; and young men of talent 
should especially receive a good education in it, with a view 
to prepare them to become the Teachers of their own 
country-people, and Translators into their own language. 

To press the necessity of the study of Native Languages 
with any other arguments upon the Society, would be 
uncalled for. The Parent Committee’s Letters to the 
Missionaries at Sierra Leone, for the last ten or twelve 
years, show how much importance they have attached to 
this subject. It is much to be regretted that more has not 
been hitherto done in this department. The people, how- 
ever, with whom the Missionaries were surrounded, claimed 
their immediate attention ; and it was necessary tliat they 
should first receive instruction, before they could render 
themselves useful to others who might undertake the task 
of reducing their languages. But I fear that the want of 
success has been chiefly owing to this circumstance — that it 
was believed to be compatible with the other duties de- 
volving upon a Missionary, and has therefore never formed 
a distinct occupation for some of the Society’s Labourers. 
That it is incompatible with other duties, past experience 
shows. The Missionaries were ever willing to do what 
they could ; but they have always found it necessary to 
attend to those duties first which admitted of no delay or 
postponement. I should be deceiving the Parent i'om- 
mittee, and disappoint their hopes and expectations, were 
I not to express my conviction tliat more will not be done 
in future, unless the study of the Native Languages be

STUDY OF THE NATIVE LANGUAGES. 


made a separate employment for two or three persons, who 
have a talent for, and feel an interest in such an employ- 
ment. It is not a business that may be taken up at any 
leisure hour, like the study of a language already cultivated. 
You have no books at your command which you may 
consult, except those of your own composing. You must 
collect all information from the lips of Natives Things 
which you take for settled and fixed, you find to be wrong 
by the next inquiry. Frequently T have spent hours before 
I was satisfied about the signification of a single word. 
I know that this will appear to some persons as an exag- 
geration of the difficulties ; but not to those who have paid 
due attention to the subject. I have often observed persons 
commencing a language with great zeal — take down a few 
hundred substantives, and commit them to memory — also 
a great number of verbs — but who have, after all, never 
obtained a full knowledge of the character of the lan- 
guage. In the vocabularies collected by travellers, I often 
found whole sentences given for single words ; the pronouns 
connected with the substantives and verbs ; and no regard 
paid to the distinction of gender, of numbers, tenses, &c. 
For this I can easily account. Much research, and com- 
parisons with other languages, are required, which demand 
perseverance and patient labour. It is further necessary, 
that a person engaged in translating should have some time 
allowed to him for the study of the languages in which the Sa- 
cred Volume is written, and for consulting works on languages ; 
by which, often more light will be thrown on his subject 
than by talking it over for days and weeks with Natives 
who have never had the advantages of acquiring a know- 
ledge of grammar. It is therefore, in my humble opinion, 
indispensable that the work of translating should be made 
a distinct branch of the operations of the Mission. If it

were in the power of the Committee immediately to send 
Missionaries to Rabbah or Bussa, their first business must 
be to reduce the Haussa Language to writing ; and they 
might there find even fewer facilities for this than offer 
themselves in Sierra Leone. If the Committee participate 
in my conviction, that little can be done in Africa except 
through Native agency, they will agree with me, that it is 
necessary that the Native Teachers should be furnished 
with the Word of Life, as their commission to their perishing 
brethren, and the message of God to all. And this most 
important work, the translation of the Scriptures, cannot be 
left to the Natives. 

I have frequently had occasion to allude, in my Journal, 
to the utility of Native Agency. Tlie remarks there made 
are supported by facts, which cannot be contradicted : and if 
there should be any thing wanting to compensate me for 
feelings of disappointment in the results of the Niger Expe- 
dition in other respects, I acknowledge, with gratitude to 
God, that the information obtained on this subject is more 
than a counterbalance. It not only demonstrates to us, that 
the designs for which the Expedition has been chiefly 
undertaken will, in the course of events, be carried out by 
Natives ; but tliat the nations in the interior acknowledge 
the superiority over themselves of their own country people 
who have received instruction, and arc willing, nay anxious, 
to see them return, and to be instructed by them in the 
habits of civilized life, and especially in the truths of the 
Gospel. And must we not recognise the liand of God in 
this, seeing that this feeling is reciprocal? In Sierra Leone 
there is a general desire among the Liberated Africans to 
return to their own countries. This was unheard of only 
a few years ago. This state of things among the Africans, 
and the additional testimony, so mournfully brought out by 


362 


ACCEPTABLENESS OF NATIVE AGENCY. 


the disatrous events which befell the Expedition, of the 
unhealthiness of the climate, and impracticability of carry- 
ing out the Society’s plans by European agency, call aloud 
upon the Committee for the adoption of measures by which 
these small beginnings may be improved to the greatest 
possible extent. Are the Natives of Africa, then, to become 
Missionaries to their own country people ? Yes;— for tliis 
the Church of God has been longing and praying. And 
the Africans themselves call upon us to give them that pre- 
paration for this important work which God Almighty, in 
His infinite mercy and goodness, has placed in our power, 
and for our earnest prayers to Him that His blessing may 
rest upon them. I take the liberty of referring you to 
Samuel Crowther’s Letter, accompanying his Journal, and 
addressed to yourself. It is not an expression of the 
desire of his heart alone, but of many others, who, by the 
blessing of the Lord, may become fit instruments, in His 
hand, in disseminating the Word of Life in distant parts of 
the globe. How is this to be done? It is the opinion of 
many Christian friends, that promising Young Men should 
be sent to England, and receive their education in this coun- 
try; but it must be acknowledged that there are serious 
obstacles in the way. Their health would be exposed ; — 
they might become too much accustomed to European 
comforts, and thereby become less capable of enduring 
hardships in Africa. As a general plan, I could not re- 
commend it, though special cases might be so dealt with. 
An exception might now and then be made, to the advan- 
tage of the Missionary Cause in Africa. Others have thought 
that an Institution might be established at Malta, for Negro 
Youths; the climate being healthy, and the changes of 
Teachers, on account of iU health, less frequent than at 
Sierra Leone. The disadvantages would, on the other hand. 


PREPARATORY INSTRUCTION OF NATIVES.

be very great. I am inclined to think, taking all things 
into consideration, that the Society would in no wise do 
better than hy putting the Fourah-Bay Institution on such 
a footing, that the Students might there receive a superior 
education, with a special view to prepare them for the Missio- 
nary work. Hitherto, its chief attention has been directed to 
quality the Students for the immediate wants of the Colony ; 
— and the results have been most encouraging. A large 
number of able Schoolmasters have been educated there, wlio 
are now employed in the Society’s Schools. Some have dis- 
appointed our hopes, by engaging in other services ; but it is 
a consolation to know that the labour and expense bestowed 
upon their education by the Society has not been lost to 
Africa. Many are now employed in Government offices, as 
Clerks or Managers : others in merchant-houses, or at tlieir 
timber-factories. Others, again, are employed as School- 
masters under Government, or by the Wesleyan Missionary 
Society. Some have engaged in commercial pursuits on 
their own account. One or two are already engaged in the 
Timmanee Country, as Schoolmasters. I need not propose 
on what plan the Institution should be established, or what 
the instruction delivered to the Students should be. The 
experience which the Committee have gained on this sub- 
ject is sufficient to guide them in their plans. I would only 
observe, that I firmly believe that the Negro Youths possess 
equal capabilities with those of other countries. 

But I cannot forbear making a few observations upon 
the internal management of the Institution. The appoint- 
ment of the Tutors ought to be permanent. Serious incon- 
veniences have ever been felt, arising from frequent changes. 
The persons in charge of it ought not to be called upon for 
other employment in the Mission ; ns it would unavoidably 
interfere with their duties, and occupy much of their time

and mind. There should be regular Quarterly Examinations 
held of the Students, and reports of the same transmitted to 
the Parent Committee. No Student, possessing abilities, 
slioidd henceforth be appointed Schoolmaster for the different 
villages, so long as he may continue to improve by the 
instruction received in the Institution. 

The Committee have been already apprised of the dilapi- 
dated state of the buildings of the Fourah-Bay Institution, 
and the necessity of erecting new and enlarged ones. This, and 
the increased number of Students to be admitted, will cause 
much expense to the Society ; wliich I deeply regret, con- 
sidering the Society’s pecuniary difficulties, and the urgent 
claims upon them from every quarter. Yet I cannot, I dare 
not, suppress an earnest appeal to the Committee, not to 
slacken their hands in tliis matter. To give to the Natives 
of Africa the best possible education wiU, under God, be 
the means of spreading the Gospel of our salvation far and 
wide. European agency is insufficient. How forcibly has 
this been demonstrated, by the early graves closing over 
many of the Society’s Missionaries at Sierra Leone, and of 
the Missionaries of other Societies on the Western Coast. 
Their strength, in the debilitating climate of Africa is, in 
the best of days, but weakness ; it ought therefore to be 
consecrated to one point, and to that which promises the 
richest harvest. 

If the question had been put to me, previously to my em- 
barkation in the Niger Expedition— Do you not believe that 
either on the banks of the Niger, or at another settlement 
along the Coast, including Fernando Po, greater facilities 
will be offered to the Society for carrying their intentions 
into execution, than at Sierra Leone?— I should undoubtedly 
have expressed my persuasion that a more favourable spot 
and greater facilities would be met with at some other place. 


ADVANTAGES OF SIERRA LEONE. 


3G5 


Personal observation and experience, however, have caused 
me to change my mind. I know now, that the present state 
of Sierra Leone, whatever may have been the wisdom in its 
original selection, is of such a nature as justifies the expec- 
tation, that from it much good will be done for Africa ; and 
that it will be the wisdom of the Church Missionary Society, 
and of all other Institutions which have the good of Africa 
at heart, to take every advantage of the facilities which 
present themselves at that place. I have alluded, in my 
Journal, to the obstacles in the way of sending European 
Missionaries to the interior of Africa ; but have always en- 
deavoured to avoid giving a decided opinion, from a fear 
that the distressing circumstances in which we were then 
placed might have an undue influence on my judgment. A 
more mature consideration — for which I have had time since 
my return to this country — has not, in the smallest degree, 
produced a change in my sentiments. The obstacles remain 
the same : the climate is unhealthy ; and if there should be 
an opportunity offered by which Missionaries might be con- 
veyed to the interior, there is no certainty that another would 
present itself, by which persons in ill health might return, 
or others receive the necessary supplies from England. For 
the present, then, and until a regular communication be- 
tween England and Central Africa shall be established, I could 
not advise a European Mission. It may be questioned by 
many, whether the objections just alluded to would warrant 
the conclusion dravTi from them ; and whether the difficul- 
ties referred to ought not to be cheerfully encountered by 
Missionaries, in their wor/c of faith and labour of love ? To 
this I would remark, that the Lord has always been pleased 
to prepare the way for His servants, to whatever country He 
called them ; and that a regular intercourse between the 
two countries should, in my judgment, be considered as the 


366 ADVANCED STATE OF THE SIERRA-LEONE MISSION. 

opening of the door for Missionary enterprise. The insalu- 
brity of the country alone would not he considered a suffi- 
cient ground for delay by myself, nor by other Missionaries. 
What I have said before on Fernando Po will show that, at 
present, not much good can he expected to result to Africa 
from that place. The question, what it might he made to 
be in future, is quite another thing : and the same applies 
to every other settlement along the coast, both English and 
American. The work of Scriptural Education has not been 
carried on in any of them to such an extent as to favour the 
hope that they would furnish a qualified agency for the 
evangelizing of Africa. 

The Committee are well aware that Sierra Leone exhibits, 
in this respect, a very different and most encouraging aspect. 
In it, the foundation is laid upon which the Missionary work 
for Afi’ica may he built. Three thousand two hundred and 
seventy- eight children receive daily five hours’ instruction 
in the Society’s Schools; and the Colony-bom children 
evince an equal aptitude in acquiring knowledge with any 
other children in any part of the world. There are, at 
present, no less than forty Native Teachers employed in the 
Society’s Schools, in which they are eminently useful. Some 
of them have been for many years engaged in making known 
the Gospel to their native brethren ; and their conduct has, 
in general, not only given great satisfaction, but has called 
forth our devout gratitude to Almighty God for their use- 
fulness, and for the perseverance and zeal which they have 
ever manifested. I have no hesitation in saying, that if the 
Church at Sierra Leone had been blessed with the paternal 
care of a Bishop, that several would ere now have been ad- 
mitted to Holy Orders. 

The Communicants, in general, have given proofs of the 
sincerity of their faith, by aiding and assisting the Missio- 


SINCERITY AND ZEAL OF NATIVE CONVERTS. 367 

naries as much as was in their power. Many render us great 
assistance as Teachers in the Sunday Schools, and in visiting 
and arguing with Pagans. Whenever a Church, School- 
house, or dwelling-house was built, they came forward with 
their liberal contributions in money and labour ; and have 
ever largely contributed, considering their means, to the 
general fund of the Society. I lately learned, that those of 
the Aku Nation in Sierra Leone have commenced making 
a collection of money, with a view to offer it to the Church 
Missionary Society, to enable them to send a Missionary to 
Badagry— a place in which they feel much interested, it 
being the inlet to their own, that is, the Yaruba Country. 
In one village alone the sum contributed amoimted, a few 
days after the subscription was opened, to fifteen pounds. 

You are aware, from previous information, that some 
wealthy individuals of this nation have purchased one or 
two prize-vessels at Sierra Leone, and taken on board Bri- 
tish manufactures, and made several voyages to Badagry 
already, and opened a commercial intercourse with that 
place and the adjacent countries. I understand, too, that 
about 300 have already left Sierra Leone, with an intention 
to settle at Badagry, or to find their way to the spots from 
which they were once forcibly taken for the slave-market. 
Many more would leave for the same purpose, if they could 
enjoy the same religious privileges there which they enjoy 
at Sierra Leone. It is therefore their anxious wish tliat 
Missionaries should accompany them, and I cannot but lay 
my views on this subject before the Committee. I am 
aware of the pecuniary difficulties under which the Society 
is labouring, and by which their exertions are impeded ; and 
that the establishment of a new Mission can hardly be 
expected under these circumstances. Yet might not Samuel 
Crowther, a Native of the same country, and held in high

estimation by his brethren, be sent thither, after he shall 
have received Ordination ? He might be accompanied by 
several Schoolmasters. To me it appears a providential 
opening ; and I ever bear it in mind, in my supplications at 
the throne of grace. When the Akus first thought of the 
undertaking, they seemed to apprehend that the Slave-trade 
would interfere with them, and therefore asked for British 
protection. It does not, however, appear that they now en- 
tertain those apprehensions. The friendly reception which 
some of the Chiefs gave them, encouraged them ; and I, for 
one, do not believe that they will be much molested by African 
or European Slave-traders. On the contrary, they are the 
most likely persons who wall do much toward the abolition 
of the Slave-trade in their own country. The whole under- 
taking is of a very interesting nature. It proves, more than 
words can prove, that the Liberated Africans are advancing 
in civilization, and accumulating wealth. They are pur- 
chasing vessels in which they had before been packed up as 
a cargo for European cupidity. They are loading them with 
British manufacture — carry the same to their own countries 
— and give to their own Chiefs and country -people the most 
striking proofs that slavery is a curse upon any nation, and 
the abolition of it the opening of the door for innumerable 
blessings. It is such a proof as was long looked for — the 
realization of those hopes which animated the hearts of the 
earliest founders of Sierra Leone ; and which ought now to 
be followed up by the liberality of British Christians, that 
their earnest desire of having the Gospel with them may be 
satisfied. I trust a few years more of experience and patient 
labour will for ever prove that Sierra Leone has not been 
“ a complete failure.” 

In conclusion, I beg leave to refer, in a few words, to the 
Timmanee Mission, lately established by the Society at Port 


SUGGESTIONS ON THE TIMMANEE MISSION. 


369 


Lokkoh ; and would entreat the Committee to strengthen it, 
as much as may be in their power, with an additional num- 
ber of Labourers. I would especially recommend that one 
Missionary should be chiefly engaged in reducing the Foulah 
Language at that place. It is veiy desirable too, that, in 
connexion with the Timmanee Mission, an Institution for the 
training of Native Schoolmasters should be established. It 
might be done on a limited scale : — six or eight intelligent 
Youths would be sufficient, on the onset. By this means you 
would be able to prepare an agency by the time when por- 
tions of Scripture and elementary school-books will be com- 
pleted in their own language. We have often felt the want 
of a Printing Establishment at Sierra Leone, and especially 
for the Timmanee Country ; and if the Society should accede 
to my proposals, and make the study and reduction of Native 
Languages a prominent part of their operations, it would 
become absolutely necessary to furnish the Mission with 
one. Probably a Printer might be obtained at Sierra Leone, 
or from Liberia, or Cape Coast. 

I am not aware that I can add any other suggestions to 
the above. I have made it my endeavour to give a faithful 
account of my share in the Niger Expedition, and must 
now leave it to the Committee to decide what measures shall 
be adopted for the benefit of the Africans. For my own 
part, I can only say, that the trying circumstances in which 
we have been placed have not shaken my confidence in the 
Lord, nor weakened my desire to devote my time, my health 
and life, to them. And though I may feel disappointed, 
seeing that there is no immediate prospect of entering upon 
the Missionary work in the interior, I feel compensated for 
it, knowing that the time will come when they shall hear the 
Gospel, and that this event may be hastened by those pre- 
parations to which the Lord has been pleased to direct us.

370 CONCLUSION OF MR. SCHON’s LETTER. 

With sincere gratitude, I acknowledge God’s mercy to- 
ward me, in preserving my imworthy life in the pestilen- 
tial air of Africa ; and in restoring my dear partner, whom 
I left, on my embarkation at Sierra Leone, in a very bad 
state of health. We have endeavoured to make God’s ser- 
vice our delight, and He has truly made all our wants His 
care ; and to Him be ascribed all praise and glory ! My 
last request is, pray for us ; pray for the Africans — that 
this people, robbed and spoiled — snared in holes— hid in pri- 
son-houses — a prep which none delivereth—a spoil of which 
none saith. Restore — may be brought into the glorious liberty 
of the Children of God, by faith in our Lord and Saviour 
Jesus Christ.

LETTER OF MR. SAMUEL CROWTHER TO THE REV. WILLIAM 
JOWETT, IN 1837, THEN SECRETARY OF THE CHURCH MISSIO- 
NARY SOCIETY, DETAILING THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED 
WITH HIS BEING SOLD AS A SLAVE. 


In this Letter, the writer relates the circumstances 
connected with his being seized and sold as a slave 
— his journey to the coast — shipment on board 
a Slaver — capture by a British Cruiser — location 
in Sierra Leone — and his there being brought, 
through the blessing of God on the labours of the 
Society’s Missionaries, to the knowledge and recep- 
tion of the Gospel of Christ. His simple details 
present a clear and affecting view of the crimes and 
miseries of that trade in man, by which Africa is 
afflicted and demoralized. 

REV. AND DEAR SIR, Fourah Bay, Feb. 22, 1837. 

As I think it will be interesting to you to know something 
of the conduct of Providence in my being brought to this 
Colony, where I have the happiness to enjoy the privilege 
of the Gospel, I give you a short account of it ; hoping I 
may be excused if I should prove rather tedious in some 
particulars. 


372 


APPENDIX III. 


I suppose, some time about the commencement of the 
year 1821, 1 was in my native country, enjoying the comforts 
of father and mother, and the affectionate love of brothers 
and sisters. From this period I must date the unhappy— 
but which I am now taught, in other respects, to call 
blessed day, which I shall never forget in my life. I call 
it unhappy day, because it was the day in which I was 
violently turned out of my fathei-’s house, and separated 
from my relations ; and in which I was made to experience 
what is called to be in slavery : — with regard to its being 
called blessed, it being the day which Providence had 
marked out for me to set out on my journey from the land 
of heathenism, superstition, and vice, to a place where His 
Gospel is preached. 

For some years, wars had been earned on in my (Eyo) 
Country, which was always attended with much devastation 
and bloodshed : the women, such men as had surrendered 
or were caught, with the children, were taken captives. 
The enemies who carried on these wars were principally the 
Eyo Mahomedans— with whom my country abounds — with 
the Foulahs, and such foreign slaves as had escaped from their 
owners, joined together, making a formidable force of about 
20,000, who annoyed the whole country. They had no 
other employment but selling slaves to the Spaniards and 
Portuguese on the coast. 

The morning in which my town, Ocho-gu, shared the 
same fate which many others had experienced, was fair and 
delightful; and most of the inhabitants were engaged in 
their respective occupations. We were preparing breakfast 
without any apprehension ; when, about 9 o’clock a.m., a 
rumour was spread in the town, that the enemies had ap- 
proaehed with intentions of hostility. It was not long after 
when they had almost surrounded the town, to prevent any 


SAMUEL CROWTHEr’s NARRATIVE. 


373 


escape of the inhabitants ; the tovm being rudely fortified 
with a wooden fence, about four miles in circumference, 
containing about 12,000 inhabitants, which would produce 
3000 fighting men. The inhabitants not being duly pre- 
pared, some not being at home — those who were, having 
about six gates to defend, as well as many weak places 
about the fence to guard against, and, to say in a few 
words, the men being surprised, and therefore confounded — 
the enemies entered the town after about three or four 
hours’ resistance. Here a most sorrowful scene imaginable 
was to be witnessed 1 — women, some with three, four, or six 
children clinging to their arms, with the infants on their 
backs, and such baggage as they could carry on their heads, 
running as fast as they could, through prickly shrubs, which, 
hooking their blies and other loads, drew them down from 
the heads of the bearers. While they found it impossible 
to go along with their loads, they endeavoured only to save 
themselves and their children : even this was impracticable 
with those who had many children to care for. While they 
were endeavouring to disentangle themselves from the ropy 
shrubs, they were overtaken and caught by the enemies 
with a noose of rope thrown over the neck of every indi- 
vidual, to be led in the manner of goats tied together, under 
the drove of one man. In many cases a family was violently 
divided between three or four enemies, who each led his away, 
to see one another no more. Your humble servant was thus 
caught — with his mother, two sisters (one an infant about ten 
months old), and a cousin, — while endeavouring to escape in 
the manner above described. My load consisted in nothing 
else than my bow, and five arrows in the quiver : the bow 
I had lost in the shrub, while I was extricating myself, 
before I could think of making any use of it against my 
enemies. The last view I had of my father was when he 


374 


APPENDIX III. 


came from the fight, to give us the signal to flee : he entered 
into our house, which was burnt some time back for some 
oSence given by my father’s adopted son. Hence I never 
saw him more. — Here I must take thy leave, unhappy, 
comfortless father ! — I learned, some time afterward, that he 
was killed in another battle. 

Our conquerors were Eyd Mahomedans, who led us away 
through the town. On our way, we met a man sadly 
wounded on the head, struggling between life and death. 
Before we got half way through the town, some Foulahs, 
among the enemies themselves, hostilely separated my cousin 
from our number. Here also I must take thy leave, my 
fellow captive cousin! His mother was living in another 
village. The town on fire ; — the houses being built with 
mud, some about twelve feet from the ground with high 
roofs, in square forms, of different dimensions and spacious 
areas : several of these belonged to one man, adjoined to, 
with passages communicating with each other. The flame 
was very high. We were led by my grandfather’s house, 
already desolate ; and in a few minutes after, we left the 
town to the mercy of the flame, never to enter or see it any 
more. Farewell, place of my birth, the play-ground of 
my childhood, and the place which I thought would be the 
repository of my mortal body in its old age ! We were now 
out of Ocho-gu, going into a town called Iseh'i, the rendez- 
vous of the enemies, about twenty miles from our town. 
On the way, we saw our grandmother at a distance, with 
about three or four of my other cousins taken with her, for 
a few minutes : she was missed through the crowd, to see her 
no more. Several other captives were held in the same 
manner as we were : grandmothers, mothers, children, and 
cousins, were all led captives. O sorrowful prospect !— The 
aged women were to be greatly pitied, not being able 


SAMUEL CROWTHER’s NARRATIVE. 


375 


to walk so fast as their children and grandchildren : they 
were often threatened with being put to death upon the spot, 
to get rid of them, if they would not go as fast as others ; 
and they were often as wicked in their practice as in their 
words. O pitiful sight ! whose heart would not bleed to 
liave seen this? Yes, such is the state of barbarity in the 
heathen land. Evening came on ; and coming to a spring 
of water, we drank a great quantity ; which served us for 
breakfast, with a little parched com and dried meat pre- 
viously prepared by our victors for themselves. 

During our march to Iseh'i, we passed several towns and 
villages which had been reduced to ashes. It was almost 
midnight before we reached the town, where we passed our 
doleful first night in bondage. It was not perliaps a mile 
from the wall of Iseh'i when an old woman of about sixty 
was threatened in the manner above described. What had 
become of her I could not Icam. 

On the next morning, our cords being taken off our 
necks, we were brought to the Chief of our captors — for 
there were many other Chiefs— as trophies at his feet. In 
a little while, a separation took place ; when my sister and 
I fell to the share of the Chief, and my mother and the 
infant to the victors. We dared not vent our grief liy loud 
cries, but by very heavy sobs. My mother, with the infant, 
was led away, comforted with the promise that she should 
see us again, when we should leave Iscli'i for Dab'dah, the 
town of the Chief. In a few hours after, it was soon agreed 
upon that I should be bartered for a horse in Iscli'i, tliat 
very day. Thus was I separated froii) my mother and 
sister for the first time in my life ; and the latter not to be 
seen more in this world. Thus, in the space of twenty-four 
hours, being deprived of liberty and all other comforts, 
I was made the property of three different persons. About

the space of two months, when the Chief was to leave 
Iseh'i for his o%vn town, the horse, which was then only 
taken on trial, not being approved of, I was restored to the 
Chief, who took me to Dah'dah ; where I had the happiness 
to meet my mother and infant sister again with joy, which 
could be described by nothing else but tears of love and 
affection ; and on the part of my infant sister, with leaps of 
joy in every manner possible. Here I lived for about tliree 
months, going for grass for the horses with my fellow cap- 
tives. I now and then visited my mother and sister in our 
captor’s house, without any fears or thoughts of being 
separated any more. My mother told me that she had 
heard of my sister ; but I never saw her more. 

At last, an unhappy evening arrived, when I was sent 
with a man to get some money at a neighbouring house. 
I went ; but with some fears, for which I could not account ; 
and, to my great astonishment, in a few minutes I was 
added to the number of many other captives, enfettered, to 
be led to the market-town early the next morning. My 
sleep went from me; I spent almost the whole night in 
thinking of my doleful situation, with tears and sobs, 
especially as my mother was in the same town, whom 
I had not visited for a day or two. There was another 
boy in the same situation with me : his mother was in 
Dah'dah. Being sleepless, I heard the first cock-crow. 
Scarcely the signal was given, when the traders arose, and 
loaded the men slaves with baggage. With one hand 
chained to the neck, we left the town. My little com- 
panion in affliction cried and begged much to be permitted 
to see his mother, but was soon silenced by punishment. 
Seeing this, I dared not speak, although I thought we 
passed by the very house my mother was in. Thus was 
I separated from my mother and sister, my then only com-

forts, to meet no more in this world of misery. After a few 
days’ travel, we came to the market-town, I-jah’i. Here 
I saw many who had escaped in our town to this place ; or 
those who were in search of their relations, to set at liberty 
as many as they had the means of redeeming. Here we 
were under very close inspection, as there were many per- 
sons in search of their relations ; and tlirough that, many had 
escaped from their owners. In a few days I was sold to 
a Mahomedan woman, with whom I travelled to many 
towns in our way to the Popo country, on the coast, much 
resorted to by the Portuguese, to buy slaves. When we left 
I-jah’i, after many halts, we came to a town called T6-ko. 
From I-jah'i to T6-ko all spoke the Ebwah dialect; but my 
mistress Eyo, my own dialect. Here I was a perfect stranger, 
having left the Eyo country far behind. I lived in T6-ko 
about three months ; walked about with my owner’s son with 
some degree of freedom, it being a place where my feet 
had never trod : and could I possibly have made my way out 
through many a ruinous town and village we had passed, 
I should have soon become a prey to some others, who 
would have gladly taken the advantage of me. Besides, 
I could not think of going a mile out of the town alone at 
night, as there were many enormous devil-houses along 
the highway; and a woman had been lately publicly ex- 
ecuted (fired at), being accused of bewitching her husband, 
who had died of a long tedious sickness. Five or six heads, 
of such persons as were executed for some crime or other, 
were never wanting, to be nailed on the large trees in the 
market-places, to terrify others. 

Now and then my mistress would speak with me and her 
son, that we should by- and bye go to the Popo country, 
where we should buy tobacco, and other fine things, to sell 
at our return. Now, thought I, this was the signal of my 


378 


APPENDIX III. 


being sold to the Portuguese; who, they often told me 
during our journey, were to be seen in that country. Being 
very thoughtful of this, my appetite forsook me, and in 
a few weeks I got the dysentery, which greatly preyed on 
me. I determined with myself that I would not go to the 
Popo country ; but would make an end of myself, one way 
or another. In several nights I attempted strangling 
myself with my band ; but had not courage enough to close 
the noose tight, so as to effect my purpose May the Lord 
forgive me this sin ! I determined, next, that I would leap 
out of the canoe into the river, when we should cross it in 
our way to that country. Thus was I thinking, when my 
owner, perceiving the great alteration which took place in 
me, sold me to some persons. Thus the Lord, while I knew 
Him not, led me not into temptation, and delivered me from 
evil. After my price had been counted before my o^vn eyes, 
I was delivered up to my new owners, with great grief and 
dejection of spirit, not knowing where I was now to be 
led. About the first cock-crowing, which was the usual 
time to set out with the slaves, to prevent their being much 
acquainted with the way, for fear an escape should be made, 
we set out for Jabbo, the third dialect from mine. 

After having arrived at Ik-ke-ku Ye-re, another town, 
we halted. In this place I renewed my attempt of stran- 
gling, several times at night ; but could not effect my 
purpose. It was very singular, that no thought of making 
use of a knife ever entered my mind. However, it was not 
long before I was bartered, for tobacco, rum, and other 
articles. I remained here, in fetters, alone, for some time, 
before my owner could get as many slaves as he wanted. 
He feigned to treat us more civiUy, by allowing us to sip a 
few drops of White Man’s liquor, rum ; which was so esti- 
mable an article, that none but Cliiefs could pay for a jar or

glass vessel of four or five gallons : so much dreaded it was, 
that no one should take breath before he swallowed every 
sip, for fear of having the string of his throat cut by the 
spirit of the liquor. This made it so much more valuable. 

I had to remain alone, again, in another town in Jabbo, 
the name of which I do not now remember, for about two 
months. From hence I was brought, after a few days’ walk, 
to a slave-market, called I'-ko-sy, on the coast, on the bank 
of a large river, which very probably was the Lagos on 
which we were afterwards captured. The sight of the river 
ten’ified me exceedingly, for I had never seen any thing 
like it in my life. The people on the opposite bank are 
called E’-ko. Before sun-set, being bartered again for to- 
bacco, I became another owner’s. Nothing now terrified 
me more than the river, and the thought of going into 
another world. Crying was nothing now, to vent out my 
sorrow ; my whole body became stiff. I was now bade to 
enter the river, to ford it to the canoe. Being fearful at my 
entering tliis extensive water, and being so cautious in every 
step I took, as if the next would bring me to the bottom, 
my motion was very awkward indeed. Night coming on, 
and the men having very little time to spare, soon carried 
me into the canoe, and placed me among the corn-bags, and 
supplied me with an Ab'-alah for my dinner. Almost in the 
same position I was placed I remained, with my Ab'-alah in 
my hand, quite confused in my thoughts, waiting only every 
moment ovir arrival at the new world ; which we did not reach 
tin about 4 o’clock in the morning. Here I got once more 
into another dialect, the fourth from mine; if I may 
not call it altogether another language, on account of now 
and then, in some words, there being a faint shadow of my 
owm. Here I must remark, that, during the whole night’s 
voyage in the canoe, not a single thought of leaping into the 


380 


APPENDIX III. 


river had entered my mind ; but, on the contrary, the fear 
of the river occupied my thoughts. 

Having now entered E'-ko, I was permitted to go any 
way I pleased ; there being no way of escape, on account of 
the river. In this place I met my two nephews, belonging 
to different masters. One part of the town was occupied by 
the Portuguese and Spaniards, who had come to buy slaves. 
Although I was in E'-ko more than three months, I never 
once saw a White Man ; until one evening, when they took 
a walk, in company of about six, and came to the street 
of the house in which I was living. Even then 1 had not 
the boldness to appear distinctly to look at them, being 
always suspicious that they had come for me : and my suspi- 
cion was not a fanciful one ; for, in a few days after, I was 
made the eighth in number of the slaves of the Portuguese. 
Being a veteran in slavery, if I may be allowed the expres- 
sion, and having no more hope of ever going to my country 
again, I patiently took whatever came ; although it was 
not without a great fear and trembling that I received, for 
the first time, the touch of a Wliite Man, who examined me 
whether I was sound or not. Men and boys were at first 
chained together, with a chain of about six fathoms in length, 
thrust through an iron fetter on the neck of every individual, 
and fastened at both ends with padlocks. In this situation 
the boys suffered the most : the men sometimes, getting 
angry, would draw the chain so violently, as seldom went 
without bruises on their poor little necks ; especially the 
time to sleep, when they drew the chain so close to ease 
themselves of its weight, in order to be able to lie more 
conveniently, that we were almost suffocated, or bruised to 
death, in a room with one door, which was fastened as soon 
as we entered in, with no other passage for communicating 
the air, than the openings under the eaves-drop. Very often 


SAMUEL CROWTHEr’s NARRATIVE. 381 

at night, when two or three individuals quarrelled or fought, 
the whole drove suffered punishment, without any distinc- 
tion. At last, we boys had the happiness to be separated 
from the men, when their number was increased, and no 
more chain to spare : we were corded together, by ourselves. 
Thus we were going in and out, bathing together, and so 

on — The female sex fared not much better Thus we 

were for nearly the space of four months. 

About this time, intelligence was given that the English 
were cruising the coast. This was another subject of sorrow 
with us — that there must be war also on the sea as well 
as on land — a thing never heard of before, or imagined 
practicable. This delayed our embarkation. In the mean 
while, the other slaves which were collected in Popo, and 
were intended to be conveyed into the vessel the nearest 
way from that place, were brought into E'-ko, among us. 
Among this number was Joseph Bartholomew, my Brother 
in the service of the Church Missionary Society. 

After a few weeks’ delay, we were embarked, at night, 
in canoes, from E'-ko to the beach ; and on the following 
morning were put on board the vessel, which immediately 
sailed away. The crew being busy embarking us, 187 in 
number, had no time to give us either breakfast or sup- 
per ; and we, being unaccustomed to the motion of the 
vessel, employed the whole of this day in sea-sickness, 
which rendered the greater part of us less fit to take any food 
whatever. On the very same evening, we were 8uri)ri8ed 
by two English men-of-war ; and on the next morning 
found ourselves in the hands of new conquerors, wliom we 
at first very much dreaded, they being armed with long 
swords. In the morning, .being called up from the hold, 
we were astonished to find ourselves among two very large 
men-of-war and several other brigs. The racn-of-war were. 


382 


APPENDIX III. 


His Majesty’s ships “ Myrmidon,” Captain H. J. Leeke, and 
“ Iphigenia," Captain Sir Robert Mends, who captured us 
on the 7th of April 1822, on the river Lagos. 

Our owner was bound with his sailors ; except the cook, 
who was preparing our breakfast. Hunger rendered us 
bold ; and not being threatened at first attempts to get some 
fruits fi’om the stern, we in a short time took the liberty of 
ranging about the vessel, in search of plunder of every kind. 
Now we began to entertain a good opinion of our con- 
querors. Very soon after breakfast, we were divided into 
several of the vessels around us. This was now cause of 
new fears, not knowing where our misery would end. 
Being now, as it were, one family, we began to take leave 
of those who were first transshipped, not knowing what would 
become of them and ourselves. About this time, six of us, 
friends in affliction, among whom was my Brother Joseph 
Bartholomew, kept very close together, that we might be 
carried away at the same time. It was not long before we 
six were conveyed into the “ Myrmidon,” in which we 
discovered not any trace of those who were transshipped 
before us. We soon came to a conclusion of what had 
become of them, when we saw parts of a hog hanging, the 
skin of which was white — a thing we never saw before; 
for a hog was always roasted on fire, to clear it of the 
hair, in my country ; — and a number of cannon-shots were 
arranged along the deck. The former we supposed to be 
the flesh, and the latter the heads of the individuals who 
had been killed for meat. But we were soon undeceived, 
by a close examination of the flesh with cloven foot, which 
resembled that of a hog; and, by a cautious approach to 
the shot, that they were iron. 

In a few days we were quite at home in the man-of-war ; 
being only six in number, we were selected by the sailors, 


SAMUEL CROWTHER’s NARRATIVE. 383 

for their boys ; and were soon famished with clothes. 
Our Portuguese owner and his son were brought over into 
the same vessel, bound in fetters ; and, thinking that I should 
no more get into his hand, I had the boldness to strike him 
on the head, while he was shaving by his son— an act, how- 
ever, very wicked and unkind in its nature. His vessel 
was towed along by the man-of-war, with the remainder of 
the slaves therein. But after a few weeks, the slaves being 
transshipped from her, and being stripped of her rigging, the 
schooner was left alone on the ocean — “ Destroyed at sea 
by captors, being found unseaworthy, in consequence of 
being a dull sailer.” 

One of the brigs, which contained a part of the slaves, was 
wrecked on a sand-bank : happily, another vessel was near, 
and all the lives were saved. It was not long before another 
brig sunk, during a tempest, with all the slaves and sailors, 
with the exception of about five of the latter, who were 
found in a boat after four or five days, reduced almost to 
mere skeletons, and were so feeble, that they could not 
stand on their feet. One hundred and two of our number 
were lost on this occasion. 

After nearly two months and a half cmising on the coast, 
we were landed at Sierra Leone, on the 17 th of June 1822. 
The same day we were sent to Bathurst, formerly Leopold, 
under the care of Mr. Davey. Here we had the pleasure 
of meeting many of our country people, but none were 
known before. They assured us of our liberty and freedom ; 
and we very soon believed them. But a few days after 
our arrival at Bathurst, we had the mortification of being 
sent for at Freetown, to testify against our Portuguese 
owner. It being hinted to us that we should be delivered 
up to him again, notwithstanding all the persuasion of 
Mr. Davey that we should return, we entirely refused to 


3S4 


APPENDIX III. 


go ourselves, unless we were earned. I could not but think 
of my di-conduct to our owner in the man-of-war. But as 
time was passing away, and our consent could not he got, 
we were compelled to go by being whipped ; and it was not 
a small joy to us to return to Bathurst again, in the evening, 
to our friends. 

From this period I have been under the care of the Church 
/ Missionary Society ; and in about six months after my 
arrival at Sierra Leone, 1 was able to read the New Testa- 
ment with some degree of freedom ; and was made a Monitor, 
for which I was rewarded with sevenpence-halfpenny per 
month. The Lord was pleased to open my heart to hearken 
to those things which were spoken by His servants ; and 
being convinced that I was a sinner, and desired to obtain 
pardon through Jesus Christ, I was baptized on the llth of 
December 1825, by the Rev. J. Raban I had the short pri- 
vilege of visiting your happy and favoured land in the year 
1826. It was my desire to remain for a good while, to 
be qualified as a Teacher to my feUow-creatures ; but Provi- 
dence ordered it so, that, at my return, I had the wished-for 
instruction under the tuition of the Rev. C. L. F. Haensel, 
who landed in Sierra Leone in 1827 ; through whose instru- 
mentality 1 have been qualified so far, as to be able to render 
some help, in the service of the Church Missionary Society, 
to my fellow-creatures. May I ever have a fresh desire 
to be engaged in the service of Christ, for it is perfect 
freedom ! 

Thus much I think necessary to acquaint you of the 
kindness of Providence concerning me. Thus the day of 
my captivity was to me a blessed day, when considered in 
this respect ; though certainly it must be unhappy also, in 
my being deprived on it of my father, mother, sisters, and 
all other relations. I must also remark, that I could not as 


SAMUEL CROWTHER’s NARRATIVE. 38 .) 

yet find a dozen Ocho-gu people from among the inhabitants 
of Sierra Leone. 

I was married to a Christian woman on the 21st of Sep- 
tember 1829, She was captured by His Majesty’s Ship 
“ Bann,” Capt. Charles Phillips, on the 31st of October 1822. 
Since, the Lord has blessed us with three children — a son, 
and two daughters. 

That the time may come when the Heathen shall be fullj' 
given to Christ for His inheritance, and the uttermost part 
of the earth for His possession, is the earnest prayer of 

Your humble, thankful, and obedient Servant,

APPENDIX IV. 


FOURAH-BAY INSTITUTION BUILDINGS’ FUND. 

The Committee of the Church Missionary Society 
have long felt the importance of training African Youths in 
Sierra Leone for employment as Religious Teachers of their 
Countiymen. Experience has fully proved that the Euro- 
pean constitution cannot long bear up against the insalubrity 
of the climate of West Africa. It is therefore plain, that, 
for the extensive diffusion of the Gospel in that country, a 
Native Agency must be resorted to. It is not less plain, 
that, in order to the efficiency of such an Agency, hopeful 
Youths must be dul}' educated for Religious Teachers. 
These views led the Committee to form an Educational 
Establishment at Fourah Bay, near Freetown, SieiTa Leone, 
for that purpose, designated The P'ocraii-Bay Institution. 
The progress of the Institution has been much impeded by 
frequent changes in the Mastership of it, rendered unavoid- 
able by sickness or death. Notwithstanding these disadvan- 
tages, it has already supplied the Mission with many useful 
Teachers, as Schoolmasters, Assistant Catechists, and Cate- 
chists. The Rev.G. A. Kissling,the Senior Missionarj', writing 
to the Committee in July 1841, says: — “In the mid.st of 
interruptions and difficulties, a number of Schoolmasters and 
Native Teachers have been raised up, through the medium 
of that Institution, without whom it would be quite impos- 
sible to carrj' on those extensive operations which are now 
s2 


388 


APPENDIX IV. 


committed to your Agents’ charge. Your European La- 
bourers in W est Africa, notwithstanding the additional re- 
inforcement lately made, are not much more in number tlian 
they were ten years ago, when barely half the field of use- 
fulness was occupied, and when the several departments of 
Christian instruction were far from being so efficiently at- 
tended to as we have the satisfaction of observing it now. 
Tliis improvement must, under God’s blessing, be ascribed 
to the advanced strength and ability of our Native Brethren.” 
Of the Institution, the Rev. J. F. Schon wrote to the Com- 
mittee a few weeks ago : — “ Hitherto its chief attention has 
been directed to qualify the Students for the immediate 
wants of the Colony ; and the results have been most en- 
couraging.” 

Not only has the Mission been thus supplied with many 
of its most important Agents ; but many, trained in it, have 
entered into other employments in the Colony. This is 
doubtless a loss to the Mission ; but not to the general in- 
terests of Africa. On this head Mr. Schon remarks, in the 
Letter just quoted : — “ Some have disappointed our hopes, 
by engaging in other services ; but it is a consolation, to know 
that the labour and expense bestowed upon their education 
by the Society has not been lost to Africa. Many are now 
employed in Government Offices, as Clerks or Managers : 
others in merchant-houses, or at their timber-factories. 
Others, again, are employed as Schoolmasters under Govern- 
ment, or by the Wesleyan Missionary Society. Some have 
engaged in commercial pursuits on their own account.” 

What, therefore, has been already accomplished by the 
Institution, under all its disadvantages, affords the strongest 
encouragement to persevere in the same course. 

One additional ground of encouragement to the Committee 
is this. The Institution is now under the charge of the 


FOURAH-BA.Y INSTITUTION BUILDINGS’ FUND. 389 

Rev. Edward Jones, himself of African descent. Mr. Jones 
is well educated, and was admitted to Holy Orders some 
years ago in the Episcopal Church in the United States. 
Mr. Jones has now been many years in Sierra Leone, with- 
out suffering from the climate. In addition to this, the 
Committee have the prospect of obtaining for the Institu- 
tion another Individual from the United States, a Native 
of Africa, also in Episcopal Orders. They have therefore a 
far more encouraging prospect of permanency in the Heads 
of the Institution than at any antecedent period, 

Tlie results of the Niger Expedition have supplied still 
stronger motives to the adoption of the most effective mea- 
sures possible for training Africans as Religious Teachers : — 

1. It has afforded additional and very painful proofs of the 
baneful influence of the climate of West Africa on European 
constitutions : so much so, that all parties are agreed, that 
to benefit Africa extensively, by imparting to her our reli- 
gious and social blessings, Africans themselves must be the 
principal agents. 

2. The important and cheering fact has been established, 
that both Chiefs and people are willing to receive instruction 
from Black M^n, even of such as they know to have been in 
a state of slavery ; and that such Black Men, trained in the 
Schools and Institution of the Society in SiciTa Leone, are 
capable of acceptably imparting it. The fact is so pecu- 
liarly hopeful for Africa, that, in corroboration of it, the 
Committee quote the following passage from the above- 
mentioned Letter of Mr. Schiin : — 

“ I have frequently had occasion to allude, in my Journal, 
to the utility of Native Agency. The remarks there made 
are supported by facts, which cannot be contradicted : and if 
there should be any thing wanting to compensate me for 
feelings of disappointment in the results of the Niger Expo- 


390 


APPENDIX IV. 


dition in other respects, I acknowledge, with gratitude to 
God, that the information obtained on this subject is more 
than a counterbalance. It not only demonstrates to us, that 
the designs for which the Expedition has been chiefly under- 
taken wiU, m the course of events, be carried out by Na- 
tives; but, that the Nations in the interior acknowledge the 
superiority over themselves of their oivn country-people 
who have received instruction, and are willing, nay anxious, 
to see them return, and to be instructed by them in the 
habits of civilized life, and especially in the truths of the 
Gospel.” 

The following occurrence is related by Mr. Schon, in his 
Journal. Describing his intercourse with Obi, king of Ibo, 
he says : — “ I opened the English Bible, and made Simon 
Jonas read a few verses to him, and translate them into Ibo. 
The verses he read were some of the Beatitudes of our 
Saviour, in the Fifth Chapter of St. Matthew. Obi was 
uncommonly’' taken with this. That a IVhite Man could 
read and write, 'was a matter of course ; but that a Black 
Man — an Ibo man — a slave in times past — should know 
these wonderful things too, was more than he could ever 
have anticipated. He seized his hand, and pressed it most 
heartily : ‘You must stop with me ! you must teach me and 
my people ! ’ ” 

Impressed by these considerations, the Committee have 
determined, so soon as they shall have sufficient pecuniary 
means at their disposal for the purpose, to enlarge the In- 
stitution at Fourah Bay, so as to admit of its receiving 
Thirty Students, with provision for the residence of Two 
Masters. 

The design of the Institution is, to give to Native Y ouths 
that Christian Education which may fit them for stations of 
usefulness, with an especial reference to the preparation of 


FOURAH-BAY INSTITUTION BUILDINGS* FUND. 391 

those who may be most promising for Teachers, including 
the Ministry. 

¦While, in accordance with the design of the Institution, 
the course of study will comprise a good general education, 
the main objects will be the sound Theological training of 
the Youths, and the diligent use of the means best calculated 
to promote, under the Divine Blessing, personal Religion. 
It is proposed that the course of study should embrace, 
(1) English Composition, Geography, and History; (2) Arith- 
metic, Euclid, Algebra, Trigonometry, and the Branches of 
Natural Philosophy ; (3) The Elements of Latin and Greek ; 
(4) The most considerable of the Native Languages of ^Yest 
Africa; (o) Vocal Music; (G) Drawing and Perspective; 
(7) Scriptural Instruction, including the Holy Scriptures, as 
the basis of all Religious teaching; (8) Ecclesiastical Hi- 
story, with the Government, Articles, and Formularies of 
the Church of England ; (9) Exposition of Scripture, Com- 
position of Sermons, and the method of communicating know- 
ledge to others. The whole of this course, however, can 
only be gradually carried out as the capacity and attain- 
ments of the Students will admit. 

In addition to what has been already stated, it is intended 
that the Students should be encouraged to acquaint them- 
selves with useful Mechanical Arts; the Princijdes of Gar- 
dening and Agriculture ; and such other departments of 
knowledge as may contribute to enlarge their capacity for 
promoting the social improvement of their (.'ountrynien. 

In order to carry out the views of the (.'ommittcc, the 
present Buildings at Fourah Bay, which are in a very dila- 
pidated state, must be taken down, and larger and more 
substantial Buildings erected. The necessary cost of these 
will not be less than Two Thou.sand Pounds. I he financial 
difficulties, however, in which the Church Missionary Society 


392 


APPENDIX IV. 


is at present involved, wholly preclude the Committee 
from providing for the cost of them out of the regular in- 
come of the Society. That income is indeed scarcely ad- 
equate to maintain the existing establishments of the Society, 
even on the reduced scale on which the Committee have 
been compelled to place them. The Committee have, there- 
fore, as the only available means of providing funds for the 
Fourah-Bay Institution Buildings, opened a separate Fund 
for Special Contributions for that specific object. To that 
Fund they earnestly solicit Contributions from the Members 
of the Society. They also appeal to those Friends of Africa, 
who, though not Members of the Church Missionary Society, 
are solicitous to promote the Religious and social welfare of 
Africa by means of Scriptural Education. The claims of 
Africa on the Religious and Benevolent are indeed strong 
and undeniable ; for greatly has Africa suffered at our hands. 
Peculiar, too, are the facilities and encouragements now pre- 
sented in Sierra Leone for repairing our wrongs, so far as 
reparation is practicable, by training and sending forth her 
own cliildren as the Heralds of Salvation, and the harbingers 
of brigliter and happier days to Africa. The Christianity of 
the Bible, and that alone, can heal the wounds of Africa, 
and raise her from her present degradation, to participate in 
our Religion, our Laws, and our Institutions — our science, 
our commerce, and our agriculture — and all those civil and 
social blessings which, through the Divine favour, we 
pre-eminently enjoy. Wisely, as well as eloquently, has 
Sir T. F. Buxton thus recorded his judgment of the para- 
mount importance of Christianity as the means of good to 
Africa : — 

“ The hope of effecting Africa’s civilization, and of in- 
ducing her tribes to relinquish the trade in man, is, without 
this assistance (Christianity), utterly vain. This mighty

lever, when properly applied, can alone overturn the iniqui- 
tous systems which prevail throughout that continent. Let 
Missionaries and Schoolmasters, the plough and the spade, 
go together, and agriculture will flourish ; the avenues to 
legitimate commerce will he opened; confidence between 
man and man will be inspired ; whilst Civilization will ad- 
vance as the natural effect, and Christianity operate as the 
proximate cause, of this happy change. 

“ If indeed it be true, that such effects will follow in the 
train of Religion, and that Christianity alone can effect such 
changes, and produce such blessings, then must we pause 
before we take a single step without it. The cause of Africa 
involves interests far too g^eat, and results far too stupen- 
dous, to be trifled with. The destinies of unborn millions, 
as well as of the millions who now exist, are at stake in the 
project ; and the question is one of life or of death, of com- 
fort and happiness or of unutterable misery." 

He emphatically adds — “ I believe that Christianity will 
meet the necessities of the case, and will prove a .specific 
remedy for the moral evil of Africa."
