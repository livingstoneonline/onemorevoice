
Gleanings from Recent Letters.
[...]
How Collections are made at Abeokuta.
From a recent journal of the Rev. D. Williams, a Native Pastor,
we take the following, which may convey a significant hint to
some of our own readers:&#8212;
June 29th, 1874.&#8212;Had our missionary
meeting for collection towards
the Native Pastorate. It was opened with singing, reading a portion of
Scritpure from Hebrews vi., and prayer. After having given a short
preliminary speech, I called upon a few gentlemen to give speeches, which
they performed with avidity, and the few people were moved, after
having given once their subscriptions, to promise more. No hope of
realising such an amount up to that of last year on account of the hardness of the present time,
consequent upon the fall of trade, which has
thrown many merchants into a great distress. I received only a few
amounts and promises. Being not satisfied with the collection of the day,
I gave notice of another to be held in a fortnight.
