TRIALS OF CONVERTS IN INDIA.
IN our last Number we adverted to the trials and bitter persecutions
which converts from Hinduism have to endure at the hands fo their
own friends and relatives; and we introduced the Rev. B. Geidt's account
of a young Brahamin convert at Burdwan as illustrative of this.
We now add another case, that of Shrinath Ghose. The account is
contained in a letter from the Rev. Jagadishwar Bhattachargya, of the
Free Church of Scotland, Calcutta, to a lady in Edinburgh.
In my last letter I mentioned to you that there was a very hopeful inquirer
with me, who would soon come forward to enter into the church
of Christ by baptism. He did come, and was received into the church
on the first Sabbath of the year. But what has happened to him since
will extremely grieve you to hear, as it did me and all my friends.
Shortly after his baptism, Shrinath—for that is the young man's name—was
sent up to Bansbaria, that he might remain with me during our vacation,
or accompany me to a preaching tour if I went into the interior.
The day after his arrival his mother came to see him, and oh, what a
scene took place that morning—a scene one does not like to witness if he
can help it! With slow and trembling steps the mother entered our
Mission compound, and the moment she saw her son she flung herself
upon his neck, and set up a most terrible howling. Her cries, her
shrieks, the beating of her breast, and tearing her hair, drew floods of
tears from the spectators who stood around the afflicted parent and her
son.
After her feelings had a little subsided, she urged every argument and
entreaty in her power to persuade her son to go back to heathenism; but
finding they were ineffectual, she stretched herself on the bare ground,
and raised another most piteous howling; at which the friends who accompanied
her from her village conveyed her to a quiet place, and
endeavored to comfort her.
It appears, next day she went to her village, with a view evidently to
consult with her friends and relatives how she might best take away
Shrinath from us. After a week, she returned with some men, and
made an attempt to carry him away by force. The second day she
repeated almost the very same things she did in her first interview—the
same sort of howling, the same arguments and entreaties as before, and
with the same success, for she was unable to shake the resolution of
her son. Her design was to decoy him into the public street, that
she might have an opportunity to carry him away into her village; but
in this she was also disappointed.
Perceiving her wicked intentions, I thought it prudent to remove
Shrinath from this place, and accordingly the next morning I took him
down to Calcutta, and put him in the Mission-house with our native
brethren. Scarcely three days have elapsed. Behold the mother maketh
her appearance thither, and, by her fair but false professions, completely
disarmed all suspicions from the mind of her son regarding her designs.
Her proceedings there were managed with such deep and consummate
subtlety as to deceive the most wary and experienced. No wonder, then,
that Shrinath, a youth of twenty, should fall into her snare. She first
took a lodging near the Mission premises, and frequently came to see her
son, and allowed him to do the same without molestation. Shrinath, at
first, never went to see her without being accompanied by one or two of
the brethren. After a week, she removed her lodging to a place about
a mile distant from the convert's premises, and desired her son to
visit her there as often as he liked. Shrinath visited her once or twice
in her new abode, accompanied by a Mission servant, and came back
without suspecting any bad motive in her. The last time he went
to see her he was seized, and forcibly carried away to his native
village, and is to this moment detained in her custody. It appears
she collected some of her friends that are in Calcutta, and, by their
assistance, effected her purpose. Shrinath is now a close prisoner,
through no chains are put on him. He is not allowed the liberty to
come out of the house, but must remain confined in the zenana, or inner
department. No person can have access to him without a special permission
from the mother: no message can reach him without it being
first made known to her. Day and night he is closely watched.
You can easily conceive what must have been my feelings when I heard
of this transaction. Immediately I went down to Calcutta to consult with
Mr. Mackay, and other European friends, what steps should be adopted
for the rescue of the new convert. Many of them advised me not to take
any legal measures, but to leave the whole case in his hands of Providence,
trusting that the Lord will deliver him in His own time.
After my return from Calcutta, I sent a private message to Shrinath,
but unfortunately it could not be delivered. At present I see no means
of his immediate deliverance, unless the Lord, in His infinite mercy,
interpose on behalf of His servants.
By all the reports hitherto reached me, I exceedingly rejoice to learn
that Shrinath is continuing firm in faith, and bearing testimony to "the
truth as it is in Jesus" in the midst of all his trials.
Hindu converts sacrifice much that they may be wholly for Christ.
What sacrifices do we make as evidences of our thankfulness that, in
following out the convictions of our conscience, we have no such difficulties
and hindrances to contend against? Is the knowledge of
salvation through a Saviour's blood a treasure which we prize? and
are we proving the value we set upon it by the diligent efforts we 
are making to bring that treasure within the reach of others?
