The following is an extract received by Mr. Davis some time since from the Rev. James Lewana,
the Native Minister who was left by Mr. Davis in charge of the native Circuit in
Graham's Town, where he was labouring previous to his leaving Africa on a visit England.
"To me it is a matter of much thankfulness to God to hear how the hand of the Lord has brought
you and your family safely through those great waters, to again see you friends, and the land
from which God the Spirit called you to come and tell us the way to salvation; we who were in
great darkness, as all our fathers were in time past; but now light has begun to shine among us
through your ministrations and others in the Gospel of Christ, and for which we all give thanks
to Him who is Lord over all things. Since you left me in charge of this Circuit I have see the
mighty power of God in calling sinners to repentance, and to Himself. Both in Graham's Town and
Spring Vale, and at Assagai Bush, many have been converted from their heathenism, and have
joined the classes; at Assagai Bush fifty are joined to the Society, and at Spring Vale, a new
place, ten have been publicly baptized, and eleven are on trial, and here in Graham's Town our
members have increased, and our subscriptions also. We have just held our Missionary meeting,
and Brother Charles Pamla came from Peddie to help at our services. A very good work took place,
and many found the blessing of peace with God. The number converted during our Missionary
services is fifty, who have all begun to meet in class. Thus has God wrought for us, and we
thank Him for His great goodness in thus blessing our labours, and bringing souls from among the
heathen to the knowledge of the truth of Christ, which is able to save the soul."
