This letter, charming in its originality and the spirit of gratitude and goodwill that it breathes, was sent to <persName>Mrs. Field</persName>, of <placeName><placeName>I, Cromwell Street</placeName>, <settlement>Ipswich</settlement></placeName>, who showed great kindness to the <orgName><term type="collective">Zulu</term> <term type="collective">Christian</term> Choir</orgName> when they were in <country>England</country> last year, took them to some of the religious societies and sent back 200 penny toys for the school-children of the chief. <persName>Mr. Gumede</persName> was first cousin to <persName>chief Ncwadi</persName>, and the latter was very unwilling to allow him to come to <country>England</country>; but when <persName>Mr. Gumede</persName> returned he was so pleased with the treatment his cousin had received and the little gift of the toys, that he is now quite anxious to visit the country himself and to send his sons to complete their education.</p>
<milestone unit="section" rend="quarter-line"/>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName>Mrs. Field</persName></hi> keeps up a very interesting correspondence with <persName>Mr. Gumede</persName>, and she sent out a <orgName>Children's Scripture Union</orgName> Card to see if any would join in the neighbourhood of <placeName>Acton Homes</placeName>, <region>Upper Tugela</region>, where <persName>Mr. Gumede</persName> lives. As a result, 30 children and one big man joined. <persName>Mr. Gumede</persName>, up to lately, worked as an evangelist, but being appointed as teacher in some schools built by the chief, he has been obliged to give up this particular work, except on Sundays. <persName>Mrs. Field</persName> is most anxious to provide a native evangelist in his place, the salary required being &#163;25 per annum. She has already collected &#163;3 towards it. The <orgName>Religious Tract Society</orgName> and the <orgName>Open Air Mission</orgName> provided several large wall pictures which have proved most valuable in bringing home the truths of <term type="collective">Christianity</term> and Scripture to the minds of the people at <placeName>Acton Homes</placeName>.</p>

I return so many thanks for your kindness of presenting us with the toys for the school children, and by all means to develop my school. I am as one in a dream, when I hear the thing I had not expected, because I was still mourning for their being expelled by their masters, and that led them under great trouble, and now I hear glad tidings for them, and that I am valued much by the gentlemen and gentleladies of the highest rank in <country>England</country>, and who desire me welfare and improvement in education, civilization, and ecclesiastical course. Education is the most thing I value under the sun. I also return thanks for those written papers you sent me, whereas I cannot promise you anything at present.</p>
<p>I thank you also for your kindness of treating <persName>Josiah</persName> so well and comfort during their hard times. May God bless you and have an improvement in your thoughts. May the Almighty be with you, and preserve you, and perhaps by His everlasting mercy may arise me from a sleep and consider what will take place in the future, that is in the world to come, where there will be no parting for evermore.</p>
