<lb/><p>During the two days' stay made by <orgName><persName>Mr. Stanley</persName>'s 
ex<!-- - -->pedition</orgName> at this place, in order to organize the caravan 
inteaded to proceed by way of the <geogName>Falls</geogName> to <settlement>Leopoldville</settlement>, 
a resident here had a conversation with <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName>, in 
which the latter entered into full particulars concerning 
his past and present connexion with <persName>Mr. H.M. Stanley</persName>.</p>
<p>It was at <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName>, where <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName>, accompanied by 
his son, had gone to sell ivory, that he received <persName>Mr. 
Stanley</persName>'s letter from <settlement>Brussels</settlement>, proposing to him to enter 
the service of the <orgName>Assooiation</orgName>. No mention was then 
made of any appointment as <persName>Governor of the <geogName>Falls</geogName></persName>, it 
being merely stated that <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName>'s services would be 
used on the <region><geogName>Upper Congo</geogName></region>, as near as possible to the centre 
of his operations in <bloc>Africa</bloc>. <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName> mentioned these 
proposals to his son, who advised him not to accept them 
He resolved to await <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName>'s arrival, offering his 
services meanwhile for engaging 200 <term type="collective"><geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> natives</term> for 
the projected expedition.</p>
<p>After speaking of the services which he had rendered to 
<persName>Lieutenant Cameron</persName> and <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName>, and particularly to 
the latter on his first expedition, <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName> was asked what 
had decided him to aceept <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName>'s offer and to ac-
company him to <settlement>Boma</settlement>. He replied as follows :&#8212;</p>
<p>"I never clearly understood the object or the 
organiza<!-- - -->tion of the <orgName>International African Association</orgName>. The other 
<term type="collective">Arab</term> chiefs and myself at first believed, on seeing 
expedi<!-- - -->tions organized at <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> under <persName>Captain Cambier</persName> and 
<persName>Lieu<!-- - -->tenant Becker</persName>, that the <term type="collective">Europeans</term> wished to compete 
with us in the markets of <settlement>Tabora</settlement> and <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName>, and 
ex<!-- - -->port, like ourselves, ivory and produce of various kinds.
We did not know whether <persName>Stanley</persName> and the other white 
chiefs were acting for the <persName>King of the Belgians</persName>, for
<country>Belgium</country>, or for the <orgName>International Association</orgName>, and we 
were always left in doubt on the point.</p>
<p>"But now that we have seen that such are not the 
intentions of the whites&#8212;that is to say, of the <term type="collective">Belgians</term> 
and <term type="collective">English</term>, whom we have met on the <region>East Coast</region> ; now 
that they have abandoned this part of <bloc>Africa</bloc> in order to 
establish, by common accord, we are told, between all the 
great peoples of <bloc>Europe</bloc>, a State where everybody may 
freely trade, we see no further reason to doubt the good
intentions of the whites, who have already done so much
in <bloc>Africa</bloc>."</p>
<p>Being next asked if there were not other reasons which 
had led him to accept <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName>'s proposals, <persName>Tippoo 
Tib</persName> replied :&#8212;</p>
<p>"Yes. I confess that at first the idea of becoming a 
functionary of the <country>Independent Congo State</country> was a singular 
one to me. But <persName>Stanley</persName> pointed out that I should have a 
privileged position; that the <country>State</country> on its side could only 
gain by seeing its establishments on the <region><geogName>Upper Congo</geogName></region> 
supported by the authority which for many years past I 
had acquired over the people of the interior, who all knew 
me through having traded with me ; while,as regarded 
my<!-- - -->self, I could not but strengthen my commercial relations 
by means of the support which the <country>Congo State</country> would 
afford to me, as to all who were established on its 
territory.</p>
<p>"I perceived the justice of these arguments, and I had, 
moreover, at heart to remedy, as far as I could, the 
mischief which the <term type="collective">Arabs</term> and the population at the <geogName>Falls</geogName> 
had done in destroying the station at <geogName>Stanley Falls</geogName>. This 
act was the result of misunderstanding and imprudence; but 
I do not think that I can refuse to make reparation if, as 
I believe, I can do so."</p>
<p><persName>Tippoo Tib</persName> admitted that he was also influenced by 
commercial considerations of another kind, and said :&#8212;</p>
<p>"The circumstances under which trade is carried on 
with the <region>East <choice><sic>coast</sic><corr>Coast</corr></choice></region> are no longer so favourable as some 
years back, when I commenced trading with <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> and 
abroad. Trade at that period had, so to speak, no 
existence. I established myself at <settlement>Houron</settlement><!-- This placeName has become corrupted, but I can't think of what the correct name is. AW -->, near <settlement>Tabora</settlement>, 
with my old father and my brother <persName>Mohamed Massoudi</persName>, 
wishing first to create in the neigbbourhood plantations 
yielding satisfactory returns, and above all to monopolize 
the ivory trade by establishing <term type="collective">Arab</term> correspondents 
throughout <region>Central <bloc>Africa</bloc></region>, on the shores of the <geogName>Lakes</geogName>, 
and as far <settlement><choice><orig>Nyangoué</orig><reg>Nyangwe</reg></choice></settlement>. The people of the centre, who 
had no means of disposing of their considerable stocks of 
ivory, let me have them at a price which enabled me to 
realize a large profit. In a short time I had monopolized 
nearly all the sources of ivory production, 
and all the trade of the <region>Manyema</region> was in my hands.</p>
<p>"The great difficulty has always been to bring the 
produce of <region>Central <bloc>Africa</bloc></region> to the markets of <settlement>Tabora</settlement> and 
<geogName>Zanzibar</geogName>. At first this was easy enough, but gradually 
the people of the centre became aware that they could
also gain something by my operations, and commenced 
imposing heavy tribute upon me for right of way through 
their territories. For instanoe, the <term type="collective">Wa-Kundis</term>, who 
alone possess the boats necessary for crossing the 
<geogName>Malagarazi</geogName>, exact exorbitant terms for the use of them. 
Certain tribes sometimes attacked my caravans, causing 
me heavy loss in men and merchandise.</p>
<p>"Even on the coast the conditions of trade changed. 
The <term type="collective">Germans</term> were everywhere, and their pretentions 
rendered business more and more difficult. Great 
diffi<!-- - -->culties arose from this state of things, and on all these 
grounds I concluded that if the trade of <region>Central <bloc>Africa</bloc></region> 
could follow another route and reach the coast by sure 
roads on which no tribute would have to be paid, and 
where no difficulties were to be apprhended, everybody 
would be the gainer. After what I have seea at <settlement>Banana</settlement> 
and <settlement>Boma</settlement> I believe I am not mistaken, and that traders 
like myself can only gain by dispatching their produce 
from <settlement><choice><orig>Nyangoué</orig><reg>Nyangwe</reg></choice></settlement> by way of the <geogName>Falls</geogName> and the <geogName>Congo</geogName>."</p>
<p>On being asked what he would do on reaching the <geogName>Falls</geogName>,
and how he would fulfil his mission, <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName> 
replied :&#8212;</p>
<p>"In the first place I feel sure that <persName>Stanley</persName> will succeed 
in his enterprise and relieve <persName>Emin Pasha</persName>. He is a real 
<term type="collective">Arab</term> for energy and intelligence. I do not know yet for 
certain whether I shall go with him as far as <settlement>Wadelai</settlement>, but 
I think I shall. Once installed at the <geogName>Falls</geogName>, I shall rebuild 
the stations and summon all the <term type="collective">Arab</term> and <term type="collective">native</term> chiefs to 
a great meeting, at which I shall announce to them my nomination 
as <persName>Governor</persName>, and my intentions. They will 
be surprised, I expect, to see me arrive from this side, for 
the news of my leaving <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> with <persName>Stanley</persName> and of my 
nomination as <persName>Governor</persName> cannot reach <settlement><choice><orig>Nyangoué</orig><reg>Nyangwe</reg></choice></settlement> and 
<region>Central <bloc>Africa</bloc></region> in less than four or five months, and I shall 
arrive at the <geogName>Falls</geogName> before that time. When order is 
re<!-- - -->established at the <geogName>Falls</geogName>, I shall probably undertake a 
commercial expedition to <settlement><choice><orig>Nyangoué</orig><reg>Nyangwe</reg></choice></settlement> and the <region>Lake
region</region>."</p>
<p>The <term type="collective">Arab</term> chief's real name is <persName>Hamed-ben-Hamed</persName>, the 
<hi rend="italic">sobriquet</hi> of <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName> having been given to him owing to 
a twitching of the eyelids to which he is subject. The 
best understanding exists between <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName> and <persName>Tippoo 
Tib</persName>, and the latter has already been of great assistance in 
maintaining order among the <term type="collective"><geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> men</term>. Son of an 
<term type="collective">Arab</term> of <geogName>Zanzbiar</geogName>, <persName>Tippoo Tib</persName> detests negroes, and is 
attached to the whites, whom, in conversation, he calls his 
<term type="collective">European</term> brothers.</p>
