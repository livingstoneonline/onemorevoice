62 days, at about the rate of 9 or 10 <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> miles daily;

In
standing on the banks of the lake it can be seen across, in the

miles). Several islands were observable in it. On leaving the
<span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">African</span> coast</span> we travelled in a direction for the first month about
two points <abbr>S.</abbr> of where the sun sets, and afterwards continued to
travel exactly in the direction of the setting sun.</p>
<p class="p ">The river called <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Magrazie</span> takes its origin from the lake, and
disembogues itself into the sea between the rivers <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lindy</span> and
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Keelwa</span>; and I am sure the rivers <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lindy</span> and <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Masoryre</span> are
branches from it. Across the lake there is a great trade of ivory,
oil of a red colour, and slaves like those of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Nubia</span>. There is a
trade carried on from the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><abbr>W.</abbr> bank of the lake</span> to the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><abbr>W.</abbr> coast</span>; it
consists of white and blue cotton cloths, and some broad-cloths,
which are bartered for ivory. The time taken to reach the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><abbr>W.</abbr> coast</span>
from the lake is about 6 months. For two trassalors<span>*</span> of beads
you get four of ivory; the beads costing about five dollars per
trassala.</p>
<p class="p ">Never heard of the dwarf human species spoken of: the people
near the lake are fairer than those near the coast. There is a great
sea or swell on the lake when the wind blows fresh: and it is well
known by all the people there that the river which goes through
<span class="country" title="A country.">Egypt</span> takes its source and origin from the lake. The banks of the
lake are composed of sand-hills, thrown up by the waves; the water
is very deep, with great quantities of fish. On the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><abbr>W.</abbr> side of the
lake</span> the name of the tribe is <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Yoah</span>; they are circumcised, and call
themselves <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Mohammedans</span>. Some of the boats are 6 fathoms long,
very narrow, and without sails. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Manumuse</span> (<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Mono-moezi</span>)
are pagans; and both sexes go nearly naked. Near the lake, and
through the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Mono-moezi</span> country</span> there are no horses or camels,
but plenty of asses and a few elephants. In travelling in the
country from the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><abbr>E.</abbr> side</span> to the lake there is no danger; and from
the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><abbr>W.</abbr></span>, by paying a little to the different sultans, they would
forward you with the greatest safety. During the whole distance
the people with the caravan were healthy; they got plenty of
good and cheap food and water. The houses on the road and
at the lake are made of wood, and thatched with grass; no upper
stories, nor is there any chimney. Dogs are very numerous and
troublesome, some of a very large kind.</p>

Gold and silver were abundant in <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Ferttee</span>.</p>
<p class="p ">In his country, he says, there is a great river called <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Ayah</span>,
broader than the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thames</span>. It comes from the <abbr>E.</abbr>, and runs to
the <abbr>W.</abbr> or the setting sun. Its course from his country passed
first through a place called <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Komse</span>, second <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Mongell</span>, third <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Pambe</span>,
and fourth <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Mondell</span>. In his way westward he passed several rivers,
but all smaller, except one about midway; and they all ran in
the direction of and to join the Great River. This river is joined
on both sides by small streams. During the dry season the Great
River is about 3 feet deep. There are no canoes on the Great
River: the people either swim across it or pass it on rafts. During
the rainy season there is plenty of hail; the children pick it up and
put it in their mouths as amusement, as it makes them feel cold:
it lies three or four hours on the ground before melting. Plenty of</p>

<p class="p noindent ">hills, some of them so high as to be always white with snow or hail.
Rain sometimes incessant throughout the year; sometimes dry.
Old people make rain fall—make fires and offerings to bring it.
Many shooting-stars or comets: these run like serpents, and explode.
This takes place before the kings die. Thunder and
lightning very heavy, and very frequent. There are plenty of
elephants and monkeys; the monkeys do no hard work. There
are plenty of cows and horses, but these are never employed in
work. There are plenty of sheep, goats, and tiger-cats. There
is also plenty of fish in the rivers: both men and women catch
them in nets; these nets are made of a kind of grass or hemp.
There are plenty of crocodiles and alligators; the people eat
them, and also the guana: sometimes the crocodile kills people
in the river. There are plenty of large trees and plenty of brush.
The houses are made round; they are built of mud, thatched all
over, and have small fire-places. They have plenty of fowls.
Each kind of stock live separately. They have plenty of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Guinea</span>
corn and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Indian</span> corn; plenty of yams and sweet potatoes of a description
resembling beet-root.</p>
<p class="p ">They have as many wives as they like: the king has ten, or
more. They have many slaves, which are either bought or taken
in war. There are also plenty of yellow and brown people—God
made them as well as the blacks: the brown or red coloured
people come with camels to buy slaves, &amp;c.; these red people
bring the camels in order to carry themselves and their goods.
His country made war with different nations—one called <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Koome</span>,
another <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Korre</span>, a third <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Komante</span>, and a fourth <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Juke</span>: the latter are
marked like the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">New Zealanders</span>. All these nations are black,
and speak different languages. In his country they make images
of wood and worship them: they also pray to stones. The common
people build their images of clay. They also build a large
image with stone; this image only the king and courtiers worship:
they make him like a man, with a hole in one side in order to give
him victuals to eat, consisting of flesh, fowls, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Thomas Wogga</span> is of a deep black colour, but without any of
the real negro countenance, such as the flat nose, thick lips, &amp;c.
He is now considerably advanced in years, but when young must
have been a good-looking man. His country marks are numerous
and full. He describes the general features of his own county, and
of those through which he travelled, with considerable clearness;
but, like every other <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">African</span> black, he can give no explanation
about names of places which are known to us from other quarters,
or of geographical bearings and distances, with any precision, except
as from <abbr>E.</abbr> to <abbr>W.</abbr>, or from the rising to the setting sun, or by
the sun being to the <abbr>N.</abbr> or the <abbr>S.</abbr> of the road.</p>
