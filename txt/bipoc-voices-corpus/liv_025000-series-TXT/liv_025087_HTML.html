  <p>"The Postscript of a Letter received from Mr. Kramer, mentions, that three Boschemen called
    upon them, one of whom had been there before; and they brought with them two natives of a
    different nation, who mentioned, that they had understood they would be likely to hear something
    concerning One whose name was <em>Jesus</em>, which would do them good. They had, for this
    purpose, come on foot a journey of eight or ten days; and, as the road was so difficult and bad,
    they thought something more than Nature must have prompted them to undertake it. They did not
    think themselves worthy to hear of this Name, but yet they were desirous of it, and wished to
    know whether any of those, who understood the doctrine of Christ, would go and instruct their
    countrymen. The brethren answered, that as their number was now reduced to two, by the departure
    of one of their body to Dr. Vanderkemp, they could not go at present; but would answer them more
    fully when they came again, which they said they would do in seventy days, and that their
    request should be complied with, if in their power."</p>
  <br>
  <p>Letters from the South African Missionary Society at the Cape, dated Dec. 22 and 23, 1800,
    state, that brother Kicherer had been tempted with the offer of three parochial livings, but
    that "the virtue of the blood of the cross had enabled him to resist."</p>
  <p>By these letters it appears also, that through the activity of the South African Society, which
    consisted, in the month of August, of two hundred and twenty-nine members, no less than one
    thousand nine hundred heathen had already received instruction, and since that time their number
    has considerably increased. The greater part of these still remain hardened and obstinate in
    their sins; many, however, enquire with many tears for the Lord Jesus, and some feel the
    sanctifying power of his grace.</p>
  <p>The above letters inclosed two from bastard Hottentots, with which we doubt not that the
    friends of the Society, and of the Gospel, will be gratified. The work of God is evidently begun
    among this poor people.</p><br>
  <h4 style="text-align:center">"LETTER OF A BASTARD HOTTENTOT.</h4>
  <h5 style="text-align:center">[Translated from the Dutch.] </h5>
  <p>"Dear Sirs,</p>
  <p>"I can say no other now than that I thank you, dear Sirs, that you have sent to us our dear Mr.
    Kicherer, he is such a dear teacher; he is always the whole day ready to instruct us, and talks
    continually of that dear Lord Jesus, and that is so pleasing. Now how good is that dear Lord to
    us, to send his children to such blind heathens, who never have known the least thing about the
    dear Jesus, and who have done nothing, but continually to sin against him; and to let them tell
    us, that we shall go to Hell, if the dear Lord Jesus does not save us. I have now seen what a
    great sinner I am. All the bushes in the field are not so numerous as all my sins. As I lay down
    to sleep, I grow so frightened that I must get up at once and pray to my dear Lord Jesus, that
    he will forgive my sins. O! was there not the dear Lord Jesus, I should not know now where to go
    to; I know no other place now, than to that dear Lord Jesus. I cannot bear to talk about any
    thing else than of him. It is only of Jesus people must speak to me. One of my sons is become
    the same: he also will die for the Lord Jesus. O! the dear Lord Jesus, how good is he to me that
    he has from so far sent to me that dear man to tell me, that I must be lost, if the blood of
    that dear Lord Jesus does not purify me. I cannot live now without that dear Jesus, and O! how I
    wish that all mankind would fall in love with that dear Jesus. Now farewell, dear Sirs, I wish
    you may always love the dear Jesus; from him every thing is to be had.</p>
