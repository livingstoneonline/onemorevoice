  TRIALS OF CONVERTS IN INDIA.
  IN our last Number we adverted to the trials and bitter persecutions
    which converts from Hinduism have to endure at the hands fo their
    own friends and relatives; and we introduced the Rev. B. Geidt's account
    of a young Brahamin convert at Burdwan as illustrative of this.
    We now add another case, that of Shrinath Ghose. The account is
    contained in a letter from the Rev. Jagadishwar Bhattachargya, of the
    Free Church of Scotland, Calcutta, to a lady in Edinburgh.
  
    In my last letter I mentioned to you that there was a very hopeful inquirer
    with me, who would soon come forward to enter into the church
    of Christ by baptism. He did come, and was received into the church
    on the first Sabbath of the year. But what has happened to him since
    will extremely grieve you to hear, as it did me and all my friends.
    Shortly after his baptism, Shrinath&#8212;for that is the young man's name&#8212;was
      sent up to Bansbaria, that he might remain with me during our vacation,
      or accompany me to a preaching tour if I went into the interior.
      The day after his arrival his mother came to see him, and oh, what a
      scene took place that morning&#8212;a scene one does not like to witness if he
      can help it! With slow and trembling steps the mother entered our
      Mission compound, and the moment she saw her son she flung herself
      upon his neck, and set up a most terrible howling. Her cries, her
      shrieks, the beating of her breast, and tearing her hair, drew floods of
      tears from the spectators who stood around the afflicted parent and her
      son.
    After her feelings had a little subsided, she urged every argument and
      entreaty in her power to persuade her son to go back to heathenism; but
      finding they were ineffectual, she stretched herself on the bare ground,
      and raised another most piteous howling; at which the friends who accompanied
      her from her village conveyed her to a quiet place, and
      endeavored to comfort her.
    It appears, next day she went to her village, with a view evidently to
      consult with her friends and relatives how she might best take away
      Shrinath from us. After a week, she returned with some men, and
      made an attempt to carry him away by force. The second day she
      repeated almost the very same things she did in her first interview&#8212;the
      same sort of howling, the same arguments and entreaties as before, and
      with the same success, for she was unable to shake the resolution of
      her son. Her design was to decoy him into the public street, that
      she might have an opportunity to carry him away into her village; but
      in this she was also disappointed.
    Perceiving her wicked intentions, I thought it prudent to remove
      Shrinath from this place, and accordingly the next morning I took him
      down to Calcutta, and put him in the Mission-house with our native
      brethren. Scarcely three days have elapsed. Behold the mother maketh
      her appearance thither, and, by her fair but false professions, completely
      disarmed all suspicions from the mind of her son regarding her designs.
      Her proceedings there were managed with such deep and consummate
      subtlety as to deceive the most wary and experienced. No wonder, then,
      that Shrinath, a youth of twenty, should fall into her snare. She first
      took a lodging near the Mission premises, and frequently came to see her
      son, and allowed him to do the same without molestation. Shrinath, at
      first, never went to see her without being accompanied by one or two of
      the brethren. After a week, she removed her lodging to a place about
      a mile distant from the convert's premises, and desired her son to
      visit her there as often as he liked. Shrinath visited her once or twice
      in her new abode, accompanied by a Mission servant, and came back
      without suspecting any bad motive in her. The last time he went
      to see her he was seized, and forcibly carried away to his native
      village, and is to this moment detained in her custody. It appears
      she collected some of her friends that are in Calcutta, and, by their
      assistance, effected her purpose. Shrinath is now a close prisoner,
      through no chains are put on him. He is not allowed the liberty to
      come out of the house, but must remain confined in the zenana, or inner
      department. No person can have access to him without a special permission
      from the mother: no message can reach him without it being
      first made known to her. Day and night he is closely watched.
    You can easily conceive what must have been my feelings when I heard
      of this transaction. Immediately I went down to Calcutta to consult with
      Mr. Mackay, and other European friends, what steps should be adopted
      for the rescue of the new convert. Many of them advised me not to take
      any legal measures, but to leave the whole case in his hands of Providence,
      trusting that the Lord will deliver him in His own time.
    After my return from Calcutta, I sent a private message to Shrinath,
      but unfortunately it could not be delivered. At present I see no means
      of his immediate deliverance, unless the Lord, in His infinite mercy,
      interpose on behalf of His servants.
    By all the reports hitherto reached me, I exceedingly rejoice to learn
      that Shrinath is continuing firm in faith, and bearing testimony to "the
      truth as it is in Jesus" in the midst of all his trials.
  
  Hindu converts sacrifice much that they may be wholly for Christ.
    What sacrifices do we make as evidences of our thankfulness that, in
    following out the convictions of our conscience, we have no such difficulties
    and hindrances to contend against? Is the knowledge of
    salvation through a Saviour's blood a treasure which we prize? and
    are we proving the value we set upon it by the diligent efforts we 
    are making to bring that treasure within the reach of others?
