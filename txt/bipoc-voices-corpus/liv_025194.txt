Warning: Readers should exercise caution when consulting this text and others published by the “BIPOC Voices” project due to the possible inclusion of offensive or otherwise problematic historical language. Readers should also take note that any racist or similar elements in the texts do not necessarily represent the real views of the BIPOC creator(s), but rather may be due to the (often silent) intervention of Victorian-era white British missionaries, editors, and publishers.

  [...]
  The following is an extract received by Mr. Davis some time since from the Rev. James Lewana,
    the Native Minister who was left by Mr. Davis in charge of the native Circuit in
    Graham's Town, where he was labouring previous to his leaving Africa on a visit England.
  "To me it is a matter of much thankfulness to God to hear how the hand of the Lord has brought
    you and your family safely through those great waters, to again see you friends, and the land
    from which God the Spirit called you to come and tell us the way to salvation; we who were in
    great darkness, as all our fathers were in time past; but now light has begun to shine among us
    through your ministrations and others in the Gospel of Christ, and for which we all give thanks
    to Him who is Lord over all things. Since you left me in charge of this Circuit I have see the
    mighty power of God in calling sinners to repentance, and to Himself. Both in Graham's Town and
    Spring Vale, and at Assagai Bush, many have been converted from their heathenism, and have
    joined the classes; at Assagai Bush fifty are joined to the Society, and at Spring Vale, a new
    place, ten have been publicly baptized, and eleven are on trial, and here in Graham's Town our
    members have increased, and our subscriptions also. We have just held our Missionary meeting,
    and Brother Charles Pamla came from Peddie to help at our services. A very good work took place,
    and many found the blessing of peace with God. The number converted during our Missionary
    services is fifty, who have all begun to meet in class. Thus has God wrought for us, and we
    thank Him for His great goodness in thus blessing our labours, and bringing souls from among the
    heathen to the knowledge of the truth of Christ, which is able to save the soul."
