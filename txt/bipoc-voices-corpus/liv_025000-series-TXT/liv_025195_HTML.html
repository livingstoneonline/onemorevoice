<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em>Extracts from Letters of the Rev. Charles Pamla, to the Rev. Robert Lamplough, Graham's Town, dated May and July, 1872.</em></h5>
<p>I HAVE just settled down in the Tsomo Mission house, under the superintendence of the Rev. E. J. Barrett, at Butterworth. On my journey I called at Kamastone, and preached there one Sunday, morning and afternoon. The power of God came down upon the people: many came forward and got good. You see that I am sent to a very dangerous place, where there is a great battle, and my Superintendent lives many miles away. Please, Sir, to pray for me very much, that God may bless my labour in this place, as He has done in others. There seems to be a good feeling. By the help of God, I hope to see a very good work next Sunday. The work has already commenced. An Englishman was converted last night in my house. He had been seeking the Lord since last Sunday, and last night was soundly converted, and slept in my house. He is going to meet in class now. I have a very good work here. If I had a little time with you, I should be able to preach in English with ease. More than twenty sinners have been saved here at the station alone. </p>
