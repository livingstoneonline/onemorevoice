  <h5 style="text-align: center;">NEW ZEALAND.</h5>
  <p>N<small class="small">OWHERE</small> has the power of the Gospel more remarkably displayed
    itself than in New Zealand. The Natives in their heathen state
    were accustomed to tattoo their faces. The marks once made
    could never be removed; and the features were disfigured, and
    deprived of the expression which God had put upon them. This
    practice in a figure explain how sin had spoiled the character of
    this people. The crimes they practised, war and cannibalism,
    made them hideous to look upon. But very many amongst them
    have been "transformed by the renewing of their mind:" they have
    put on Christ and been renewed in knowledge, righteousness,
    and true holiness. A pleasing instance of this is mentioned by the
    Rev. R.David in one of his late Journals.</p>
  <p>A Chief named Maika, of Mangakahia, together with several of
    his people, was baptized a year back. Anxious to see how he was
    getting on, Mr. Davis recently visited his Pa. He found there
    proofs of rapid improvement. A new, decent, slab chapel had
    been built, sufficient to accommodate a hundred people. Many
    of the Chief's young men had learned to read the Scriptures correctly;
    and nearly the whole of his people, both old and young,
    were well acquainted with the Church Catechism. A great change
    had taken place in the neighbourhood. Of course, like all other
    persons who try to do good service to Christ, he met with difficulties,
    which only served to show more clearly the reality of his
    Christian character. Some vicious young men, who had fallen
    away from their Christian profession, had resolved on taking possession
    of some rich land in the neighbourhood, which the owner,
    an elderly Chief and a Christian, whom Maika calls his elder
    brother, had kindly permitted them to cultivate for a time. The
    old Chief was angry; and serious consequences might have followed,
    had not Maika interposed. He warned his old friend that
    this was a device of the enemy to hinder him in his Christian
    course, and recommended him to suffer evil, and give up the land.
    The young men, ignorant of what was going forward, and supposing,
    from Maika's friendship for the old Chief, that he would
    take part with him in the quarrel, came to his place to challenge
    him. Maika soon undeceived them, and spoke to them most
    closely on their falling away.</p>
  <p>The Society, on the occasion of the Jubilee, addressed a Letter to
    its Native Converts throughout the world. Amongst other places,
    it reached Mr. Davis's district in New Zealand. It was read to the
    Native Christians, who were much pleased with it, especially the
    Mangakahia Chief Maika, who sent back the following answer&#8212;</p>

  <p>This is my love to you [in thus writing] that you may know that I
    love you in Jesus Christ. There is a God above who has caused my
    children to grow [in that which is good]. I have considered my salvation
    to be of God, because His loving-kindness toward this land has been
    great: yes, His love to this land has been very great, and the people of
    this Island have been much strengthened from the clothing of the Holy
    Spirit. On this account my heart loves my Father which is in Heaven,
    because He has given, through your gracious design, [His] saving grace
    to this Island. It is true, it was from the Missionaries you sent that
    we heard the words of this salvation. And my prayer to God is, to
    strengthen my heart and my body by His Holy Spirit, that I may be
    sacred to Him, in order that I may be strong to give the saving word to
    my children, to my fathers, and to all the people of my place. I am well
    acquainted with the wickedness of the world: it is my desire to cast off
    the world with all its evil. Let Christ [now] be a Father to me and to
    my children. When I go to God [in prayer] He pours His loving-
    kindness into my heart: He is the spring of the water of life: these are
    the riches I am seeking after. As soon as I was baptized I built a House
    of Prayer for my people, and fenced it in: I am now waiting to receive a
    bell from you. Be gracious, and send a bell for the House of Prayer&#8212;a
    calling voice for my children both morning and evening.</p>

  <p>It was in this year of Jubilee that your Letter came to our Minister,
    Mr. Davis. He is wise in looking into our sins, and in proclaiming to
    us the Word of God. Mr. Marsden was the first messenger to us wicked
    people of New Zealand: the second messengers were Mr. Williams and
    Mr. Davis: these are the elders of the Church in this country. The
    desire of my heart with regard to your words is, that I may seriously
    consider them in my mind: the consideration must be an inward one.
    And I pray to the Father to help me&#8212;to give me earnestness in prayer to
    Him, and the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. I rejoice at your words,
    which come, through you, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who is
    the director of all things in heaven and earth. You are the sanctified
    people of that God. Jehovah has chosen you to devise means whereby
    His Word may be disseminated. My heart's desire is, to bow down and
    cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner," a sinful man. O God, Thou hast
    seen, Thou knowest my ignorance, nor are my sins hid from Thee!
    "Search me, and see if there be any wicked way in me." I will smite
    upon my breast and say, "God be merciful to me a sinner." Yes, you
    shall behold me, and I shall behold you, at the last day, although some
    are living in the north, south, east, and west.</p>
