Warning: Readers should exercise caution when consulting this text and others published by the “BIPOC Voices” project due to the possible inclusion of offensive or otherwise problematic historical language. Readers should also take note that any racist or similar elements in the texts do not necessarily represent the real views of the BIPOC creator(s), but rather may be due to the (often silent) intervention of Victorian-era white British missionaries, editors, and publishers.

  Day-Spring in the Far West.
   Sketches of Mission Work in British North America.
  
  IX.&#8212Results of the Work.
  [...]
  Again, the effect of the faith in the heart is manifested by these Christian Indians in their
    hour of death. The Rev. H. Budd, himself a first-fruit of the Indian people, writes from
    Cumberland:&#8212;
  "I went to visit a poor woman who has been suffering
    a long time;
    she suffers patiently and submissively. Asking her whom she trusted in,
    she replied, 'None but the Saviour.' 'Have you any fear of death?'
    'Not while the Saviour is with me.' 'What is the Saviour to you?' 'He
    is everything to me.'"
    [...]
    From Devon, Mr. Budd writes in 1872:&#8212;
    "I am thankful to be able
      to say, that if the Devon
      Indians are improving in their
      temporal condition, they are,
      I humbly trust, no less im-
      proving in their spiritual. If
      we may judge of the tree by
      its fruit, I witness enough to make me hope that they are
      growing in the Divine life,
      and increasing in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
      An increasing thirst for the
      Word of God is manifest by
      their regular attendance on
      the preached Word; their
      punctual attendance on all the
      means of grace; as well by the
      labour and toil they will take
      in travelling so far in the cold
      and snow to be present at each
      returning Sacrament day.
      Christ Church tells that the
      population in Devon is growing; it is sometimes full to
      overflowing. The regularity
      of the responses in the services, and the hearty singing,
      show that the congregation
      understand and value the services. The Cumberland House
      Indians have begun to build
      houses for themselves like the Devon Indians. Here they assemble on
      Sundays, and, as many of them can read in their own language, they have
      their books both Prayer-book and the New Testament, and can hold
      regular services among themselves."
