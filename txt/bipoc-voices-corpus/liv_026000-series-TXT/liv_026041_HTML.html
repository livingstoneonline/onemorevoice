  <p>Mr. Mathaniel M. Bull, Native Catechist at Prince Alfred's Town, in Timneh Country, near Sierra
    Leone, writes:&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">A week ago two Lokkoh men came to me on a visit. I
    drew them to
    converse much about sacred things. I told them that there is no man on
    earth that sinneth not, and therefore no one has a right to heaven, the
    place where there is no sin.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">Upon this the Mende man says, "All living men are
    committing sin
    (and God weighs the sins and righteousness of all men), and should your
    sins which you have committed surpass the good, if you die on the
    morrow, you will go to hell; but should the good outweigh the evil, and
    you die on the morrow, you will be taken by God to heaven." This, sir,
    is the ground upon which all Mende men stand to go to heaven.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">I here call the aid of Rev. C. B. Leupolt's parable
    (C. M. S. Gleaner,
    May number, page 50), changing the local words <em>Baboo, rupees, fakeer.</em>
    I turned it to Mende. It met a singular success; after this I propose
    the way of salvation by Jesus Christ alone.</p>
