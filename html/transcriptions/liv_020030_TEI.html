<hr class="milestone halfline quarterline center ">
<p class="p ">My friend <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom Moody</span> was a very fair sample of that class which is
now-a-days called the old time <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Plantocracy</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> had his faults as
well as many a worse man, but if his failings were many, his virtues
were not less numerous.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hospitable almost to extravagance was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>
and as charitable a soul as ever breathed the breath of Heaven.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He
was honorable too, strictly honorable in his dealings with the world;
but Heaven help the poor devil who might have been discovered in an
endeavour to deceive him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> had no mercy for such rascally delinquents, as he termed them; and if they happened
to be persons
over whom he had any control—his slaves for instance—he would flog
them to within an inch of their lives.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> was fond of using the cat—that terrific foe to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Quashie</span>'s peace of mind and corporeal
comfort—on the contrary, I never knew a planter who took less
advantage of his power over his human cattle than did <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>—but he
administered the castigation by way of medicine as he said—and the
stronger the dose the better for the patient.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" 'Tis</span> all for his good,
the <span class="seg word "><span class="italic "><em>nagur</em></span>, "</span> he once observed to me, on his return from witnessing the
punishment of one of his people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" It's</span> all for his good, poor
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Pompey</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If I let him alone he would rob every cane off the property and damn his soul to eternity.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So you see, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Joe</span>, my boy, I'm only endeavouring to rescue his soul from the clutches of his cousin,
the
devil; but I dare say the scoundrel hasn't a piece of gratitude to give
me in return for my <span class="seg word ">kindness. "</span></p>
<p class="p ">It was about this period, during a rather lengthy sojourn at
<span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place."><span class="seg word ">" Moody's</span> <span class="seg word ">Hill, "</span></span> that the following circumstances came under my
observation.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> had a favorite slave, a good-looking, glossy-skinned negro—called <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lycurgus</span>; but notwithstanding <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>'s partiality for the<br>
<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center caps ">Or the Old Time Busha.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span class="seg right ">31</span></span>
fellow and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s apparent affection for his master, the latter had of
late begun to entertain some suspicion of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s fidelity.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>'s
mind was rather prejudiced against him by another slave of his, whose
petty tattling, like a great horse fly, kept constantly buzzing about
the ears of his master, much to the injury of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> who was entirely
ignorant of all that was going forward to his prejudice.</p>
<p class="p ">One morning <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> appeared before his master, his head bound up
with an old handkerchief and looking very ill and flurried.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" What's</span> the matter <span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>, "</span> said <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, while his eyes sparkled
with a peculiar meaning.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" What's</span> the matter to-day? You haven't
seen a ghost have <span class="seg word ">you? "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> groaned, and shuddered till his very teeth rattled against
each other.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" What</span> the devil is the matter with the <span class="seg word ">man, "</span> continued <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, his
anger fast getting the better of his patience.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" Tell</span> me directly, sir;
is it a duppy or the devil that you have <span class="seg word ">seen? "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Ah!</span> <span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span>, "</span> replied <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>, <span class="seg word ">" dats</span> the ting sar: <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> nearly dead, <span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span>; "</span> and then he entered into a long rambling explanation, half of which was <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Greek</span> to me, of his having seen the <span class="seg word ">" perit "</span> of his <span class="seg word ">" grandy "</span> and of his having been warned by it of his approaching death.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The result of his lachrymose tale was a hearty roar of laughter from his master and
myself, and an injunction from the former to go about his business, and to take care
that he was after no tricks.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> departed muttering and groaning, and I thought no more of the matter.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Towards evening, however, while <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> and myself were discussing a jorum of excellent sangaree, one of the old woman who
usually performed the duties of nurse to the sick slaves, made her appearance, and
intimated that<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> was quite bad, and that she thought he would not outlive the night.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> was rather startled, and rose immediately to satisfy himself as to the truth of the
old woman's report.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We proceed together to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s quarters, where, extended on a mat spread on the bare earthen floor, lay the unfortunate
victim of superstition.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We were much struck by the change which a few <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: hours'">hour's</u> illness had made in the appearance of the poor fellow.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He replied not a word to the many questions put to him by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, but continued groaning and rocking himself from side to side during the whole time
of our visit.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> then quitted the hut for the purpose of compounding more medicine for the sufferer,
and I followed him to the great house where on our arrival we found <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s rival, the slave alluded to, his face beaming with the importance of a great secret.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We were about to pass him when he attracted our attention by a low sly chuckle, and
with a request to be heard for a few minutes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> bade him follow us, and in a short time he was delivered of his secret, apparently
much to his own satisfaction and the annoyance of his master.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I never saw <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> so much moved before.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One fit of passion has scarcely subsided when he fell into another.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As, however, the greatest tempest will at last settle down into a calm, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>'s <br>
<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg left ">32</span> <span class="seg center caps "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s Funeral,<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>
rage gradually decreased by its very violence.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At last he turned to me and in a stern, quiet manner observed,</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Since</span> he will, it shall be so—the ungrateful <span class="seg word ">scoundrel. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" For</span> Heaven's sake, <span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, "</span> I said, alarmed by the cool determination expressed in his countenance, <span class="seg word ">" for</span> Heaven's sake no <span class="seg word ">violence. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Don't</span> be <span class="seg word ">frightened "</span> he replied, <span class="seg word ">" I will</span> only pay him in his own <span class="seg word ">coin "</span>; so saying he opened his medicine chest and took out a bottle containing a dark ruby-colored
fluid.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He pouted about half an ounce of it into a glass, and then he set down the bottle
on the table, I saw that it was labelled Laudanum.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My heart sunk as I read the inscription, and I started up to divert him from his dreadful
purpose.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, "</span> said I, almost chocked by my feeling, <span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span></span>, this is cold-blooded and deliberate murder, and I will not be a party to so foul
and dreadful a deed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. <span class="seg word ">Moody, "</span></span> I continued perceiving that he heeded not my remonstrances, <span class="seg word ">" this</span> place is no longer a fit abode for an honest man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I feel it my duty to inform you, that not even our long established friendship shall
secure you from the consequences of the deed you are about to commit, so far as I
am concerned.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Be warned in time, ere it be too <span class="seg word ">late. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Joe</span> "</span> he replied in the same quiet tone which had so much alarmed me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" I</span> honor you for your feelings, but I must at the same time inform you that you are
making a great fool of yourself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What,in the name of heaven, do you take me to be?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Do you suppose that I could for one moment, entertain the dreadful purpose which you
attribute to me?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I assure you on the honor of a gentleman, that I intended no further harm to the ungrateful
scoundrel, than to punish him that he shall remember, to the day of his death, which
for aught I care may be a thousand years hence, his attempt to deceive a confiding
master. This bottle is wrongly labelled; you may convince yourself by smelling its
<span class="seg word ">contents. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Your</span> word is sufficient, my dear fellow, and I can only ask you to pardon my unjust suspicions;
at the same time you must allow that I was somewhat justified in entertaining <span class="seg word ">them. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Say</span> not another word, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Joe</span>, but wait patiently and see the <span class="seg word ">result. "</span></p>
<p class="p ">He had by this time completed his task, and requesting me to follow him, once more
preceded to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s cottage.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was now about eight o'clock.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There was no moon, but the stars twinkled merrily in the heavens, while the cool night
wind struck through me with a chill which made me glad enough to button up my coat
to my throat.</p>
<p class="p ">A single tallow candle, stuck in the neck of a bottle, cast an uncertain light in
the room occupied by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>'s patient.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He took no notice of us when we entered, and until <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> called to him, he remained on his miserable bed as if the hand of death were already
laid on him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The sound of his master's voice seemed, however to arouse him, for be turned towards
us, and in low tremulous accents expressed his thanks for our attention.</p>
<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center caps ">Or The Old Time Busha.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span class="seg right ">33</span></span>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Here,</span> <span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> "</span> said <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>,<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" I</span> have brought you some physic which will make yon well in no time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Get up, if you can, and take <span class="seg word ">it. "</span></p>
<p class="p ">He could not, however, rise without assistance; but being aided by the old black nurse,
he contrived to sit up and to take the medicine from his master's hand.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Ah</span> <span class="seg word "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span> "</span> he said, <span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span></span> fraid physic come too late.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jumbi</span> tronger dan you po' boy.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nebber min', <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span>, me will take fo' please <span class="seg word ">you "</span> and he swallowed the bitter draught.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> sat down by the bed-side to watch the result of his
prescription.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He had not long to wait.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the course of a few minutes <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s body was as convulsed as if it had been under the action of a
powerful galvanic machine: his eyes protruded from their sockets, and his mouth opened
and shut with wonderful rapidity, while his hands grasped the scanty coverlet as if
he were in the agonies of the death struggle.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not a muscle of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>'s countenance moved during all this time, but when <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> started up—without assistance this time—and the whole of the contents of his stomach
were poured forth through his mouth, the face of his master bore that expression which
we might suppose the countenance of the devil to wear when he regards the torments
of the damned.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> was writhing under the effects of a powerful emetic—the liquid which I had mistaken
for laudanum having been a strong dose of ipecacuanha wine.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Poor <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>! How he tossed, and heaved his body, and rolled his great staring eyes, and put out
his long red tongue until I thought it would have been torn off at the root.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For more than an hour he suffered indescribable torture; and when at last, (his stomach
having thrown up every drop of the terrible medicine,) and his sufferings having in
consequence subsided, he threw himself back on his pillow, the extent of his previous
agony might have been plainly seen on his distorted features.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> at length prepared to leave the cottage, but the punishment
which poor <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> had already suffered did not seem to satisfy his master.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A horrible idea had entered his head.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span></span> will die during the night, I <span class="seg word ">suppose, "</span> he said to the old woman <span class="seg word ">" and</span> as I wish the funeral to take place at an early hour, I will at once order the estate's
carpenter to make his coffin.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See that everything is prepared. And let me know the exact time when he <span class="seg word ">dies. "</span></p>
<p class="p ">The old woman curtesied her willingness to comply with her
master's orders; and we were about to leave the cottage, when <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> mustered sufficient strength to request <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> to remain a little longer as he had something to say to him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moody</span> immediately returned to
his bedside, and patiently awaited the expected communication.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Massa</span>,"</span> began <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>, <span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span></span>, me no bin always a good boy to you, <span class="seg word ">sa?

<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span></span> da dead, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span>; him can't sarve you any mo'; him hoe
bruk and him cutlass dull—so, if <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span> please, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> would like to
die a free man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Pose <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">massa</span> gib <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> him free paper now, him will die <span class="seg word ">happy. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Don't</span> say another word, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>, you shall have <span class="seg word ">it "</span>; then turning towards me, he requested that I would go to the great house for pens,
ink, and paper.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In five minutes the writing materials were
forthcoming, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, placing the paper on the top of his hat, wrote a few words, folded the paper and
put it in the hands of the emancipated negro.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The eyes of the black sparkled with delight as he clutched the deed which conferred
on him his freedom; he poured forth a thousand thanks for his master's kindness, in
the middle of which we quitted the hut and returned to the great house.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Neither <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> nor myself, however, retired to rest.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The former's scheme remained yet to be completed and put in execution, and the morning's
light found us busily engaged in the preparations for <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s funeral.</p>
<p class="p ">By eight o'clock all was completed—the coffin made, the shroud prepared and everything
else that was necessary in readiness—even the grave was dug.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All being in excellent train, we proceeded to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s cottage, preceded by a dozen negroes carrying the funeral gear.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> was still lying where we had left him, but the entrance of so many persons caused
him to turn round towards them. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> however, and the negroes who accompanied him, the latter of whom were well tutored,
appeared not to take any notice of his having stirred.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> was supposed to be dead; and all that remained to be done was to bury him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Accordingly four stout strong fellows raised <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> upright on the bed and commenced to strip him of his clothes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether it was that the dead man was frightened into insensibility by the imposing
preparations, or whether he was too weak from the effects of the emetic to make any
resistance, I am not prepared to say; but he lay like a log in the hands of the negroes,
by whom he was speedily dressed in his grave-clothes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I had donned an old gray dressing gown, and with a <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Johnson</span>'s dictionary in my hand, stood ready to act the part of the parson.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Still <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> moved not.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The coffin was brought in—he seemed not to see it: he was placed in it, and yet was
insensible of what was being done—but when the lid was about to be put on, then, and
not till then, did <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> afford any <br>
<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center caps ">Or the Old Time Busha.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> <span class="seg right ">35</span></span>
evidence of his being a living man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He yelled, he shrieked, cursed,
swore, tore the grave-clothes, and struggled so manfully, that it was with the utmost
difficulty he was forced down into the coffin, and that the lid, in which several
small holes were bored, was slightly fastened
down.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The old nurse, too, seemed to have been half mad at the extraordinary proceedings.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She declared that the poor boy was not dead—and that we were committing murder.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, however, silenced her by saying that the boy was dead, and that it was only the
jumbi of his grandy which had appeared to him, that had entered his body and was playing
such tricks.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The old woman believed this probable explanation, and was immediately quieted.</p>
<p class="p ">The procession now moved towards the grave, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Caesar</span> acting as chief mourner, and to show the extent of his grief, grinning until every
one of his white teeth was seen—gums and all.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But how can I describe the scene which took place when the coffin was lowered into
grave.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>, who had not ceased his exertions while he was being borne along to free himself
from his unnatural position, no sooner heard the first shovel full of earth upon the
coffin, than fear lent him the strength of a giant; with one powerful kick he knocked
off the top of the coffin—started up before we had time to hold him—and fled away
as if the devil was at his heels, the whole troop of negroes following helter skelter
after him.</p>
<p class="p ">A week elapsed before we heard anything of the resuscitated <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>
and then he was in ——— work-house, whither he had been taken
as a runaway slave.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His free paper which he kept, was of no use to
him; for it only bore these words :—<span class="seg word ">" My</span> black scoundrel
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lycurgus</span>, otherwise called <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>, has it in contemplation, as I have been
informed, to obtain his freedom from me by means of a trick. Should he succeed in
his attempt, this is to request the friends of the undersigned to lodge the rascal
in the nearest house of correction until he is sent for.</p>
