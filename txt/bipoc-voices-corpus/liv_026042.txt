  A Negro Clergyman at Nazareth.
  WE mentioned
    some months
    ago that the
    Rev. Henry
    Johnson, one
    of the Sierra Leone Native
    clergy, was studying Arabic
    in Palestine, with a view to
    cope with the active Mohammedan
    emissaries who
    are trying to spread their
    blighting faith&#8212;if such a
    fatalistic system can be
    called a "faith"&#8212;in West
    Africa. Mr. Johnson has
    spent most of his time in
    Jersualem, where he could
    have competent teachers;
    but he lately made a tour
    northward to recruit his
    health. His impressions
    of Nazareth and the Mission
    there will interest our 
    readers:&#8212;
  
  Night had closed in upon
    us when we arrived at Nazareth. Nothing could have been
    more lovely than the peculiar
    brilliancy of the moon that
    night. She wanted but wo
    days to the full. Our way being diversified by alternations
    of hill and dale, the ride proved
    extremely interesting. Now,
    the moon is shaded by a hill,
    now she bursts upon us with
    increased lustre, and so she
    continued playing at bo-peep
    with us as it were: the effect
    was strikingly beautiful. At
    about a quarter past seven P.M. I was safely lodged under the hospitable
    roof of Mr. Zeller.
  Nazareth impressed me most favourably. I could wish I had had a
    longer time to spend there, that I might have studied for myself the manners and customs of the
    inhabitants, and form my own theories and conclusions. But this I hope yet to do at some future
    occasion.
  I made no excursions to places which are easily accessible from Nazareth, as, not being
    sufficiently strong, I did not consider it prudent to
    yield to the temptation, lest I should have a relapse. The next best thing
    I did was to ascend with Mr. Zeller and Mr. Huber one of the hills by
    which Nazareth is encompassed, and from the highest point I gained a
    most delightful panoramic view of a large extent of country. Mount
    Tabor, raising majestically above other hills, first attracted my attention.
    Then at a distance I saw Mount Gilboa. From another point I could take
    in nearly the whole range of Carmel. The great plain of Esdrealon, reaching far, was distinctly
    visible; and several places were pointed out, but I
    could not exactly take all in at the moment, confused as I was by the
    new character in which the Bible history appeared to my wondering
    gaze.
  During my stay I had an opportunity of seeing together many of the
    members of Mr. Zeller's congregation. His Sunday Bible-class was converted into a kind of
    missionary meeting, at which I was present to give
    an account of the work of the Society in West Africa. The meeting was
    quite packed, and all seemed much interested in hearing the accounts I
    gave of the wonders which God has wrought by His servants amongst a
    once degraded people. Mr. Huber, formerly a missionary at Badagry,
    interpreted my address. Mr. Huber still retains a strong affection for
    Africa; and never is he more interested or more communicative than
    when conversation turns upon Missions in West Africa.
  The earnest attention paid by the people to the
    address&#8212;their hearty
    and harmonious singing&#8212;their devout attitude when prayers were being
    offered up&#8212;all struck me forcibly, and convinced me of the real work
    that is being carried on at Nazareth, amid discouraging influences of
    various kinds. On another occasion I met the women of Mr. Zeller's
    sewing-party, to whom I made a few remarks.
  The day before I left I was privileged to see another most deeply interesting department of the
    Society's work. I accompanied Mr. Zeller
    to the schools to witness an examination of the children. First of all I
    was taken to the Preparandi students. They were examined in Scripture,
    grammar, and geography. I was quite pleased to observe how thoughtfully they answered the
    questions put to them. Evidently they had been
    taught to think before speaking, and hence they appeared to know what
    they were about. After a good hour's catechising, they took up their
    violins, and three of them performed most creditably on the instrument.
  We went next to the boy's day-school. There were nearly 100 children present, the countenances
    of many of whom wore marks of high
    intelligence. The examination was conducted partly by Mr. Zeller, and
    partly by the native deacon and the schoolmaster. It was soon manifest
    to me that Scripture was the children's forte. The first class astonished
    me by giving, with hardly the slightest perceptible hesitation, the con-
    tents of each chapter of the Gospel of St. Luke and the Acts of the
    Apostles. It is a fact which I fancy many who are older than they can
    never perform with even an approximate readiness. Of course everything
    was done in Arabic. Pointing out places on the map of America was
    another branch of their performances. To make matters short&#8212;the children showed off most
    creditably, and no one could have witnessed the examination without feeling inclined to give a
    just need of praise to the
    teachers, who have evidently been doing their doty. As an old school-
    master myself, I know the nature of the difficulties which have first to be
    overcome before pupils are sufficiently presentable to the critical eye of
    strangers. We finished by paying a visit to the infant school. I have
    already said that I was pleased with Nazareth; I was not at all disappointed at its appearance.
  At Nazareth He was brought up who came down from heaven for our
    salvation. That retired spot was well suited to Him for preserving an
    absolute obscurity while the period of preparation lasted. I tried now and
    then to abstract my thoughts from present local surroundings, in order to
    fix them upon scenes and objects painted by the imagination as probably those amid which He had
    lived and moved. I did not require adventitious aids such as those with Franciscan monks were
    ready
    to supply out of the Church of the Annunciation (so called) to kindle
    emotion, or to deepen a pious and reverential feeling for the home of the
    despised Nazarene. I came away after a brief stay of three days, full of
    thankfulness for the privilege I had enjoyed of visiting a spot which, for
    sacred associations, takes its rank among such places as Bethlehem and
    Capernaum and Jerusalem&#8212;places which have derived their importance
    principally from events that occurred in them at various periods of the
    Saviour's life.
  As regards the Society's work which is being carried on by their faithful
    missionaries, I can speak, with my limited means of observation, in terms of
    the highest encouragement. Considering the adverse influences at work,
    one is surprised to find that instead of being altogether neutralised, the
    work is daily gaining a fresh accession of strength. Schools are a great
    instrument of good in Mission work, as I can testify from experience;
    and therefore I look forward without any misgivings to the future of
    the work at Nazareth. The instruments which are being imparted to the
    children are solid in character, and much leavened with the moral teachings of a pure Gospel,
    and therefore, under God's blessing, success must
    follow. I do not pretend that there is not much to discourage the heart
    of the earnest missionary. It will not be supposed that I have been de-
    scribing a Utopian state of perfection. No; on the contrary, the object
    of my remarks is simply to show that there being so many features of
    hopeful interest apparent, efforts should be more earnestly and willingly
    put forth to extend and consolidate the work, both at Nazareth itself and
    in the out-stations, that so, instead of being confined, the blessing may
    reach the many thousands who are still ignorant of the redemption
    wrought out long ago by the Saviour in this land of His birth, His
    sufferings, and His death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HENRY JOHNSON.
