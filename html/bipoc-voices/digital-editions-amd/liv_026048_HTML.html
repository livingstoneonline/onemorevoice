  <h3 class="center">April, 1875</h3>
  <h4 class="center">Sick and Dying Christians in Yoruba.</h4>
  <p>The year which I now hold in review opened upon us with sore trials.
    The Lord was most graciously pleased to beckon home to the heavenly
    rest two of His dear children from our midst.</p>
  <p>
    1. Maria Ekidan, a most zealous and devoted sister, left us rather
    bruptly for the world above, as if saying still to us, "Thus a Christian
    ought to live, and thus to die." She was an Egba, converted by the
    ministry of the late Rev. Thomas King, at Abeokuta. It was her zeal
    for the glory of God, and her love for souls, which made her a resident of
    this place. She came here some time before the outbreak in Abokuta,
    of 1867, and though she paid two or three visits to her relations in that
    place, yet she returned again as if to spend her remaining life here.
    She had often signified to me how strongly the incredulity of Badagry
    resembled hers in her heathen state, and that nothing short of infinite
    mercy could save her; that as a heathen she was so much bigoted and
    fierce, that nobody dared to speak a word to her about God, and that she
    did much to hurt the cause of God, hated and persecuted all who aban-
    doned their idols and became Christians. Therefore, after her conversation,
    she exclusively appropriated the term "Elese" to her christian name,
    Maria, and thus was commonly known as "Maria Elese," <em>i.e.</em>, Maria the
    sinner, and as an object of mercy she was also called "Omo Alanu," <em>i.e.</em>,
    a child of the merciful, which latter name she applied to all Christians.
    She lived with us here as a petty trader, and was a blessed example to our
    little flock of how to "be diligent in business, serving the Lord." We
    were always indebted to her for wise counsels in adjusting cases that may
    arise among the converts. She was a staunch reprover of sin wherever it
    was found, and a great lover of truth and holiness, and had ample oppor-
    tunity by her vocation of testifying of the love of God in Christ, to all
    classes in the streets of Badagry, and as if this was her sole object, wilst
    she travelled about to sell, she went from house to house, so that in the
    heart and outskirts of the town she was known not so much as a trader,
    as "Mammy Oniwasu," <em>i.e.</em>, mammy the preacher, so intent was she on
    her Master's work. She did preach to all, rich and poor, old and young,
    male and female, heathens and Mohammedans. She was ripe for glory,
    and as an especial honour conferred on her, it was remarkable how
    silently but triumphantly she passed through death. On a Friday night
    she turned in complaining of earache. She was missed at early prayers
    next morning, quite an unusual thing, and when we felt it our duty to
    force open her door and awake her, she was quite unconscious of all we
    said or did; but every time we disturbed her, she would bow and kneel in
    a praying posture, and then quietly lay down to sleep again, and thus she
    never spoke one word more to man, as if she was ordered to be silent after
    having spoken so much during her lifetime. On Sunday night, November
    16th, 1873, which was the third day of her illness, she breathed her last.
    Her remains were interred in the Christian burial ground, in the after-
    noon of the following day, in the midst of bitter lamentations from
    a concourse of people, who were either Christians, Mohammedans, or
    heathens. After her burial, I learnt that she had left two hens in chare
    of one of her god-daughters, with instructions to rear them up for God,
    and the proceeds to go to the repairs of the house of God.</p>
  <p>
    2. On the 7th May also our ranks became thinner by the removal from
    this scene of troubles of our dear Eliza Afresi, the old Popo convert.
    For some four or five months before this event she became quite disabled
    by weakness, and subsequently was blind from extreme age. All her
    heathen relations had forsaken her, because she could not have been so
    old as to survive her generation unless she was a witch. And since she
    embraced Christianity she became more hateful to them&#8212;to that extent
    that many of the Popo fetish devotees would not meet her by the way
    without spitting at her. During her confinement in a room, Paul Akibode,
    her landlord, with his wife and household, took the greatest possible care
    of her, and never suffered her to want. I particularly observed this per-
    sonally, with heartfelt gratitude to God. I visited her often, and found
    her very patient in her confinement. Once she said, "I am not alone, my
    Saviour is with me, and always sits by me when nobody is in the room." On
    another occasion she assured me, "I live by prayer; it strengthens me as
    food is to the body." Though so old, yet her reason was not impaired almost
    to the last. Two days before her death, Paul Akibode informed me that she
    sang out joyously, "My eyes are open! my eyes are open!" and was in
    a state of ecstacy to the last, calling our late sister loudly and repeatedly,
    as if she saw her. On the following day she was heard singing loudly,
    "Olugbala, Juo il obba mimosti," <em>i.e.</em>, "O Saviour, Thou are the holy
    King, &c.," a song of praise composed by the late Maria Ekidan. I met
    her singing it on the morning before her death, with a rather fainting
    voice. But before my return the next morning her enraptured spirit
    had taken its flight.</p>
