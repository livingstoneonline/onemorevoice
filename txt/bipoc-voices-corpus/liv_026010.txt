We have received the Journal of Mr.
C. Sandreczki to the end of March. It
appears that the Turkish Government,
supported by its Christian subjects, who
are unwilling to bear any longer with the
tyranny and extortions of their ecclesiastical
leaders, is energetically endeavoring
to check the spirit of avarice and oppression
which has characterized the proceedings
of the Greek and Armenian Patriarchs,
and their subordinates, a result which it is
seeking to accomplish in a manner which
would not be discreditable to a Christian
Government. Measures of this description, if successful in their results, may exercise an
Influence on the Missionary cause, which,
If ever so indirect, ought to be well watched and diligently improved; because, as Mr.
Sandreczki says, "It becomes more and
more evident that Mahomedanism at large
will be vanquished by the reformation of
the Eastern Churches." He then proceeds
to say&#8212;
Just as the struggle against the letter of
indulgence formed the prelude to our reformation,
so the Sultan's procedure against
the abuses of the Patriarchs may be the preliminary
step toward the same end; for it
has already called forth a hitherto unheard-of
excitement amongst the laity, who are henceforth
to bear a more equal, or even preponderating
share in the administration of worldly
affairs. By little and little they may be
carried on, through the combat of worldly
interests, to that of higher ones in search of
truth; and then they will learn to value that
liberty of conscience, which the chief of the
orthodox Mussulmans has granted to his
Christian subjects.
Mr. Sandreczki, in a Letter dated April
19, 1849, mentions some interesting particulars
as to the progress of inquiry
amongst the members of these Eastern
Churches&#8212;
The American Missionaries kindly communicate
to us the almost daily progress of
spiritual or religious agitation among the Armenians
and Nestorians. Highly-interesting
details have of late come to our hearing. At
A'indab (Syria) and Urumia&#8212;and these even
among Bishops&#8212;the minds of the people are
roused to great emotion. It is as if the dawning
of revival were coming on; and I venture
to say that Mr. Wolters' Greek Sermons, too,
have already begun to stir up the minds of a
few persons of the Greek community here.
O for faith and perseverance now! O Lord,
spread Thy table for the Mahomedans and
Christians in this wilderness!
In his Journal of Feb. 14 he adds&#8212;
Some forty Greeks of Broosa are already
said to have separated from their Church on
account of the extortions of their Bishop.
The particulars of this case are still unknown
to us. However, if the little we have heard
of it prove true, the blow will be smartly felt
by the Greek Clergy; and the example of the
Protestant Armenians, the first-fruits of the
indefatigable efforts of our American brethren,
will be followed up more extensively; so that
we may expect to see the beginning of a
foreign-bred reformation converted into the
more powerful advances of a native reformation.
The Rev. J. Bowen, late of Knaresborough,
having proceeded, at his own expense,
to Syria, for the purpose of investigating
the state of its population, and
the opportunities which may exist of affording
to them instruction in the pure Gospel,
has reached Smyrna in safety, accompanied
by Mr. Schwartz.
In Mr. Sandreczki's Journal we find the
following reference&#8212;
March 25: Lord's-day.&#8212;Mr. Bowen preached
this morning at Boujah from Rom. xii. 1.
He carries along with him a full load of spiritual
refreshments from godly old England,
which, to us pilgrims through, and sojourners
in, the desert places, are powerful restorative&#8212;a
breath of revival.
