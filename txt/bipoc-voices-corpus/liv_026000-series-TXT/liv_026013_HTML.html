  <h5 style="text-align:center;">INDIAN SNAKE-CATCHER.</h5>
  <p>The following remarkable circumstance is related of Daehne, the
    Moravian Missionary, who laboured amongst these Indians about
    a hundred years ago—</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">The Indians having forsaken him, he was left alone in
    the Mission
    Settlement, and was often in no small danger from wild beasts and other
    venomous creatures. Thus a tiger for a long time kept watch near his
    hut, seeking an opportunity, no doubt, to seize the poor solitary inhabitant.
    Every night it roared most dreadfully; and though he regularly
    kindled a large fire in the neighbourhood before he went to bed, yet, as
    it often went out by the morning, it would have proved but a miserable
    defence, hand not the Lord preserved him. The following circumstance
    is still more remarkable, and illustrates, in a singular manner, the care of
    God over His servants. Being one evening attacked with a paroxysm of
    fever, he resolved to go into his hut and lie down in his hammock.
    Just, however, as he entered the door, he beheld a serpent descending from the roof upon him. In
    the scuffle which ensued, the creature bit him in three different places; and, pursuing him
    closely, twined itself
    several times round his head and neck as tightly as possible. Expecting
    now to be bitten, or strangled to death, and being afraid lest his brethren
    should suspect the Indians and murdered him, he, with singular presence
    of mind, wrote with chalk on the table—"A serpent has killed me."
    Suddenly, however, that promise of the Saviour darted into his mind,
    "They shall take up serpents, and shall not be hurt." Encouraged by
    this declaration, he seized the creature with great force, tore it loose from
    his body, and flung it out of the hut. He then lay down in his hammock
    in tranquillity and peace. This was most probably a boa-constrictor,
    whose bite, though painful, is not venomous, and which destroys
    his prey by crushing it to death and gorging it whole.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">May the old serpent Satan become as universally an
    object of antipathy to men; and may they be taught to dread that deadly poison of sin with which
    he destroys the soul! May the great Deliverer who bruised his head make us strong to wrestle
    with our great adversary, and "bruise Satan under our feet shortly!"</p>
