# One More Voice
One More Voice (https://onemorevoice.org/), a digital recovery project, identifies and documents the voices of racialized creators in British imperial and colonial archives. The project seeks to dismantle a foundational myth of colonialism, especially settler colonialism â€“ that the archives are full of gaps and silences in terms of indigenous voices. Our project instead combines social justice values and a focus on accessibility to highlight the abundance of these voices and to create a space of reckoning where the voices might be acknolwedged, heard, critically engaged, and amplified.
