  <h5 style="text-align:center;">THE FALSE AND THE TRUE VASANTA RAYAR.</h5>
  <h6 style="text-align:center;">A Narrative of Religious Excitement in Southern India
    Ten Years ago.</h6>

  </h6>
  <h6 style="text-align:center;"><em>(Proclamation of Vasanta Rayar.)</em></h6>
  <p>Then follows the narrative, describing the address of Devenderan,
    with Vishnu's reply, in which he promises to appear on
    earth as "Vasanta Rayar." He is accordingly born on the tenth
    day of the tenth month in the year 1850, in Gowdama, on the
    Godaveri, north-east of Cashmere. In due course he is instructed
    by the holy sages of Mount Meru, and their utterances
    regarding him are recorded as oracles. Various kinds of deaths
    and ailments befalling the opponents are mentioned as precursors
    of the great event of Vasanta Rayar's reign. Thus:&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">"By the treachery of friends and assaults of open
    foes some will fall.
    By atrocities of various kinds will the goddess Kali destroy some. By the
    volcanic action of Mount Keilasam some will die. The idols in the Siva
    and Vishnu temples will rise up and dance, and this sight will kill some.
    Infants and old men will fall from mountain tops and die. Foxes,
    kites, and owls will howl and screech day and night unceasingly.
    Four stars will appear in the sky in open day, and a fearful sound be
    heard in the heavens. Creatures that live in water will cry out, 'We have
    got on land, we have got on land,' and making straight for Mount Keilasam,
    and entering Veera Malaram Temple, will stay there eight days, and
    then vanish. In the Temple of Kumara Sami, the door will be shut seven
    days, and in consequence a furious wind will blow, and destroy many
    people. Demons, tigers, and wild beasts will injure multitudes, and blood
    suffuse all eyes. At time of new moon, full moon will rise. At dead of
    night the sun will rise. Blood will fall as rain. The goddess of fortune
    will weep. The ocean and rivers will rage. The goddess Terra will salute
    and acknowledge Vasanta Rayar as supreme lord. Then charities and
    virtues will flourish as of old. People of every caste will rejoice. Rain
    will pour three times every month. Crops of grain will grow profusely.
    Gifts and charities be everywhere abundant. Brahmins, Chattriyas, Visyas,
    and Sudras will be prosperous, performing their respective duties."</p>
  <p>Then follow promises to those who promote the matter:&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">"Whoever believes what is herein mentioned, whoever
    performs poojah
    to this book, will have health, with long life, riches, possessions, and conveyances.
    Whoever will not write, nor read, nor hear this book, but
    ridicule and revile it, will be annihilated, worms will breed in their
    mouth, and the furies will torment them."</p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">"We, the emissaries in this matter, were seized and
    brought before the
    vile fellows who hold the present reins of government. They put powder
    and shot in their guns and fired at us, when the two balls came and fell
    into our hands."</p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">"Therefore in the year Perabava (1867) Vasanta Rayar
    will come to
    reign, and that you who are virtuous may know this matter, we have
    written and sent this revelation to the several provinces. The virtuous
    and those who meditate on Siva, even if weak in the eyes, if they copy
    this book, and make poojah to it, will receive all that they wish for in
    their prayers. All who write, or read, or hear and worship this book,
    whatever be their present age, will be prosperous till he, Vasanta Rayar,
    come. Pluto cannot approach nor afflict with his pangs any who laud this
    book. The gods prosper you."</p>
  <p>Observing the excitement created on all sides by these proclamations,
    I determined to meet it, and take advantage of it, by
    publishing a tract reviewing the documents, and setting forth
    Jesus Christ as the true Vasanta Rayar. This tract of forty
    pages became for the time exceedingly popular, not only in Tinnevelly,
    but also in Travancore and Malabar, where a Malayalim
    translation of it was read with great avidity. It served not only
    to explode the current notions regarding the Hindu Messiah, but
    it was made useful under God's blessing to the conversion of
    several parties. One of the Basle missionaries wrote to me to
    say that he knew four persons who had been converted to
    Christianity by the perusal of this tract. It was styled:&#8212;</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><em>(Truth Victorious.)</em></p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">"GLORIOUS NEWS OF THE TRUE VASANTA RAYAR."</p>
  <p>Within three months after the publication of the tract, the
    excitement regarding Vasanta Rayar ceased, and not long after
    the matter was completely ignored.</p>
