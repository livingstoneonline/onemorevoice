<h3 id="h3-title" class="center">NEW-ZEALAND CHIEFS IN COMMITTEE DRAWING UP A
REPLY TO THE SOCIETY'S JUBILEE LETTER.<a href="#note1" id="note1back">*</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">C<span class="small">HRISTMAS-DAY</span> is Midsummer in New Zealand. At that season
numbers of Native Christians of different tribes&#8212;men who had once
fought with each other and contended as enemies in deadly strife&#8212;meet
at Wanganui, the Station of the Rev. R. Taylor, from different
parts of his immense district, to unite in prayer and praise, and
benefit by the instruction of their Minister. The last Christmas
Meeting of which we have received an account, that of 1849,
was numerously attended, and deeply interesting. In that year
Christmas-day fell on Tuesday. On the previous Sunday, the 23d,
the Congregation was so large, that, the Church was not being capable
of containing it, the pulpit was carried into an adjoining field.
The day was fine, and the congregation attentive; Mr. Taylor,
in his sermon, remarking that the present assembly proved the
power of God: no earthly cause would have brought so many
tribes together: God's word had done it. After the Service, the
Sacrament was administered to 295 individuals, and a collection
made, amounting to <em>2l</em>. <em>13s</em>.</p>
<p>The 24th as a lovely morning, most suitable for the purpose for
which it was intended&#8212;a Missionary Meeting; to those who
possess the spirit of Christian Missions, and know their value, a
delightful and animating occasion. At five <span class="small">A</span>.<span class="small">M</span>/ Morning Service
was held, and after breakfast about 2000 Christian Native assembled
in the open air, in God's own temple&#8212;for "the Lord by wisdom
hath founded the earth; by understanding hath He established the
heavens"&#8212;the pavement carpetted with the grass which He makes
to grow, and the clear blue sky of New Zealand extended as a
canopy over their heads. The proceedings commenced with singing
the hymn in Maori,</p>
<p class="poem center smaller">"Salvation! oh, the joyful
sound!<br>
What pleasure to our ears!"</p>
<p class="noindent">Mr. Taylor says&#8212;</p>
<div class="small">
<p>I then opened the Meeting by stating that a Letter
had been addressed
by the Church Missionary Society to them, in common with the
rest of their countrymen who had embraced the Gospel through the
instrumentality of the Society; that a similar one had been sent to all
parts of the world where they were labouring to spread the Gospel, and
that now they were assembled to hear the Letter read; that it was filled
with love to them; that the Society style themselves elder brethren,
but, for my part, I thought they were rather entitled to the name of
fathers, as they had begotten them to be a new people in Christ Jesus;
that very large Meetings had been held in England to spread the
Gospel throughout the world; and that they had sent this Letter of love
to confirm their faith, and interest their hearts in the same glorious
cause. But, to explain more fully the object of the Letter, I had also
written an introductory one, which we had got printed, together with
that of the Society, which should now be read to them. I then called on
Mr. Baker to read the introductory Letter, and that of the Society.</p>
</div>
<p class="topmargin">Several Resolutions were then moved and seconded, in suitable
speeches, by Native Chiefs and Catechists. The first was by
Tamehana Te Rauparaha, the son of the warrior and cannibal
Rauparaha, who in his day slew multitudes of his countrymen.
This is his speech&#8212;</p>
<p class="small">Listen to these words. You have just heard the Letter
of the Church
Missionary Society read to you, and you see that we ought to be united
in spirit and love towards them, as they are towards us. To do this we
must write them a Letter. We have seen and felt the power of the
Gospel, for all our old customs have been given up through its instrumentality.
Now we have begun a new work let us not go back, but
strive to go forward. Some have foolishly tried to continue their evil
ways, but have found they can do so no longer. The Missionaries first
drew our feet out of the mire, and placed us on a firm foundation. We
are now called upon to thank the Church Missionary Society for our
Ministers. They are a peculiar blessing to us: they are but few in
number, and therefore ought to be more highly prized. For, whilst
we can at all times get plenty of merchants and settlers to come amongst
us, who only come for their own interest, we cannot so easily obtain
Missionaries. I feel much for our Ministers, for they have to contend
with Europeans as well as Maori, and have truly the care of all the
Churches upon them. It is to them alone we owe our present state of
civilization; and now we are called upon to show that we are aware of
our obligations to the Church Missionary Society.</p>
<p>Another speech, made by Matini Wiwi, was as follows&#8212;</p>
<div class="small">
<p>Are there not many still amongst us who were once
strongly attached
to all our old customs, and the superstitions of our forefathers? Let me
ask them, what was it that made you forsake those ancient customs?
My friends, it was the Word of God, which sunk deep into your hearts.
We did not lay them aside as a man does an old garment when it is no
longer fit to wear. No! but because it opened our eyes to see the folly
of them. St. Paul truly says, that though our bodies may be separated
according to the flesh, still the spirits may be near. This is the case with
the Members of the Church Missionary Society. We do not know them
personally, nor the place where they live; but we know them in our
hearts as our sincere friends, and the remembrance of what they have
done for our welfare will always claim our love.</p>
</div>
<p>After five Resolutions had been duly moved, seconded, and in some
instances supported, so many were anxious to address the Meeting
that Mr. Taylor called upon all the principal Chiefs to do so. The 
Meeting concluded with a hymn translated from</p>
<p class="poem center smaller">"Jesus, immortal King, arise!<br>
Assume, assert, Thy sway!"</p>
<p>After prayer and the blessing all quietly dispersed, apparently
much interested.</p>
