  <p class="noindent">I<span class="small">n</span> the Journals of our Missionaries at Abbeokuta we find much
    which affords to us satisfactory evidence of the progress of the 
    work. The people are very anxious to hear the good news of
    the Gospel, and that, not only in Abbeokuta itself, where the
    Missionaries have been for some years resident, but in the
    neighbouring towns and villages. They seem, indeed, in this
    respect, to resemble a newly-ploughed field, which lies open to
    receive the seed which falls plenteously on it from the sower's hands.
    Nor is this all. In other Missionary fields the seed was long in
    springing up, and many years passed away before the hearts of the
    labourers were cheered by a single instances of conversion; but in
    Abbeokuta the seed is already coming back in produce. There are
    many who have cast away their idols as sinful and worthless, and,
    boldly professing the name of Jesus, have willingly endured for
    His sake the dislike and scorn of their relatives and friends.
    Our Native Catechist, and Mr. Thomas King, in the accompanying
    narrative, has related an interesting case of this description.</p>
  <p><em>Oct. 28, 1850</em>&#8212;This morning I went with the Rev. H. Townsend to see
    a sick Candidate, who had sent to him earnestly requesting to have the
    sacrament of baptism administered to him, as he found his sickness
    gradually gaining the mastery.</p><br>
  <div class="center"><img

      alt="Sketch of Rev. Townsend administering a baptism; Courtesy of Adam Mathew Digital"
      style="width: 455px;"></div><br>
  <p>His answers to several questions proposed
    to him by Mr. Townsend were such that it would have been unjustifiable
    to refuse him his request, especially under such pining disease. "Why
    do you wish to be baptized?" asked Mr. Townsend. "Because Jesus
    has commanded it to be done to every one that believes in Him."&#8212;
    "It is, then, answerable to the heathen amulets, as a means by
    which you hope to be preserved from sickness, death, and other
    evils?" "By no means: it is only an outward sign of an inward
    operation by the Spirit of God."&#8212;"Administered to you, will
    your salvation be then completed?" "It will by no means be profitable
    to me without true faith in Jesus the Savior."&#8212;"Do you, then, believe
    in Jesus?" "O yes! with all my heart; and I hope that He will enable
    me more to trust in Him. I know that I am unfit; but as I cannot tell
    how it will fare with me in this sickness, I therefore wish to receive the
    sign which Christ has appointed as a means for salvation." After this,
    he was baptized by Mr. Townsend, in the presence of more than a dozen
    individuals, Communicants and Candidates, who went with us, and some
    of the household. After this, some words were spoken to those of his
    unconcerned and careless relatives present for about an hour; by which
    an emigrant who came with us from Sierra Leone was so convinced of
    the utmost necessity of casting his lot with the people of God, that he
    quitted the residence of his heathen relatives the same day, to live with
    one of the Native Communicants who went with us, where he would be
    able to attend to these things without molestation.</p>
  <p><em>Nov. 24</em>: <em>Lord's-day</em>&#8212;The above sick young man was brought to
    the yard this morning. The most influential man among his relatives
    sent to Mr. Townsend about a fortnight ago to take the young man to
    our premises. To ascertain the real cause of this message, Mr. Townsend
    sent Mr. A. Wilhelm and myself to make inquiries. He assigned no other
    reason than that, as the young man refused their making sacrifices for
    him, they knew not what assistance would be rendered to him. His
    language, he said, was not understood by them, as their words were
    contrary to his. We inquired how this could be, since the young man
    knows and speaks no other but the same common language. "His
    views," said he, "are contrary to us, neither can any in the house understand
    him. As long as he refuses to worship Ifa,<a href="#note1" id="note1back">*</a> I know not what
    other help could be rendered him, neither will I show him any favour.
    Tell the gentleman that I am quite sincere in what I said. If he is
    better, he may remain with him in his yard; but should the sickness
    terminate in death, he may bury him: we cannot help it." What provoked
    them to be so much disgusted with the sick man, I am informed,
    was the violent insult he once offered to Ifa, when, in spite of all his
    remonstrances, this head man of their family determined to consult
    Ifa on his behalf. On a certain day, when the babbalawo, whom the
    head man brought for the purpose, had taken his seat, and spread Ifa
    and all the instruments, the sick man was requested to come forward and
    perform his adoration by prostration on the ground before the priest,
    and by touching the nuts with his forehead, all which are to precede the
    act of divination. But the young man refused. As he would not rise,
    it was then proposed that Ifa should be handed to him, in order to touch
    it with his forehead, but even with this they could not get him to comply.
    His relative, the employer, then remarked, that as they could easily
    perform the ceremonies were the sufferer to be absent, they might
    deal with this case just in the same way, and therefore bade the priest to
    proceed. At this crisis, the sick man, who in the mean while was contemplating
    how to put an end to all their imposing cheats, nimbly got
    up, on which they supposed he was now inclined to comply with their
    wishes; but on the contrary, to the astonishment and displeasure of all,
    he took hold of the nuts, and scattered the whole in the yard. Enraged
    by such daring conduct, the chief relative threw the sick young man down
    by such a violent push that those present supposed him to be dead. The
    whole party being in confusion were then dispersed. The babbalawo,
    without a word to his employer, departed in haste. The poor man,
    coming to himself after a while, got up and went into the house. This
    is the source of their animosity to him, from which even his mother is
    not exempted, but seems, as it were, to be hardened against her own son.
    They troubled him greatly after this to give up his faith, but, finding they
    could not prevail, their hatred to him was the more increased. But the
    young man, instead of being shaken in faith, was firm and resolute;
    and, far from being sorry for the proposal made by the head man, he
    was rather much pleased to come to the yard. Their bitter hatred to
    him has given him sufficient reason to suspect that, in case of danger,
    such as outbreak of fire, they might leave him to perish. The poor
    man, since his entrance into the yard, has met with parental care and
    attention from Mr. and Mrs. Townsend. How forcibly is the Saviour's
    saying verified in the case of this young man&#8212;"I am not come to
    send peace on earth, but rather division!" Neither is David's saying
    less applicable to him&#8212;"When my father and my mother forsake me,
    then the Lord will take me up."</p>
  <p class="topmargin">This poor fellow has since entered into rest. During his illness
    he was often cast down under the deep sense of his unworthiness;
    yet at other times he was enabled to rejoice in the hope place
    before him by the Gospel of Jesus. On one occasion, when asked
    by Mr. King what he thought of the Lord's dealings with him, he
    replied, "Oh, very kind and loving indeed is He to me&#8212;more than
    any parents." "What! is it kindness to suffer you to be thus
    afflicted, while many of your companions are in full vigour and
    strength?" "O yes! very indeed;" and then he entered into a long
    detail of all that he had passed through since the commencement of
    his sickness: how, when in ignorance of the promise of mercy in
    Christ, he was repeatedly tempted to commit suicide, but, being
    discovered, was providentially prevented. That he should have been
    spared to hear the glad tidings of salvation, appeared to him an
    uncommon mercy; and heartily did he bless God that he had
    not been suffered to plunge himself into endless misery. His
    mother, finding that there was no hope of his recovery, wished to
    have him removed to his grandmother's place, that there, taking
    advantage of his weakness, they might practise their idolatrous
    rites. Mr. King questioned him, to see whether he felt disposed to
    go. "Do not," he said, "entertain any fears for me: not while
    there is breath in me shall I go there." Most grateful was he for
    any thing that was done for him. Entering his room suddenly,
    Mr. King on several occasions found him on his knees. Often,
    with deep interest, did he speak of the rest to be found in
    Jesus, and as long as he had the power of utterance continued to
    express his hope in Christ. "The last time," says Mr. Townsend,
    "that I saw him alive, when almost past consciousness, he had lying
    by his side his books, which I understood from his mother were
    placed there at his desire&#8212;doubtless, a last testimony that he continued
    'a book-man' and a Christian."</p>

    <section class="small topmargin">
      <p class="noindent" id="note1">*  Ifa is a supposed deity, represented by sixteen palm-nuts. He is consulted by
        means of the nuts, manœuvred by a babbalawo, or priest. Before commen[c]ing operations,
        the inquiring parties must evince their faith in Ifa by prostration, and by touching 
        the nuts with the forehead. The priest then gives to some of the bystanders pieces
        of broken earthenware, or something of the kind, some representing a favourable,
        others and unfavourable response. Having also whitened a board, he shakes the nuts
        within his hands, and with his right hand grasps a number. Some are left in
        the other hand, and the babbalawo makes marks accordingly on the whitened board.
        He now asks for one of the pieces of earthenware, and declares whether Ifa's answers
        be favourable or not. The people being ignorant as to what pieces represent favourable
        and what pieces represent unfavourable replies, they are altogether at the mercy of the
        priest's arbitrary declaration. If the response be adverse, the babbalawo says the
        applicants must sacrifice, and Ifa is again consulted as to what sacrifice he requires.
        The answer may be sheep, goat, fowls, &amp;c., as the necessities of Ifa—or the babbalawo—may 
        render most desirable.—<em>Ed.</em> C. M. G. <a class="small" href="#note1back">[return]</a></p>
