through various ranges of hills, through the country of the tribe of
Loam by. The next two days passed the town of Kesunga; their
king is called Keringawarha, who is an usurper; the name of the
tribe is Wamefee:<ref target="#note_08">*</ref> this is all a hilly country. From thence
travelled 2 days to Marora; the king's name is Negaboo; the
name of the tribe Osagara<ref target="#note_09">&#134;</ref> (many sold in Zanzibar) : at this
place there are two rivers whirh irrigate the country, and food in
plenty; there are also numerous running streams from thti hills.
From Marora in one day reached the Bahar (the river, viz. the
Lufigi ?) : there is a large river, called Matoney, infested with
hippopotami; travelled close to the banks of the river for 8 days,
through the tribe called Yoaha:<ref target="#note_10">&#135;</ref> the country is hilly; and we
were constan1ly falling in with villages, at which we slept every
evening; when we got to Powaga. Travelled thence, through a
plain country, on the banks of the same river for 5 days longer
till we reached Osanga; from thence proceeded to Sanga in 3
days, leaving the river Matoney on our left hand, the hills were also
all left to the south; and the other part of the country was perfectly
level, principally sand and ironstone : thence travelled for 5 days
throng h the tribe of Toomba; the country quite plain, and well
populated-during the whole time from leaving the coast had no
rain. From Toomba to Jangwera 2 days; thence to Sangara 3
days: no villages or people. Sangara forms the east limit of the
Manumuse (Mono-moezi) tribe, and one of the kings lives there;
from this to the lake is occupied by the Manumuse (Mono-moezi)
tribe, which is under four independent sovereigns: the people are
very honest aud ciril to strangers; no instance has occurred of ill
tr,.mtmeut or injury. The road to the lake is plain, without hills.
Sangara to Ganda 5 days, quite plain, country well populated, more
so than before entering the Manumuse (Mono-moezi) country.
Sheep eight for one dollar, bullocks four for one dollar; but they
prefer a quarter of a dollar's value of cotton cloth. From Ganda
to Shesha 3 days; here is a sultan or king: the appearance of the
country as before. Hence to Sanjee 5 days; here another sheik
or sultan : at this place there is an abundance of iron-ore-country
quite lerel. From this latter place to Sagosee 2 clays, country
as before; thence Ogaree 3 clays, where there is a very large river
called Magrazie, with numerous hippopotami in it. Frnm this
place to the Grand Lake is 12 days, through a country called
Olia, a plain level country: on the banks of the lake is the great
Sultan of the Manumuse (Mono-moezi), whose minister's name is
Kegaw; the appearance of the people near the lake is that of the

<p rend="no-indent">days, or 4½ months, on the road; and during which time we travelled
62 days, at about the rate of 9 or 10 English miles daily;
but I have no means of ascertaining the exact distance.</p>
<p>The extent of the Manumuse (Mono-moezi) country is about
2 months from N. to S., and from E. to W. I½ month. In
standing on the banks of the lake it can be seen across, in the
same manner as from Zanzibar to the main (which is 24 English
miles). Several islands were observable in it. On leaving the
African coast we travelled in a direction for the first month about
two points S. of where the sun sets, and afterwards continued to
travel exactly in the direction of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The river called Magrazie takes its origin from the lake, and
disembogues itself into the sea between the rivers Lindy and
Keelwa; and I am sure the rivers Lindy and Masoryre are
branches from it. Across the lake there is a great trade of ivory,
oil of a red colour, and slaves like those of Nubia. There is a
trade carried on from the W. bank of the lake to the W. coast; it
consists of white and blue cotton cloths, and some broad-cloths,
which are bartered for ivory. The time taken to reach the W. coast
from the lake is about 6 months. For two trassalors<ref target="#note_11">*</ref> of beads
you get four of ivory ; the beads costing about five dollars per
trassala.</p>
<p>Never heard of the dwarf human species spoken of: the people
near the lake are fairer than those near the coast. There is a great
sea or swell on the lake when the wind blows fresh : and it is well
known by all the people there that the river which goes through
Egypt takes its source and origin from the lake. The banks of the
lake are composed of sand-hills, thrown up by the waves; the water
is very deep, with great quantities of fish. On the W. side of the
lake the name of the tribe is Y oah; they are circumcised, and call
themselves Mohammedans. Some. of the boats are 6 fathoms long,
very narrow, and without sails. The Manumuse (Mono-moezi)
are pagans; and both sexes go nearly naked. Near the lake, and
through the Mono-moezi country there are no horses or camels,
but plenty of asses and a few elephants. In travelling in the
country from the E. side to the lake there is no danger; and from
the W., by paying a little to the different sultans, they would
forward you with the greatest safety. During the whole distance
the people with the caravan were healthy; they got plenty of
good and cheap food and water. The houses on the road and
at the lake are made of wood, and thatched with grass; no upper
stories, nor is there any chimney. Dogs are very numerous and
troublesome, some of a very large kind.</p>

<head rend="italic">II. Information obtained from Thomas Wogga, an African.</head>
<p rend="no-indent"><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> man is at present in this country: he had been previously,
fourteen or fifteen years, on board of a British man-of-war; and
liberated from slavery about the year 1815 or 1816. He is a
native of a country which he calls Kimcoul; and which, as far as
the accounts which he gives are correct, must be situated near the
sources of the Tshalda, in about 10° N. and 18° to 19° E. He
was exactly 68 days actually travelling from thence to Calabar,
and always in the direction of the setting sun. From the rate at
which he travelled, and the time occupied, he must have made
good at least 10 geographical miles daily, if not more. He states
that Donga was 6 days' journey, on foot, eastward from his
country; that he had been there, his country having been engaged
in war with the people of that district; that there were
plenty of rivers, great and small, in the country of Donga; that
they were not the same as the river in his country, but ran in an
opposite, or rather in a southerly and westerly direction. He was
very clo~ely questioned about his knowledge of this place, and he
always adhered to the statement that he k11Pw it perfectly. He
also stated that he had heard of a country called Ferttee, to the
eastward of his country and of Donga. He gave the name of
every place or town at which he halted in his journey to the coast.
Gold and silver were abundant in Ferttee.</p>
<p>In his country, he says, there is a great river called Ayah,
broader than the Thames. It comes from the E., and runs to
the W. or the set.ting sun. Its course from his country passed
first through a place called Komse, second Mongell, third Pam be,
and fourth Mondt>ll. In his way westward he passed several rivers,
but all smaller, except one about midway ; and they all ran in
the direction of and to join the Great River. This river is joined
on both sides by small streams. During the dry season the Great
River is about 3 feet deep. There are no canoes on the Great
Rirnr: the people either swim across it or pass it on rafts. During
the rainy season there is plenty of hail; the children pick it up and
put it in their mouths as amusement, as it makes them feel cold:
it lies three or four hours on the ground before melting. Plenty of</p>

<p rend="no-indent">hills, some of them so high as to be always white with snow or hail.
Rain sometimes incessant throughout the year; sometimes dry.
Old people make rain fall-make fires and offerings to bring it.
Many shooting-stars or comets: these run like serpents, and ex-plode.
This takes place before the kings die. Thunder and
lightning very ht>avy, and very frequent. There are plenty of
elephants and monkeys; the monkPys do no hard work. There
are plenty of cows and horses, but these are never employed in
work. There are plenty of sheep, goats, and tiger-cats. There
is also plenty of fish in the rivers: both men and women catch
them in nets; these nets are made of a kind of grass or hemp.
There are plenty of crocodiles and alligators; the people eat
them, and also the guana: sometimes the crocodile kills people
in the riwr. There are plenty of large trees and plenty of brush.
The houses are made round; they are built of mud, thatched all
over, and have small fire-places. They have plenty of fowls.
Each kind of stock live separately. They have plenty of Guinea
corn and Indian corn ; plenty of yams and sweet potatoes of a description
resembling beet-root.</p>
<p>They have as many wives as they like: the king has ten, or
more. ThPy have many slaves, which are either bought or takPn
in war. There are also plenty of yellow and brown people&#8212;God
made them as well as the blacks: the brown or red coloured
people come with camels to buy slaves, &amp;c.; these red people
bring the camels in order to carry themselves and their goods.
His country made war with different nations&#8212;one called Koome,
another Korre, a third Komante, and a fourth Juke: the latter are
marked like the New Zealanders. All these nations are black,
and speak different languages. In his country they make images
of wood and worship them : they also pray to stones. The common
people build their images of clay. Tht>y also build a large
image with stone; this image only the king and courtiers worship:
they make him like a man, with a hole in one side in ordPr- to give
him victuals to eat, consisting of flesh, fowls, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Thomas Wogga is of a deep black colour, but without any of
the real negro countenance, such as the flat nose, thick lips, &amp;c.
He is now considerably advanced in years, but when young must
have been a good-looking man. His country marks are numerous
and full. He describes the general features of his own county, and
of those through which he travelled, with considerable clearness;
but, like every other African black, he can give no explanation
about names of places which are known to us from other quarters,
or of geographical bearings and distances, with any precision, except
as from E. to W_., or from the rising to the setting sun, or by
the sun being to the N. or the S. of the road.</p>

is a considerable river, but smaller than the Ayah: it runs westward
to join the latter. At Ocoom there is a river, called Moniah,
not so large as the Ayah. Ocoom is N. of the large river, and
not far from it. Ocoom Rirer not far from Great Hiver. Plenty
of yams and tobacco at Ocoom. There is no river at Monsookko,
but plenty of water from springs. The women here have very
large heads. There are large hills here, but not so large as those
in his country. Plenty of brush. U ngwa is a large town, with a
river 20 yards broad, but deep. There is no river at U vangah: it
is a large town, with plenty of bush in it and around it ; there are
many hills in its vicinity, some large and some small. Between
U ngwa and Uvangah one river, not fordable; swam across it. No
river from Uvangah to Umblisse; but the country is hilly, with
plenty of water from springs and rivulets. From U mblisse to
New Calabar the country is flat. In these journeys the people
of the caravan carried each yams for their food.</p>
