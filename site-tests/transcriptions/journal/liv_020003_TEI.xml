<p rend="no-indent">days, or 4<choice><orig>½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> months, on the road; and during which time we travelled
62 days, at about the rate of 9 or 10 <term type="collective">English</term> miles daily;
but I have no means of ascertaining the exact distance.</p>
<p>The extent of the <region><term type="collective">Manumuse</term> (<term type="collective">Mono-moezi</term>) country</region> is about
2 months from <region><choice><abbr>N.</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice></region> to <region><choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>South</expan></choice></region>, and from <region><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice></region> to <region><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice></region> 1<choice><orig>½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> month. In
standing on the banks of the lake it can be seen across, in the <!-- geog: lake ? -->
same manner as from <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> to the <region>main</region> (which is 24 <term type="collective">English</term>
miles). Several islands were observable in it. On leaving the
<region><orgName>African</orgName> coast</region> we travelled in a direction for the first month about
two points <choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>South</expan></choice> of where the sun sets, and afterwards continued to
travel exactly in the direction of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The river called <geogName>Magrazie</geogName> takes its origin from the lake, and <!-- geog: lake ? -->
disembogues itself into the sea between the rivers <geogName>Lindy</geogName> and
<geogName>Keelwa</geogName>; and I am sure the rivers <geogName>Lindy</geogName> and <geogName>Masoryre</geogName> are
branches from it. Across the lake there is a great trade of ivory, <!-- geog: lake ? -->
oil of a red colour, and slaves<!-- I'm pretty sure we don't tag 'slaves' as <orgName> now, but note that the guidelines seem ambiguous - Arab slave trader example still shows <orgName> around 'slave' - see section 17.1 AM --> like those of <placeName>Nubia</placeName>. There is a
trade carried on from the <region><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice> bank of the lake</region> to the <region><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice> coast</region>; it
consists of white and blue cotton cloths, and some broad-cloths,
which are bartered for ivory. The time taken to reach the <region><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice> coast</region>
from the lake is about 6 months. For two trassalors<ref target="#note_11">*</ref> of beads <!-- geog: lake ? -->
you get four of ivory; the beads costing about five dollars per
trassala.</p>
<p>Never heard of the dwarf human species spoken of: the people
near the lake are fairer than those near the <region>coast</region>. There is a great <!-- geog: lake ? -->
sea or swell on the lake when the wind blows fresh: and it is well <!-- geog: lake ? -->
known by all the people there that the river which goes through
<country>Egypt</country> takes its source and origin from the lake. The banks of the <!-- geog: lake ? -->
lake are composed of sand-hills, thrown up by the waves; the water <!-- geog: lake ? -->
is very deep, with great quantities of <term type="animal">fish</term>. On the <region><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice> side of the
lake</region> the name of the tribe is <term type="collective">Yoah</term>; they are circumcised, and call <!-- geog: lake ? -->
themselves <orgName>Mohammedans</orgName>. Some of the boats are 6 fathoms long,
very narrow, and without sails. The <term type="collective">Manumuse</term> (<term type="collective">Mono-moezi</term>)
are pagans; and both sexes go nearly naked. Near the lake, and <!-- geog: lake ? -->
through the <region><term type="collective">Mono-moezi</term> country</region> there are no <term type="animal">horses</term> or <term type="animal">camels</term>,
but plenty of <term type="animal">asses</term> and a few <term type="animal">elephants</term>. In travelling in the
country from the <region><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice> side</region> to the lake there is no danger; and from <!-- geog: lake ? -->
the <region><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice></region>, by paying a little to the different <term type="occupation">sultans</term>, they would
forward you with the greatest safety. During the whole distance
the people with the caravan were healthy; they got plenty of
good and cheap food and water. The houses on the road and
at the lake are made of wood, and thatched with <term type="plant">grass</term>; no upper <!-- geog: lake ? -->
stories, nor is there any chimney. <term type="animal">Dogs</term> are very numerous and
troublesome, some of a very large kind.</p>

<p rend="no-indent"><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> man is at present in this country: he had been previously, <!-- geog:  -->
fourteen or fifteen years, on board of a <term type="collective">British</term> man-of-war; and
liberated from slavery about the year <date when="1815">1815</date> or <date when="1816">1816</date>. He is a
native of a country which he calls <region>Kimcoul</region>; and which, as far as
the accounts which he gives are correct, must be situated near the
<geogName>sources of the <geogName>Tshadda</geogName></geogName>, in about 10° <choice><abbr>N.</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice> and 18° to 19° <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice> He <!-- Adrian, we're not marking lat/long anymore, right? HB -->
was exactly 68 days actually travelling from thence to <placeName>Calabar</placeName>,
and always in the direction of the setting sun. From the rate at
which he travelled, and the time occupied, he must have made
good at least 10 geographical miles daily, if not more. He states
that <placeName>Donga</placeName> was 6 days' journey, on foot, eastward from his
country; that he had been there, his country having been engaged <!-- geog: Kimcoul -->
in war with the people of that district; that there were
plenty of rivers, great and small, in the country of <region>Donga</region>; that
they were not the same as the river in his country, but ran in an <!-- geog: Kimcoul -->
opposite, or rather in a southerly and westerly direction. He was
very closely questioned about his knowledge of this place, and he
always adhered to the statement that he knew it perfectly. He
also stated that he had heard of a country called <region>Ferttee</region>, to the
eastward of his country and of <region>Donga</region>. He gave the name of <!-- geog: Kimcoul -->
every place or town at which he halted in his journey to the <region>coast</region>.
Gold and silver were abundant in <region>Ferttee</region>.</p>
<p>In his country, he says, there is a great river called <geogName>Ayah</geogName>, <!-- geog: Kimcoul -->
broader than the <geogName>Thames</geogName>. It comes from the <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice>, and runs to
the <choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice> or the setting sun. Its course from his country passed <!-- geog: Kimcoul -->
first through a place called <placeName>Komse</placeName>, second <placeName>Mongell</placeName>, third <placeName>Pambe</placeName>,
and fourth <placeName>Mondell</placeName>. In his way westward he passed several rivers,
but all smaller, except one about midway; and they all ran in
the direction of and to join the Great River. This river is joined <!--geog: Ayah -->
on both sides by small streams. During the dry season the Great 
River is about 3 feet deep. There are no canoes on the Great <!--geog: Ayah -->
River: the people either swim across it or pass it on rafts. During
the rainy season there is plenty of hail; the children pick it up and
put it in their mouths as amusement, as it makes them feel cold:
it lies three or four hours on the ground before melting. Plenty of</p>

<p rend="no-indent">hills, some of them so high as to be always white with snow or hail.
Rain sometimes incessant throughout the year; sometimes dry.
Old people make rain fall&#8212;make fires and offerings to bring it.
Many shooting-stars or comets: these run like <term type="animal">serpents</term>, and explode.
This takes place before the <term type="occupation">kings</term> die. Thunder and
lightning very heavy, and very frequent. There are plenty of
<term type="animal">elephants</term> and <term type="animal">monkeys</term>; the <term type="animal">monkeys</term> do no hard work. There
are plenty of <term type="animal">cows</term> and <term type="animal">horses</term>, but these are never employed in
work. There are plenty of <term type="animal">sheep</term>, <term type="animal">goats</term>, and <term type="animal">tiger-cats</term>. There
is also plenty of <term type="animal">fish</term> in the rivers: both men and women catch
them in nets; these nets are made of a kind of <term type="plant">grass</term> or <term type="plant">hemp</term>.
There are plenty of <term type="animal">crocodiles</term> and <term type="animal">alligators</term>; the people eat
them, and also the <term type="foodstuff">guana</term>: sometimes the <term type="animal">crocodile</term> kills people
in the river. There are plenty of large trees and plenty of brush.
The houses are made round; they are built of mud, thatched all
over, and have small fire-places. They have plenty of <term type="animal">fowls</term>.
Each kind of stock live separately. They have plenty of <term type="foodstuff"><term type="collective">Guinea</term>
corn</term> and <term type="foodstuff"><term type="collective">Indian</term> corn</term>; plenty of <term type="foodstuff">yams</term> and <term type="foodstuff">sweet potatoes</term> of a description

<p>They have as many wives as they like: the <term type="occupation">king</term> has ten, or
more. They have many slaves, which are either bought or taken <!-- So no tags on slaves, correct? HB --><!-- I think that's right AM -->

people come with <term type="animal">camels</term> to buy slaves, &amp;c.; these red people
bring the <term type="animal">camels</term> in order to carry themselves and their goods.
His country made war with different nations&#8212;one called <placeName>Koome</placeName>, <!-- geog: Kimcoul? -->
another <placeName>Korre</placeName>, a third <placeName>Komante</placeName>, and a fourth <placeName>Juke</placeName>: the latter are
marked like the <term type="collective">New Zealanders</term>. All these nations are black,
and speak different languages. In his country they make images <!-- geog: Kimcoul? -->
of wood and worship them: they also pray to stones. The common
people build their images of clay. They also build a large
image with stone; this image only the <term type="occupation">king</term> and <term type="occupation">courtiers</term> worship:
they make him like a man, with a hole in one side in order to give
him <term type="foodstuff">victuals</term> to eat, consisting of flesh, <term type="animal">fowls</term>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><persName>Thomas Wogga</persName> is of a deep black colour, but without any of
the real negro countenance, such as the flat nose, thick lips, &amp;c.
He is now considerably advanced in years, but when young must
have been a good-looking man. His country marks are numerous <!-- geog: Kimcoul? -->
and full. He describes the general features of his own county, and
of those through which he travelled, with considerable clearness;
but, like every other <orgName>African</orgName> black, he can give no explanation
about names of places which are known to us from other quarters,
or of geographical bearings and distances, with any precision, except
as from <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice> to <choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice>, or from the rising to the setting sun, or by

<p><placeName>Uppe</placeName> is 1 day from the great river <geogName>Ayah</geogName>. At <placeName>Auzilliga</placeName> there
is a considerable river, but smaller than the <geogName>Ayah</geogName>: it runs westward
to join the latter. At <placeName>Ocoom</placeName> there is a river, called <geogName>Moniah</geogName>,
not so large as the <geogName>Ayah</geogName>. <placeName>Ocoom</placeName> is <choice><abbr>N.</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice> of the large river, and <!-- geog: Ayah -->
not far from it. <geogName><placeName>Ocoom</placeName> River</geogName> not far from Great River. Plenty <!-- geog: Ayah -->
of <term type="foodstuff">yams</term> and <term type="plant">tobacco</term> at <placeName>Ocoom</placeName>. There is no river at <placeName>Monsookko</placeName>,
but plenty of water from springs. The women here have very
large heads. There are large hills here, but not so large as those
in his country. Plenty of brush. <settlement>Ungwa</settlement> is a large town, with a <!-- geog: Kimcoul -->
river 20 yards broad, but deep. There is no river at <settlement>Uvangah</settlement>: it
is a large town, with plenty of bush in it and around it; there are
many hills in its vicinity, some large and some small. Between
<settlement>Ungwa</settlement> and <settlement>Uvangah</settlement> one river, not fordable; swam across it. No
river from <settlement>Uvangah</settlement> to <placeName>Umblisse</placeName>; but the country is hilly, with
plenty of water from springs and rivulets. From <placeName>Umblisse</placeName> to
<placeName>New Calabar</placeName> the country is flat. In these journeys the people
of the caravan carried each <term type="foodstuff">yams</term> for their food.</p>
