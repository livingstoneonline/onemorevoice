  <p>It was in this year of Jubilee that your Letter came to our Minister,
    Mr. Davis. He is wise in looking into our sins, and in proclaiming to
    us the Word of God. Mr. Marsden was the first messenger to us wicked
    people of New Zealand: the second messengers were Mr. Williams and
    Mr. Davis: these are the elders of the Church in this country. The
    desire of my heart with regard to your words is, that I may seriously
    consider them in my mind: the consideration must be an inward one.
    And I pray to the Father to help me—to give me earnestness in prayer to
    Him, and the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. I rejoice at your words,
    which come, through you, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who is
    the director of all things in heaven and earth. You are the sanctified
    people of that God. Jehovah has chosen you to devise means whereby
    His Word may be disseminated. My heart's desire is, to bow down and
    cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner," a sinful man. O God, Thou hast
    seen, Thou knowest my ignorance, nor are my sins hid from Thee!
    "Search me, and see if there be any wicked way in me." I will smite
    upon my breast and say, "God be merciful to me a sinner." Yes, you
    shall behold me, and I shall behold you, at the last day, although some
    are living in the north, south, east, and west.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;">From your loving Friend,<br>
    D<small>AVID</small> T<small>AIWANGA</small>.</p>
