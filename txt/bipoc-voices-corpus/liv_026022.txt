THE NATIVE INSTITUTION AT WAIKATO HEADS, NEW ZEALAND.
[...]
"Friend Maunsell&#8212;How farest thou and mother Maunsell? Friend,
here I am at Waikare. My sickness still continues. It is in my head.
If God is pleased that I should return well, it is well: if He wills that
I should die now, it is well. But I forget not God: I pray for myself
to God, for my children, and for my wife. Still the pain is violent.
With God rests the issue, whether for life or for death. As for me, I
am now in the interval between life and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From JOHN HUKI."
