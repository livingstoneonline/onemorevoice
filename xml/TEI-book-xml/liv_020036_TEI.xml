<p>It was about ten o'clock at night, towards the end of the last re<!-- ­ -->bellion, that five privates and a sergeant attached to the &#8212;&#8212; company of the <orgName>Trelawny Militia</orgName> were located in an out-house on &#8212;&#8212; estate, for the purpose of protecting that property in an anticipated attack of the insurgents.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was about as dark a night, reader, as I remember ever to have <seg type="word">seen ;</seg> the rain fell in torrents, not a star was visible, and the thunder broke over our heads in loud and deafening peals, and with a force, too, that shook to its foundation the crazy building in which we were posted.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Not one of us had a dry rag about <seg type="word">him ;</seg> for as the dismantled old house possessed but half a roof, and the pro<!-- ­ -->portion of half a shutter to every three windows&#8212;to say nothing of a most lamentable deficiency of sash frames, the rain poured down as mercilessly on us as it did outside of the house.</p>

a heap of empty bottles and broken glasses.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It required  but that to cap the climax of his <seg type="word">misfortunes ;</seg> starting up with a yell which rung throughout the house, he ran towards the door, determined, as he afterwards told us, rather to brave the storm without, than to remain one moment longer in the house.</p>
		
<p>But he was suddenly foiled in his attempt to escape.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He had scarcely reached the door when a vivid light shot up on his path, and the entrance to the apartment became occupied by a most extraordi<!-- ­ -->nary apparition.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Toosy</persName> started back with much more vigour than he had exhibited in making for the <seg type="word">door ;</seg> and truly, a man of stronger nerve than our poor <term type="collective">Cockney</term>, might have felt some dread at the unexpected visit of the being who had so suddenly broken in upon our privacy.</p>
	
<p>The intruder was a tall gaunt negress, whose age, notwithstanding her erect stature, must have exceeded fifty <seg type="word">years ;</seg> her dress, which barely reached her skinny legs, was tattered, and dripping with <seg type="word">moisture ;</seg> her head was bare, and exposed to view a quantity of woolly grey hair, and her features were sharp and severe. But the most striking object about her face, was her <seg type="word">mouth ;</seg> it looked no more like the usual negro receptacle for cocoas and plantains, than chalk does like <seg type="word">cheese ;</seg> the lower lip hung down so low, as almost to conceal her chin, whilst five or six long white teeth protruding from her gums, gave her an appearance of ghastliness and  terror, which struck a chill to our hearts.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She carried in her left hand a large horn lantern, the side of which was <seg type="word">open ;</seg> and in her right, a bright matchet or <seg type="word">cutlas ;</seg> <seg type="word"><choice><sic>"</sic><corr></corr></choice> </seg>no word spoke she,<seg type="word"> <choice><sic>"</sic><corr></corr></choice></seg> until she had carefully examined the apartment, when in harsh discordant notes, but in terms strikingly devoid of the negro <hi rend="italic">patois</hi>, she enquired, <seg type="word">" is</seg> there a negro here?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Does one of that cursed race inhabit this room?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Be he slave or freeman, no negro, nor none of his blood, must hear the words which I have to speak to<!-- ­ --><seg type="word">night. "</seg></p>
	
<p><seg type="word">" There</seg> is no negro here, good mother," I replied, <seg type="word">" and </seg>your light at all events, if not yourself, is most heartily <seg type="word">welcome. "</seg></p>
	
<p>She sat down without replying, and appeared to be deep in thought for some <seg type="word">minutes ;</seg> at last she muttered <seg type="word">" I'll</seg> do <seg type="word">it "</seg>&#8212;then turning towards us, enquired, <seg type="word">" who</seg> commands <seg type="word">here? "</seg></p>
	
<p><seg type="word">" I</seg> <seg type="word"> do,"</seg> said sergeant S&#8212;&#8212;, rising from a heap of cloaks on which he had thrown himself. <seg type="word">" I</seg> do, mother, what would you with <seg type="word">us? "</seg></p>
		
<p><seg type="word">"Have</seg> you strength and courage?" asked she.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><seg type="word">" Could</seg> you dare the lion in his den, or rouse the savage tiger in the jungle?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>If ye can, follow me&#8212;but I warn ye death will be among ye ere the day breaks on this distracted country.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Follow me at once, and nerve yourselves to accomplish an act of daring and of <seg type="word"> danger. "</seg></p>
	
<p><seg type="word">" Softly</seg>, good mother," said <persName>Sergeant S&#8212;&#8212;</persName>, "these are not times when men blindly rush into danger, or follow at the beck of every and any one.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We must know whither you would lead us, and the nature of the expedition on which yon command our <seg type="word">aid.

<p>The cautious reply of <persName>Sergeant S&#8212;&#8212;</persName> drew forth some commen<!-- ­ -->datory remarks from young <persName>Toosy</persName>, who was apparently but little dis<!-- ­ -->posed to lend the aid of his powerful arm and great military talents in carrying out the desires of the old woman.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Whether it was that the warning contained in the negress's address damped his courage (and, between us, good reader, <persName>Toosy</persName> was not blessed with any extraordi<!-- ­ -->nary development of the organ of combativeness,) or whether he con<!-- ­ -->ceived that the misfortunes which had already befallen him, were suffi<!-- ­ -->cient for the night, I will not undertake to decide, but his disinclina<!-- ­ -->tion to trust himself to the guidance of the old woman was expressed in terms so forcible and explicit, that they drew upon his luckless head the entire burst of anger which she had been vainly endeavoring to repress.</p>

<p><seg type="word">" Weak</seg> and timid fool," she exclaimed, <seg type="word">" your</seg> chicken-heart would but destroy our chance of success.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Remain here, if you fear to fol<!-- ­ -->low me, and change your musket for a doll.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Is it with men such as you that the government expects to put down this <seg type="word">outbreak ?</seg><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Fools are they to suppose <seg type="word">so !</seg><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>If there are any <hi rend="italic">men</hi> among ye, follow me at <seg type="word">once" ;</seg> she continued turning to the others, <seg type="word">" follow</seg> me this in<!-- ­ -->stant, or lose the honor which you will acquire in taking one of the most daring and successful of the <seg type="word"><orgName>rebels</orgName>. "</seg></p>

<p>	The tone in which she spoke, her excited gestures, and air of authority, together with the prospect she held out of our taking an in<!-- ­ -->surgent chief, produced the desired effect.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In an instant every man was on his feet, busily resuming the military accoutrements which had been thrown aside, and we were just about to follow our strange guide when the storm of rain and thunder burst forth with renewed fury, and for the moment compelled us to abandon all idea of the ex<!-- ­ -->pedition.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><seg type="word">" However</seg> willing we may be to accompany you, my good woman" said <persName>Sergeant &#8212;&#8212;</persName>, addressing the negress, <seg type="word">" you</seg> perceive it will be impossible for us to do so at present.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>No human being could live in a night like this, were he exposed to the fury of the elements.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sit down, therefore, and let us know something more of the service which you require at our <seg type="word">hand."</seg></p>

<p>She made no answer to this address, but commenced to pace up and down the dilapidated apartment, totally regardless of the heavy fall of water which poured down through the broken roof on her un<!-- ­ -->covered head.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After continuing this exercise for some minutes, she gradually drew near to the lantern which she had placed under the table, and throwing herself on the floor, begun to warm her long skinny hand at the flame of the candle, muttering some words the while, but in so low a tone as prevented our catching their import.</p>
	
<p><persName>Toosy</persName>, who appeared to have recovered from the effects of all his late misfortunes, except that particular one which had resulted in the loss of his whisker, began to while away the time with a most <seg type="word">melan<!-- ­ -->choly</seg> ditty, which, as it belonged to that species of musical composi<!-- ­ -->tions usually termed sentimental, aided not a little in producing the<lb/>

effects of a sedative on our senses.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Not that there was anything par<!-- ­ -->ticularly somnific in the air itself&#8212;in fact it was rather an agreeable recital of the loves of a certain <persName>Alice Gray</persName>, and an anonymous youth.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Toosy</persName> possessed little or no musical genius, und had a most extraor<!-- ­ -->dinary knack of converting demi-semi-quavers into breeves, and semi<!-- ­ -->quavers into semi-breeves.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The effect of this peculiar talent on the part of <persName>Toosy</persName> was, as may be supposed, that of extending the air to a most unconscionable length&#8212;and to such a height had he carried this new principle in music, that he once contrived to continue the battle of <settlement>Prague</settlement> through an entire <seg type="word">fortnight ;</seg> at the conclusion of which, he relieved our ears with the welcome announcement that he had forgotten the remaining half of the piece.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Toosy</persName>, I say, had just commenced to while away the time with the afore-mentioned air, and we were just falling into a refreshing slumber, when we were startled by a sudden and loud exclamation from the old woman.</p>
	
<p><seg type="word">" Stop,"</seg> she cried, <seg type="word">" stop</seg> for the love of <seg type="word">God !</seg> <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>That song, that song, it will kill <seg type="word">me. "</seg></p>

<p><seg type="word">" There,"</seg> blubbered out the luckless <persName>Toosy</persName>.</p>
		
<p><seg type="word">" There</seg>, I've put my foot in it again."<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><seg type="word">" I</seg> always thought you'd kill somebody yet with your cursed howling," said <persName>Dick</persName>, <seg type="word">" Can't</seg> you stop with that d&#8212;&#8212;d thing you call a song?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It's enough to kill a deaf horse, much less an old nigger <seg type="word">woman.<choice><sic></sic><corr>"</corr></choice></seg></p>

<p><seg type="word">" I'm</seg> sure," commenced <persName>Toosy</persName>, apologetically, <seg type="word">" I'm</seg> sure I didn't mean to do any harm to the old 'oman, but&#8212;" <seg type="word">" It's</seg> of no conse<!-- ­ -->quence young man," interposed the negress, <seg type="word">" and</seg> no apology is needed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>'Twas but a momentary spasm that caused me to cry out, and it has passed."</p>
				
<p>The words, however, to which she had given utterance, refuted her assertion of sudden illness.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I felt convinced there was some mystery connected with the old woman, and determined to make myself ac<!-- - -->quainted with it.</p>

<p><seg type="word">" You</seg> have not complied with our request, good mother," said I, <seg type="word">" We</seg> asked you to give us some information as to the nature of the service you require of us."</p>
	
<p>The old woman appeared to reflect for a moment, then putting her hands to her eyes and dashing away a few tears which had gathered there, she said in a voice broken with emotion, <seg type="word">" Listen</seg> to <seg type="word">me ;</seg> draw near all of you, and hearken to the story of  my life&#8212;nearer yet, I must whisper it to you, for I fear I have scarce enough strength left me to tell it."</p>
	
<p>We drew closer as she requested, and waited eagerly for the words to fall from her lips.</p>
	
<p><seg type="word">" Do</seg> I look like one who has suffered?" she <seg type="word">began ;</seg>  <seg type="word">" do</seg> I look like one who has ever known what it is to be happy?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Ye answer <seg type="word">not ;</seg> but let me tell you, I was not always the miserable wretch I appear to be.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Age and misfortunes have broken my spirit, and poverty and neglect are hurrying me to the grave.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I was and<lb/>
