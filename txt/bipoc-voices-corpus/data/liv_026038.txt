Again, the effect of the faith in the heart is manifested by these Christian Indians in their
hour of death. The Rev. H. Budd, himself a first-fruit of the Indian people, writes from
Cumberland:—
"I went to visit a poor woman who has been suffering
a long time;
she suffers patiently and submissively. Asking her whom she trusted in,
she replied, 'None but the Saviour.' 'Have you any fear of death?'
'Not while the Saviour is with me.' 'What is the Saviour to you?' 'He
is everything to me.'"

From Devon, Mr. Budd writes in 1872:—
"I am thankful to be able
to say, that if the Devon
Indians are improving in their
temporal condition, they are,
I humbly trust, no less im-
proving in their spiritual. If
we may judge of the tree by
its fruit, I witness enough to make me hope that they are
growing in the Divine life,
and increasing in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
An increasing thirst for the
Word of God is manifest by
their regular attendance on
the preached Word; their
punctual attendance on all the
means of grace; as well by the
labour and toil they will take
in travelling so far in the cold
and snow to be present at each
returning Sacrament day.
Christ Church tells that the
population in Devon is growing; it is sometimes full to
overflowing. The regularity
of the responses in the services, and the hearty singing,
show that the congregation
understand and value the services. The Cumberland House
Indians have begun to build
houses for themselves like the Devon Indians. Here they assemble on
Sundays, and, as many of them can read in their own language, they have
their books both Prayer-book and the New Testament, and can hold
regular services among themselves."
