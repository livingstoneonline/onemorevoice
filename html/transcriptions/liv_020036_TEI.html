<h3 class="head caps center large "><span class="seg large ">An Incident
<br>In the Late Rebellion in <span class="country" title="A country.">Jamaica</span>.</span></h3>
<hr class="milestone halfline quarterline ">
<p class="p ">It was about ten o'clock at night, towards the end of the last rebellion, that five
privates and a sergeant attached to the —— company of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Trelawny Militia</span> were located in an out-house on —— estate, for the purpose of protecting that property
in an anticipated attack of the insurgents.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was about as dark a night, reader, as I remember ever to have <span class="seg word ">seen ;</span> the rain fell in torrents, not a star was visible, and the thunder broke over our
heads in loud and deafening peals, and with a force, too, that shook to its foundation
the crazy building in which we were posted.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not one of us had a dry rag about <span class="seg word ">him ;</span> for as the dismantled old house possessed but half a roof, and the proportion of
half a shutter to every three windows—to say nothing of a most lamentable deficiency
of sash frames, the rain poured down as mercilessly on us as it did outside of the
house.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Vot</span> a night for firevorks and <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Wauxall</span>," said young <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>—(the last importation from <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Cokaigne</span>, who had joined our company just before the breaking out of the rebellion)—his teeth
chattering in his head, and his lips as blue almost as indigo.—<span class="seg word ">" Real</span> stunning enjoyment I call <span class="seg word ">this,"</span> continued he, <span class="seg word ">" cuss</span> the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">rebels</span>, the black varmints, and <span class="italic "><em>juice</em></span> take the <span class="italic "><em>Curnol</em></span> for hordering us on this dirty <span class="seg word ">duty ;</span> you hain't got a cigar about you <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dick</span>, 'ave you?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I do think I'd feel better for a <span class="seg word ">veed "</span>.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dick</span> pouch was forthcoming at the word, but the cigars, like everything else about him,
were soaked through with water.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>, however, selected one which he thought he might manage, and crawling towards the
single candle, which flared and sputtered in a porter bottle under a table, where
it had been placed to protect it as much as possible from the rain, endeavoured to
kindle his cigar at the puny flame.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His exertions, were, however, ineffectual, and resulted only in his extinguishing
the miserable light, and leaving us in utter darkness.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Here's</span> a go," exclaimed the unfortunate recruit, as he groped his way back to his comparatively
dry corner, amid a volley of abuse from his fellow-sufferers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" Here's</span> a cussed go, I do believe the devil himself has had a hand in everything that has
happened to-night. Fust of all <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> burnt the priming of his gun near my face, as he says, by accident, and singed off
von of my <span class="seg word ">viskers ;</span> next that d——d nigger gave me winigar for brandy, and now I have gone and blowed
out the honly light ve had.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I'm blessed if it's not enough to drive von distracted;" saying which, poor <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> coolly deposited himself on<br>
<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center caps ">An Incident in the Late Rebellion in <span class="country" title="A country.">Jamaica</span>.</span> <span class="seg right ">37</span></span>
a heap of empty bottles and broken glasses.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It required but that to cap the climax of his <span class="seg word ">misfortunes ;</span> starting up with a yell which rung throughout the house, he ran towards the door,
determined, as he afterwards told us, rather to brave the storm without, than to remain
one moment longer in the house.</p>
<p class="p ">But he was suddenly foiled in his attempt to escape.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He had scarcely reached the door when a vivid light shot up on his path, and the entrance
to the apartment became occupied by a most extraordinary apparition.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> started back with much more vigour than he had exhibited in making for the <span class="seg word ">door ;</span> and truly, a man of stronger nerve than our poor <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Cockney</span>, might have felt some dread at the unexpected visit of the being who had so suddenly
broken in upon our privacy.</p>
<p class="p ">The intruder was a tall gaunt negress, whose age, notwithstanding her erect stature,
must have exceeded fifty <span class="seg word ">years ;</span> her dress, which barely reached her skinny legs, was tattered, and dripping with
<span class="seg word ">moisture ;</span> her head was bare, and exposed to view a quantity of woolly grey hair, and her features
were sharp and severe. But the most striking object about her face, was her <span class="seg word ">mouth ;</span> it looked no more like the usual negro receptacle for cocoas and plantains, than
chalk does like <span class="seg word ">cheese ;</span> the lower lip hung down so low, as almost to conceal her chin, whilst five or six
long white teeth protruding from her gums, gave her an appearance of ghastliness and
terror, which struck a chill to our hearts.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She carried in her left hand a large horn lantern, the side of which was <span class="seg word ">open ;</span> and in her right, a bright matchet or <span class="seg word ">cutlas ;</span> <span class="seg word "><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">"</u> </span>no word spoke she,<span class="seg word "> <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">"</u></span> until she had carefully examined the apartment, when in harsh discordant notes, but
in terms strikingly devoid of the negro <span class="italic "><em>patois</em></span>, she enquired, <span class="seg word ">" is</span> there a negro here?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Does one of that cursed race inhabit this room?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Be he slave or freeman, no negro, nor none of his blood, must hear the words which
I have to speak to<span class="seg word ">night. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" There</span> is no negro here, good mother," I replied, <span class="seg word ">" and </span>your light at all events, if not yourself, is most heartily <span class="seg word ">welcome. "</span></p>
<p class="p ">She sat down without replying, and appeared to be deep in thought for some <span class="seg word ">minutes ;</span> at last she muttered <span class="seg word ">" I'll</span> do <span class="seg word ">it "</span>—then turning towards us, enquired, <span class="seg word ">" who</span> commands <span class="seg word ">here? "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" I</span> <span class="seg word "> do,"</span> said sergeant S——, rising from a heap of cloaks on which he had thrown himself. <span class="seg word ">" I</span> do, mother, what would you with <span class="seg word ">us? "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">"Have</span> you strength and courage?" asked she.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" Could</span> you dare the lion in his den, or rouse the savage tiger in the jungle?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If ye can, follow me—but I warn ye death will be among ye ere the day breaks on this
distracted country.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Follow me at once, and nerve yourselves to accomplish an act of daring and of <span class="seg word "> danger. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Softly</span>, good mother," said <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant S——</span>, "these are not times when men blindly rush into danger, or follow at the beck of
every and any one.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We must know whither you would lead us, and the nature of the expedition on which
yon command our <span class="seg word ">aid. "</span></p>
<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg left ">38</span> <span class="seg center caps ">An Incident In The</span></span>
<p class="p ">The cautious reply of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant S——</span> drew forth some commendatory remarks from young <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>, who was apparently but little disposed to lend the aid of his powerful arm and great
military talents in carrying out the desires of the old woman.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether it was that the warning contained in the negress's address damped his courage
(and, between us, good reader, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> was not blessed with any extraordinary development of the organ of combativeness,)
or whether he conceived that the misfortunes which had already befallen him, were
sufficient for the night, I will not undertake to decide, but his disinclination to
trust himself to the guidance of the old woman was expressed in terms so forcible
and explicit, that they drew upon his luckless head the entire burst of anger which
she had been vainly endeavoring to repress.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Weak</span> and timid fool," she exclaimed, <span class="seg word ">" your</span> chicken-heart would but destroy our chance of success.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remain here, if you fear to follow me, and change your musket for a doll.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Is it with men such as you that the government expects to put down this <span class="seg word ">outbreak ?</span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fools are they to suppose <span class="seg word ">so !</span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If there are any <span class="italic "><em>men</em></span> among ye, follow me at <span class="seg word ">once" ;</span> she continued turning to the others, <span class="seg word ">" follow</span> me this instant, or lose the honor which you will acquire in taking one of the most
daring and successful of the <span class="seg word "><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">rebels</span>. "</span></p>
<p class="p "> The tone in which she spoke, her excited gestures, and air of authority, together
with the prospect she held out of our taking an insurgent chief, produced the desired
effect.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an instant every man was on his feet, busily resuming the military accoutrements
which had been thrown aside, and we were just about to follow our strange guide when
the storm of rain and thunder burst forth with renewed fury, and for the moment compelled
us to abandon all idea of the expedition.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" However</span> willing we may be to accompany you, my good woman" said <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant ——</span>, addressing the negress, <span class="seg word ">" you</span> perceive it will be impossible for us to do so at present.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No human being could live in a night like this, were he exposed to the fury of the
elements.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sit down, therefore, and let us know something more of the service which you require
at our <span class="seg word ">hand."</span></p>
<p class="p ">She made no answer to this address, but commenced to pace up and down the dilapidated
apartment, totally regardless of the heavy fall of water which poured down through
the broken roof on her uncovered head.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After continuing this exercise for some minutes, she gradually drew near to the lantern
which she had placed under the table, and throwing herself on the floor, begun to
warm her long skinny hand at the flame of the candle, muttering some words the while,
but in so low a tone as prevented our catching their import.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>, who appeared to have recovered from the effects of all his late misfortunes, except
that particular one which had resulted in the loss of his whisker, began to while
away the time with a most <span class="seg word ">melancholy</span> ditty, which, as it belonged to that species of musical compositions usually termed
sentimental, aided not a little in producing the<br>
<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center caps ">Late Rebellion in <span class="country" title="A country.">Jamaica</span>.</span> <span class="seg right ">39</span></span>
effects of a sedative on our senses.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not that there was anything particularly somnific in the air itself—in fact it was
rather an agreeable recital of the loves of a certain <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Alice Gray</span>, and an anonymous youth.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> possessed little or no musical genius, und had a most extraordinary knack of converting
demi-semi-quavers into breeves, and semiquavers into semi-breeves.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The effect of this peculiar talent on the part of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> was, as may be supposed, that of extending the air to a most unconscionable length—and
to such a height had he carried this new principle in music, that he once contrived
to continue the battle of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Prague</span> through an entire <span class="seg word ">fortnight ;</span> at the conclusion of which, he relieved our ears with the welcome announcement that
he had forgotten the remaining half of the piece.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>, I say, had just commenced to while away the time with the afore-mentioned air, and
we were just falling into a refreshing slumber, when we were startled by a sudden
and loud exclamation from the old woman.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Stop,"</span> she cried, <span class="seg word ">" stop</span> for the love of <span class="seg word ">God !</span> <span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That song, that song, it will kill <span class="seg word ">me. "</span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" There,"</span> blubbered out the luckless <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" There</span>, I've put my foot in it again."<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" I</span> always thought you'd kill somebody yet with your cursed howling," said <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dick</span>, <span class="seg word ">" Can't</span> you stop with that d——d thing you call a song?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It's enough to kill a deaf horse, much less an old nigger <span class="seg word ">woman.<u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: &#34;"></u></span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" I'm</span> sure," commenced <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>, apologetically, <span class="seg word ">" I'm</span> sure I didn't mean to do any harm to the old 'oman, but—" <span class="seg word ">" It's</span> of no consequence young man," interposed the negress, <span class="seg word ">" and</span> no apology is needed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Twas but a momentary spasm that caused me to cry out, and it has passed."</p>
<p class="p ">The words, however, to which she had given utterance, refuted her assertion of sudden
illness.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I felt convinced there was some mystery connected with the old woman, and determined
to make myself acquainted with it.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" You</span> have not complied with our request, good mother," said I, <span class="seg word ">" We</span> asked you to give us some information as to the nature of the service you require
of us."</p>
<p class="p ">The old woman appeared to reflect for a moment, then putting her hands to her eyes
and dashing away a few tears which had gathered there, she said in a voice broken
with emotion, <span class="seg word ">" Listen</span> to <span class="seg word ">me ;</span> draw near all of you, and hearken to the story of my life—nearer yet, I must whisper
it to you, for I fear I have scarce enough strength left me to tell it."</p>
<p class="p ">We drew closer as she requested, and waited eagerly for the words to fall from her
lips.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Do</span> I look like one who has suffered?" she <span class="seg word ">began ;</span> <span class="seg word ">" do</span> I look like one who has ever known what it is to be happy?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ye answer <span class="seg word ">not ;</span> but let me tell you, I was not always the miserable wretch I appear to be.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Age and misfortunes have broken my spirit, and poverty and neglect are hurrying me
to the grave.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I was and<br>

am still a slave, though only one in name, for I was ever free to go and come as I
liked.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I belonged to <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">—— estate</span>, and was a domestic in the great-house, until I bore my first child, when I was called
upon to perform the functions of a nurse.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From these now dry and withered breasts, the only daughter of my dear mistress drew
her first sustenance, her unfortunate mother having died in giving her birth.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I nursed my young charge from her infancy, and tended her until she reached the age
of twelve years, when my master resolved on sending her to <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> to be educated.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At her entreaty and my own, I was permitted to accompany her, and I remained in <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> with her until she returned to <span class="country" title="A country.">Jamaica</span> in her 18th year.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shortly after that event, my master died under circumstances which created suspicion
of his having come to his end by violent <span class="seg word ">means ;</span> but notwithstanding the many investigations which took place into the cause of his
sudden death, the crime could not be traced home to any one, and to all but myself
it has been until this night buried in mystery.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Miss Harriet</span>, as you may suppose, was considerably affected by the death of her beloved parent,
and for some months she was plunged into a state of gloom and sorrow, from which I
found it difficult to arouse her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But unavailing regret, like every thing else, must have an <span class="seg word ">end ;</span> and about two years after her father's death she married a young Englishman, named
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Gray</span>, who had but a short time before arrived on the <span class="seg word ">island. <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: &#34;"></u></span></p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" It</span> was about this time also that I married the man with whom I had lived previous to
my departure from <span class="seg word "><span class="country" title="A country.">Jamaica</span> :</span> but I had soon bitter cause to regret the step I had taken.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The little money which the kindness of my mistress had enabled me to save, was seized
by my husband, who was a free man, and lavishly squandered on other women for whom
he neglected me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My spirit rose at this treatment.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A feeling of hatred towards him sprung up in my breast, which was not a little increased
by a proposition he once made to me to rob my mistress to supply his extravagance.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I do not now recollect what at the time prevented my acquainting my mistress with
the nature of the disgraceful proposal which had been made to me, but I have since
had bitter reasons to blame myself for not having done so.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Need I say that I met my husband's vile proposition with scorn and revilings?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From that moment we met no more until three or four months after our separation, when
I received a message from him, stating that he was dying, and earnestly praying me
to see him once again before we parted for ever.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I hastened to him, forgetful of all my past sufferings, and found him as he had said,
fast hurrying to the grave.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He recognised me immediately, and motioning all except myself out of the room, beckoned
me towards his bedside.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He held out his hand, and not only implored my forgiveness, but also begged me to
pray for God's mercy on his soul, for, said he, <span class="seg word ">" there's</span> blood upon <span class="seg word ">it ;</span> the blood of a good worthy man lies heavily on it, and I am stained not alone with
the sin of ingratitude towards you, but with the heinous<br>

by my husband's hand—that the child which I then bore in my womb was the offspring
of a murderer—that perhaps it would come into the world with all the evils of its

was unequal to the task.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Throwing myself down again with the intention to take a little repose, the sound of

<p class="p ">She rose as she ceased speaking.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her tall form appeared to expand to a gigantic size, as re-armed with the recital
of her woes, she drew herself up and gazed on us as if she would have said, <span class="seg word ">" See</span>, my misfortunes have not yet broken my <span class="seg word ">spirit ;</span> I can still act and think for myself."<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Heaven only knows what thoughts were passing in her mind at that moment.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her eyes flashed, her nostrils dilated, and her breast heaved as though a fearful
struggle were going on within her, but not another word escaped her lips at that <span class="seg word ">time ;</span> and she soon after regained her composure.</p>
<p class="p ">The storm had now almost subsided.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The wind would moan and sigh occasionally through the thick foliage of the numberless
trees that surrounded the house, but there was no longer any rain or thunder, and
the earth exhaled that peculiar odour which usually rises from it after a heavy rain.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It yet wanted two or three hours of daylight, and the old woman urged us to take advantage
of the remaining hours of darkness, and hasten in pursuit of her wretched son.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Accordingly we made every preparation necessary for the supposed difficulties of the
expedition—cleaned and dried our firelocks, examined our ammunition, and found that,
fortunately, our powder was perfectly <span class="seg word ">dry ;</span> and put everything else in an effective condition.</p>
<p class="p "> After about an hour's hard walking, we followed our strange guide into a narrow defile,
overhung by towering and massive rocks.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A mountain torrent, swollen by the late rains, roared and splashed down a precipitous
gully that ran along the entire line of road, extending in many instances over large
portions of the path itself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Poor <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span>'s misfortunes recommenced as we entered on this portion of our march.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First his hat was knocked over his eyes by an overhanging <span class="seg word ">branch ;</span> then he lost one boot, which was with difficulty <span class="seg word ">recovered ;</span> at another time his lankly feet became entangled in some under-wood, and he was thrown
on his face with some violence.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Again he lost his footing and plumped up to his middle in a deep hole filled with
<span class="seg word ">water ;</span> and at last, in sheer desperation, he sat himself down on a piece of fallen rock,
and swore not to budge another foot farther.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" Take</span> your hand from off mine," said he to one of us who stood by him, <span class="seg word ">" its</span> as cold and clammy as hice: take it away, I say, and leave me here, I am determined

itself from the limb, and escaped into the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The outcries which the frightened <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> made startled the echoes to so great degree, that I have no doubt many a sleeping
bird was deprived of its morning's nap.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From one extreme<br>

as soon as possible.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The dangers of remaining where he was appeared to him much greater than any which

<p class="p ">Order being once more established, we hasted to make up for the lost time, particularly
as some red streaks in the east warned us that the dawn was approaching.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our way led, for about two miles farther, up the defile, when it was suddenly brought
to a close by what appeared to us to be an insurmountable obstacle.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An enormous rock, clothed to its summit with rank <span class="seg word ">vegetation ;</span> completely blocked up the path, and barred all egress in that direction.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finding himself thus circumstanced, doubts of the honesty and good faith of our guide
began to enter the mind of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Serjeant S——</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He imagined she had led us into this trap in order to give us into the hands of one
of the numerous gangs of <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">insurgent negroes</span> who roamed about in all <span class="seg word ">directions ;</span> and his alarm momentarily increased.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Daylight was now fast stealing on us, and it afforded some satisfaction to know that
in the event of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Serjeant S——'s</span> suspicions being confirmed, we should at least be able to see and oppose the danger
by which we were surrounded.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" See,"</span> cried <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Serjeant S——</span> suddenly <span class="seg word ">" Look</span> there—to the <span class="seg word ">right !</span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By heaven there are figures moving on the hill.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stand to your arms my men.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We must now sell our lives dearly."</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Hola !</span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Draw not a trigger on our lives," interposed our guide, <span class="seg word ">" the</span> men on the rock above are <span class="seg word ">friends ;</span> they come to aid us in this <span class="seg word ">enterprise.

<p class="p "> The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Serjeant</span> stepped forward as he spoke with the intention of seizing her, but she sprung aside
with an agility which her age did not betoken, and quickly scrambling up one side
of the rock, divided with her powerful arm a thick cluster of underwood, and stepped
into the path she had opened for herself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A few seconds elapsed and she once more appeared on a portion of the rock which jutted
far out into the air.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">" You</span> forced me to act as I have done," she exclaimed, as she took up her position above

<span class="seg word ">so." </span><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She disappeared behind a portion of the rocks as she spoke and soon, after we perceived
her descending into the defile, accompanied by three of her followers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As she advanced <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Serjeant S——</span> stepped forward and in a few words expressed his gratitude for her forbearance.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He now declared his readiness to follow with his men whithersoever she chose to lead
<span class="seg word ">him ;</span> and giving the word to march, we cautiously ascended a narrow beaten track which
our guide pointed out to us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was now day-break, but a thick fog which rose from the defile, and overhung the
surrounding hills, rendered it necessary that we should tread with the utmost care
the precarious path by which we mounted into the region of rock and wood high over
our heads.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A quarter of an hour's toil and exertion brought us in front of what appeared to be
a deep fissure in the mountain, the entrance to which was partly concealed by a quantity
of brush-wood and fragments of limestone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cautioning us not to utter a word, and to keep within call, but not to show ourselves
in the direct path to the cave, the negress strode towards it, followed by the three
negroes who, I had forgotten to say, were armed with old rusty fowling pieces and
cutlasses.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The loud barking of a dog within the cave betrayed the approach of the intruder, and
the sound of a confused noise in the same direction, shortly after reached our ears.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was evident that the tenants of the cave were alarmed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The negress beckoned us to approach, which we did as quickly as the nature of the
ground would permit.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No one had yet issued from the <span class="seg word ">cavern ;</span> the persons concealed within were doubtless acting on the defensive, and as it appeared
a matter of no difficulty for a party of resolute men to defend the place for a long
time, we began to dread that, unprepared as we were to carry on a siege, we would
be compelled to retrace our steps without accomplishing the purpose for which we had
severely and laboriously toiled.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Serjeant S——</span> called an immediate council of war, and it was determined to dispose of the few men
he had under his command with as much effect as possible.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Myself and another were ordered to advance towards the left of the cavern, where a
narrow path was distinctly visible, to intercept whomsoever might attempt to escape
in that <span class="seg word ">direction ;</span> two of the negroes, and as many more of our own party, were directed to clamber over
the rocks, and endeavour to discover if there were any outlet at the back of the <span class="seg word ">cave ;</span> while <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> and the remaining negro were posted some yards below, in the track by which we had
ascended, and ordered give immediate alarm should any hostile movement be observed
in that quarter.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant S——</span> himself with the negress and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dick</span>, undertook to keep possession of the path leading to the mouth of the cavern, and
to resist every effort of the beseiged to escape.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Having thus disposed of our small force, we waited as patiently as we could until
the opportunity should offer for the exercise of more vigorous and decisive measures.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Half an hour passed away, and matters still remained in the same position.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The sun rose in splendour, and<br>

dispersed the thick mist which surrounded us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Exhausted with our previous exertions, and anxious to bring the business to a speedy
termination, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant S——</span> now determined to assail the entrance of the cavern at all risks.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He recalled the party under my command which had been posted on the hill, and desiring
us to co-operate with him, marched resolutely towards the cave.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Before, however, we had advanced twenty yards, the brushwood which partly concealed
the mouth of the cavern was removed, and a young negro of herculean build presented
himself at the entrance.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He was armed with a long cavalry pistol, which he carried in his <span class="seg word ">hand ;</span> by his side hung a broad shining cutlass, and in his belt was stuck what appeared
to be a sort of dirk.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He desired us to halt, and presented his pistol to enforce his command.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Utterly regardless, however, of the threatening aspect of the rebel, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant S——</span> commanded us to move forward, but his temerity well nigh cost him his life.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A sudden report, the sharp rustling in the air as the bullet flew through it, and
the rapid disappearance of the rebel from the spot on which he had been standing,
told that he had vainly expended his shot, and had retreated into the cave.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="seg word ">" Onward,"</span> exclaimed <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant S——</span>, <span class="seg word ">" and</span> quickly too, but be careful of being surprised in the cavern."<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We were now joined by the party who had been sent to learn if there were any other
entrance to the cave.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They reported their failure, which perhaps was fortunate for them, as the sequel will
shew.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our force being thus augmented, we did not hesitate for one moment to enter the stronghold
of the rebel.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="seg word ">We <span class="seg word "><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">"</u></span> carried</span> it at the point of the bayonet,<u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">"</u> but the object of our pursuit was nowhere to be found.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We could not discover the slightest trace of him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He had <span class="italic "><em>w</em></span>anished like a <span class="italic "><em>w</em></span>ision, as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> afterwards observed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strewed about the interior of the cave, were some broken victuals, a breaker of water,
and some spirits in a bottle.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an aperture in the solid rock was a bed composed of dried leaves and grass, covered
with several pieces of ragged blanketing, on which lay the dead body of a dog, doubtless
the same which had warned the rebel of an approach, and which he must have slain under
the apprehension of its betraying him.</p>
<p class="p ">Annoyed at our want of success, and astonished at the apparent mystery in which the
escape of the rebel was shrouded, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sergeant S——</span> gave strict injunctions to institute an immediate and rigid search throughout the
cave, in the hope of discovering some hidden outlet or secret hiding place, for which
the cavern offered many facilities.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words, however, had scarcely left his lips, when a loud cry reached our ears.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It appeared to come from the spot on which we had left <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Toosy</span> and the <span class="seg word ">negro ;</span> and impressed with the idea that the rebel had found some means to quit the cave,
and was then escaping, we hurried out with the view to intercept and take him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My blood runs cold, and my cheeks pale, even at this distance of time, when the recollection

death was almost on <span class="seg word ">us ;</span> certain and deadly destruction hung hovering over our heads but one minute before
we rushed from the cavern.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We had scarcely gone one hundred yards, when, with a report like a whole park of artillery
discharged simultaneously, and with a concussion that shook the earth for an immense
distance around, the cave was blown to atoms and scattered in a thousand fragments
in all directions.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For some moments we stood as if rooted to the earth.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We could neither move nor speak.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The suddenness of the occurrence, the horrible intention of the rebel to involve us
in his own dreadful fate, from which we were saved only by the merest accident, struck
us all as being so terrible and astounding, that for some minutes we were bereft of
motion.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gradually, however, we recovered ourselves, when the first words uttered were thanks
to the Almighty One, who had preserved our lives in the moment of danger.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This duty being paid, we looked about to observe the effects of the explosion.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The scorched and disfigured body of the rebel was stretched out at no great distance
from <span class="seg word ">us ;</span> beside it was the mangled remains of his dog, and it struck us as being an extraordinary
instance of retributive justice that the slaughtered animal should lie side by side
with him who had deprived it of life, within an hour after the act had been committed.</p>
<p class="p "> We never learned what became of the old negress.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether she perished in the cave, or escaped with us, we had no means of <span class="seg word ">ascertaining ;</span> but she was never afterwards seen or heard of.</p>
