<p>The following statement, made and signed by
the <term type="collective"><choice><orig>Bakwaina</orig><reg>Bakwena</reg></choice></term> Chief <persName>Sechele</persName>, now in <settlement>Cape Town</settlement>,
on his way to <country>England</country>, has been forwarded to us

<p rend="center caps">Statement of <persName>Sechele</persName>, Paramount
Chief of the <term type="collective"><choice><orig>Bakwaina</orig><reg>Bakwena</reg></choice></term></p>
<p>I am <persName>Sechele</persName>, son of <persName>Motchuazele</persName>, chief of the <term type="collective"><choice><orig>Bakuena</orig><reg>Bakwena</reg></choice></term>.
My father died while I was still young. After his death
the <term type="collective"><orig>Matabele</orig><reg>Ndebele</reg></term> under <persName><choice><orig>Mosilikatsi</orig><reg>Mzilikazi</reg></choice></persName> made war upon my <w>coun<!-- - -->try</w>, and destroyed my town. I fled with my people to
another part of our country near the desert. The <term type="collective"><choice><orig><w>Mata<!-- - -->bele</w></orig><reg>Ndebele</reg></choice></term> afterwards came out against us several times; but
we always escaped from them by going into the <region><choice><orig>Kalagare</orig><reg>Kalahari</reg></choice>
desert</region>, where they could not follow us, because they did
not know where water was to be found, and again 
<w>re<!-- - -->turning</w> when our enemies had gone back. We were 
living at a place called <settlement>Kopong</settlement>, when we heard that
<persName><choice><orig>Mosilikatsi</orig><reg>Mzilikazi</reg></choice></persName> had been attached by the <term type="collective">Boers</term>. Fearing
that the <term type="collective">Matabele</term> in flying from the <term type="collective">Boers</term> might fall
upon us, we removed to another part of our country, to a
place called <settlement>Lopepe</settlement>. We lived there some time
when we heard that <persName>Dingaan</persName> had attached the <term type="collective"><orig>Matabele</orig><reg>Ndebele</reg></term>, and
driven them out of the country. We then removed back
to <settlement>Shakwane</settlement>, the site of one of our former towns. About
five years afterwards I was again attacked by the 
<term type="collective"><w>Mata<!-- - -->bele</w></term>. Hearing that some <term type="collective">Boers</term> were hunting on the
<region>Mariqua</region>, I went to them and requested their assistance
against my enemies. They answered me, "the <term type="collective"><orig>Matabele</orig><reg>Ndebele</reg></term>
have not attacked our country, therefore we cannot 
<w>in<!-- - -->terfere</w>." These were the first <term type="collective">Boers</term> I had ever seen. I
then went back and collected my people together, and
removed with them to a place called <settlement>Chonuane</settlement>, in the
<term type="collective">Bakhatla</term> country, near the <region>Mariqua</region>, on account of the
game which was there in large numbers. At this place
I was visited by some of <persName>Potgieter</persName>'s people. They had
brought cattle for sale, these I purchased for ivory. I
also allowed them to hire some of my people to go 
and work for them. About three years after this, 
<persName><w>Living<!-- - -->stone</w></persName> came to live with me, and to preach the Word of 
God. After a while, a message came by some of 
<persName><w>Mokhat<!-- - -->la</w></persName>'s men from the <term type="collective">Boers</term> to say  I must give up all my guns.
<persName>Livingstone</persName> then went to the <term type="collective">Boers</term> to ask them why they
wished to take away my guns. They said it was because
I had come into their country. Some of these guns I had
purchased from <term type="collective">Boers</term>, others from <term type="collective">Griquas</term> and <term type="collective">English</term>
traders. About one year after this, I removed to <settlement>Kolobeng</settlement>
in my own country. The <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> now sent me repeated
orders to say I must stop the <term type="collective">English</term> from travelling
into my country, and also to say that they were the
masters of the land. I always refused to comply with
their demands. They, however, contined sending
letters to me threatening me with war, if I did not obey
them. I refused to comply with any of their orders.
I told them I would sooner die than become their slave.
The <term type="collective">English</term> I said were my friends; I received 
<w>every<!-- - -->thing</w> from them. I also told them I was not at <settlement>Chonuane</settlement>
any longer, which they said was their country. Another
reason why I refused to submit to their rule was, I
knew they ill-treated those tribes already under them,
taking away their cattle and children without cause. I had
heard also from some of my people who had been working 
for the <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> of the manner in which they had treated
<persName>Mangkopane</persName> and <persName>Mokopane</persName>, two chiefs to the
eastward of the <region>Mariqua</region>, how they had attacked these
chiefs without cause, and taken numbers of cattle and
children from them, and that maby of these children
were sold. Things went on in this manner till the time
that the <term type="collective">English</term> made a treaty with <persName>Pretorius</persName>. After
that, the <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> called upon all the chiefs to attend a
meeting. I refused to attend, because I did not 
<w>consi<!-- - -->der</w> myself under them. I learnt, however, from those 
who did attend, that they called upon us all to submit to
their laws, and if we refused they would make war upon
us. The <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> said that the country had been given to them
by the <term type="collective">English</term>, and that they had also been given them leave
to do as they pleased with the black people. About five
months after this, <persName>Moselele</persName>, chief of the <term type="collective">Bakhatla</term>, came 
to my place, he said, he was flying from the <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> who 
were coming in a large body to attack us. I told him I
was glad he had come to me, we could now fight 
<w>to<!-- - -->gether</w>, as I also was determined not to become a slave.
I also called upon <persName>Senthue</persName> and <persName>Segostsane</persName> to join me
that we might be able to make a stand against the <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term>.
They each sent a number of men, and these I supplied
with powder and lead. They came on a Saturday, and
sent me an order to give up <persName>Moselele</persName>; I told them that
<persName>Moselele</persName> was my father's son, and therefore I could not
give him up. I sent them word that the next day was
God's day, I wished therefore they would defer saying 
<w>any<!-- - -->thing</w> till Monday, when I would speak to them. On 
Monday morning, they sent one of my own men whom
they had taken prisoner, to say I must send all the women
and children out of the place, as they intended to fight.
I sent back a message to them saying, we had better
speak first. They said there is no tome to speak now, if
you are afraid to fight give up all your guns, all your
oxen, all your sheep, all your goats, and all your 
<w>child<!-- - -->dren</w>; also your corn, which we want for our horses. I
said, my children and my guns I cannot give you. These
can only be taken when I am dead. They commenced
the attack, my people tried to fight, but they could not
fight with <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term>. The tribes whom I had called to my
assistance fled at the first fire. I was surrounded on a
hill, with only a few men, by the <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term>. I fought till it
was dark, and retreated to another hill. The <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> took,
I think, one thousand children from my town, two
hundred women, burnt my town, took all the things
belonging to the <term type="collective">English</term>, which had been left in
my charge, most of the cattle, sheep, and goats,
belonging to myself and people. Eighty-nine of my
men fell in the fight. I retreated with my people
(those I had left), to the borders of the <region>Kalagare</region>. The 
<term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> have since sent to me desiring peace. I told them
I wanted my children back, and those of my people,--
and then I would make peace. They said, they could
not give them back. I now determined to go to the
<term type="collective">English</term>, and request them to reprimand the <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term>, and
restore peace to my country. If the <term type="collective">English</term> do not
assist me, I am a dead man. I do not know where to
go. The <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term> will not allow us to live any longer.
What grieves me very much also is, that I shall not be
able to hear the word of God any longer, the 
<w>missionar<!-- - -->ries</w> being also driven out of the country.</p>

<p>"I have this day seen in your paper an account of the
attack of the Emigrant <term type="collective">Boers</term> on <persName>Sechele</persName>'s kraal, and <w>hav-
ing</w> just returned from the interior, am able to confirm it
in every respect. On our road back we outspanned on
the site of <persName>Sechele</persName>'s kraal, which we found burnt down,
and about twenty skeletons lying on and about the hill.
The <term type="collective">Boers</term> took fifty five of our oxen, and nearly all the
loose cattle belonging to the <term type="collective">English</term> now in the interior.
The <term type="collective">Kafirs</term> report that the <term type="collective">Boers</term> have also sent a strong
commando to attach the travellers at the Lake. The
<term type="collective">Boers</term> are forming another commando to attack <persName>Mahura</persName>,
chief of the <term type="collective">Batlapis,</term> and in order to veil their <w>proceed-
ings</w> they represent that they are going to revenge a <w>mas-
sacre</w> which they allege to have been recently committed
by <persName>Moselekatse. As we were hunting all this year on</persName>
the borders of his country, far beyond the <term type="collective">Boers</term>, I can <w>con-
fidently</w> state that none of the <term type="collective">Boers</term> have been within
one hundred and fifty miles of any of his people. It is
quite true about their ransacking <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName> and
<persName>Mr. Edward</persName>'s houses, and also about their taking the
latter gentleman and <persName>Mr. Inglis</persName> to <region>Mahalisberg</region>. The
<term type="collective">Kafirs</term> we met on our road were starving, and <persName>Santonay</persName>,
one of the chiefs, told us, that in the event of continued
attacks, his and the other tribes intended to seek refuge
under the <orgName>British Government</orgName> in the Colony.</p>
