TO
THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE
AND LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OF THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT OF WESTERN AFRICA.
es
GENTLEMEN,—It has been truly remarked by Heberden, that
one of the first steps towards preserving the health of our
fellow-creatures is to point out the sources from which diseases
are to be apprehended. I have therefore, in the pages of this
work, endeavoured to investigate that subject in its detail, and
to point out the various causes which, on the West Coast of
Africa, have led to so fatal a result among the European and
native population; which have degraded the lives of a great
many; and which have deteriorated the energies of the in-
habitants.
The maladies peculiar to tropical climates have the most
mischievous effect in checking the progress of true civilisation
in tropical countries; they leave a prestige of insalubrity
hanging like a cloud over them. How far this is the case in
Western intertropical Africa, I need not venture to enlarge
upon, but will merely remark in passing, that not only has the
European on leaving home a melancholy foreboding of a
speedy termination of his existence, but his relatives and
friends also reckon him, from the day of his embarkation, as
amongst the dead; and to what extent these forebodings have
been realised, I leave the death-rate of the few Europeans who
visit the coast to tell.

ADDRESS.
It is unfortunately true, that the actual approach of disease
is the only mighty stimulus which can induce men in power
to give sufficient attention to sanitary matters ; and the Satur-
day Review has but recently made this just remark, that
"when the public health is satisfactory, sanitary reform is
naturally (held to be) rather a dull subject, and sanitary re-
formers run the risk of being voted at least equal nuisances
with the abuses which they wish to get removed." But the
public health is never satisfactory in the British colony in
Western Africa. In a pamphlet lately published by me on
the " Political Economy and Requirements of British Western
Africa," I urged the necessity of sanitary reform on the coast,
and I was harshly remarked upon by many of those whose
lives it was my chief object to spare. In this present work
I have entered more into detail respecting the nuisances
which abound in the various colonies, and I must, therefore,
be prepared for still harsher comments.
But believing that you, gentlemen, like myself, are interested
in the material advancement of the inhabitants of the coast,
and are ready to become "ministers, under Divine power and
goodness, in prolonging and economising the life of men,"-that
any means by which the great mortality could be effectually
diminished would be welcomed by you,—and that gradual and
efficient remedies would willingly be adopted by you to re-
move the evils pointed out, I beg respectfully to submit for
your attention and consideration the detailed causes of the
diseases of the coast, and the prophylactic measures which are
necessary for their amelioration.
In conclusion, may I be allowed to state that it will be a
happy day for the West Coast of Africa, for its European in-
habitants, and for its native population, when the Governor-
General may be able to state authoritatively, that "my medical.

officers of health * are industriously mapping out the realms of
diseases which too often definitely manifest themselves amongst
the vilest purlieus of our colonies, and ere long Western Africa
will, I trust, be pronounced one of the healthiest of Her
Majesty's intertropical possessions, since many of the causes
of disease are being systematically, energetically, and effec-
tually exterminated by rigid sanitary reform."

I have the honour to be,
GENTLEMEN,
Your most obedient humble servant,

tion of this volume, and while it has been passing through the press, the

PREFACE.
seve
WHILST the physical and medical climate of India,
Ceylon, the West Indies, Australia, and Intertropical
United States, has been ably described by Carter, Sir
R. Marten, Norman Chevers, Miss Nightingale, Sir E.
Tennant, Robert Jackson, Burgess, and Blodget, there
has never appeared a work on that of Western Africa,
as a whole, which would present an easy reference on
the various interesting subjects involved. There are
several works on the physical geography of Western
Africa, such as that of Hutchinson, Poole, Burton, &c.,
and recently Dr Clark has published a most able topo-
graphical description of the Gold Coast.
It has become a bye-word amongst Europeans that
the Western African colonies are the most deadly of the
British possessions ; but what are the various causes
which have led to this result, and what hygienic means
are necessary for their prevention and removal, are sub-
jects which have not received detailed consideration.
It is for the purpose of supplying this desideratum

PREFACE.
that I have ventured to undertake the publication of
the following researches made by me during a period
of six years on the West Coast of Africa ; and although
I am conscious that in the execution of my task I
have committed" many sins of omission and commis-
sion," yet I still venture to hope that the inferences
and deductions drawn from the various observations
on the subjects treated of, may serve as a guide to those
who shall hereafter attempt to give a fuller considera-
tion to the subject.
My opportunities of observation have been such as to
enable me, from personal experience, to make accurate
statements with regard to the climate from the Bight
of Benin to Senegal. I was stationed for nearly a year
at Quittah, in the Bights, and visited Lagos. I served
from time to time, during several years, at all the mili-
tary posts on the Gold Coast. I am a native of Sierra
Leone, where, fifteen years ago, I made thermometrical
and pluviametrical observations; and I was for two
years and a half stationed in the interior and on the
sea coast of the Gambia, the climate of which is almost
identical with that of Senegal on the north, and the
Casamanza on the south.
The plan adopted in this work is that recommended by
Malte Brun, and improved by Martin. I first considered
the physical climate and meteorology, including the
seasons; then the medical climate, with the mortality;

and I close with some hints for the preservation of
health in the tropics.
I have received great assistance from the able
work of Sir Ranald Martin, on "The Influence of
Tropical Climate ;" of Dr Edmund A. Parkes, on
" Practical Hygiene ;" and of Dr James H. Pickford,

PHYSICAL CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY
OF
WESTERN AFRICA.
CHAPTER I.
INTRODUCTION.
By the term climate is to be understood the condition of a Definitions.
place as regards the various complex phenomena connected Climate.
with the soil, the water, and the atmosphere.
When soil is referred to in a climatic point of view, it is soil.
intended to include all that portion of the earth's crust which,
under certain conditions, is capable of affecting health.
Dr Parkes gives the four following as the conditions neces-
sary for soil to affect health, viz:-
1. Its conformation and elevation.
2. The vegetation covering it.
3. Its mechanical structure, which influences absorption and
radiation of heat, reflection of light, absorption of water, move-
ment of water over and through the soil, passage of air through
soil, formation of dust.
4. Its chemical structure, which acts especially by altering
the composition of the air over the soil, or the water running
through it.
To which may be added the aspect of a place, and the amount
of sunshine and light it receives.
There are only two considerations by which the supply of Water.
water might affect health, viz., its quality and its quantity.
The climatic conditions of the air or atmosphere by which Atmosphere.


## p. 2 (#26) ###############################################

INTRODUCTION.
health can be affected might be arranged under the following
headings, viz.:-1. Its temperature ; 2. Its humidity; 3. Its
movement; 4. Its weight; 5. Its composition ; and 6. Its elec-
trical condition.
Meteorology. Of late, the meteorology of tropical climates has occupied
the attention of many physicians; and the more our knowledge
is increased as to its various influences in enhancing or miti-
gating diseases, the better shall we be able to conquer many
seeming difficulties in their treatment. Unfortunately, as yet
meteorology has not been turned to extensive practical advan-
tage; but every year new facts are discovered, and old prin-
ciples greatly elucidated; and the time is not far distant when
the ascertained meteoric causes of disease will be so displayed
before the public mind, that each individual will, by the force
of public opinion, find it incumbent on him to employ the best
hygienic remedies for the removal of those causes.
I differ from the assertion of Dr Mason Good, that "of all the
subdivisions of general philosophy, meteorology is the least
entitled to the name of science; and, consequently, physicians
need not blush at being incapable of turning to account the sup-
posed influence of the planets, or of unfolding and tracing the
origin and capricious courses of epidemics and pestilence." This
subject opens a wide field for investigation, which would repay
any physician who labours to develope the untold facts con-
nected with the meteoric origin and progress of pestilential and
other diseases. Meteorology treats especially of the atmosphere
-the different changes it undergoes during the course of the
year characterised as the seasons—the degree of heat and cold
-of saturation and of the state of the wind, as well as the
barometric pressure, and, consequently, treats of subjects which
are the ascertained causes of most of the diseases we meet with
in tropical climates. In these several bearings it affords objects
of interest to the agriculturist, the botanist, the naturalist, the
navigator, and the physician.
Meteorolo- To carry on meteorological observations, various instruments
4- are required; and I shall here give the official instructions
Meteorolo-
gical Instru-
nients.

INTRODUCTION.
issued by the Army Medical Department for reading the
meteorological instruments supplied by that Department. They
are as follow :-
The observer should make himself thoroughly acquainted
with the scale of every instrument, especially with that of the
barometer, and its attached vernier, and by frequent comparisons
ascertain that he and his deputy read the instruments alike, and
record the observations accurately.
All observations must be recorded exactly as read. The
corrections are to be made only at the end of each month on
the " means" of the "sums."
Barometrical observations must be recorded to the third
decimal place; thermometrical, to the first decimal. When
the readings are exactly to the inch or degree, the places
for the decimals must be filled up with ciphers.
The observations should be made as quickly as possible,
consistently with perfect accuracy, and the observer must
avoid breathing on the instruments, particularly the dry and
wet bulbs, and maximum thermometers.
Barometer Readings.—Note the temperature of attached
thermometer in degrees only; by means of the thumb-screw
at the bottom adjust the mercury in the cistern to its proper
level, the point of the ivory cone, which should just touch the
mercury without breaking the surface ; then bring the zero
line of the vernier to the level of the apex of the column of
mercury, and read off in the manner described at page 15 and
16 of Sir H. James's " Book of Instructions."
Thermometer Readings. The scales are divided to degrees
only, but these are so open that the readings can be determined
to the tenth of a degree. Practice and attention will ensure
accuracy.
Maximum Thermometer in Shade. The maximum thermo-
meter must be hung at such a distance (2 or 3 inches) from
the water vessel of the wet bulb thermometer, that its readings
may not be affected by evaporation.
In hanging the maximum, care must be taken that the end


## p. 4 (#28) ###############################################

INTRODUCTION.
of the tube is slightly inclined downwards, which will have
the effect of assisting in preventing the return of any portion
of the column of mercury in the bulb on a decrease of tempe-
rature. To read the instrument, gently elevate the end furthest
from the bulb to an angle of about 45°, in which position of
the instrument note the readings. To read the thermometer,
a gentle shake or swing, or a tap on the wooden frame of the
instrument, will cause the excess of mercury to return to the
bulb, and it is again ready for use.
Maximum in Sun's Rays, or the Vacuum Solar Radiation
Thermometer.—Being constructed on the same principle as the
last mentioned instrument, it must be read in a similar position.
After completing the reading, by giving the instrument a slight
shake, with the bulb still inclined downwards, the excess of
mercury will return to the bulb, and the thermometer be ready
for the next observation.
Minimum Thermometer in Shade.—The minimum thermo-
meter must be so hung that the bulb may be almost an inch
lower than the other extremity of the instrument, because in
its position the index is less likely to be affected by a rise in
the temperature. The extremity of the index furthest from
the bulb shows the lowest degree to which the spirit has fallen
since last observation. The reading on the scale corresponding

the bulb, the index will float towards the end of the spirit.

The temperature of the air is given by the former, that of
evaporation by the latter; from these data the hygrometrical
results are to be calculated by Glaisher's Tables, third edition.
Rain Gauge and Measure.—Pour the contents of the gauge
into any convenient vessel with a lip, and from this into the
glass measure, which has been graduated especially for the
gauge, and is only to be used in measuring its contents. It is
graduated to the hundredth of an inch.
Anemometer.—The dials are read from left to right. The
first on the left records hundreds of miles, the second tens,
the third miles, the fourth tenths of a mile, and the fifth
hundredths of a mile.
The reading of the anemometer is obtained by deducting
from the amount registered by the dials the total sum registered
at the period of the preceding observation. The difference
between these (subject to a small correction) indicates the
velocity or horizontal movement of the first set up; the reading
on the dials must be noted, in order that it may be deducted
from the total registered by the dials at the end of the first
period of observation.
In making observations on the presence of ozone a box has
been found to be unnecessary,-equally satisfactory results
having been obtained by fixing the paper immediately under
the pent-house of the stand, which shelters it sufficiently from
a strong light, while it secures proper exposure.
The minimum thermometers are liable to get out of order-
first, by carriage, when the index may be wholly or partly
driven out of the spirit, or a portion of spirit may become
detached from the main column; and secondly, by slow evapo-
ration of the spirit, which, rising in the tube, condenses at the
upper end. The first mentioned errors are corrected by taking
the thermometer in hand, with its bulb downwards, and giving
it a swing up and down. The second is remedied by the
inclined position of the instrument, which allows the condensed
spirit to trickle back to the main column.

Observations Not being supplied with instruments for observation by the
author on the Government, and being subject to the various movements to
which an assistant surgeon serving in such an unlucky climate
is liable, the various observations which I privately registered
within six years are—thermometer, hydrometer, saturation of
the atmosphere, dew-point, amount of cloud, oxonometer and
the weather, barometer and pluviameter.
Thermometer THERMOMETER.—I made observations with the wet and dry
bulb thermometers as well as with the common thermometer;
the readings were taken at 7 A.M., 12 noon, and 4 P.M. The
maximum, medium, and minimum of each month are recorded.
Hygrometer. HYGROMETER shows the amount of watery vapour or humidity
in the atmosphere at the time of the observation; this I obtain
by the readings of the dry and wet bulb thermometers.
Saturation of SATURATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE.—In this observation I
have endeavoured to show the degree of atmospheric saturation
at the time of registering; the calculation is based on the
ascertained fact, that when a space charged with the maximum
of vapour is reduced in temperature a deposit of moisture in
the liquid form is the result, since " the tension of vapour in
every liquid remains constant for each degree of temperature,
and diminishes according to the terms of a geometric progres-
sion; as the temperature falls in arithmetic progression, the
elasticity of vapour falls with a fall of temperature more rapidly
in proportion than the temperature declines."
Method of The quantity of moisture contained in the air at any given
saturation of time might be ascertained by first determining the temperature
at which dew begins to fall, and then finding the tension or
elastic force of aqueous vapour at the same period. To carry
this into effect, we call the quantity of invisible vapour which it
is possible for the air to retain at the temperature of observa-
tion 1000, and then make our calculation from the observed
finding

dew-point, the proportion which the amount actually present
bears to that which exists at that temperature.
Thus, on the 1st of May 1860, at Quitah, on the Slave Coast,
the temperature of the air at 7 A.M. was 78° F.; the tempera-
ture at which dew began to form was ascertained to be 72º.
Referring to Mr Dalton's Tables, we find that the tension or
elastic force of aqueous vapour in an inch of mercury at 78° is
0.940, while at 72° it is only equal to 0-721. It is a known fact
that the quantity of aqueous vapour is directly proportioned to
its tension or elastic force, consequently-
0.940 : 0.721 : : 1000 : 767.0.
definition.
The resultant 767.0 represents the degree of saturation at 7
o'clock in the morning of that day.
DEW-POINT.-By the term dew-point is meant that state or Dew-point
temperature of the atmosphere at which its aqueous vapour ce
becomes condensed and deposited in minute drops on any sur-
face. This temperature must, of course, have been cooled down
below the point of maximum density of watery vapour. After
sunset, and the temperature of the upper strata of air is much
cooled down, the earth gives out its superfluous temperature
into the surrounding space by radiation, and consequently cools
down the air immediately in contact with it below the point of
saturation ; a portion of the aqueous vapour suspended in it is
then deposited in the form of dew. A simple example of the
result of this radiation might be adduced, by bringing a tube
containing cold water into a warm room; the outside of the
glass at once becomes bedewed with moisture.
To determine the dew-point, several instruments have been lustrument.
recommended, such, for instance, as Daniell's dew-point hygro-
meter and the wet bulb hygrometer, but I employed for my obser-
vation Mason's hygrometer-an instrument consisting of two
delicate thermometers, of nearly equal size, the bulb of one of
which is covered with thin muslin, kept always moist by the.
capillary attraction of a few cotton threads deprived of fat, from
a fountain of water attached to it.

INTRODUCTION.
To find out the dew-point, or the temperature at which dew
falls, it will be necessary to multiply the difference between the
temperature of the dry and wet bulb thermometers by a factor
corresponding to the temperature of the atmosphere, as shown
by the dry bulb thermometer, from which subtract the product,
which is the depression of the dew-point. The resultant or
remainder represents the temperature of the dew-point. Mr
Glaisher and Dr Apjohn have calculated these factors for
deducing the dew-point from the atmospheric temperature and
evaporation, which are to be found in the Greenwich Mag-
netical and Meteorological Observations for 1844. In this
treatise I have used Mr Glaisher's figures.
E.g.-On the 19th May 1860 the dry bulb of the hygrometer
was registered by me at 85°, and the wet bulb at 76°, the dif-
ference being 9°; the factor, on referring to Mr Glaisher's Table,
is 1°:7, which gives the depression of dew-point when multiplied
by the difference 9°, viz., 15°-3. Subtracting this from the tem-
perature, as indicated by the dry bulb, 85°, gives 790.7, which is
the temperature at which dew falls, or dew-point.
Radiation from the earth's surface takes place more quickly,
as well as cooling of the atmosphere, when the nights are calm
and starry, and consequently the deposits are always more
abundant during those times.
AMOUNT OF CLOUD.-In estimation of the amount, I express
a cloudless sky by a dash, and then reckon from 1 to 10—this
last number indicating a perfectly cloudy sky; the intermediate
numbers showing variation in degrees. Look midway between
the visible horizon and the zenith, and then slowly turn round,
and the relative amount of cloud can be easily judged from
the distance between the clear and cloudy sky.
Varieties of. There are endless modifications in the forms of clouds, and
for those of my readers to whom the subject might be interest-

now universally adopted. These variations are seen in perfec-

tion in every part of intertropical Western Africa, especially
just before and after the rainy seasons.
Howard gives three simple and distinct forms and four inter-
mediate or compound forms or modifications.
PRINCIPAL FORMS.
1. Cirrus consists of filaments, either parallel, flexuous, or
diverging, which, by association, form a slender network or
woolly hair expansion. They possess the least density, and
are very high in the atmosphere, higher than all the other
clouds, being more than ten miles. It is regarded as prognostic
of wind, and is vulgarly called "mares' tails."
2. Cumulus.—Hemispherical or conical heaps, increasing
from an horizontal base resembling a mountain ; its structure
is exceedingly dense, and may be considered as the "cloud of
day," and moves with the current next the earth. Some have
compared the cumuli with bales of cotton.
3. Stratus.--A widely-extended, continuous, horizontal sheet,
increasing from below upwards, forming often at sunset, and
is the lowest of the clouds, having its inferior edge resting on
the earth or water. It has a mean degree of density, persistent
during night, and disappearing at sunrise.
INTERMEDIATE AND COMPOUND MODIFICATIONS.
1. Cirro-cumulus. — Small, roundish, well-defined masses,
in close horizontal arrangement or contact, most frequent
during the warm and dry weather. The sky in this condition
is said to be fleecy.
2. Cirro-stratus.—Horizontal or slightly inclined strata or
masses, attenuated towards a part or the whole of their circum-
ference, more compact than the cirri, bent downwards or undu-
lated, apparently composed of a number of thin clouds at the
zenith, at the horizon, or a long narrow band. This cloud is
almost always followed by a lowering of temperature by wind
and rain. This modification exhibits frequently the phenomena

known as the solar and lunar halo, of parhelia, mock-suns,
paraselence, and mock-moons.
3. Cumulo-stratus. — The cirro-stratus blended with the
cumulus, and either appearing intermixed with the heaps of
the latter or superadding a wide-spread structure to its base.
The distinct cumulo-stratus indicates the approach of thunder-
storms; the indistinct is principally observed in the intervals
of showers, rain, snow, or hail.
4. Cumulo-cirro-stratus vel Nimbus.—The rain-cloud. It is
a horizontal sheet above which the cirrus spreads, while the
cumulus enters it laterally and from beneath. It forms a
system of clouds from which rain is falling.
Clouds are masses of visible vapour, or visible collections of
minute globules of water in suspension in the atmosphere,
placed at considerable distance above the earth's surface; the
ordinary height is sometimes less than a mile, and, according
to Professor Leslie, they can never rise beyond two miles
above the line of perpetual congelation. Their formation is
the result of admixture in the higher regions of the atmo-
spheric strata of air of different degrees of saturation and
temperature.
Ozonometer. OZONOMETER. — The observations were made from papers
covered with a composition of iodide of potassium and starch,
and exposed to the air.
Mode of pre- This ozone paper is easily made by saturating strips of bibu-
lous paper in a mixture made" by boiling one drachm of white
starch in an ounce of distilled water for three minutes, in which
are to be dissolved, when cold, twelve grains of chemically pure
iodide of potassium."
When the paper is exposed to the atmosphere it is turned
brown, and when immersed in water, yellow the degree of
intensity of discoloration indicates the amount of ozone. The
principle of action is that the ozone oxidises the iodide of
potassium, and so disengages the iodine free, which attacks and
combines with the starch, forming a coloured compound-

its estima-
one being the smallest quantity, and 10 the highest degree of
intensity.
There are both physical and chemical objections in the objections in
estimation of ozone, from the following circumstances :*- tion
1. Other substances, such as nitric acid formed during elec-
tric storms, act on iodide of potassium as ozone; air containing
·00005 of its volume of this acid-coloured starch and iodide
paper.
2. The reaction is effected by light, wind, humidity, and
temperature, by expelling the free iodine.
3. Two chemical objections have been made : "Supposing
that iodine is set free by ozone, a portion of it is at once
changed by additional ozone into iodozone." This substance
in ordinary temperature is very volatile, and, in contact with
water, is changed into free iodine and iodic acid.
Some portion of the iodine, originally set free, being either
volatilised or oxidised, never acts on the starch. Another
error might be occasioned by the ozone itself acting on the
starch.
The observations were made alone in countries along the sea
coast, where it is supposed to be always abundantly produced ;
as it is found in large quantities on mountains and elevated.
localities; over lands covered with luxurious vegetation; over
water, and on the sea coast.

ture-humidity, winds, pressure, &c.; but in the following
observations I have confined it to the number of wet and dry
days.

INTRODUCTION.
Rules for
Rules for
observation
We subjoin the following from Dr Pickford's Hygiene, as
the rules laid down by Dr Halley, John Patrick, M. Cotte, and
others, for our guidance in the use of the barometer as a
weather-glass. We are, at the same time, to remember that the
changes in the weather indicated by the barometer may occur in
the upper part only, not extending to or being observable at the
earth's surface; that sometimes variations produced by changes
in the atmosphere of an adjoining district, and not from changes
of wind or weather in the district of observation in the weight
of the atmosphere over any given district, may arise :-
1. Indications of approaching changes of weather, and espe-
cially of the direction and force of winds, depend less on the
absolute height of the mercury in the tube than on its falling
and rising.
2. A height of 30 inches at the level of the sea is more in-
dicative of settled weather and steady winds than any other
height.
3. The barometer is said to be falling when the mercury in
the. tube is sinking, at which time its upper surface is almost
always concave or hollow; the barometer is said to be rising
when the mercurial column is lengthening, and its upper sur-
face is convex or rounded.
4. The rising of the mercury presages, in general, fair, and
its falling, foul weather, as rain, snow, high winds, and storms.
5. Below 30 inches the probability of rain is in an increased
proportion with equal decrements of the mercurial column;
above 30 inches the probabilities of fine weather are in a
diminishing proportion with equal increments.
6. In calm weather, when the air is inclined to rain, the
mercury is commonly low.
7. It sinks lowest in very great winds, though these be un-
attended with rain.
8. In very hot weather the falling of the mercury forebodes
thunder.
9. In winter the rising presages frost; and in frosty weather,
if the mercury, which is generally high, fall three or four tenths

of an inch, a thaw will certainly follow; but in a continued
frost, if the mercury rise, it will certainly snow.
10. A rapid rise of the barometer indicates the approach of
unsettled weather; a slow rise, the reverse.
11. A considerable and rapid fall is a sign of stormy weather,
though of short duration, and is usually accompanied with
rain.
12. A sudden rise in the barometer during a storm indicates
that the worst is over.
13. The greatest depressions of the barometer are accom-
panied by rain and gales from the south and south-west ; the
greatest elevations by the north-west, north, and north-east
winds.
14. Although the barometer almost always falls with the
southerly and rises with a northerly wind, the reverse some-
times occurs, in which case the southerly wind will be dry, and
the weather fine, whilst the northerly wind will be wet and
violent.
15. When the barometer sinks considerably, high winds,
rain, or snow will follow; the wind will be from the north-
ward if the thermometer is low for the season, from the south-
ward if the thermometer is high.
16. If, when the wind is from any point between north-west
and north-east, the barometer fall and the thermometer rise,
the wind will shift to the south.
17. If, when the wind is from any point between east and
south-west, the barometer fall, an increasing gale from that
quarter will ensue, which will be of shorter or longer duration
according as the fall is rapid or slow.
18. Sudden falls of the barometer, with the wind from west,
are frequently followed by violent storms from north-west or
north, during which the mercury will rise to its former height.
19. If a gale set in from the east or south-east, and the wind
veer by the south, the barometer will continue falling until the
wind becomes south-west, when a comparative lull may occur,
after which the gale will be renewed, and the veering of the

INTRODUCTION.
wind towards the north-west will be indicated by a rise of the
barometer and a fall of the thermometer. These gales, which
are accompanied by unusually high tides and the heaviest
seas, are supposed to have a rotatory movement. When a lull
in the course of the storm occurs, it is a sign that the centre of
the revolving gale is passing over or near the place of obser-
vation.
20. If, after a storm of wind, the mercury remains stationary,
fine weather, with the winds, from the same quarter, will con-
tinue until the barometer begins to rise or fall, when a change
may be looked for.
PLUVIAMETER.—This instrument, commonly known as the
rain-gauge, determines the amount of rain. The only observa-
tions on this point were made at Sierra Leone and the Gambia.
The rain-gauge consisted of a round tin box with a groove at
the top. The top is round, having a funnel inside, and fits on to
this groove, which, when filled with water, forms a water valve.
The opening above is circular, and descends, funnel-shaped, the
small ends turning up to prevent evaporation. The lower part
of the box is sunk in the ground, or in a receptacle in a pillar
nearly to the groove. The upper part is put in, and a glass
vessel placed below the funnel to receive the water; the glass
is removed at 6 A.M. and at 6 P.M., the water taken out and
measured in a glass vessel graduated to an inch and hundredths
of an inch. One inch fall of rain signifies that on every square
inch of surface a height of rain has fallen equal to one inch.
.I shall, in the first place, consider the various conditions of
physical climate, which takes into account its heat and cold,
degree of salubrity, its humidity and draught; then the seasons
of Western Africa; and afterwards, the influence of the climate
on diseases,—or medical climate.
It must be confessed that philosphers have contended a
great deal as to the real extent to which climate is to be viewed ;
some regard it as "any space distant from the equator and
poles ; another, as nothing more than a well-arranged table of
the wind, of the thermometric, barometric, and hygrometric

degrees; a third, as having reference solely to elevation above
the level of the earth's surface; a fourth, as consisting only of
the internal heat of the globe ; while a fifth, supposed to be
better informed than the rest, an authority who seemed to
have been in nature's cabinet council,' pronounces climate to
be influenced only by latitude and local elevation, and allows
it to be but slightly affected by any other causes."
Malte Brun has given the following divisions, which I intend
here to adopt as the causes of physical climate :
1. The action of the sun upon the atmosphere.
2. The interior temperature of the globe.
3. Elevation of the earth above the level of the ocean.
4. The general inclination of the surface and its local expo-
sure.
5. The position of its mountains relative to the cardinal
points.
6. The neighbourhood of great seas and their relative situa-
tions.
7. Geological nature of the soil.
8. Degree of cultivation and of population at which a country
has arrived.
9. The prevalent winds.
To these Sir Ranald Marten has added-

climate into four seasons, viz., the RAINY, HARVEST, HARMATTAN,
and SUMMER. The rainy season commences in May and termi-
nates in September. On the Gold Coast and Bights we meet
with two successions of rains, respectively known as the former
and latter rains. The first terminates about the beginning of
July, and the second commences in August, and continues
sometimes to the middle of October. In Sierra Leone and the
Gambia and Senegal, the rain commencing in the latter part of

May continues to the middle of September; it commences
later and terminates earlier.
RAINY SEASON.—Near the equator, from the Gaboon to
Cape Lopez, the seasons are divided into two, viz., the dry and
the rainy season; the latter occupies the longest portion of
the year.
The rainy season commences about the middle or end of
September, and terminates in the beginning or end of May;
thus occupying the whole of what is the dry season in the
Senegambia region.
About the middle or end of December the rains cease for
a short time, varying from a month to six weeks, and then
recommence in the latter end of January or beginning of
February. This period is called " the little dry season," and
is the period when the sun is nearest the southern tropics.
As the sun again approaches the line, the rains recommence,
and are at their height when the sun is on the line. Here,
that is in the regions between the Gaboon and Cape Lopez, the
hottest period of the year is in the rainy season, the hot months
being December, January, February, and March.
Before the little dry season the rains are heavy, but they are
still more so after it, and severe tornadoes and thunder storms
blow and roar during February, March, and April.
DRY SEASON.—The dry season commences in May or
beginning of June and terminates in September. The weather
is now very cold ; the thermometer in the morning is some-
times registered at 64° Fahr. At its commencement, the mom-
ing and nights are cold, and the wind veers from south-west to
south. The sky is overcast ; " the wind," writes Dr Chaillu,
"on the coast, which had blown from the land in the morning
and from the sea by night, now almost turns into one steady
sea breeze, which blows strongly, especially in the afternoon
and evening." This season is not interrupted by any short
rainy season. During this season there is very little dew.

November; it is earlier on the Gold Coast and Bights than

any other part. The harmattan, a part of November, Decem-
ber, and January, and a part of February. Summer, a part of
February, March, April, and a part of May.
In a medical point of view, we might divide the West
African tropical year into three divisions-
1. The diarrheal or dysenteric division.
2. The febrigenous or malarious division.
3. The congestive or pulmonic division.
The first comprises the months of February, March, April, a
part of May, October, and part of November.
The second, the months of May, June, latter part of August
and September.
The third, the latter part of November, December, January,
viz., the harmattan months, a part of June, July, and a part of
August.
In these divisions of the year I have attempted to particu-
larise the disease most prevalent in each. During heavy rains,
and in the harmattan, fever is seldom heard of, and when it
does occur its attack is generally mild, unless accelerated by a
previous bad habit or undue exposure to malarious districts.
The harmattan cold dry wind places a veto to the manifesta-
tion of malarious fever on the system ; it patches up all the
malarious beds, but dries up large lakes or ponds sufficiently to
allow them to generate malaria or to form muddy swamp. Fever
of a congestive nature might occasionally be produced by its
driving the blood from the surface to the interior organs.
During the rains the different malarious beds are so much
inundated that they are incapable of generating malaria except
when there is little rain, or in those countries where the fall
of rain is scanty, as on the Gold Coast and a part of the Bight
of Biafra, where remittent fever of a most dangerous type
sometimes occurs. In this section congestive diseases are of
frequent occurrence; the natives suffer principally from affec-
tion of the lungs.
In the febrigenous section there are seldom cases of pul-

monary affection except those of long standing; there are
sometimes sporadic cases of diarrhea and dysentery, but fever
is the most prevalent disease.
In the diarrheal or dysenteric section the constant heat of
the sun, and the effect of putrescent vegetable matter mingling
with the drinking water, as well as water impregnated with
animal life and fæcal matter, lead to the most fatal forms
of diarrhea and dysentery. At Sierra Leone dysentery is an
occasional disease and seldom proves fatal; but sometimes comes
on epidemically, when it is very fatal ; whilst on the Gold
Coast, the Bights of Benin and Biafra, and the Gambia, dysen-
tery and diarrhoea are frequent in occurrence and dangerous in
type.
I must here, however, premise that in considering the climate
and meteorology of a coast-line of more than 3000 miles, many
variations in the season and meteoric phenomena will be
observed as we proceed from one place to the other, but I shall
endeavour to make that due correction and allowance which
will be found necessary in treating the various phenomena.

The changes in the temperature of Western Africa must be Changes,
regarded in two broad lights, viz., periodical. and non-perio-

the amplitudes of the daily or yearly fluctuations. The non-

In Western Africa the temperature of the air is at its lowest Daily

gradually begins to fall until 4 A.M.; and since the heat of
climate does not depend only on the immediate effects of the
rays of the sun, but on their continuous operation, this forms
the daily periodic changes in the temperature of the air.
These changes are less in the sea coast towns than in the
interior, and greater in elevated positions than on the sea level.
Thus they are greater in Leicester Mountain at Sierra Leone
than in Freetown; greater in the Cameroon Mountains than
at Lagos; and in the Aquapim Mountains than at James'
Town, Accra.
The coldest month in Western Africa, as a whole, is in Yearly
January; this is particularly to be noticed in places where the changes.

and Benin, the harmattan seldom lasts more than a few days,
and consequently we cannot regard January as the coldest
month : from actual observation, I might safely say that Sep-
tember is the coldest month in those regions.
In Senegal and the Gambia the hottest month is April,
the hottest days being from the 23d of April to the 2d May.
In Sierra Leone and Liberia the hottest days are between the
20th February and the 1st March, and on the Gold Coast and
Bights in the middle of February. The coldest day in Sene-
gal, the Gambia, and Sierra Leone, is between the 1st and 6th
of January. On the Gold Coast and Bights the coldest day is
in the beginning of September.
Of the British possessions, Gambia, in its geographical posi-
tion, is situated in 13° 40' north of the equator, Sierra Leone
or Freetown in 8° 29' N., Cape Coast in 5° 6' N., Lagos in
6° 24' N., Cape Lopez 36' 10" S., the utmost southern limit
of Western Africa. It is a known rule, that the nearer a place
is situated to the equator the hotter it must be, although cer-
tain local non-periodic causes can modify it. At all these
places of the British possessions which I have named, the rays
of the sun at noon fall vertically or perpendicularly for two
months of the year, or at an angle which deviates from a right
angle by 31° at the utmost reckoning; the general rule being,
that all places situated at 231° on either side of the equator
receive the sun's rays vertically at one period of the year.
The climate of the Gambia, Senegal, and the Casamanza,
when compared with other parts of the coast, must be regarded
as extreme and excessive, the amplitude of the yearly fluctua-
tions and undulations being greater than at any other part. In
1865 the thermometer fell in the beginning of January on
land to 64° F., on the 22nd December it was 63°, while in
April of the same year it went up to 111°—an observation
which no other part of the coast will present. The climate of
these other parts may be regarded as limited, being in a great
measure equable, presenting only limited yearly variations.

1. On the inclination of solar rays to the surface of the
earth.
2. On the distribution of land and water.
3. The condition of the country whence proceed the pre-
vailing winds.
4. The neighbourhood of sea, rivers, and lakes.
5. The elevation of the land.
M. Cotte has laid down the following axioms for our guid-
ance in the consideration of temperature :-
1. The extreme degrees of heat are almost everywhere the
same; this, however, is not the case in regard to the extreme
degrees of cold.
2. The thermometer rises to its extreme height oftener in
the temperate zones than in the torrid zone.
3. It changes very little between the tropics ; its variations,
like those of the barometer, are greater the more one proceeds
from the equator towards the poles.
4. It rises higher in the plains than on the mountains.
5. It does not fall so much in the neighbourhood of the sea
as in inland parts.
6. The wind has no influence on its motions.
7. Moisture has a peculiar influence on it, if followed by the
wind which disperses it.
8. The greatest heat and greatest cold take place about six
weeks after the northern or southern solstice.
9. The thermometer changes more in summer than in
winter.
10. The coldest period of the day is before sunrise.
11. The greatest heat in the sun and in the shade seldomi
takes place on the same day.
12. The heat decreases with far more rapidity from Septem-
ber to October, than from July to September (i.e. in temperate
climates)..
13. It is not true that a very cold winter is the prognostic
of a very hot summer (nor a very cold harmattan, or exces-
sive rain-fall, the prognosis of a hot summer, Author).

Effect of heat
in shade
Effect of heat The effect of great heat in shade, is in the first place to pro-
duce a most depressing effect on the nervous system, interfer-
ing with the action of the stomach ; and from the rarefaction
of the air with respiration. There is greater waste of tissue
from the direct effect of heat, and the urine is always loaded
with lithates.
Dr Parkes has given the following as the effect of high
atmospheric temperature in shade on Europeans, residing or
passing into the tropics :-
1. The temperature of the body does not rise greatly-not
more than 5 or 1° F. (John Davy); from 1° to 21° and 3°
(Eydaux and Brown Sequard). The temperature of the body
is the result of the opposing action of two factors—1st, of
development of heat from the chemical changes of the food,
and by the conversion of mechanical force into heat, or by direct
absorption from without; and, 2nd, and opposed to this, of
evaporation from the surface of the body, which regulates in-
ternal heat. So beautifully is this balance preserved, that the
stability of the animal temperature in all countries has always
been a subject of marvel. If anything, however, prevents this
evaporation, radiation and the cooling effect of moving wind
cannot cool the body sufficiently in the tropics. Then, no
doubt, the temperature of the body rises, and the extreme dis-
comfort always attending abnormal heat of body commences.
In experiments in ovens, Blagden and Fordyce bore a tempera-
ture of 260°, with a small rise of temperature (23° F.), but
the air was dry, and the heat of the bodies was reduced by
perspiration. When the air in ovens is very moist and evapora-
tion is hindered, the temperature of the body rises rapidly.*
2. The respirations are lessened in number (Ludwig) in
animals subject to heat, and the same is believed to hold good
in the tropics. If so, less carbonic acid, and, presumably, less
water, are eliminated. (When the weather is extremely hot,

and hot winds are blowing, the author has observed the respira-
tion to be often stifled, and considerably below the standard ;
the author has known it to be as low as 15 in a minute).
3. The heart's action is somewhat increased in frequency,
perhaps not in force, in new comers, in tropical climates.
4. The digestive powers are somewhat lessened; there is less
appetite, less desire for animal food, and more wish for cool
fruit (and cooling drinks in abundance, Author). The quan-
tity of bile secreted by the liver is not increased, if the stools
are to be taken as a guide (Marshall in 1819, John Davy,
Morehead, Parkes), though Lawson believed that an excess of
colouring matter passes out with the stools ; nothing is known
of the condition of the usual liver work.
5. The skin acts much more than usual, and great local
hyperæmia and swelling of the papillæ occur in new comers,
giving rise to the familiar eruption known as "prickly heat."
In process of time, if exposed to great heat, the skin suffers
apparently in its structure, becoming of a slight yellow colour,
from, probably, pigmentary deposits in the deep layers of the
cuticle.
6. The urine is lessened in quantity (and this is caused by
the excessive activity of the sudorific glands, Author). The
urea is lessened, as shown by experiments in hot seasons at
home, and during voyages (Dr Forbes Watson and Dr Becher.)*
It is not yet certain whether this is simply from lessened food.
The pigment has been supposed to be increased (Lawson, the
Author), but this is doubtful. The chloride of sodium is
lessened, the amount of uric and phosphoric acid is uncertain
(the uric acid is increased, Author).
7. The effect on the nervous system is generally considered
as depressing and exhausting, i.e., there is less vigour of mind
and body. But it is undoubted that the greatest exertions,
both of mind and body, have been made by Europeans in hot
climates. Robert Johnson thought as much work could be

got out of men in hot as in temperate climates. It is probable
that the depressing effects of heat are most felt when it is com-
bined with great humidity of the atmosphere, so that evapora-
tion from the skin, and consequent lessening of bodily heat, is
partly or totally arrested.
To which may be added
8. Excessive secretion of the sudorific glands, with an in-
crease of the solids of the sweat, especially the chlorides.
I must now give the therrnometrical observations which
have been made; and to those who have not been acquainted
with the different scales used in science, I may here state that
there are four in daily use, but for my observations I have
employed that used in England :-
Fahrenheit's Scale, the freezing point of which is registered
at 32°, and the boiling point at 212°.
Centigrade Scale is that used in France, and amongst most
of the Continental nations ; the freezing point is placed at zero
(0°), and the boiling point at 100°. This is the most con-
venient scale.
Reaumur's Scale is that used in Russia ; the freezing point
is at zero, and the boiling point at 80°.
De Lisle's Scale is very little used; the boiling point is
placed at zero, whilst the freezing point at 150°.
To find the corresponding point of each of the four scales,
finding.cor- we have to consider 1 degree of Fahrenheit to be equal to
8ths of a degree of Centigrade, to $ths of a degree of Reaumur,
and to ths of a degree of De Lisle, and by arithmetic calcula-
tion the quotient will be very easily found.
The maximum, medium, and minimum of the three daily
registers are noticed, and I may here remark that the medium
gives the continuous medium observation during the whole
month, and not the difference between the maximum and
minimum.

CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY OF WESTERN AFRICA.
CHAPTER III.
1. THE EFFECTS OF TROPICAL HEAT ON THE GREAT NERVOUS
CENTRES, AND ON THE VITAL PROCESSES OF THE INHABITANTS
OF TROPICAL CLIMATES.—2. THE INTERIOR TEMPERATURE OF
THE GLOBE.
The effects of great tropical heat on the intellectual faculties
of man is indeed very marked, especially when continuous ; it
seems, in the first place, to interfere with the regular nutrition
of the cerebrum, producing a modification in the associative
connections of ideational consciousness, and consequently
interferes in some degree with the transmission of external
expression made on that organ to the sensorium—the centre of
consciousness.
One great example may be adduced from the want of success
with which, in tropical climates, individuals in many cases
attempt to exert the will to the recall of events which had
previously been before their consciousness, but which do not
at the time automatically or spontaneously present themselves
in it. We very often hear the complaint, that "The heat has
destroyed my memory. I cannot recollect anything." The
individual fixes his attention upon ideas which had already
been present in his consciousness, and places the full weight of
his mind to it so as to intensify these ideas, and thus suggest
and strengthen those associations which were connected with
the circumstances under consideration, and yet he hesitates
and bungles, and cannot give a positive and direct statement
as to the facts.

tervals.
The effect of this modified nutrition, occasioned by the con- Modified
stant exposure to heat, is to produce a species of absent state the brain-
of the mind, a weakness of the "bond of direct association,"
whereby the thoughts do not so quickly develope themselves
when we attempt to recall events which at some past period
had produced impressions of sensational consciousness, as when
the events appeal directly to our ideational consciousness.
But this state of absent consciousness is not permanent, Lucid in-
since there are lucid intervals when the mind appears to be in terval
perfect activity, and when the process of aggregating and
collocating ideas, of decomposing complex ideas into simple
ones, and of combining simple ideas into general expressions, is
performed to a great extent automatically; and thus many
philosophers believe that the same amount of mental and
bodily application which is shown in temperate climates can be
performed in the tropics—that the same vivid train of thought,
the same mental consciousness and reasoning faculties, can be
there exercised—in a word, they believe that there exists the
same central activity, which, when our attention is fixed upon a
certain class of ideas, suggests to our consciousness the same
train of thought, in continuous and rapid succession, independ-
ently of our will, or without any purposed direction of our
will to it, as is met with every day in temperate climates. This
condition, when duly considered and examined, it will be ad-
mitted, forms an a priori argument, which cannot possibly be
attained in tropical climates.
The foregoing statement exhibits, without a doubt, the reasons Effects of
why natives of tropical climates do not show the same active native of the
development of the intellectual faculties, especially of the "
reasoning processes, as natives of a temperate climate. Thus,
with the former, the combination of suggestive ideas so as to
produce important results in a material form, can only with
great difficulty be obtained; and since this alone is the great
source of improvement in knowledge, it is no wonder that the
natives of tropical climates are deficient in the fundamental
principle of education, whilst, on the other hand, those of

temperate climates have every facility offered them. The
young native inhabitants of the tropics do not undergo any
proper mental cultivation ; the fixation of their attention to
certain objects, exclusively of many others, is not made the
constant study of their parents, who do not instruct them
to call into their understanding the relation and connection
which exists between different ideas, nor how to isolate ideas
and recognise their common properties. They do not withdraw
their minds from those noxious influences which may occupy
their mental activity–from what is sensual and debasing-
and thus bring in appropriate ideas or fertile and productive
faculties which will direct and invigorate, cultivate, and
chasten their youthful consciousness.
Again, in tropical climates, the uninterrupted application of
the intellectual or reasoning faculties for a few hours on any
particular subject produces great mental fatigue; the automatic
or attractive power, after a very short time, becomes incapable,
or finds it difficult, to rivet the attention on the class of ideas
under consideration; and the thoughts, in consequence, either
wander from the subject or do not " develope themselves con-
secutively in the mind;" and very often the individual com-
plains of severe headache or vertigo. In temperate climates the
case is very different; the author, whilst at college in England,
requently occupied fourteen out of the twenty-four hours in
hard study without any evil result, but since his return to the
tropics he finds six hours to be his utmost limit of continuous ap-
plication without producing severe mental fatigue; and even this
period he finds to diminish the longer he remains in the tropics.
Results of In the northern portions of Western intertropical Africa,
perature on viz., Senegal and the Gambia, the temperature, as has been
demonstrated in the preceding chapter, is at certain seasons
extreme, being continuous for several days from 102° to 110°;
and the effects of this heat, per se, independently of any local
condition, have decidedly ulterior influences in the reproduc-
tion and development of the inhabitants occupying these
regions. The heat has of itself a great influence in increasing
Jollofs.

RESULTS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE.

he deposits of black pigmentary matter in the coloured cells of
the epidermis or true skin ; in consequence of which the Jollof
and Mandingo inhabitants of these regions, but especially the
former, are of a jet or lamp-black colour; whilst the Sarra
Wollies and Footah Foolahs, who years ago migrated into
these countries, become darker every generation, and the
present inhabitants are two shades darker than the Moors of
the interior, from whose stock they are descendants. It is
common to characterise a very dark individual as " Jollof
black," since the Jollofs, as a nation, present a more perfect
black tint in their pigment cells than any other nation, I think,
on the globe, at least that I have ever met with, which seems to
prove most convincingly that to the temperature, exclusive of
any other condition, we have to trace the colour of the skin.
I must state the fact, that the offspring of inhabitants of other
parts of the coast, after residing for some time in this region,
become as jet black in successive generations as any Jollof,
although they themselves present no change, or very little, in
the complexion. The converse of this I have noticed to be
equally correct ; for Jollofs who remain for a long time in other
parts of Africa of a more equable and limited temperature, all
things being equal, have offspring of a lighter complexion.
Jollofs, in whatever favourable condition they may be as regards
food, habitation, attention to bodily cleanliness when resident
in their own country, retain that colour of their skin for which
they are remarkable, and transmit the same to their offspring.
The heat also interferes with the general nutrition and vital
operations of the body, either by disturbing the chylopoietic
assimilation, or by acting indirectly through the nerve centres ;
but one thing is certain, that the inhabitants are much more
attenuated than in any other parts, and although generally
tall, their muscles are ill developed, and they are incapable of
severe muscular exertion, however short; their virile powers are
quickly exhausted, and fecundity in the females is very limited.
The Mandingo, especially, leads a sort of migratory life.
Even amongst some of the lower animals, which are expected

to be very hardy in their habits, such as goats and pigs, virility
is very much interrupted. I observed, in many instances,
that a goat, which, as a general rule, brings forth two or three
kids, if impregnated during the hot weather and exposed to
the full effect of the heat for two or three months, gives only
one kid; evidently showing that the heat interferes with the
full results of fecundation.
Through the heat the eliminating organs of the body are
called upon to perform more work, while the formative organs
are retarded in their elaboration. The kidneys during
the hot weather are much more loaded with solid matter,
much lithates and uric acid, showing increased degeneration
and destruction of tissues; the sudorific glands increase in
activity, and the perspiration contains an increased proportion
of chlorides and other salts; whilst, on the other hand, we
find a decrease in performance of the functions of respiration,
digestion, and sanguinification. The operation of these causes
tends to diminish the "span of life;" and the average of three-
score years and ten is seldom attained by the inhabitants
occupying these regions.
Besides being short lived, the inhabitants in this hot region
grow early old; they appear in most cases about ten years older
than they really are. A Mandingo or Jollof sixty years of age
will have a long white beard, with grey hairs, and will give the
appearance of a man of seventy years or more, which is not
the case in other parts of the coast; and the natives themselves
attribute it to the effects of the heat.
High temperature produces a very marked effect on the
respiration of individuals residing in tropical climates in North
Western Africa, where the temperature ranges in some parts
of the year from 86° to 100°. The air is so rarefied in the
afternoon that there exists an evident deficiency of oxygen for
breathing purposes; an individual will be actually for hours
in great distress, and pant for breath ; his respiration becomes
quicker, but he feels that he cannot take at a time sufficient air
to relieve him ; he finds immediate relief if he allows the heated

air to pass through a damp atmosphere before it enters into his
lungs, and this he does by keeping his apartment continually
wet by sprays or jets of water. Besides the want of a suffi-
cient supply of oxygen in the air, individuals in these climates
suffer also from a diminished purification of the blood, through
a diminution in the exhalation of carbonic acid; the higher the
temperature the less quantity of carbonic acid is exhaled.
It has been shown that the climate of the Gambia, Senegal,
and the Casamanza, is the hottest in Western Africa; that the
temperature during the hottest month in the shade is sometimes
registered at 110°; also that the temperature of Sierra Leone,
Liberia, the Gold Coast, and the Bights, are comparatively
limited, and that the temperature during the hottest month
rarely exceeds 90°. It follows that the inhabitants of the
latter places exhale more carbonic acid than those of the
former, and it is computed to be a little more than two-thirds.
According to Vierordt,* a difference of 10° F., in man, pro-
duces a variation of rather more than two cubic inches of
carbonic acid hourly exhaled.
I have previously stated that the inhabitants of this hot
region are tall and attenuated; that their muscular system is
ill developed. This has another effect, in diminishing the
quantity of carbonic acid exhaled; for the more robust and
muscular an individual is, all things being equal, the more car-
bonic acid he exhales—the height, weight, and capacity of the
chest, &c., having very little to do with it. But these inhabi-
tants, especially the Mandingoes, make up for this decrease
by bodily exercise; they are a clever, athletic race, and are
continually on the move, and consequently are always thus in-
creasing the amount of carbonic acid exhaled; and when the
exercise is moderate, it has been calculated to increase to one-
third of the quantity exhaled during rest, which continues for
some time after the cessation of the exercise.
The importance of these observations will be noticed, when
we consider that the number of respirations per minute is from

tides.
15 to 26, or an average of 20; that at each respiration we take
in 1:62 cubic inch of oxygen, and consequently make 28,800
cube respirations per diem, and take in and consume 46,656
cubic inches, or 26 cubic feet, or nearly a cubic yard of oxygen
during that time. The great heat lessens this quantity to a
very prejudicial degree. At each respiration a healthy indi-
vidual takes in 20 cubic inches of air, and inspires 400 cubic
inches in a minute, or 24,000 in an hour; such expired air
contains about 4 per cent. of carbonic acid, and consequently
16 cubic inches per minute, or 960 per hour, and 23,040 in
the 24 hours, viz., 3.529 grains of carbon. A diminished excre-
tion of this substance vitiates the blood, and produces a very
injurious effect on the system.
Atmospheric Every meteorologist in tropical climates must observe that
there are tides in the atmosphere at different times in the
twenty-four hours, occasioned by the presence or absence of
the sun. According to Humboldt, the flow tide in the tropics
commences at 9 or 9.15 A.M., and at 10 or 10.45 P.M.; and the
ebb at 4 or 4.15 P.m., and at 4 A.M. This statement is pretty
correct in Western Africa, except that the late ebb commences
about 3 or 3.15 P.M.; the ebb is produced by the expansion of
the atmosphere during the hottest part of the day, and the flow
to the pressure of the mass of cold air.
Atmospheric The pressure of the atmosphere on a given body is directly
as its density, or as its solid parts, to its own reacting inter-
stices. In the mean human body the atmospheric pressure is
reckoned at about 15 tons, or a total pressure of 32,400 lbs.;
but during the hot weather, or at an elevated spot in the tropics,
when the atmosphere is much rarified, the amount is slightly
diminished; for every degree of heat the air expands about
13th part.
It is unfortunate that in Western Africa the local Govern-
ment has in a great measure overlooked the beneficial effects
that will be produced by taking advantage of the delightful pro-
perties of trees, in exhaling a certain quantity of aqueous vapour
for the purpose of cooling the atmosphere : a more general

planting of umbrageous trees in the highways of the towns
will operate to moderate the effects of atmospheric heat. An
effort in this direction has been made by the planting of a
large number of trees in the front street at Bathurst, in Govern-
ment Yard at Sierra Leone, in Salt Pond Road, and Jackson
Street at Cape Coast Castle; but there should be a more
general one, and under a well-directed plan.
It is now the belief of every scientific man, that the further Internal
we descend below the surface of the earth the greater is the tem-
perature; and at 45 or 60 feet the increase becomes very per-
ceptible; or in Europe, between the parallels of 48° and 52°, it
forms the stratum of invariable temperature. At the depth of
100 feet the internal heat is equal to 2°-25 F., or 1° of R. of
increase ; but in intertropical Africa the stratum of invariable
temperature is 1 foot below the surface, which cannot be due
to solar influence. Since, says Professor A. Taylor :-
"1. The existence of a zone of invariable temperature shows
that the power of the sun must be limited to that portion of
the earth's crust which is above it.
"2. If the interior heat of the mass of the earth were due to
external or solar influence alone, the thermometer should fall
just in proportion as we descend below the invariable stratum."
The reverse of this is, however, the fact; and hence, we must
believe that below this invariable stratum we are arriving at
· a source of heat situated in the centre of the globe. Professor
Alfred Taylor, after an elaborate investigation of this subject,
arrived at the following conclusions :-
1. That the temperature of the surface of our globe, in-
cluding that of the air, earth, and sea, depends exclusively
upon the quantity of heat transmitted to it from the sun, the
heat thus received being again lost, partly by radiation into
space, and partly by conduction downwards through the super-
ficial strata.
2. That the chief loss takes place undoubtedly by radia-
tion, and that it is by the amount of this last we learn the tem-
perature of the medium (space) in which our globe is floating.

3. That, at a certain depth below the surface of the earth,
there is a source of heat which progressively affects the ther-
mometer as we descend.
4. That the interior heat cannot be derived from the sun
or from local chemical changes.
• 5. That it does not directly affect climates or seasons, or suc-
cessfully influence the temperature of the surface of the earth,
the depth of the ocean, or the atmosphere floating above them.
6. That the necessitudes of climates, seasons, and cycles
of years are due entirely to solar influences.
7. That the influence, even at a maximum, does not pene-
trate to a greater depth than the apopooth part of the earth's
diameter.
8. That although we have positive evidence of the exist-
ence of subterranean heat, we can neither measure its degree,
nor, at present, determine its exact rates of increase downwards
into the interior.
9. That there is not the slightest evidence to show that
the earth is gradually cooling from a high temperature, or that,
within the last two thousand years, its temperature has under-
gone any increase or diminution.
In tropical climates the temperature of perennial springs is
some degrees below that of the atmosphere; this is more so in
North-Western Africa than the other parts, as the temperature
of the water does not increase in the same ratio as that of the
air. Below 120 feet of water, however, no variation takes
place.
The origin of hot springs may be accounted for from the
increase of heat as we descend beneath the surface of the earth,
and, since for every 15 yards there is an increase of one degree
in a temperate climate, at 3300 yards the heat will be sufficient
to boil water.
According to the estimation of Fourier, if below 180 miles
the interior of the globe was incandescent, it would be suffi-
cient to raise the surface about a 10th of a degree; and if it be
100 times hotter than red-hot iron, it would take 200,000

years to raise the surface only one degree. However, at 40 or
50 miles it would take only 2000 years to raise it one degree.
The heat of the celestial spaces has been the subject of calcu-
lation by him and Swemberg, who regarded it to be 50° Cen-
tigrade below zero or the freezing point.
From the equator to the poles the temperature of the sea
varies but little. On approaching land the thermometer in sea
water falls from 4 to 6 degrees.
Western Africa is subject to those subterranean disturbances Earthquakes
which are connected with internal heat. In 1855 the colony and Sierra
of Sierra Leone was one evening put to confusion by the shock
of an earthquake, which took a direction from east to west. In
1861, 1862, and 1863, Accra, on the Gold Coast, was subject
to repeated shocks of earthquakes. In August 1862 a series of
shocks were felt; the first was so severe that it destroyed the
whole of the stone buildings and fortifications at Christians-
borg Castle, Dutch Accra, and James Town; it was felt from
below the River Volta to 300 miles along the sea coast, and
far into the interior. I was present during this and several
other convulsive movements. The noise was very astounding,
stunned some of the weak nerved and even strong nerved
inhabitants, and deprived some of their senses; it was like
the noise of a powerful train passing under a tunnel, or the
subterranean peals of thunder of the loudest echoes. Cape
Coast suffered also in this subterranean agitation, but to a com-
paratively limited extent.
There are tangible evidences everywhere that the Gold Coast
was the scene of repeated earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
in ages long past. Volcanic scoriæ are scattered in the high-
ways and along the sides of the clumps of hills around which
Cape Coast is built. I have picked up several of these so-called
stones, which corroborated statements put forward by me
some years ago in a small pamphlet, entitled "Geological
Constitution of Ahanta, Gold Coast," wherein the volcanic
origin of those parts was taken into consideration. We shall
revert to this subject in another place.

Elevation.
THE elevation of a country or place above the level of the sea
is of very great importance in a sanitary point of view; the
generally acknowledged maxim—the higher we ascend the more
healthy we become-is nowhere to be regarded as of greater
practical utility than in the tropics. In Western Africa we find
that the poorer classes of inhabitants, who occupy mud-huts and
sleep on mats spread on the bare mud floor, present a greater
mortality than even those who occupy the same species of huts,
but sleep on sofas one or two feet above the ground. The
frame houses, raised about two feet above the ground by stone
pillars, allowing a current of air to circulate under the flooring,
are the most healthy of the houses of this description in the
tropics, and their inhabitants present less annual mortality
than those who inhabit mud-huts.
Gambia site. The site of the British colony on the banks of the River
Gambia is so low that it is scarcely two feet above the level of
the sea ; in some places it is below the sea-level; and Bathurst,
every year, is subject, at any very high seas, between July and
September, to be inundated, as was the case in 1847 and 1851.
Lately Col. D'Arcy, the governer, with his superintendent of
police, has worked hard to remedy this state of things;

and a barricade has been made to prevent these unpleasant
resnlts.
In the immediate neighbourhood of St Mary's, and at Combo,
there are extensive plains of offensive and pestilential swamps,
which, during the rains and the blowing of the N.W. and S.W.
monsoon, add greatly to the unhealthiness of the colony. For
the sum of L. 7000, says Major Clerk, R.N., this swamp, cover-
ing nearly 1000 acres of land, can be most effectually drained;
but the exchequer of the colony being in a very impoverished
state, there is no hope this recommendation will be carried
out. Bacchou, or Cape St Mary's, is situated on a small Bacchou, or
Cape St
rising ground facing the sea ; it is the most healthy spot around Mary's.
St Mary's, and has been used as an invalid station from
Bathurst.
M'Carthy's Island, another station situated about 250 miles M'Carthy's
in the interior, is about 51 miles in length and 1 in breadth.
During the rains it forms an extensive plain of muddy swamp,
with a pool of water dividing it almost in two, and emptying
itself into the river. It presents no high ground, and when
there happens to be a severe rainy season, the island is almost
flooded with water. There are large ditches and trenches
made at various parts of Georgetown to carry away aqueous
accumulations, but the number is too small for the requirements
of the place. Towards the end, and in the beginning of the
rains, these pools are converted into muddy swamps, exhaling
a most deadly vapour.
M'Carthy's Island is exposed to whatever influence of wind
it might be subject to, whether mephetic or hygienic, towards
the S.W., W., N.W., N., and N.E. At the east and south it is
imperfectly sheltered by a low range of hills in the mainland,
which is nearly 200 feet high. The general inclination is
from N.E. to N.W.
The barracks of M-Carthy's, hygienically, should have been
built on the range of hills on the mainland, which is known as
Fa-to-to hill, situated on the east of the island, on the Nyanney
ground. Their elevation is sufficient to moderate the heat,

which is so intense in the hot season among the swamps of
the lowland.
The general, as well as local inclination of the colony at
Bathurst, including Combo and Bacchou, is towards the
swampy banks of the river, and consequently N.E. to N.W.
There are no elevated spots around these stations, no moun-
tain or hills, but one flat plain, which is exceedingly swampy
during the rains. A few miles from Bathurst, along the river,
is the town of Albreda, formerly belonging to the French, but
exchanged for Potendie with the British Government. It is
built on the declivity of a small range of hills, and forms a
more eligible and important station for the principal seat of
government than St Mary's or even the Cape. If the summit
of the hill be occupied, it will not be very inferior to Cape St
Mary's for healthiness, and very far superior to Bathurst or
St Mary's; but in a commercial and political point of view it
will be superior to any other point on the River Gambia. At
present it is the seat of an extensive trade with the natives,
but is neither a military nor a colonial station.
Sierra Leone An extensive range of bold lofty mountains, running from
W.S.W. towards E., and then shaping itself to the south, forms
the peninsula of Sierra Leone. They are, I believe, of a volcanic
origin, although many have thought that they must have been
produced by a huge process of denudation. The highest of
Sugar-Loaf. these ranges is Regent Mountain or Sugar-Loaf, about 3000
feet above the level of the sea, and commanding a most extensive
view. Uninfluenced by any local peculiarities, it is subject
to all the climatorial changes in the weather, and, from its
height, receives the breeze in the very same state from whatever
position it may proceed. From Sugar-Loaf the mountain runs
towards E.S.E. until it becomes partially lost a little way be-
yond Hastings, or merges into the Waterloo range, the highest
peak of which is known as Mount Horton, which terminates
abruptly between Kent and York, facing the Atlantic.

and declivi-
or 500 feet above the level of the sea, ascends gradually through
Wilberforce to Leicester, where it abruptly forms itself into a
cone, from 1500 to 2000 feet above the level of the sea. From
hence the range occupies the front and rear of Gloucester, meet-
ing at a juncture between Kissy and Bathurst, and terminat-
ing gradually from Wellington to Allen Town.
The general declivity of Sierra Leone is therefore towards Local aspect
the east and south-east, but there are great differences in its ties,
local declivities. The whole of the towns and villages of
Sierra Leone are either partially or wholly built on elevated
spots, but the numerical difference in their healthiness depends,
I am of opinion, on their local aspect.
In a sanitary point of view, the spot now occupied by the Freetown.
city of Freetown is the most unhappy that could have been
selected for the capital and entrepôt of trade. It is covered
towards the south and south-east, south-west and west, by
high and lofty mountains ; its aspect or declivity is towards
the north and east, facing the mainland, and exposed but very
impartially to the north-west or the ocean. It is built in the
plain at the foot of the lesser chain of mountains already de-
scribed, where it makes an angle between Signal Hill and
Kissy Range, and is therefore screened from all breezes arising
from south-east to west. At the centre of the town is an
abrupt hill, about 400 feet high, possessing a table-land at its
summit, which is occupied as a military station. The town
around is low, except in front, where there is a gradual ascent
from the river to this elevation, which is called "Tower Hill."
It is a well-known fact, that by a proper exposure of the soil Effects of
to the action of the sun a most beneficial result is obtained. *
"A hill inclined 45° to the south, when the sun is elevated 45°,
receives solar rays perpendicularly, whilst upon a plain the
same rays strike the soil under an angle of 45°, that is, with
one quarter less of force; and a hill inclined 45° to the north
will be struck by the solar rays in a horizontal direction, which
makes them glide along its surface." Again, local aspect has
a most powerful effect in altering the effects of the prevailing

winds in a country; and these two results, viz., the action of the
sun on the soil, and the alteration of the effects of the prevail-
ing winds by local aspect or declivity, but principally the
latter, must be regarded as the grand keystone to an explana-
tion of the unhealthiness of the city of Freetown in Sierra
Leone (and not, as has been most wrongly stated in books, the
colony of Sierra Leone).
During the December solstice the sun is about 32° south of
Freetown, and its benign influence is consequently lost early
in the day, through the interruption of Leicester Mountain and
afterwards Sugar-Loaf; that is, towards evening evaporation
decreases and condensation begins to take place earlier, through
the loss of the direct rays of the sun. We know also that
malaria is generated and concentrated on the surface of the
earth, or just above it after sunset, when the heated and conse-
quently rarefied air becomes cooled down; any influence, there-
fore, which deprives a place of the full action of the sun does to a
certain extent predispose it to disease. Fortunately, however,
at the December solstice there are other climatic influences
which moderate the injurious effect that might have been pro-
June solstice. duced. In the June solstice the sun sets about 15° north of
Freetown, but its rise is interrupted by the position of the lesser
range of hills, and the town receives the sun's rays only in a
slanting direction. Tower Hill interrupts in some measure,
secondarily, the due action of the sun in every part of Free-'.
town; its position in the very centre of the town has a direct
influence, at whatever position in the compass the sun rises
or sets.
Towards the end of the October or north-east monsoon,
namely, at the beginning of April, the wind shifts from N. and
N.E. to S.W. and W., but occasionally blowing from E. and N.E.
At this time the rain gradually begins to fall; the dried up
dead vegetable matter receives moisture and begins to putrefy,
and consequently forms the source of unhealthy exhalations.
The wind from E. and N.E. blows from the Continent through
an extensive track of these unhealthy emanations, through

between Wellington and Hastings, bifurcates. A part takes the
direction in front of the lesser range, passes through Wellington,
Kissy, and then Freetown, where it is interrupted in its course
by the concavity below Leicester range, and has to mount
Wilberforce, or make a detour through the Cape before it gets
into the sea. This wind, impregnated with mephitic substances,
deposits a larger quantity at Freetown through the interruption
which it meets at the concavity, and does not at all relieve the
town of the miasmata that is generated from it. The next half
of the wind passes between the gulf made by the two ranges of
hills over Allen Town, then ascends to Charlotte, Bathurst,
Regent Town, and after passing Lumley, is lost in the sea, near
the Cape, meeting with the first half, and during its ascent loses
a greater portion of its miasmata. But the principal wind at
this season (April and May) is generally from S.W. and W.,
blowing from behind the mountain. I have before stated that
at this the commencement of the rains, which is at Sierra
Leone in the latter part of April and May, there are most un-
healthy emanations from the earth's surface, that the vapour is
like steam rising from the ground, and producing great depres-
sion; the most sanitary effect of a strong current of wind is to
displace this and drive it away from the place where it is
being generated. Freetown, by its local aspect and declivities,
entirely loses these beneficial results; the high mountains,
towering behind and nearly all around it, interrupt the wind
in its course, especially the S.W. When due W. it passes
over Wilberforce Hill, touches Tower Hill in its course, but
scampers over the town below it, and then sweeps through
Fowrah Bay. The miasmata, which seeks the lower level,
remains in its position, and forms the source of the most con-
centrated form of febrile affections. The only healthy breeze
that blows through the town of Freetown is the N.W. wind,
which proceeds direct from the Atlantic, and is uncontaminated
by any poisonous vapour.

Healthiness
of Sierra
Leone.
When all these circumstances are taken into consideration,
can there be a doubt in the mind of any one why Freetown
(and not Sierra Leone) is so unhealthy at certain periods of the
year? why the concentrated action of poisonous air, uninter-
rupted by any aerial disturbance, should be the cause of a
most deadly form of fever? These facts, I am of opinion, are
the real source of the unhealthiness, added to which is the
neglect of the local Government in effecting proper sanitary
works ; there are no proper effective drains, and year after
year the excessive mortality cries loudly to the legislature and
the executive council for reform.
But Sierra Leone is one of the most healthy spots on the
whole western coast of Africa. The high and lofty peaks
invite, but in vain, the inhabitants of the low, steam-vapoury
Freetown, and point out the spot which nature designed
them to inhabit. They call upon them to plant villas every-
where on their numerous platforms, and to retire there after
their business is over; but all their warnings are in vain. So
long as the merchants will not occupy the hills—so long as
they will continue to sigh for gold, unregardful of their health
-and so long as the local Government will still continue to
persist in disregarding that essential element for improving the
health of the town, viz., sanitary reform,* so long will the
European and native population show a heavy yearly mortality.
Sir Ranald Martint has given the following summary as to
* In the author's pamphlet on the " Political Economy and Requirements
of British Western Africa," whilst recommending the necessity for the for:
mation of a municipal council, the following occurs :-" The time is perfectly
ripe when Sierra Leone should have a town corporation, since the existence
of such a body in a country is a true sign of advance in political matters, and
we hope that no narrow-minded prejudice will prevent its immediate esta-
blishment. . . . . Sierra Leone, from its rate of mortality and the
necessity for a vigilant sanitary police, requires a town council and a medical
registrar. It will root out the pernicious causes of the diseases in the colony,
will relieve the police-court of a great many of its cases and officers, and con-
sequently will save the colony a fair sum of money. The benefit derived
from the summonses, fines, &c., after paying all expenses, should be used
entirely for renovating the town, clearing it of filth and dirt," &c.

the localities to be selected for forming military camps, canton- Localities to
ments, and stations in tropical climates, which, I think, well
deserves the consideration of civilians also :-
1. When military circumstances do not imperatively forbid
it, an elevated and dry soil should always be selected for
bivouacs, camps, or cantonments, on undulating ground or the
declivity of a hill, the most healthy sites being such as do not,
from the natural fall or from the quantity of the soil, retain
moisture.
2. Open downs so called are healthy.
3. Such grass lands as have a sufficient fall or inclination
are healthy.
4. The elevated banks of rivers that have a sufficient fall
either way.
5. Tongues of land, or slender promontories jutting well
into the sea.
6. It is said that wherever pure spring water is procurable,
there the ground is generally fit for encamping or cantoning
troops.
7. When marching, to halt, during wet weather, on ground
somewhat elevated and sloping, and sheltered from the wind.
8. In such cases to increase the number of fires, and to keep
them up to the starting time.
9. To make frequent halts, selecting places where the water
is good, and to take care that the men do not drink cold water
when heated by the march.
10. In marshy localities, to encamp on the highest ground
procurable.
He has also given the following rules, pointing out the Localities to
localities to be avoided :-
1. All damp ground to be carefully avoided, and even where
the surface may appear parched up and destitute of vegetation,
if it be moist underneath, as by previous rains, it may be found
charged with the worst exhalations.
2. Half-dried beds of rivers, of canals, tanks, or ditches,
and narrow gorges.
Localities to
be avoided.

3. Marshy grounds, and such as are elevated immediately
above marshes, and grounds which are exposed to winds and
currents passing over marshes. ·
. 4. Ground covered with underwood, or the vicinity of such
ground.
5. The low, jungly, or marshy banks of rivers and lakes.
6. The best ground, if long occupied by masses, becomes

ground of encampment frequently.
Horace Wilson had said, that "if British colonies be ever
formed in the East, with a chance of preserving the moral and
physical energies of the parent country, it is to the vales and
mountains of the Indian alps that we must look for their
existence." As with the East Indies, so with Africa ; and I say
that if the Europeans intend to preserve their lives in Western
Africa, if the Government is determined to cultivate the
healthy growth and vigour of the rising generation, they must
lay out and carry into effect extensive plans for properly occu-
pying the mountains of the African alps. In the mountains
are the towns of Leicester, Gloslu, Regent, Bathurst, and Char-
lotte. The local aspect of the three first, together with their
position on the summits and vales of the mountains, show that
they must be the most healthy places in Sierra Leone, and ex-
perience has proved it to be the case.
The river districts, viz., Kissy, Wellington, Hastings, and
Waterloo, present the same disadvantages as Freetown,
being low, exposed to the most unhealthy and injurious
breezes, and sheltered from those that are healthy. The sea
district towns, viz., Kent, York, and Bannana Island, are
healthy, being exposed to every current of air, and washed
by the ocean ; the first and last have special advantages, the
former being placed on the promontory of Sierra Leone, the
latter being an island in the Atlantic.
I have before, in another place, recommended that a sani-
tarium should be made at the summit of Sugar-Loaf. The
experience of Newcastle, Jamaica, has led many to believe

that it will be of great importance to the colony and the coast
in general; but when the site is chosen, sanitary rules will
require that the buildings should be made to face the Atlantic
as much as possible, but not to face Regent's Town. The only
difficulty is that of transport ; but if the path to the Himalaya
can be made available for practical purposes, I do not see why
a peak 3000 feet high could not have an easy path made
through it. It must be borne in mind that an elevation of
2000 feet above the level of the sea is a good protection
against the deadly fevers of tropical climates, and therefore
Leicester mountain should also be occupied. Two thousand
five hundred feet is a safeguard against yellow fever or black
vomit, and the local Government should at once cast off the
vis inertice that at present prevents them from occupying
Sugar-Loaf mountain.
Leaving Sierra Leone, we arrive at towns quite exposed to
the Atlantic. The most important of these is Monrovia, the Monrovia
capital of the Liberian Republic; its salubrity, through its
local declivities, is very questionable, since it "is deprived of
the northern sea breeze in its purity by the long sandy beach
and brushwood which stretches from Cape Mount to St Paul's
River, across which it must pass before reaching the place, and
of the westerly winds by a high peak of land intervening be-
tween the town and the sea.". Monrovia, however, is built on
an elevated land.
Cape Palmas is a flat country, exposed in every direction, Cape Palmas
except towards the north, to the Atlantic, and consequently
enjoys the refreshing breeze uncontaminated when it blows
from N.E., E., S., S.W., and W. Its local and general decli-
vity is towards the ocean, and it is without exception the most
healthy spot in the republic of Liberia. It is slightly elevated
above the sea-level, and is well watered by many magni-
ficent rivulets.

Ahanta.
Anamaboe, Winnebah, Accra, Adangme, and Awoonah, must
now be considered. All the districts from Apollonia to
Winnebah are built on slight elevations above the level of the
sea ; the general inclination of the surface, as well as their
local aspect, is towards the broad ocean, in the direction from
north-east to west-south-west, the north and north-west por-
tions being towards the mainland. Axim contains a Dutch
fort, which is built on a rock near the mouth of the River
Axim. The country around is low, moist, and thickly wooded;
it has no mountains, but at some distance from the town
clumps of hills are here and there to be found.
In Ahanta there are three important towns, viz., Secondee,
Bantry, and Dix Cove; they are all built on a slight elevation
from the sea, and are surrounded by abrupt clumps of hills.
There are no mountains near this part of the Gold Coast, but
only small hillocks. "Passing through Chema, as one ap-
proaches the Ahanta coast, several objects of scenographic im-
portance arrest his attention : a land jutting far into the sea; a
sea-coast covered with blocks of huge basaltic rocks; breakers
extending to a considerable distance into the sea, forming, as in
Secondee, a natural breakwater; here and there hillocks of no
mean size, and so abrupt as to give sufficient evidence of the
manner of their origin ; and a country well watered by beauti-
ful streams and rivulets. The breakers are principally pro-
duced by rocks under the sea, encrusted with several varieties
of medrepore corals, stretching in the form of capes a great
distance into the sea ; in some places outcrops of these rocks,
in very low tides, are to be traced about one and a-half mile
from land. The most extensive breakers rise in Cape Three
Points, which extends almost two and a half miles; the next
at Adjuah, the third at Achowa Point, and the fourth at Mum-
ford."*

names of Corner and Barnes' Hills, or Kardo, each of which
contains a mud fort, built by Commodore Wilmot of the "Rattle-

highest of which, Mount Blankson, is situated on the north- Mount
east portion of the town, behind the little town of Agah, which
it overlooks; they all rise from an abrupt base, and are of a
conical shape. From Anamaboe to Accra there are a few high
hills, not worthy the name of mountains ; the most important
of these are situated behind Mumford and Mamquadee. "There
are no mountains," says Dr Tedlie in his report to Dr Nicoll,
"within several miles of Cape Coast, the highest land not being
above 200 feet above the level of the sea; nor are these plains
of great extent. The country, however, is not without beauti-
ful scenery; clumps of hills are to be seen everywhere, with
their corresponding valleys covered with a most luxuriant
foliage throughout the year. The whole of the country, as far
as the eye can see, is one continued forest until you reach the
boundaries of the Winnebah and Accra countries. Here exten-
sive plains, with clumps of trees and bush, are beautifully
interspersed. These plains, however, are not without their
evil consequences to Europeans, for, during the rains, when the
rivulet is filled with water to such an extent as to overflow its
original boundaries, it bursts forth and covers the plains, pre-
senting an extensive watery surface for the action of the
powerful rays of a vertical sun."
All these clumps of hills are decidedly of a volcanic origin. Volcanic

I have many a time picked up beautiful black shining metallic-

been the subject of volcanic upheavals at some distant epoch.

whatever direction ; they are but slightly raised above the
level of the sea. The principal towns are James Town, Dutch
Accra, Christiansborg, Prampram, and Addah, which are all on
the border of the sea. Their general inclination and local
aspect are towards the Atlantic, and chiefly between north-east
and east-south-east.
Behind, and in the interior of Accra, is the Aquapim moun-
tain, which is about 1500 feet above the level of the sea, having
a declivity from south-west to north-east. The principal station
is Akrapoug, where the Basle missionaries have large stone
buildings. The climate is very healthy; the air is colder and
more invigorating than in the towns along the sea shore. The
mountain is covered with an extensive forest, which makes it
continually cool. It forms the sanitarium for the European
missionaries of the Basle Connexion, who have always, to my
knowledge, returned from it after a few weeks' residence quite
renovated.
Behind the Adangme district are, first, the Shai mountain,
which is an abrupt basaltic production, running from south-
west to north-east, and whose aspect is in the latter direction.
I have been on the summit of this hill, which is composed
of huge rocks, entirely displaced and in confused masses
everywhere. Next to Shai is Crobboe, which is an abrupt
formidable mountain about a mile in length, rising almost
perpendicularly from an extensive plain. It presents an open
flat surface on its summit, on which two large towns are built.
It runs from south-east to north ; its local aspect is north-east
and east, and it receives the rising sun full and uninterrupted,
but the setting sun is received slantingly. It is cool and
healthy. Towards the northern aspect the mountain side is
covered by thick forest, but to the south-east it is generally
bare, being only covered by rank grass. From its abrupt rise
on the Crobboe plains, as well as its formidable appearance, an
intelligent military officer has designated it "the Gibraltar of
Western Africa."

Still further behind the Crobboe hills are the Aquamboo Aquamboo
range of mountains; they run from north-east to south-west,
and their aspect is towards the east and south. The range, at
its north-east extremity, is stopped short by the River Volta,
which waters these regions. At this position it rises abruptly
above the rest of the range, forming a peak, which receives the
name of Mount Pine. I ascended one of these ranges in 1863,
situated near the Basle missionary station of Odumasi. Before
me there was an extensive plain, dotted here and there with
abrupt hills or mountains of various heights. Alongside the

stands boldly out; it is a conical, abrupt mount of good height,
and exposed in every direction to the sea breeze. These several
mountains are, without doubt, of a volcanic origin; and the
plains, which are covered with sand and marine shells, must
have been raised from the depth of the ocean by subterranean
disturbances at an early epoch of the world's history. Their
summits are healthier than the plains; and the suggestion that
Acropong should be made an invalid station, if carried out, will
be a step in advance in sanitary matters.
Leaving the Gold Coast, we arrive at an extensive narrow
tract of sandy land, extending from the River Volta to the
Niger, and included under the name of the Bight of Benin. Bight of
These tracts were of coral formation originally, but they have em
been covered with sand and alluvial deposits. About fifteen
miles from Cape St Paul is Quittah, which was formerly a Quittah
military station, but which is now abandoned both by the civil actor
and military authorities. The coast all along this bight is low
and swampy, especially during the rains; the island of Lagos,
which has lately been received as a British colony, forming no
exception to the general rule.
There is but slight elevation above the level of the sea, and
the general and local inclinations are towards the Atlantic. No
mountains or elevated spots are to be seen, except far into the
interior. Between the mainland and the interior there is a
lagoon of brackish water. The island of Lagos originally

was of coral formation, but has been increased by the con-
tinual deposits of alluvium from the surrounding rivers. It is
situated at the confluence of the rivers Ogun, Oshun, and Ossa,
which unite to form the Kradu Water, and discharge them-
selves into the sea over Lagos bar. "The delta formed at the
mouth of this lake," says Dr Roe, Army Medical Staff, "had
been originally a mud bank. On this has been formed a sand-
bank, which constitutes the island of Lagos. Its greatest
length from east to west is three miles; its greatest breadth
from north to south, one mile; but these measurements must
not be considered as giving the area of the island, from the
great irregularity of its outline. The depth of this deposit of
sand varies from six to sixteen feet, and underneath it is always
found argillaceous earth, white or grey in colour. Clay is
found on the western bank of the lagoon, opposite to the town,
of good consistence, and used for making serviceable bricks.
They are friable, and do not stand exposure to moisture well,
but, as a reason, the clay is not thoroughly puddled, and the
bricks are not properly burnt. . . . . In no part of the island
is there much elevation above the level of the surrounding
lagoon, perhaps the highest does not exceed thirty feet above
this; and these elevated portions exist only in two places, and
then in an area of only a few square yards. A large part of
the island is absolutely below the water level ; and two of these
tracts, the larger than the others, form swamps, which reach
within a short distance of the sea on either side, while branches
of the lagoon indent the margin in all directions."* The main-
land in the immediate vicinity of Lagos presents no eminence
or rising ground worthy of notice, but at Epi and Ikorodu the
ground has a decided rise from the bank of the river.

lofty mountains, higher than those seen in any other part of
Western Africa. The country along it is of considerable eleva-
tion above the level of the sea, the northern portion having an
inclination towards the south and south-east; the southern
showing an inclination towards the west and south-west. There
are no stations along the whole coast line occupied by the
English Government, and, consequently, I must be brief in my
description. Between the Old Calabar and Camaroon Rivers
there are lofty mountains, the highest of which, the Camaroon Camaroon
Peak or Mongo-ma-lobah, rises about 13,760 feet above the
level of the sea; the lesser Camaroon Peak is about 5820 feet
high. These mountains, towards their summit, possess the vege-
tation of the temperate zone and a European climate; they
are very healthy, and decidedly of a volcanic origin. To

them to perfect health.
Within this bight there are several islands of volcanic origin.
The principal is Fernando Po, which is now occupied by the Fernando Po
Spanish Government. The island is very much elevated above
the level of the sea, presenting various local aspects. It is
very mountainous, the ranges running from north to south-
west by south; they are entirely of a volcanic origin. It has
two lofty peaks, the highest of which, Clarence Peak, is about Clarence
10,160 feet above the sea level. Of its volcanic origin Dr
Daniel writes :-" Basaltic scoriæ, in different stages of de-
composition, with aluminous and other shalified conglomerates,
alternately blended with and based on the results of igneous
action, fully determined the geological features of Fernando
Po, and attest its volcanic origin; while the recent explorations
of Clarence Peak, in confirmation of the correctness of these
views of its physical formation, have satisfactorily proved it to
be an extinct crater of considerable magnitude. Throughout the
isle the land in general rises somewhat abruptly from the sea,
exposing to the eye faces of basaltic and other rocks embedded

in the soft friable masses of scoriæ, the crevices of which are
frequently filled up by tufts of plants and by brushwood. In
other places, where the declination of the land is of a less pre-
cipitous character, it becomes more easy in its descent. Beaches
of fine black sand, with huge rounded fragments dislocated
from the circumjacent cliffs, are found at their base; the accli-
vities surmounting which are uniformly concealed by a dense
underwood of shrubs and young trees. On the inferior
slopes these volcanic vestiges are covered with superficial
crusts of dark red clay, mixed with the loam of decayed vege-
tation, which, being clothed with extensive woods of bombax,
palm, red wood, and other trees of gigantic dimensions, pre-
sent a very imposing and beautiful effect. Like all moun-
tainous regions in equatorial Africa, the upper plateaus and
heights are diversified by the mingled links of a varied vege-
tation, which, partly corresponding with the woody productions
of a more temperate clime, and partly with those found on the
lower or maritime districts of the island, are of a less exuberant
growth, and do not assume the gorgeous richness so peculiar
to African landscapes within the tropics. Adjoining the limits
of these woods the ground is conjointly strewed by a thick
jungle of dwarf bushes and trees, intersprinkled with occasional
specimens of the aborescent fern (Filix aborea). Beyond this
a verdant sward of grass ascends within a short distance from
the more lofty peaks, and is selected by game, herds of deer,
and wild buffaloes as their pasturage. In the dry months the
natives set fire to the long withered stems, in order to drive
these animals into their power, and it is possible that from this
circumstance the report has originated of the volcanic eruption
of flames, said to have been noticed on the summit of the
mountain. The distant range of highlands, as they rise from
the flat and undulating terraces that constitute the extreme
periphery of the island, proportionately increase in altitude, and
finally converge into two terminal peaks, joined by a continuous
ridge some miles in extent. The highest of them, called Clarence
Peak, is almost constantly enveloped in fleecy clouds."

At the first occupation of this island by the Spanish Govern- Spanish
ment the mortality was very high ; they occupied the town of
Clarence, which is built on a slight elevation along the water
side. Experience has taught them that the higher they ascend
the more healthy they become, and now they have built sanita-
riums on the sides of the lofty ranges of hills, viz., at 1000 feet
above the level of the sea, which have immensely reduced the
rate of mortality in the island.

over the climate of a place. 1st, By their general declivity hills, and
with respect to the course of the sun. 2nd, By their height. spots on
3rd, By the winds they arrest and those they do not interrupt.
Dr Pickford gives the following summary as their re-
sults:-
1. Countries lying to windward and westward of extensive
Inountain chains are warmer than those to leeward or to east-
ward.
2. The atmosphere of elevated localities is colder, thinner,
more transparent, drier, purer, more bracing, more elastic, more
exhilarating, and more ozoniferous than that of the vale or
plain below.
3. As a rule malaria is rarely met with on hills and elevated
situations, unless generated by stagnant pools on the table-
land or plateaus of the hills themselves, its great specific
gravity precluding its ascent to high grounds.
4. Elevated localities are exempt from typhus and remitting
fevers, and are in every respect more healthy than the valley
or plain.
5. The atmosphere of mountains and high situations, says
Aristotle, is much more agitated than that of low ground.
6. More rain falls among the mountains than in the plain.
7. The reading of the barometer is not so high on hills and
mountains as in the plains below.
8. Mountain travelling, in consequence of the purity, elasti-
city, and ozoniferous qualities of the air, is highly conducive
to health.

9. The effect on the pulse and respiration of mountain
travelling is to accelerate them.
According to M. de Saussiere the air of low plains is less
salubrious, because it is loaded with heavy exhalations, sus-
tained by its density; on the other hand, that of mountains
more than 500 or 600 toises (3196.85 or 3836•22 feet) above
sea level is vitiated by other exhalations, which, possibly lighter
than common air, do not the less impair its salubrity.

cooler than the interior of the continent. Thus, during the
Ashantee expedition of 1863-64, the encampment at the banks
of the River Prah, about 180 miles from the sea coast, was at an
average ten degrees hotter than Cape Coast; this is due to
the cooling influence of the sea water over the wind as it
passes over its surface. The atmosphere is generally more
invigorating and healthier than in the interior, through the

unhealthy; the emanation from the surface of the river does not
consist of aqueous vapour only, but also of deleterious gases, such
as sulphuretted and carburetted hydrogen, &c., besides which
the muddy swamp that is occasioned gives off very poisonous
vapours. The mean daily temperature of the water of the river
sometimes exceeds the minimum temperature of the country or
town around, in which case the water exhales mephitic atmo-
spheric gases, the result of putrefaction of the vegetable and
animal matter which it receives in its course, and which is held
in solution by them; and this water, when drunk by individuals
predisposed to bowel complaints, at once produces dysentery
and diarrhea. These diseases continue in amount and severity
in direct ratio with the increase of temperature, and decrease as
the heavy rain increases the bulk of the water, and diminishes
its temperature.
Through the evaporations and exhalations that are con-
stantly going on from the surface of water, especially in
tropical climates, the banks and surface of the river and
neighbouring country are always covered with mists, fogs, or
haze, which is principally the case when there exists a great
difference between the temperature of the atmosphere and that
of the water. This haze or mist is observed generally in the
morning before the heat of the sun dispels it. Thus, during the
harmattan months, in the upper portion of the River Gambia,
when the temperature of the water is very low, ranging froni
50° to 56° in early morning, the surface of the river and the
adjacent lands are generally covered with thick mist.
The ebbing of tidal rivers by the ocean tide, such as those
met with in every part of Western Africa, leaving muddy
banks with dead vegetable and animal putrescent matter
exposed to the direct rays of solar heat and the influence of
the temperature, twice during the twenty-four hours, are pro-
ductive of deadly emanations which might produce fever,
diarrhoea, and dysentery.
When lakes and lagoons are well supplied with water, and
their banks are high and steep, they give out no pestilential

vapour, but when their banks are low, and the water is subject
to be diminished, their banks become exposed to the direct
rays of the sun, and the vegetable and animal remains become
decomposed, and form the source of malarious fevers. The
lagoons in the Bight of Biafra are the source of the most
deadly emanations : the banks are open, flat, and covered with
rank vegetation, and here and there pools of water. During the
dry season there remains an extensive tract of slimy mud,
which sends forth pestilential vapours.
But lagoons, lakes, and swamps, when surrounded by large
umbrageous trees, by forest trees and green vegetation, are not
unhealthy, nature having provided the leaves of these plants
with the property of decomposing and destroying the malarious
poison by the oxygen which they give out, forming ozone by
combination with the oxygen of the air, and of absorbing
certain noxious emanations; but when marshy land, covered
with forest and underwood, is deprived of solar light and heat, of
a free circulation of the air, and the woods are close and impene-
trable to atmospheric influence, it becomes very unhealthy.
Countries that are well supplied with forests or woods are Forests and
very much cooler than those which are open and cultivated;
the reasons are that they shelter the surface of the earth from
the direct rays of the sun, and consequently prevent radiation
from it (the process by which the atmosphere is heated)—that
the leaves give out a large quantity of watery vapour—that
they absorb solar heat, and increase the amount of cooling
superficial or radiating surface.
During the day, whilst there is sunshine, plants absorb and
decompose carbonic acid from the atmosphere, assimilating its
carbon and giving out its oxygen to the air : during the night,
or in the shade, they absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid.
But malaria is most active and deadly from sunset to sunrise,
at the very time when plants absorb oxygen and give off
carbonic acid. Marsh miasma "is arrested, and probably
neutralised, decomposed, absorbed or respired, by large thick
woods.

leafy trees, by dense groves and forests, by masses of foliage
and by evergreen shrubs ;" and Pliny was correct in his opinion
that "groves and trees absorb and destroy mephitic vapours."*
According to Haviland, a forest, intervening between a pes-
tilential marsh and a city, often affords a protection to the
inhabitants, and perchance the pestiferous air gets decomposed
into innocuous gases during its enlargement among the trees.
Sullivan, in his " Visit to Ceylon," corroborates this fact. He
remarked that the vicinity of tanks and lagoons of the most
fatid and agueish character was perfectly healthy. They were
covered in abundance with various kinds of aquatic plants,
including the lotus, of almost Victoria Regia magnificence,
which, by a kind Providence, are made " to serve not only as
filterers and purifiers of the water itself, but even as consumers
of a considerable portion of the noxious exhalations that would
otherwise poison the neighbourhood."
The atmosphere of valleys is generally charged with
moisture. It contains very little ozone; it is chilly in the
morning before the rise of the sun. "During the forenoon,
mid-day, and afternoon, the temperature has attained its
maximum, and is succeeded by the cold mist and fogs of
evening. Mountain chains influence the temperature of the
valleys to a very considerable extent. Valleys and plains on
the north side of lofty mountains, being deprived of the
warming and cheering rays of the sun, are cold and gloomy,
and their vegetation is retarded in a proportionate degree."
The morning mists are generally dispelled by the morning
sun. These are caused by radiation of heat in calm nights and
the cooling of the earth's surface or surface air below the air
above; their origin is from the vapour which arises from the
earth's surface and from water. Fogs have the same origin,
their immediate causation being the admixture of airs of differ-
ent temperatures. The temperature of the water at night is
hotter than that of the superincumbent air, which, " becoming
warmed by the water, rises surcharged with moisture, which

it precipitates in the form of fog upon coming in contact with
the cooler air above."
The fogs generally observed on the tops of Leicester moun-
tain and Sugar-Loaf, or on the top of any mountain, are caused
by their sides and summits being cooler than the prevailing
wind, condensing the vapour which they hold in solution, while
molecules of water form themselves into fogs. According to ·
M. de Saussiere, mists and fogs consist of minute vesicles or
hollow spheres of water filled with air, capable of mutual re-
pulsion. Being very rapid in their movements, they chase,
repel, and fly to each other in the most grotesque and amusing
styles ; they are supported and formed in the air by the agency
of electricity, derived from the upper strata of the atmosphere.
Having in the foregoing cursorily treated on the advantages
and disadvantages of places situated in the neighbourhood of
great seas, of large rivers, lakes or lagoons, of forests, and in
valleys and low lying land, I shall now briefly describe the
relative positions of the different colonies and principal places
on the West Coast of Africa with respect to those conditions,
and how they either destroy or enhance health.

the debris and other putrefying matter brought down by the Ga
river. It is far below the water level, and is bordered on
the north and west by an extensive muddy swamp, which at
the commencement of the rains gives out a most deadly vapour.
Governor Colonel D'Arcy, in a "Report to the Legislative
Council on Dikes and Drains," remarked that the Island of
St Mary's was considerably below the level of the sea in some
parts,—"For on observing the wells during the dry season,
the water is ten or twelve feet below the surface of the earth ;
whereas during the rains the surface of the water in the wells
of the military hospital, one of the highest parts of the island,
is scarcely a foot from the level of the ground. This proves
that the whole of the race-course and Half Die must be con-

siderably below the level of the sea." "Observing this pecu-
liarity, I was induced early in 1860 to commence the sea-wall
round Half Die."
At Government House and burial-ground the sea is en-
croaching, so that the very existence of the island is precarious.
"Let there be a combination of elements," says Colonel D'Arcy,
" in a sea breeze, during the month of August, blowing strong
when the waumies happen to be in the ascendancy, preventing
thereby the ebb-tide from acting freely, and nothing could save
the island from being covered with six feet of water, to the
great destruction of life and property." He strongly recom-
mended the formation of drains, the building of ramparts
against the encroachment of the sea and river, the filling up
of marsh and low lands—all which are measures necessary for
the sanitary condition of the colony.
The Cape is opposite the sea, and enjoys all the good in-
fluence which the neighbourhood of such an element is like to
produce..
M'Carthy's Island is a mass of muddy swamp during the
rains, and very low, so that in a heavy season the water inun-
dates a large portion of the island. It is entirely surrounded
by the river, whose muddy banks, from October to July,
through the ebbing-tide, are exposed twice in the twenty-four
hours to the action of the sun. During the dry season the
alluvial earth is dry and caked; a few large trees are to be seen
here and there, but the island is generally bare at this time.
There are no forests near St Mary's, or trees, with the excep-
tion of a few mangroves in the swamps ; but the early inhabi-
tants were conscious of the benefits to be derived by planting
rows of trees in the town, and thus the front streets, and some
of the back streets also, are decorated with rows of evergreen
trees, which not only give a pleasing aspect to the town, but
also produce a most beneficial sanitary result, as we have
already seen.

river. The river is, in general, bordered with moderately high
cliffs, so that at ebb-tide there are little or no mud banks exposed
in those places. But the river forms undulations and bays at
different places, and during ebb-tide leaves there extensive
tracts of muddy swamp, which act most prejudicially upon the
health of the colony. At Freetown, Congotown Bay, Crew Bay,
and Granville Bay, form conjointly one of the most pernicious
sources of the endemic fevers so destructive at certain seasons
in the colony. The Crew Bay swampy tract is in the heart of
Freetown; it is twice every day exposed to atmospheric in-
fluence, and gives a most sickening odour. The Grammar
School building overlooks this deadly bay ; and can it be a
wonder,' then, that no European can occupy that spacious
building without in a few months, yea weeks, falling into the
most severe form of intertropical fever ? Is it a wonder that
when yellow fever was prevailing in the town, its principal
and his consort fell an easy prey to its deadly paw, and both of
them were carried in the same day to a distant graveyard ? Is
it a wonder that a successor, who was sent from England to
take his place, after a few weeks' residence was invalided, after
a most distracting attack of fever? Is it a wonder, I say, that
the present principal, who is a native of the colony, found,
after some years of labour, that he was dying by inches, and
that his life was most uncertain so long as he remained there,
and that he consequently tendered his resignation, which was
not accepted? And need I say, is it a wonder that the building,
being formerly a Government House, was sold, after the death of
several governors and government officers? Amongst the former
Jeremy was one. And yet is it not paradoxical, that the local
Government has not done the least thing towards counter-
acting this noxious Pontine marsh? Year after year its deadly
effluvia conveys many a valuable life to "the long home," and
yet the local Government "dines and sups" by its side without
ever thinking it worth their consideration to do something
towards neutralising its effects.

when compared with Crew Bay, but they help, by their eman-
ations, to fill the air of Freetown with miasmatic poison.
Freetown, as well as all the towns in the river district, is
situated at the foot of the mountains, with elevated spots at
different parts of the town. The most swampy and low por-
tions of Freetown are behind Crew Town, known as Portuguese
Town; this is always found covered with mist and fog, especially
at the beginning of the rainy season, and is in all respects
amongst the most unhealthy portions of Freetown, as the rate
of mortality is greater there than from any other part. . It is a
low lying land, and consequently subject to those disadvan-
tages already described.
The towns in the mountain districts are in the neighbour-
hood of small, clear fresh-water rivulets, having gravelly bot-
toms ; they rise from the valley made between the range of
hills on either side. The climate is cool and refreshing, and
there is a constant draught of strong wind. The banks of the
rivulets are generally healthy, having no muddy swamp, except
at some isolated spots during the rainy season. Kent, York,
and Bannana are exposed to the temperate influence of the
Atlantic, being situated in its immediate neighbourhood, and
receiving the breeze in every direction.
All the towns in Sierra Leone are plentifully supplied with
evergreen verdure. The habit of occupying detached build-
ings, having a piece of land surrounding each habitation, where
plants in all the bloom of tropical luxuriance are everywhere
to be found, is carried to such an extent, that it is picturesque
to stand on one of the mountains and take a bird's eye view of
the town ;* but the local Government has not yet organised
* The houses are placed on either side of the streets, detached, many of
which have beautiful promenades and flower-gardens around them. This
reminds me of that portion in Tacitus, where he says, describing the habita-
tions of the Germans of his day, " Ne patiunter quidem, inter se junctas sedes.
Colunt discreti ac diversi, ut fons, ut campus, ut nemus placuit. Viscos

means by which trees can be planted in regular rows in the
streets of Freetown. Such a plan would tend to decrease the
unhealthiness of the town. It has been proved without a doubt,
that since the streets were covered with the Bahama grass, the
colony has greatly improved in health. With the exception
of York, there are no large forests in the immediate neighbour-
hood of any of the towns, but they are surrounded by low woods
and high grass. Sherbro Island is low, swampy, and unhealthy,
and presents almost the same peculiarity as M'Carthy's Island.
Monrovia, the capital of the Liberian Republic, is built on
the bank of the Mesurado River on a high ground; it is also
exposed to the sea. Local influences tell very much against its
healthiness. Cape Palmas is situated in the neighbourhood of
the Atlantic. In its interior it is well watered by several small
streams; it has no large forests behind it, and its healthiness
is unquestionable.
The Gold Coast stations are in the immediate neighbourhood
of the Atlantic. They are but scantily watered by large rivers ;
there are only five within a coast line of nearly 300 miles, viz.,
the Assenee, Aucobra, Boosum Prah, Iyensu, and the Volta.
There are no stations built in the immediate vicinity of any of
these rivers, with the exception of Chema, near Boosum Prah,
and Winnebah, near Iyensu, but they are placed at some distance
from the mouth or banks of the rivers. The towns on the Gold
Coast are surrounded principally by thick bush of underwood,
and in many places by large forests. The only unhealthy
water collections are the salt ponds, which are always found
outside the towns. There is one at Cape Coast, another at
Anamaboe, and several at Accra. They are small lagoons
which, during the drying process, give out very offensive and
sickly odours, which, their position being towards the south-
west, are consequently ever drifted towards the towns.
Cape Coast is quite in advance of Sierra Leone in one
grove may attract them. They plan their villages, not after our own fashion,
in rows of adjoining houses ; on the contrary, every one has a piece of land
surrounding his habitation.-( The Author's work on the Medical Topography of
the West Coast of Africa.)

sanitary particular : the old European residences have large
umbrageous trees planted on either side of the streets, cooling
the air, and making an agreeable shade against the noon-day
sun. They have squares with shady trees in every direction,
which have lately been put into perfect repair by the great
sanitary governor, Colonel Couran. This is a step in advance
which the sister colony should, without delay, imitate. . Several
trees should be planted by the sides of these salt-water lakes
nearest to the towns, which will tend to neutralise the action
of the poison emanating from their banks.
Malaria has an attraction for or adherence to lofty um-
brageous trees. Dr Ferguson writes :—"At Paramaribo, the
capital of Surinam, the trade wind, which regularly ventilates
the town and renders it habitable, blows over a considerable
tract of swamp at a short distance, but which, fortunately for
the inhabitants, is thickly covered with umbrageous forests.
Experience, besides, has shown that there, as in all other new
lands, the cutting down of those trees in the swamps has ever been
a fatal operation in itself, and in all probability would be pro-
ductive of pestilence to the town." This should always be borne
in mind by heads of colonies, and they cannot plant too many
trees in the various towns. From the same cause, the inhabi-
tants near the Dismal Swamp of America, occupying a tract of
nearly 150,000 acres, on the borders of Virginia and North
Carolina, very seldom suffer from ague, whilst North and
South Carolina and Virginia suffer dreadfully from it. The
Bights of Biafra and Benin are well watered with many rivers.
The Ogun, Niger, Bonny, Calabar, Cameroon, &c., are to be
found here ; but we have more to do with stations at Biafra,
which are situated on a narrow tract of land between the
lagoon and the Atlantic. They are much exposed to the
influence of the Atlantic; and although Lagos is a few miles
inland, it still is near enough to receive its benefit. The banks
of the lagoon are low and muddy, and covered with rank
vegetation near the land. At the commencement of the rains,
the extensive dried up banks are covered with small pools of

stagnant water, which give out putrid exhalations. It is the
great source of the unhealthiness of this part of the coast, and
the only remedy would be to cover these banks with large
trees.

source of disease, the immortal Shakspeare has even told us.

But we find that the natives have instinctively protected them-
selves from the results of these deadly emanations from the
banks, by surrounding their towns with large lofty cocoa-nut
trees, which are densely packed together. This has assisted
a great deal in putting down the malaria evolved, and the
inhabitants are comparatively healthy. Lagos, as has been
described, is situated at the confluence of these rivers, and in
some parts is below water-level. There are, unfortunately, not
many large trees in the town, and it is not surrounded, as in the
other towns, by lofty cocoa-nut trees. Fernando Po has been
sufficiently described in the last chapter as to its position in
the centre of the Atlantic.

Nature of The geological nature of the soil bears very important relations
relation to to the sanitary condition of a country,—its configuration and
ogical geological characters having a close connection, within a certain
itions of limit, with certain pathological conditions of man.
Clayey soils. The compact nature of clayey soils prevents it from admitting
both heat and air. It permits the superficial retention
water and moisture of every kind. "It generates, how partially
soever, those marshy or undrained spots, or wet woods, or
moist meadows, which are the sources of malaria, and, conse-
quently, of the various diseases confounded with the vague
term unhealthiness." The atmosphere on clayey soils is
generally more cool than on other soils, because during the
heating process they give out a large quantity of the contained
water in the form of vapour, which acts beneficially on the
heated air; the air is, however, very damp and foggy, and its
effect on the system is very relaxing. The inhabitants of such
soils are most subject to colds, coughs, and rheumatism.
Clayey soils absorb about ten or twenty times more water
than sandy soils, and twenty or thirty times less than surface
soils. Clay soils absorb heat less than sandy soils, and cool

down more rapidly also; they allow less quantity of air to pass
through them.
Gravelly soils are, when dry, very healthy; they are easily Gravelly
permeated by air, water, and light, and quickly get dry; they
are easily drained, and prevent the accumulation of vegetable
putrescent matter.
Ferruginous soils absorb heat rapidly, and give it out also Ferruginous
rapidly. Sir Ranald Martin considers them most unhealthy
and deadly. From a priori reason I consider that this is not
the case, but I shall say more on the subject when we come
to consider the ferruginous soils of Western Africa.

slow in its radiation in many cases. The heat during the day
is very great, and the radiation being slow, at night it is very
oppressive, unless other climatic circumstances lessen it: these
conditions may be modified by covering these soils with green
vegetation.
Sand absorbs very little water; it passes very rapidly through
it, and, cæteres paribus, it is generally healthy; but sometimes
it contains organic decomposing matter, or the sand is the super-
ficial covering of a clay mould, in which cases sandy soils may
become very unhealthy; in which latter condition, the air is
generally moistened by the evaporation from the clayey subsoil.

water runs off readily; the air is comparatively dry ; vegeta-
tion is not excessive; marshes and malaria are comparatively
unfrequent, and few impurities pass into the drinking water.
... Such regions are often elevated, strong currents of air
are more frequent, and the particles derived from the dried
stools are carried away.
When these rocks have been weathered and disintegrated,
and when they often yield a red or dark-coloured soil, they are
supposed to be unhealthy. Such soil is certainly absorbent of
water.
2. The Clay Slate.—These rocks precisely resemble the granite
and granitoid formations in their effect on health. They have
usually much slope ; are very permeable; vegetation is scanty,
and nothing is added to air or drinking water.
They are consequently healthy; water, however, is often
scarce, and, as in the granite districts, there are swollen brooks
during rain, and dry water courses at other times swelling
rapidly after rains.
3. The Limestone and Magnesian Limestone Rocks.— These
so far resemble the former that there is a good deal of slope
and rapid passing off of water. Marshes, however, are more
common, and may exist at great heights. In that case, the
marsh is probably fed with water from some of the larger
cavities, which, in the course of ages, become hollowed out in
the limestone rocks by the carbonic acid of the rain, and form
reservoirs of water.
The drinking water is hard, sparkling, and clear. Gcitre is
more common, and, it is said, renal calculus. Of the various
kinds of limestone, the oolite is the best, and magnesian is the
worst; and it is desirable not to put stations on magnesian
limestone if it can be avoided.
4. The Chalk.—The chalk, when mixed with clay and per-
meable, forms a very healthy soil. The air is pure, and the
water, though charged with carbonate of lime, is clear, spark-
ling, and pleasant. Goitre is not nearly so common, nor
apparently calculus, as in the limestone districts.

COMPARATIVE HEALTHINESS OF SOILS.

If the chalk be marly, it becomes impermeable, and is then
often damp and cold. The lower parts of the chalk, which are
underlaid by gault clay, and which also receive the drainage of
the parts above, are often very malarious.
5. The Sandstones. The permeable sandstones are often
very healthy; both soils and air are dry; the drinking water
is, however, sometimes impure. If the sand be mixed with
much clay, or if clay underlies a shallow sand rock, the site is
sometimes damp. In choosing such a site, the water should
be always carefully examined.
The hard millstone grit formations are very healthy, and
their conditions resemble those of granite.
6. Gravels of any depth are always healthy, except when
they are much below the general surface, and water rises
through them. Gravel hillocks are the healthiest of all sites;
and the water, which often flows out in springs near the base,
being held up by underlying clay, is very pure.
7. Sands.—There are both healthy and unhealthy sands.
The healthy are the pure sands, which contain no organic
matter, and are of considerable depth. The air is pure, and so
is often the drinking water. Sometimes the drinking water
contains enough iron to become hard, and even chalybeate.
The unhealthy sands are those which are composed of silicious
particles (and some iron), held together by a vegetable sedi-
ment. It is nearly impermeable to water, but water dissolves
gradually the vegetable matter, and acquires a brownish yellow
colour, and, if it comes from six feet in depth, has a marshy
odour. It is most unwholesome, and causes intermittent and
visceral engorgements. Chemical and microscopic analyses
will detect this condition.
In other cases sand is unhealthy, from underlying clay or
laterite near the surface, or from being so placed that water
rises through its permeable soil from higher levels. Water may
thus be formed within three or four feet of the surface; and in
this case the sand is unhealthy, and often malarious. Impuri-
ties are retained in it, and effluvia traverse it. Merely digging

for water in the wet season will cause the discovery of these
conditions.
In a third class of cases the soils are unhealthy because they
contain soluble mineral matter. Many sands contain much
carbonate of magnesia and lime salts, as well as salts of the
alkalies. The drinking water may thus contain a large quan-
tity of carbonate of soda, and even lime and magnesia salts
and iron.
8. Clay, Dense Marls, and Alluvial Soils generally.—These
are always to be regarded with suspicion. Water neither runs
off nor runs through ; the air is moist; marshes are com-
mon; the composition of the water varies, but it is often
impure with lime and soda soils. In alluvial soils there are
often alternations of thin strata of sand and sandy impermeable
clay. Much vegetable matter is often mixed with this, and
air and water are both impure. If such spots must be chosen
(for a station), thorough subsoil draining, careful purification of
water, and elevation of the houses above the soil, are the
measures which must be adopted.
The deltas of great rivers present these alluvial characters in
the highest degree, and should not be chosen for sites. If
they must be taken, only the most thorough drainage can
make them healthy.
9. Cultivated Soils.—Well cultivated soils are often healthy,
nor at present is it known that the use of manure in any form
has been hurtful. Irrigated lands, and especially rice fields,
which give not only a great surface for evaporation, but also
send up organic matter into the air, are hurtful. Where a
country is densely populated, and where agricultural pursuits are
carried on extensively and to a high degree, the health of the
country must of necessity be greatly improved ; malaria is
prevented from being generated, and the death rate is much
diminished. But when a land is first cleared and the soil
broken up for cultivation, the exposed land might be the
source of malaria for some time; it is always better that it
should be done in the heat of the day.

seeds, without applying the least scientific measures towards
the improvement of them. Their mode of cultivation answers
remarkably to the description given of a Hindu field, in the
highest state of cultivation, by Mill,—"Everything which
savours of ingenuity, even the most natural results of common
observation and good sense, are foreign to the agriculture of
the" people of Western Africa. "Their ideas of improvement
are very limited; they scarcely extend beyond the introduction
of irrigation into land which was formerly cultivated dry. Each
small proprietor is content to follow the customs of his fore-
fathers; the same rude implements of husbandry, the same
inferior race of cattle, and the same practices, are still in
operation, which have existed unchanged for centuries. As to
any new experiments of general measuring, drainage, differ-
ences in the rotation of crops, introducing new grain or
vegetables, or new sorts of those already known, any attention
to their breed of cattle, any adoption of a better and more
combined system by which a smaller number of people could
raise the same, or a larger proportion of produce—all these are
out of the question."
It is a great pity to find that the Colonial Government still
neglects to promote agriculture, and to assist in developing the
natural resources of the country, although this was pointed out
in the Parliamentary Committee of 1842. This neglect is a great
drawback to the prosperity of the various colonies. The Euro-
pean merchants seek quick returns and large profits, and con-
sequently do not give the necessary encouragement and direction
to profitable industry. How truly Mr Attarra has said, "It is
truly surprising that in a colony like [Sierra Leone] agriculture
is considered a thing of little importance. Had education been
warmly taken up as the invaluable birthright of the African,
he would have viewed the matter with the right eye, and seen
that far from being a low employment, agriculture furnishes
the most delightful occupation for such a creature as man."

CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY OF WESTERN AFRICA.
In 1842 the Parliamentary Committee urged upon the
Colonial Government the necessity of introducing cotton as an
article of trade, and Sir P. F. Buxton did the same some years
ago; " but the African cotton brought to the English market
was through the exertions of a private friend of Africa, who
sent out a small sum and a few cleaning machines to a native
teacher in Africa." The first consignment was in 1852, which
was small, but this rapidly increased, until in the eighth year
it reached to 4000 cwts.
Mr Rosenbush has remarked, that the greatest requirement
of the colony is agriculture, and he recommends the establish-
ment of a model farm by convict labour; and the Rev. Henry
Venn* says,—"A model farm, to be of real service, should also
be a botanical garden for ascertaining and cultivating the best
specimens of native produce, and for receiving from the Royal
Botanical Gardens at Kew specimens of tropical plants which
might be introduced into Western Africa." The Colonial
Government has never attempted to develope the natural
resources of Africa, although the natives are in that stage of
civilisation in which such an attempt would produce a very
profitable result. The Government, to make their efforts
productive of good, should establish model farms, should give
prizes to successful producers of agricultural produce, should
form public warehouses where small farmers might store their
goods for shipment, and should give as much as possible
encouragement and facilities for shipment.
There is nothing so necessary for the healthy growth of a
in towns and community as the drainage and sewerage of the towns they
inhabit, and the inefficient mode in which this is done in
Western Africa shows that the general population or their
superiors have set a limit to their own existence. Yes. "The
air we breathe, loaded with carbonaceous matter, sulphurous
and sulphuric acid, sulphate of ammonia, and sulphuretted
hydrogen, is deprived, by the absence of vegetation, of the
revivifying principle, oxygen, and is hence less fitted for the

necessary changes of the blood effected during respiration.
The earth which we tread under our feet, loaded with the ashes
of our forefathers, and rich with the remains of animal and
vegetable matter of ages long gone by, saturated with the
putrefying contents of cesspools and leaking sewers of our own
day, emits, at certain seasons of the year, the poisonous ema-
nations which generate typhus, diarrhea, dysentery, and
cholera ; whilst the waters of our principal tidal rivers, con-
verted into open common sewers, teem with pestiferous exhala-
tions charged with the germ of disease or the messenger of
death. If under these favourable conditions a pestilential
epidemic invade our shores, it finds us an unprepared and easy
prey."
This should be an important subject with the Governor- Officer of
General of the Coast. An officer of public health should be
appointed in the various colonies in the Coast Government,
and ample means afforded him for the efficient performance of
the duties which would devolve upon him. He should be made
plainly and distinctly to know that his duties are—To examine
and watch over the health of the population at large; to see
that the water is pure and plentifully supplied ; to ascertain
that every public building and the dwelling-houses of the poor
are properly ventilated; to prevent the committing of nuisances
in the streets and lanes of towns and villages, or in their imme-
diate neighbourhood, the burial of the dead in houses, and
all noxious and unwholesome trade from being carried on with-
in a given distance from the towns and dwelling-houses; to
establish public slaughtering-houses and burial-grounds; to
make strict sanitary inspection of all trading vessels ; and
especially to "lay down and carry out an effectual, efficient,
complete, and common-sense plan of drainage and sewerage
for every town and city."
The sewage of towns and cities consists of the solid and Composition
fluid excreta of men and animals, which, if not continually re-
moved from the dwelling-houses, or if inefficiently removed,

forms one of the most prolific sources of disease. Taken at an
average of all ages, and the mean throughout the whole year,
man passes daily about 21 ounces of fæcal, and 40 ounces of
urinary matter; or a town containing a population of 1000
people excrete in one year 25 tons of fæcal or solid matter,
and 91,250 gallons of urine.
In many of the rural districts of Western Africa, and in many
small towns, the sewage matter is deposited in the fields, and
by the action of the sea, the air, and rain, enters into the soil,
which it fertilises ; but in those villages where these sub-
stances are left on the streets, exposing the population to its
emanations, produced by the action of the rain and other atmo-
spheric influences, it becomes a source of very great danger
to human life.
But it is in large towns that it becomes essentially a ques-
Africa, and tion of life and death, which should call forth the energy and
ability of both Government and people to stay the mischief
that will arise from it. In many places in Western Africa-
say, for instance, Freetown, in Sierra Leone—there is no pro-
per organised means for removing the sewage of the town; all
the inhabitants, or the ninety-nine in a hundred, use cesspools,
which consist of a large hole dug in the ground in the imme-
diate vicinity of the dwelling-houses, or connected with them;
the hole being covered by a wood work or frame. These open
privys are some of them full, and most in a state approaching
it. There are, it must be distinctly remembered, no legislative
Acts compelling the population to keep them in order and in
a proper sanitary state; no Government inspection has ever
been made of them; and in consequence of this, and the
apathy of landowners and inmates of dwelling-houses as re-
gards the removal of their contents, and their total ignorance
of the use of deodorisers and disinfectants, the sewage of
Freetown becomes the source of a pernicious emanation, and
the chief cause why, at certain seasons of the year, fevers of
the most virulent type always break out. It is strange that

and jeopardised, have not long before this endeavoured
strenuously to rouse the local Government from its apathy on
this point. It is a question of life and death, and I, conse-
quently, bring it prominently forward here for their notice and
consideration. An organised system of sewage removal must
be adopted; a legislative Act compelling the use of cheap
deodorisers and disinfectants should be enforced ; and not till
the local Government condescend to think on these apparently
small matters, will any real improvement in the healthiness
of the climate of Freetown take place.
The population of Freetown may be put down as 20,000. Quantity of
If the average daily quantity of excreta be, per each indivi- fæces
dual (man, woman, and child), 21 ounces of fæcal matter, i
and 40 ounces of urine, these 20,000 people excrete every twely
day 3125 lbs. of fæces, and 5000 gallons of urine; or, in a
year, 500,000 tons of solids or fæces, and 1,825,000 gallons of
urine. These figures show only the excreta for a twelvemonth
of the population of Freetown. But the cesspools are far
from being emptied yearly. Five, six, seven, eight years'
accumulation, and even more, are continually found in the
city, with little or no use of deodoriser or disinfectant; and
do these increase the health of the town and country around ?
or do they not add immeasurably to all the causes already
enumerated in making the place, as one fantastic writer has
called it, "a Golgotha and a Gehena ? "
Besides the fæcal and urinal discharge of man, there are
exposed, in various parts of the town, excrementitial discharges
of various kinds of lower animals, refuse vegetable and animal
matter in various stages of decomposition, and the blood of
animals.
The ultimate composition of the solids and fluids of sew- Ultimate
age are-phosphates, urates, ammoniacal salts, salts of potash, of sewa,

there are gaseous bodies emitted, consisting principally of
the most deadly poisons, and which form the source of

I shall now consider the conditions of the various colonies
and stations :
of.
BATHURST-RIVER GAMBIA.
Gambia, soil The geological structure of St Mary's and the countries in
its immediate neighbourhood is strictly alluvial deposit, which
must have taken place during several centuries, being brought
down by the great river which flows through the country from
the interior. Beneath this is a layer of clayey laterite. This pro-
cess of formation can at present be observed in the lands lately
rescued from the river by Colonel D'Arcy; an alluvial soil,
covered with a little sand, will be seen, and if the land be dug for
any depth, a more or less clayey substratum will be found. At
a short distance from the surface the soil is very moist, except
during the hot weather, when the powerful rays of the sun dry
everything, and the temperature becomes very hot. In some
parts, such as the Cape, the soil is more clayey, and contains a
small quantity of iron ; but the alluvium is generally of a sili-
cious nature.
Far in the interior countries of the Gambia the soil is com-
posed of clay, which in the hot season becomes very hard ; in
many places the soil is composed of the debris of soft red sand-
stones ; in other places, especially near the river, it is wholly
composed of alluvium, with a clayey stratum beneath. The
Island of M-Carthy's, formed by the bifurcation of the river
Gambia on its course through the country, has an alluvial soil,
intermixed with dense clay, which during the hot season be-
comes so dense and stiff that the roads appear to be macadam-
ised. The soil contains some quantity of magnesia or lime in
its composition, with a small quantity of iron. The rocks are
principally of red sandstone, but farther in the interior, and at
the falls, they consist of a conglomeration of gravels, made to
adhere together by the intervention of clay under very great
pressure, and are of very recent formation. These conglome-

rates are easily crumbled into their original parts by very
slight force.
In the interior countries, from Vintaug Creek, through
Tendabah to as far as Sulubalong, the rocks consist of clay.
intermixed with a small quantity of sand, but generally they
are in greath depth. I saw specimens from the wells at Bye
and near Tendabah. In these regions I have also picked up
broken pieces of rough sandstone, containing large quantities
of silicate and iron; these must have occupied important
strata in the configuration of the soil. Mungo Park, in his
travels in the interior, gives an account of an extensive stratum
of quartz in the interior of Senegal, in the country of Mand-
ing, about which gold is found. This corresponds with the
stratification of the countries of the Gold Coast and those
along the Kong Mountains in Soudan.
These are conditions which do not speak well for the
healthiness of this station. The alluvium with laterite is well
known to be very malarious in its nature, and, consequently, it
is no wonder that the Gambia Station, as well as that in the
interior—M'Carthy's Island—should be so unhealthy. The
country is plentifully supplied with water, which is obtained
from creeks, or by digging at some distance from the surface.
At St Mary's water is obtained by digging a short distance from
the surface; but it is very unwholesome and very brackish.
During the dry season the river water is very clear and whole-
some at some distance in the interior; but during the rains it
passes through the country with such velocity and force,
receiving tributaries from various parts, and the natural drains
from the whole of the country, caused by the heavy rain, that
it is very muddy and unwholesome, unless allowed to settle,
and then passed through a drip stone.
We have seen that sandy soils which contain clay a few feet
from the surface, and are always kept moist by the evaporation
which is continually going on from the moist clay below, are
very malarious and unhealthy, fever of the intermittent and
remittent type being very common in the region. St Mary's

has this kind of soil, and the clay is continually kept moist by
a sort of subterranean current from the river, but its unhealthi-
ness is very much checked by being covered with the bahama
grass.
The soil is generally cleared once a-year by burning, and
left exposed to the powerful heat of the sun, which dries and
cakes it. It is under cultivation only for four months in the
year, viz., from June to September, but some plants do
not come to perfection before the end of October and No-
vember.
There is no proper system of cultivation adopted; it con-
sists only in raising the earth with the common hoe, just
sufficient to cover the seed. No ploughing is to be seen any-
where, and the soil is not raised to any great depth so as to
allow the sun to decompose the materials necessary for fertili-
sation. The farmers are perfectly ignorant of agricultural
botany, and do not change their crops in order that each might
take from the soil the different inorganic matter which it con-
tains, according to the nature of the plant. When the soil is
deprived of nutrient material, they do not keep up its fertility
by artificial means—by manure, but shift their ground and
cultivate new pieces.
The cultivation is very limited, and consists principally of
rice, Indian and Guinea corn, ground nuts, and a few vegetables.
The population of British Gambia is very small, but it is
surrounded by large tribes, who occupy small towns of mud
huts scattered over the whole of the country.
The drainage of St Mary's is excellent, and consists of mason
work, plastered on the sides, and of great durability. Through
the indefatigable exertions of Colonel D'Arcy, the late governor,
this great work is fast approaching a rapid completion. The
drain passes through the centre of the streets, but, unfortunately,
it is not covered. Of the condition of the main drain, Colonel
D'Arcy in 1864 said, that through the able and zealous
exertions of the acting Colonial engineer, it has considerably
advanced. "It is nicely faced, of good depth, and acts well.

It is nearly half way completed. When the facing reaches the
Box Bar, or large sluice gate, it will be a most important public
work carried out. The fall is so very trifling that the water
flows only by its own weight. The drain acts somewhat slug-
gishly after the masonry is left behind." He advises the con-
tinuance of facing the sides and flooring with bricks, as the
level will thus be increased, and the water be made to flow
quicker. This, I think, should be more quickly attended to, as
the exchequer of the colony is now healthy. It is frightful
after the rains to see the centre of the town, where was formerly
the race-course; there is always an extensive sheet of water
for half a mile, which the sluggish drain could not remove.

to run through. There are during and after the rains stagnant
pools and considerable swamps everywhere, which, by proper
drainage, can be made to empty into the river. There vegetable
and animal matters become decomposed, and give out very
deleterious odours.
At St Mary's there are a few public privies for the Public water-
common people and travellers, but the respectable inhabitants
use private water-closets. Of the former Colonel D'Arcy
wrote :-"In 1859 my first measure was to erect a public
privy on the beach, contiguous to the market-place, for the
convenience of the numerous travellers from the mainland,
who so constantly arrived here for the purpose of trade and
other lawful occasions. Subsequently, and at intervals, I
erected three other similar buildings; their localities are well
chosen, not the least smell is ever detected; but I grieve to
confess that the smell of the great privy is constantly com-
plained of." He considers the smell to proceed from the
slaughter-house, and not from this flushed privy.
He recommended the following improvements to be
made :-
First, To convert the present slaughter-house into a depôt
for the market women to house their valuables at night.

Second, To change the great privy into a slaughter-house.
Third, To erect a necessary opposite the Mission Boat-
house, on wooden piles, in the sea, so that the soil may be
carried away by the ebb tide.
The soil of the Gambia is dark, and contains a good deal of
organic matter.
I have before stated that Colonel D'Arcy had reserved a
large tract of land from the marshy Pontine Swamp, which
surrounds the town of Bathurst. He has, by dividing the land
into lots and selling them, brought a large sum to the colonial
chest; but this exposed alluvium, on which the population
cast all the debris and filth of the town, so as to make it solid
and prevent the rain from flooding it, will for years form a
great source of the most virulent form of malarious poison.
The physical, intellectual, and social degradation which the
inhabitants occupying the neighbourhood of this marsh are
subject to, might justly be compared with the condition of the
inhabitants in the insalubrious localities of the true Pontine
Marshes of classic Italy, as described by Montfalcon :-
"An inhabitant of La Bresse [sic Bathurst, especially of
European extraction] suffers from birth, and exhibits from the
first days of existence a deep impression of the unhealthiness
of the climate. Scarcely has he quitted the bosom of his
nurse than he languishes and gets thin. A yellow tint tinges
his skin and eyes, the viscera become engorged, and he probably
dies before he has attained his seventh year; or if he attains
this age, he does not live, but vegetates; he continues cachectic
and ædematous. Subject to putrid and malignant fevers, to
endless autumnal remittents, to passive hæmorrhages, to ulcers
of the extremities, which heal with great difficulty, the miser-
able being is scarcely able to fight against the diseases which
convert his life into a prolonged dying. Having, perhaps,
arrived at his twentieth or thirtieth year, disorganisation com-
mences, his faculties become enfeebled, and generally the age
of fifty years is the conclusion of his days. We do not live,'

a region, " We do not live—we die.'"*
SIERRA LEONE.
Sierra Leone.
The soil of Sierra Leone is composed principally of red clay, Soil of
having a large quantity of iron in its composition. This is
characteristic of Freetown, the capital. In the mountain it is
composed of the disintegration of dark and blue granitic rocks,
which are found abundantly in their elevated hills. At Water-
loo, Hastings, and Wellington, in some places the soil consists
of black alluvial loam, which are deposits from the Sierra Leone
River and the several rivulets which join it. Towards the
Cape, Aberdeen, and the countries around, the soil is alluvial
beneath, but covered with sand.
Specimens of soil from Sierra Leone, examined by the late
Professor John Bowman, of King's College, London, prove that
it contains large quantities of oxide of iron. The following is
the result of the different specimens examined :-
No. 1 contains 8.84 per cent. of oxide of iron.

out-crops of which are found behind Government House or
Fort Thornton; and by the disintegration of these iron rocks,
by the constant action of the sun and other atmospheric influ-
ences, the soil is highly impregnated with iron. Besides the
ferruginous rocks, there are the black and blue granite, which
are extensively scattered in the lofty and conical hills behind
Freetown, and in every part of the colony; they are hard and
compact, composed of augite and felspar, with quantities of
magnetic or titanic iron; they are excellent for building for-
tifications, and Fort Thornton, or Government House Battery,
and East Street Battery, are constructed with then. We find
next extensive strata of hard red sandstone in every part
of Freetown, and of the colony generally. They are used prin-
cipally for building purposes, and resist for a considerable
time the action of the elements. Some of these red sandstones
in certain localities are softer than others; they present dif-
ferent hues also, being very dark red or light red. In some
localities a fine white sandstone, not of very compact texture,
is to be seen. A specimen exists now in the out-crop through
the water-course at Kissy Road Bridge.
In 1845 the following replies to questions were sent through
Sir Charles Trevelyan to Sir Ranald Martin, from the Medical
Department of the colony :-
Question 1. What is the geological character of the soil in
and round the settlement ?
Answer. Above high-water mark, red earth ; below high-
water mark, black mud; flats and valleys, black earth.
Question 2. Does ferruginous or red sandstone prevail, or
red earth?
Answer. Red earth ; red sandstone in the strata (used for
building) underneath. Occasionally large blocks and some
strata of blue granite (now used in building).
Question 3. Is the soil of the most unhealthy stations of a
ferruginous nature ?
Answer. I have never heard any one station in this colony
called less healthy than another.

FERRUGINOUS SOILS UNHEALTHY.
123
Question 4. Does the soil of the valleys or flats partake of
the ferruginous character ?
Answer. Yes.
Question 5. Do the low lands emit any offensive gases or
smells, and if so, at what period of the twenty-four hours ?
Answer. The mud by the river bank smells when exposed
to the sun at ebb tide.
Question 6. Does magnetic iron exist, and if so, is the varia-
tion of the compass affected by it?
Answer. Yes.
Question 7. Has the nature of the soil in general, or of
the most unhealthy localities in particular, been chemically
analysed ?
Answer by Dr Fergusson. So far as I know there has not
been any minute analysis of the soil of this colony beyond the
general one, that the soil is ferruginous, gravelly in some
parts, loanny in others, in others sandy, but in all ferruginous.
The red soil of Freetown, and of the hilly portion of the
colony, possess very little organic material, or none at all,
because the effect of the iron in its composition is to decompose
or dissipate these noxious substances, which are the essential
source of disease; but on account of the great mortality of this
part of the coast, and judging from other evidences, Sir Ranald
Martin advanced the theory long ago, that ferruginous soils Ferruginous
are most unhealthy, and explains, that in certain climates and healthy.
localities the decomposition of the organic material by the iron,
together with the magnetic phenomena elicited by heat and
other agents, may lead to development of disease, especially
fever.
In the case of Freetown, as well as in the occurrence of
fever on board the " Albert," within a short distance of the ferru-
ginous sandstone red cliff of Iddah in the Niger, during the
expedition up that river, we might easily explain the source of
this paroxysmal visitation independently of the composition of
the soil. I have throughout the preceding chapters endea-
voured to bring to light all those causes which lead to the
soils un-

constant development of fever in Freetown; the ferruginous
and gravelly soil is very dry, contains little or no organic
matter in its composition, and is elevated for the most part in
every direction. Malaria cannot easily be generated from the
soil itself, except in those marshy spots already described. It
is favourable in every respect as a healthy soil. The "Albert"
having passed through the swampy delta of the Niger to the
interior, amidst all the swamp and mud alone, its whole water
course cannot be expected to escape the effects of malaria
which is constantly generated from it; its manifestation opposite
the ferruginous high land of Iddah is no proof that the nature
of the soil was the immediate cause. From a careful examina-
tion of several ferruginous soils in intertropical Africa, and
from tracing out all those causes which are likely to lead to
development of disease in those localities, I am led to deny the
theory that ferruginous soils are unhealthy, or that they are
productive of disease, especially fever, and hold, on the con-
trary, they are the most healthy soils in the tropics, all other
things being equal, and would strongly recommend their selec-
tion in cases of cantonment or sites for building.
Sherbro, soil The soil at Sherbro and the new station at Quiah consists of
alluvial deposits, intermixed with clay; it is in some parts of
a dark loamy character, rich in organic material; the country
is level, but swampy during the rains, and covered with vege-
tation.
Cultivation. The cultivation of the soil, although it is not systematically
carried out, is more constant than in most parts of the coast
during the rains, and, in fact, at any time of the year the
markets are plentifully supplied with excellent vegetables of
every kind. The soil is generally poor and barren, but manure
of cow dung and other substances are employed to enrich it.
But there are no extensive plantations in Sierra Leone itself,
except in its neighbourhood, where in Bulum, Mallacowrie, and
the Scarcies, extensive rice and ground-nut farms are in cul-
tivation during most part of the year. In the market of Free-
town are to be obtained oranges, limes, pine-apples, coffee, yam,

The population of Sierra Leone is from 40,000 to 50,000 ; Population.
the capital is Freetown, which numbers one-half the whole
population, over 20,000; the interior villages are very thinly
inhabited. In 1808 Sierra Leone was made a depot for negroes
taken out of slave-ships. In 1811 its population was 4500,
half of whom were liberated Africans. In 1833 the popula-
tion was 29,764, and in 1861 it was 42,000. In every part of
the coast emigrants from Sierra Leone are to be found. Be-
tween June 1812 and January 1833 the number of slaves
liberated there was 27,167.
In 1863 Governor Hill, in his report with reference to the Drainage.
several classes of colonists at Sierra Leone, said "that effective
water-courses have been made throughout Freetown and its
precincts; drainage has been extensively improved, and thus
many causes of disease are prevented." I have looked in vain
for these improved drains so described, and I can say that
there are no good drains to be found anywhere; in the
civilised acceptation of the word, there are neither drain-pipes
nor water-pipes. Freetown being elevated, there is a natural
drainage from the water seeking its own level; there are open
gutters produced by digging the earth on either side of the
main road, without any mason work, and the heavy rains of
the rainy season wash the filth from the surface, accumulated
during the past dry season, into these so-called open drains,
from which they are carried to the river. If the quantity of
rain is small, as in the beginning and after the rains, these
filthy decomposing matters are kept constantly in the open
gutters in front of each dwelling house, and not having suffi-
cient water for their removal, they become the foci of epide-

mics, presenting the very conditions which are necessary for
the nursery epidemics of fever, &c.; but the local Government
have not thought it time to have a well-organised sanitary ad-
ministration, and well-organised sanitary police : the climate,
therefore, must be the scape-goat for the neglect, and we
must say, like Sir Charles Napier, that "the effects of man's
imprudence are attributed to climate; if a man gets drunk, the
sun has given him a headache, and so on." As in Delhi, so
must we say of Freetown, "every garden, if not kept clean, be-
comes a morass, weeds flourish, filth runs riot, and the
grandest city in India [sic Africa] has the name of being in-
salubrious, although there is nothing evil about it that does
not appear to be of man's own creation."
Water, in the form of springs, is abundant in various parts of
Freetown, and the quality is pure and excellent. It is the best
to be obtained in all the West Coast, but there are no water-
pipes to conduct it into the various public places where it is
mostly required. It is not conducted into the buildings of the
town, nor is it used for any sanitary purpose. The people
cannot do these things, but the local Government can do them.
Freetown requires good water supply, drainage, paving, and
thorough cleansing, proper and approved healthy plans of
building; and, as Miss Nightingale says of India, so I say of
Freetown—the work is urgent. Every day it is left undone
adds its quota of inefficiency and death-rate to the Europeans
and its thousands of native population. The danger is common
to Europeans and to natives. Many of the best men Sierra
Leone ever had have fallen victims to the same causes of
disease which have destroyed the native population. And
so it will be till the local Government has fulfilled its vast
responsibilities towards the population, who are no longer
strangers and foreigners, but subjects of Her Majesty the
Queen.
There are no public water-closets, as we find in the Gambia,
and the private ones, as we have seen, are never, or very
seldom, emptied; and during the drying process, after the

rains, they become the most pernicious source of disease. It is
about the commencement of the south-western monsoon, when
the drying process has been continued for some time, and the
mountains prevent the wind from removing from the town
the noxious vapour that is exhaled from sewers and other
fever-producing sources, which now become intensified in their
operation, and become so many foci for pernicious develop-
ment, that in March and April the cry of epidemic visitation,
as evidenced by the number of deaths amongst Europeans and
native population, rings yearly from one corner of the town to
the other.

sists principally of the decomposition of granite and felspathic
rocks. There are here and there to be found volcanic scoriæ
undergoing various degrees of decomposition.
"There is very little difference in the soil along the coast,"
says Dr Tedlie, " from Cape Palmas to the River Volta. Within
four or five rniles from the shore it is of a silicious nature; the
clumps of hills, which are to be met with in every direction, are
composed of gneiss and granite; mica is found to enter into the
composition of some. The rocks, from containing large pro-
portions of felspar and mica, are rapidly passing into decom-
position ; such, more especially, as are exposed to the influence
of the air, rain, and water. The result of this decomposition
is the foundation of the argillaceous clay. On receding from
the sandy shore the soil is silicious, mixed only with some
decayed animal and vegetable matter, where no granite or
micaceous rocks intervene. It is in the valleys that the rich
alluvial soils are to be found, formed of decomposed materials
of the surrounding hills, washed down by the heavy torrents
of rain, which are deposited with the matter of vegetable de-
composition, and afford great richness to the original mould."
In some of the hills the soil is composed of red earth con-
taining, in minute subdivision, ferruginous hornblende; the

hills rise from abrupt bases, and are in a great many cases
conical above; in other places the soil consists of a dark rich
loam, highly charged with organic materials as well as the dis-
integration of the felspathic rocks which form the principal
strata. In Ahanta, and in all the Gold Coast to as far as
Winnebah, the principal varieties of rocks are decidedly of
igneous origin, being chiefly made up of trappean and meta-
morphic rocks, interspersed amongst which are rocks of the
Silurian and Devonian systems.
"The trappean rocks occur in connection with the stratified
formation in disruptive masses ; they are principally compact
hard basalt, augitic in composition, and impregnated with a
small quantity of iron ; amongst them are also a good number
of rocks which are felspathic in character, viz., the diorites.
These, from their composition, viz., of augite and felspar, pre-
sent a brighter appearance than the black basalt.
"The metamorphic rocks, which have undergone a very
striking metamorphosis in the original sedimentary character
of thin strata, are chiefly quartzose rocks and gneiss. The latter
is very common in Ahanta and Fantee. They are tough, hard,
and crystalline, and composed of quartz, mica, felspar, and
hornblende, having curved and flexured lines of stratification.
The quartzose rocks are granular, and present a more deter-
mined stratification than the gneiss; they sometimes have
bands of conglomerate structure and beds of mica flakes. The
gneiss and quartzose rocks are hypothetically believed to be the
product of the disintegration of granite rocks."*
Interspersed and lying in close proximity with the beds of
these quartzes, especially at Anamaboe and Cape Coast, are fine
conglomerate sandstones, which are used for building by the
natives; these lie in layers of considerable depth, and are
stratified. Some of the layers are very soft, and easily crumble
under the pressure of the finger, leaving a residue composed of
sand and small mica schist. These are perfectly black, speci-
mens of which are now to be seen on the water edge of Ana-

maboe. The hard variety of sandstone is black, spotted
white, which consists of varieties of composite silicates.
The quartz rocks found in this locality differ in many cases
materially from those found in Ahanta. Some are conglomer-
ates composed of gravelly silicates, which must have been fused
together under very great pressure; each gravel can with ease
be distinguished, and, if necessary, separated by the use of
force; they are united together by silicious stroma or cement.
The next variety is the common quartz, where the original
particles are not very distinct. These have undergone a greater
degree of fusion under intense heat, but not sufficient to de-
stroy or fuse the original particles. The third variety is con-
glomerate in structure, but possesses a large quantity of broad
sheets of mica and felspar, which are easily divided into
thin semitransparent plates. This variety is very common at
Anamaboe. These flakes, which contain a large quantity of
peroxide of iron, are undergoing rapid disintegration and de-
composition through the effect of the sun, the air, and the rain.
The quadrilateral space at this station is covered with the dis-
integrated particles, and during the dry season the ground seems
to be all brilliant shiny flakes, which reflect the rays of the
sun, and produce an unpleasant glare. They attract heat a
great deal, and at midday, before the south-west sea breeze
blows, the radiation from the earth is excessive.
In the argillaceous covering of the volcanic hillocks which
surround Cape Coast, lava is here and there scattered in broken Volcanic
masses. They still maintain their brilliant shiny appearance. Cava
They prove, without a doubt, that these formations were vol-
canic, and that one or more craters were in the neighbourhood,
from which these molten rocks must have had their origin.
These fragmentary lavæ are scattered in the valleys, and are
undergoing rapid disintegration by trituration and by the
action of climatic influences.
In the interior other rocks are discovered, consisting of sand-
stones with a large proportion of clay in their composition ;

they are extremely hard, especially those found in the interior
of Ahanta and Axim, and contain much oxide of iron. Some
of the rocks on the sea-shore are hard limestones, which are
characteristic of the Silurian and Devonian systems.
As is characteristic of stations where clayey and metamor-
phic rocks are greatly found, there are numerous water-courses
which present no water during the dry season, but in the rains
are filled with water, and swell into rivulets. Water is difficult
to be obtained; wells a few feet deep give brackish water.
The inhabitants live principally on tank water collected during
the rains, or obtained from swampy spots.
From Winnebah to the Volta the soil is composed of alluvial
deposit, which consists chiefly of silicious matter, oxide of iron,
and alumina. From Pram Pram to Shai, in fact all the plains
in those regions, are stiffer and harder than those near to
Accra and Christiansborg, from being mixed with a large quan-
tity of clay. During the rainy season the alluvium is covered
with vegetation, but during the dry the vegetation is burnt
down, and the soil, being exposed to the rays of the sun, be-
comes very hard. At the foot of Shai Mountain the alluvium
contains a large quantity of iron in its composition, and during
the dry season so compact is it when broken, that it resembles
a vast sheet of lava. It must be the product of disintegration
of the micaceous rocks, which are the volcanic blocks com-
posing the almost perpendicular mountain, washed down every
season by torrents of rain.
Between Accra and Christiansborg the soil consists of a
barren red clay. The rocks are-1st, A fine white sandstone,

cipally owing to the limited supply of rain and the barrenness
of the coast lands. In the interior, however, the natives work
well; but their mode of cultivating the soil is as unscientific
as in the other parts of the coast already described. There are
no extensive plantations to be seen anywhere near the sea-
coast towns, except, perhaps, in the plains of Winnebah. At
Accra, through the exertions of the Basle missionaries and Mr
Freeman, systematic plantations are in existence, which serve
as models to those parts of the coast. Several thousand coffee
trees are at present under proper cultivation. Mr Freeman
has got vines, pine apples, cotton, coffee, cabbage, &c., under
skilful and civilised management in his plantation at Beula,
which supplies Accra plentifully with green vegetables.
Of the green vegetables used on the Gold Coast by the
natives, an anonymous writer in the African Times* gives the
following :-"First, though not foremost, there is the wild cab-
bage (called by the Fantees 'Empompo'), the leaves of which
make a capital salad, or, dressed as greens, make a good substi-
tute for the savoy. It is to be had in perfection from the end
of May to the end of February, i.e., nine months in the year.
Second, the wild cucumber, little inferior, indeed, to the culti-
vated one; it makes a good salad, and eats well also stewed
with a little melted butter. Then we have the samphire, the
sea-kale, or mirenchie, growing even down to the very beach.
Purslane is also very abundant, and very wholesome, and
grows everywhere and anywhere. Spinach, also, which the
natives call kotú betlow; and the love apple (tomato), or

young corn dished up as green peas, makes a very respectable
appearance. Beans, calavanças, mazagan, and haricot; these
are to be seen daily in the market at Cape Coast, dressed up
in some native dish, but the European can get the raw article
and dress it as he pleases. The leaves of the Capsicum an-
nuum, or pepper plant, make a good salad; and when boiled
and served up as spinach, they make a very palatable dish.
Palm cabbage, which is the top or head of the palm tree; it
makes a very choice and delicious vegetable, and eats well
with fish, flesh, or fowl. There are several kinds of yams,
with as great a difference between the varieties as between the
haricot and the Windsor bean. There is the kökóé (cocoe of
the West Indies), or yam cabbage; the leaves make a good
cabbage, and are used as such by the Africans; the root re-
sembles the yam, but is more spherical, the yam being oblong ;
the flavour partakes something of a nice mealy potato, or a
roasted chestnut. The cassada, when its meal is mixed in
equal proportions of flour, makes a pastry, light, wholesome,
and easy of digestion, and well adapted for invalids. Plan-
tains, roasted, fried, or boiled, make a very good vegetable.
Bananas, when just full grown, but not yet turned to ripen-
ing, make a passable imitation of carrot. There are mushroom,
shallots, chicory, and pumpkins, all good vegetables," and can
be obtained in various quantities and quality.
The population of the Protectorate Territory of the Gold
Coast has been laid down at 400,000 souls, but there has not
been any census taken. The inhabitants occupy small towns
or villages, numbering from 40 to about 8000. In no one
town, croon, or village, so far as my experience extends, can
we find over 10,000 persons. The native huts are huddled
together, pell-mell, without any plan ; there are scarcely any
streets or proper lanes, but, as a whole, only crooked by-paths.
Cape Coast presents but a poor exception to this rule, where a
few streets properly so-called are discernible; but that con-
fused system of building, as seen in purely native towns, is
conspicuous even here.

There is no regular system of drainage on the Gold Coast ; Drainage
the country being hilly, and the quantity of rain falling in the
rainy season being small, the soil is generally dry. The native
population are very primitive in their style; they go out in the
fields, or on the sandy beach, to answer the calls of nature, and
these fæcal matters go to fertilise the soil, or are washed away by
the booming waves of the sea. The effluvia from these ochletic
poisons are extremely disagreeable, and in many cases blow
to the teeth of the town. Colonel Conran has prevented these
nuisances from being done indiscriminately in every part of
the town, and has made several public privies in the various
suitable localities in the outskirts of the town. Among the
higher classes, the use of privy cesspools, made by digging
deep into the earth, such as are found in the houses and pre-
mises at Sierra Leone, is unknown; they use closed chambers,
which are emptied into the sea once or twice every day, and are
consequently free from the reeking poison which is constantly
generated from that source. At Accra and its neighbourhood,
where there are low-lying lands, a plentiful accumulation of
water, in stagnant pools during and after the rains, always
occurs. There are no proper drains here, and the country very
much requires them.

LAGOS AND THE BIGHTS.
The several stations in the Bights of Biafra and Benin are Lagos and
composed principally of alluvium intermixed with sand. The soil of.
strip of land which runs from between the lagoon and the sea,
extending from the Volta to the Niger, and including Lagos,
had its origin primarily from immense quantities of coral
forming their beds on the border of the ocean, and gradually
raising that portion until it forms extensive reefs or breakers ;
these, by being constantly filled up with sand, debris, and
deposits from the river, and washings from the soil during the
rains, ultimately becomes rescued from the ocean. The sand is
porous and white, and allows the accumulation of surface
water, and during the rains forms beds for the swamps. "The

formation of land," says Dr Rowe, "is well shown in these
lagoons, and may be traced through all its stages, in ascending
scale, from the first step in the process to the existence of solid
land. Not unfrequently, from the same point in clear water in
the middle of the current, we see the growths from the bottom
which perform the first step in the process; next to them,
water lilies and other floating plants on the surface; long
grasses come next as we approach the bank, and when once
these have gained a footing, the work of solidification proceeds
rapidly. Acres of shallow water are grown over with this grass,
and from its margin, by the force of the current and the rise of
water-level during the rainy season, are detached large masses,
forming floating islands." This is a fair description of the
surface formation; but the groundwork must be looked for to
the incessant working of the madrepore corals, centuries ago,
with which this part of the coast abounds. In the interior,
the soil consists in some parts of dark clay, whilst in others,
the clay is red; large blocks of granite are to be found in
several places, and in most parts the soil is ferruginous. The
inhabitants of this part of the coast, especially those in
Yorouba, are very industrious, and cultivate extensively the
land. Plantain, banana, papaw, oranges, limes, custard apples,
mangoes, guavas, cashew nuts, pine apples, melons, and small
cucumbers or ghirkins, tomatoes, onions, garlic, water-cresses,
various kinds of spinach, bread fruits and bread nuts, edible
yam, cassada (from which farina is made), pumpkins, maize,
and small Chili pepper, sugar cane, are all to be obtained in
large quantities in this part. "The vegetable productions
adapted for supplies to the troops are maize, the Indian corn
of the country, rice of good quality, yams, and cassada. The
corn is used entirely by the natives. It is found cheaper to
import flour than to buy and grind the corn. The natives, for
use, soften it in water, beat it in a wooden mortar, and after
boiling the pulp, which has been carefully separated from the
husks, eat it either dry as a paste, or boiled up into gruel. It
forms the morning meal of the population. It is a very

wholesome dish, but tastes a little acid from the fermentation
which has taken place in the corn while soaking to soften.
The meal of cassada, or cassava root, is the staple food of the
natives. It is carefully prepared by washing, drying, and
roasting, and is mixed, before eating, with hot water, when it
swells into a mass. It is generally eaten warm, and with such
vegetables, palm oil, fish, or meat, as their means permit.
Meat is a luxury but seldom indulged in, except by the
wealthier. Smoked fish are used largely; they are simply
exposed, in an earthen pot with a few holes in it, to the smoke
of a wood fire." The inhabitants are scattered all over the
country in small towns, except in Abeokuta, where the popu-
lation has lately increased to 100,000. In Ibadan the popu-
lation is also large, but in all the other towns it ranges from
100 to 8000. The natives live in low mud huts, with thatched Native huts.
roofs, with a well-worked, hardened mud floor. Each hut has a
verandah before and behind it. They are built in groups on
four sides, enclosing a quadrangular space. The huts are
generally kept very clean.
The drainage of the country around is most imperfect. In Drainage
fact, there is no drain whatever. During the rains the water
freely accumulates in different parts, and is left to be dried up
by the sun, which by no means improves the healthy condition
of the place. The sewage is scattered all over the town and
streets, consisting of the excrement of men and animals, and
increased by the filthy habits of pigs, which are let loose every-
where here. The effluvia from it is very sickening and destruc-
tive, and consequently the inhabitants are very short lived.
Lagos and Abeokuta are greatly in advance in these respects.
In most of the towns the streets are narrow and very crooked,
but here and there in the outskirts, in open spaces, shaded by
numerous cocoa-nut plants, men, women, and children may be
seen parading about.

SEWAGE DEODORISERS AND DISINFECTANTS.
Various substances have been used to prevent the decompo-
sition of sewage, and check the ammoniacal compounds gene-
rated from it; and for the benefit of the inhabitants who
would like to destroy the evil results arising from their privy
cesspools, I shall here detail them :-
1. Quicklime and Water.—These should be added until
a deposit takes place, and a clear supernatant fluid remains.
Here the lime, by combining with phosphoric and carbonic
acids, forms insoluble salts of lime, which are carried down, and
ammonia set free. The liquid contains salts of potash and
organic matter, which after a time becomes decomposed. To
one gallon of sewage add always sixteen of quicklime. This
is a process which is easily performed in tropical Africa, and
which should be enforced by legislation.
2. Dry Earth.- When perfectly dry it answers well mecha-
nically, especially when marl or clay is used; but it soon
loses its power by being clogged.
3. Charcoal.—This produces effects similar to dry earth.
Animal charcoal is the best, and then peat.
4. Cheap Salts of alumina and then lime; or Manning's
process--alum sludge, lime, and waste animal charcoal. Stotherts
process consists in the addition of zinc and charcoal. This is
a more expensive process.
5. Sulphites of lime and magnesia in combination with
products from tar, impure carbolic (or Phenic Acid), forming
carbolates of lime and magnesia.—This is M'Dougall's patent,
and is sold in liquid and powder. It is one of the best
disinfectants that could be used for sewage.
6. Superphosphate of magnesia and lime-water, or Blyth's
patent.—This is very expensive, and practically not of very
great use.


## p. 137 (#161) ############################################

DEODORISERS AND DISINFECTANTS.
137
7. Perchloride of Iron.-This is one of the best disinfectants
that could be used for sewage. When added to it, the car-
bonate of ammonia precipitates rapidly peroxide of iron, which
carries down with it the suspended matter, leaving a clear fluid
above. Both this fluid and the deposit are perfectly free from
odour. The sulphuretted hydrogen is deposited in the form
of sulphuret of iron.
Besides the above, other substances may be required to purify
the air, but which are too expensive to be used in sewage.
8. Lanaude's Disinfectant consists of solutions of permanga-
nate of potash, chloride of zinc, nitrate of lead, and perchloride of
iron, and a mixture of sulphate of zinc and sulphate of copper.-
Its effect is limited.
9. Ledoyen's Fluid, or nitrate of lead, is composed of litharge,
1 lb.; strong nitric acid, 7 oz.; and water, 2 galls. It acts
rapidly, and with certainty.
10. Burnett's Disinfectant Fluid, or chloride of zinc, is a very
powerful substance, one part of which should be added to
eight parts of water when about to be used. Each fluid
drachm of the disinfectant contains 25 grains. It destroys
organic matter and ammoniacal compounds.
11. Condy's Fluid.-A process by which the permanganate
of potash or soda gives off oxygen ; its chief constituent, there-
fore, is "condensed oxygen." It is a most powerful deodoriser
and disinfectant; it is not poisonous, nor evolves any noxious
smell. It destroys organic matter powerfully and rapidly, and
has an immediate effect in decomposing ammoniacal com-
pounds. According to Professsor Hoffmann, if the permanga-
nate of soda is placed in the mouth, it takes away or destroys
the odour of tobacco. Added to impure water, especially
when travelling in the tropics, it purifies it at once, and there-
fore should be more generally used.
12. Chlorine. This is one of the most powerful deodorisers
we have; it decomposes sulphite of ammonia and sulphuretted
hydrogen rapidly, blanches organic pigments, and destroys
organic odours.


## p. 138 (#162) ############################################

138
CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY OF WESTERN AFRICA.
Preparation of Chlorine.—Mix two tablespoonfuls of com-
mon salt and two of red lead with one quart of water; stir
them well, and then gradually add half a wineglassful of sul-
phuric acid. Chlorine is evolved, and absorbed by the water,
from which it is slowly given out, and might be kept in a stop-
pered bottle or jar, and left open when required to be used.
13. Nitrous Acid, or hyponitrous acid of some authors.-It
has a most powerful effect on organic matter, and deodorises
perfectly. Its odour is irritating to the lungs, and in some
persons might cause headache, nausea, and vomiting. The
simplest way of preparing it, is to add a bit of copper in nitric
acid, and a little water.
14. Iodine Vapour.–Place a small quantity on a hot plate.
Sulphurous acid.-By burning sulphur. Vinegar and am-
monia. These three substances are of more or less value.
15. Ozone.—This is the most efficient deodoriser and disin-
fectant we have. It destroys all oxidisable mephitic emana-
tions and miasmatic exhalations. It is supplied by nature;
of how it can be artificially prepared, and some account of its
property, I shall hereafter speak.
Suggestions to the Sierra Leone Government for effectually re-
moving its Sewage, and consequently removing one of the most
pernicious causes of the disease in the colony.
1. The first movement should be a legislative Act, making
it compulsory on all owners or dwellers of houses to have their
privy cesspools emptied once or twice every year, under the
immediate supervision of the Government; and if once-a-year,
it should be done in the month of November.
2. That the fæces and urine, or the sewage, be removed from
the privies, and collected in proper carts provided by the
Government for that express purpose, under the superinten-
dence of the Officer of Health or his subordinates.
3. That, as the water-closets are made as I have above de-
scribed, the dry process shall be the only means employed for
the removal of the sewage which they contain.


## p. 139 (#163) ############################################

SUGGESTIONS FOR REMOVAL OF SEWAGE.
139
The contents of the cesspool should first be mixed, in suffi-
cient quantity, with one of the disinfectants or deodorisers
named above. Lime, charcoal, or M'Dougall's patent (car-
bolates of lime and magnesia), will be found very expensive,
and consequently I should recommend that surface earth, con-
sisting of clayey or marly soil, should be well dried and baked
in an oven, and thrown into the water-closets in sufficient
quantity to precipitate the solid constituents, and dry up the
liquid. The hardened solid material should be removed into
the Government cart, and thence into poudretta manufactories,
or conveyed at once to the soil. Mixed with dried clay, the
sewage becomes an excellent fertilising manure, which might
be sold to farmers, or employed in the model-farm already
recommended to the Government.
4. In process of time, the Government might recommend,
and see carried out, especially in houses in the centre of the
town, a standard form for water-closets, by which the sewage
might be very easily removed—something like what was pro-
posed in 1858 by the Bengal Government.
5. That owners of houses be made to pay a small tax, if
found necessary, towards this cleaning, and the Government
should principally employ the numerous prisoners who infest
the jail of Freetown for this purpose.
That Sierra Leone is groaning under a want of material sani- Necessity for
tary reforms, and that within the last few years the health for
of the colony has deteriorated in a marked degree, may be Inspectors of

The Observer, of August 2, 1866 :-
"This colony, we are sorry to state, has not improved with
respect to its health. Fevers and dysentery are still known
amongst us, but we employ little or no means to get rid of them.
Unwholesome meat is still sold in butchers' stalls, and paraded
about the town for sale; there is no inspector of stock, or of
meat, or of markets. A board of health is unknown to us, and
sanitary inspectors more so."
With these facts before us, the editor asks, " Can there be
sanitary re-
market and

any surprise that fever and dysentery visit the colony ?" "The
present state of the butchers' market," he observes, "is most
disreputable; the building is quite dilapidated, and the stalls
where the meat is exposed for sale are most filthy. There is not
the slightest convenience in these stalls; and what is worse than
all, water is not accessible." The consequence is that they are
never washed, and the quantity of dirt and filth accumulated
in them is such as to shock the nerves. "The malaria
arising from the quantity of filth must, as a matter of course,
not only infect the meat, but must be injurious to health."
The public have no guarantee that the animals killed are in
good health and condition. The cattle plague has been busy
amongst the herds in the colony, but "there are no inspectors
to inspect and look over the beasts slain. Why could not a
diseased animal be imported into the market, killed, and sold ?
Again, in the butchers' market the stalls are quite exposed ;
there are no doors; and a butcher who cannot sell his meat
during the day takes it home, or to any unwholesome plaee for
the night; carries it again next day to his stall, and exposes it
for sale. It may be that at his residence yellow fever or any
contagious disease reigns; it follows then that the meat
becomes also infected, and passing into the possession of
another, the disease, whatever it may be, is carried into another
house, place, or locality."
Dilating on the injurious effects of filthy dwellings, he con-
tinues :"What can be more pernicious to life than filthy
dwellings and stagnant pools? The former are numerous in
this town ; indeed, even in the middle of the city the yards of
several houses are in a most detestable condition. The latter
are frequently seen in streets and roads not quite familiar to
business men, and where the poor are in general congregated.
Now, I ask, should there not be regular sanitary inspectors, not
only to visit yards, and to see that they are kept clean, but also
to inspect streets, roads, and lanes ?" He predicts, without a
question, that the health of the colony would be greatly im-
proved if an inspector of markets and stock be also appointed.

winds.
ONE of the most important phenomena in the consideration of Effects of
physical climate is the prevailing winds. By them the tempera-
ture of the atmosphere is properly adjusted—the dryness and
humidity increased or diminished—clouds gather or disperse
water produced by evaporation from the seas and oceans
transported into interior of continents—noxious vapours and
emanations are dissipated or made innoxious—and perfect venti-
lation in an otherwise close and sultry atmosphere is obtained.
Winds are currents of air like those in water, produced by un- How pro-
equal heating, and by the tides and currents of the sea and Trade winds.
rivers. Within the tropics, beneath the vertical rays of the sun,
the air becomes rarefied, and made specifically lighter by the
heat, and ascends far above; the colder and heavier air of the
poles rushes towards the tropics in a perpendicular manner
to supply the place of the heated equatorial air which has
ascended. About 5000 or 6000 feet above the surface the
heated air begins to recondense, and flows towards the poles.
"The rotation, however, of the earth on its axis from west to east,
deflects (on account of the increased velocity of the parallels of
latitude near the equator, which have greater radii than the
arctic parallels) the currents of polar air from their northern
and southern course, and produces on the north side of the
equator a north-easterly current, and on the south side of the
equator a south-easterly current—both of which, as they ap-
proach the equator, gradually become more nearly parallel to

it, or east." To these currents writers on meteorology have
given the name of trade-winds.
The equatorial currents, on their polar direction, take a
westerly direction from the same cause, viz., the earth's rota-
tion on its axis, until they become nearly west. They are
called the upper or returning trade-winds; and the west-south-
west, or westerly winds form the counter currents of the tropical
east winds or trade-winds.
But the north-east and the south-east trade-winds do not
blow from the same degree of latitude in opposite directions,
but are separated by a space equal to about five or six degrees
in breadth, which is known as the region or zone of calms, where
rains and storms are plentiful, and where the heat is very
great, other local modifications not being taken into considera-
tion. The north-east trade-winds blow between 9° and 27° of
north latitude, and consequently from Scarcies and Matacong,
north of Sierra Leone to Cape Bojador, near Teneriffe, and
about 19° north of Portendie, including Isle de Loss, Pongas,
Nunez, Bularma, the countries under the Gambia and Senegal
· Governments. The south-east trade-wind blows between 3°
north latitude and 25° south latitude, including the Gaboons,
Fernando Po, Ascension, St Thomas, St Helena, Congo, and St
Paul de Loango. The zone of calms is occupied by Sierra
Leone, Liberia, the Ivory Coast or Grand Bassam, the whole of
the protected territory of the Gold Coast, Awoonah, Dahomy,
Lagos and the Yoruba countries, Benin, Egbo, Calabar, Came-
roons, and the northern part of Fernando Po. Winds may be
divided into three great heads, viz., constant, periodical, and
variable. Their variations are produced by many causes, viz.,
by large extent of country—by the greater heat caused by re-
flection of land-by mountains-by the alternate heat and cold
of seasons—and by rains. In India the year is divided into two
halves by periodic winds, which have been designated the
monsoons, which blow for six months in one direction, and
then six months in the other. The monsoon is only a modifi-
cation of the trade-winds, occasioned by its being disturbed in its

course by the large tracts of land presented by Africa and Asia,
and by mountains; and to keep the equilibrium of the atmo-
sphere, the wind takes opposite direction for six months, instead
of blowing from east to west. From 10° to 23° south latitude,
there being no land to disturb the wind, it blows constantly
from east and south-east ; but from 10° northwards to the
equator, from October to April, north-west winds blow, and from
April to October, south-west. North of the equator, to the tropic
of cancer, a change takes place ; south-west winds blow from
April to October, and north-east winds from October to April.
"The south-west rainy monsoon, the most remarkable of our
periodical winds," writes Sir Ranald Martin, "begins on the
Malabar Coast in May, and reaches Delhi by the end of
June, extending to the north-eastern parts of Affghanistan,
but greatly modified. It prevails more in the mountains than
the flats of the Punjaub. The hills and valleys of Cashmere
have their share of it, and it gradually loses itself westward in
the valley of Peshawur, where it appears only in clouds and
showers. On the Coromandel coast it is retarded, the clouds
brought by the south-west winds being detained by the
Ghauts. It reaches Bengal by the 15th of June." In the
latitude of 111° on the coast of Malabar, the rains are very
plentiful, being not less than 123-5 inches in the year, and this
is produced by the arrest of the south-west monsoon by the
mountains, and the accumulation of vapour occasioned by it.
As soon as the sun passes the southern hemisphere the direc-
tion of the monsoon is at once altered. "The mass of air which
had been accumulated during the hot season and rains on the
central platform of Asia, now bestirs itself, and moves towards
the regions south of the equator, where the atmosphere has
been dilated and dissipated by the solar heat." Over most
parts of the Indian Ocean—the central platform lying to
the north-east the monsoon proceeds from the same direc-
tion, viz., north-east. In the seas of China, Borneo, New
Guinea, and Java, it blows from north and north-west from
their position to the central platform. In Assam and Behar

the prevalent winds are east and west ; in South Bengal,
north and south.
In the consideration of the prevailing winds of Western Africa,
we have to divide the whole western course into three great sec-
tions, viz., the first, that portion which lies within the north-
eastern trade winds, i.e., from lat. 9° north to lat, 14° 44' north ;
the second, within the zone of calms, from lat. 3° north to lat. 9°
north; and the third, from lat. 3° north to lat. 0.36' 10" south.
In the first section, including the Casamanza, the Gambia,
and Senegal, the winds divide the year into two portions,
exactly as the monsoon of the Indian Ocean. The first com-
mences in October, and terminates in the end of April. During
this portion of the year the wind blows from the east and north-
east for the most part; occasionally only the sea breeze from the
south-west blows in the afternoon. At the commencement of
this monsoon, or the breaking up of the south-west monsoon,
storms and tornadoes are frequent, and the wind fixes to the
east and north-east, when it blows constantly for days from
east and south-east by east, which it does in November,
December, and January. The wind is dry, cold, and accom-
panied with thick haze, forming the harmattan, of which we
shall hereafter speak. From February to April it blows a hot
wind almost constantly from north-east, occasionally inter-
rupted by the sea breeze, which is cool and refreshing. The
second portion of the year commences in April, and terminates
in October. At this time the prevailing winds are from
south-west, west, and north-west; occasionally from north-east.
These winds blow through the whole of the rainy season, and
are moist, healthy, and pleasant, and are well charged with
evaporation from the ocean over which they blow. Their com-
mencement is marked with storms and tornadoes also, but the
rains are late and not plentiful. In April and May the simoom
blows over this portion of Western Africa. It is exceedingly
hot, and destroys vegetation, and blows from every point of the
compass. Of its character I shall speak hereafter when writing
on the hot season.

region.
Sierra Leone In the second section, including Sierra Leone, Liberia,
Grand Bassam, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast (Lagos
and other places), we come to the region of variable winds;
their predominant direction is in opposition to the general
course of the trade winds, and, consequently, in a westerly
or south-westerly direction. They are subject to frequent
changes both in velocity and direction. The movements
of these winds are generally in different strata superim-
posed one upon the other. The land and sea breezes alter-
nate regularly with each other near the shore of this portion
of the continent, the sea breeze setting in between ten and
half-past twelve in the forenoon and noon, and continuing till
between five and seven; between seven and nine the land
breeze commences, and continues till between eight and ten.
The blowing of the south-west sea breeze from the quarter
where the sun has not yet travelled is a merciful providence
of the Creator to keep down the intense heat which must be
the result of the sun's action on this zone of calm, as it cools
and moistens the air, and makes it fit for habitation both for
vegetable and animal life. "The general temperature between
midnight and noon is cooler than the temperature from noon
to midnight. Towards sunrise it is a cooler time than any
other part of the twenty-four hours; and, taken at equal dis-
tances from the meridian over which the sun is passing, the
quarters over which the sun has passed are more heated than
those towards which it has been longest absent." Winds, then,
from parts where the sun has passed, as the north-east wind of
the first section, are considerably hotter than those from where
it is travelling to, as the south-west, the predominant in this
zone; and this explains why the Gambia and Senegal are
hotter than Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Gold Coast, although
these places are in the hottest zones.
I have in the second section, under the headings of
remarks, detailed the directions of the various winds found
on the coast. As the Gold Coast is the centre of this zone,
suffice that I here give its prevailing winds in the different

fore, is from a westerly direction (S.W.); and Freetown being
protected in that direction from it by its lofty chain of moun-
tain, stagnation of noxious effluvia, to a certain extent, is the
result, and its beneficial influence is lost. The north-east and
easterly winds in these regions, blowing just before sunrise, are
generally very cool and pleasant.
In the third section, including the Gaboons, a part of Lopez region.
Fernando Po, Princes' and St Thomas Islands, the north-west
and south-west winds are generally prevalent; but they are
not so constant as in the first section, but variable as in the
second. The force and velocity of winds are determined by Force of
the anemometer. The following is the result obtained by Mr winds.

The force of wind is as the square of the velocity by the
density. The velocity can be ascertained by taking the square
root of 200 times the pressure ; the pressure in pounds, or
parts of a pound, per square foot, by multiplying the velocity
for one hour by 60, and then square the hour velocity, and
multiply by .005.
The velocity of tropical tornadoes, according to Humboldt,
is in its extreme at the rate of 200 or 300 miles an hour.
According to Colonel Beaufoy, frequently, in violent storms
of wind, the current does not reach any considerable altitude.
Often there is perfect calm at the height of 1600 feet. The
converse is also true. There are many cases where winds may
be noticed at considerable distances above the surface of land
or sea, moving with great celerity, whilst the lower strata of
the atmosphere is perfectly still and tranquil, as in the account
of Hurricane in the Clouds, to be hereafter noticed.
Sir H. James, in his "Instruction for Meteorological
Observers," gives the following naval terms for expressing the
amount of wind. The velocity noted can scarcely be said to
be correct :

atmosphere
The amount or degree of atmospheric saturation depends Humidity of
entirely upon the temperature, and increases with it, but explained.
faster than the rise of the thermometer. Thus at 32° the air
is capable of absorbing 160th part of its weight in aqueous
vapours ; at 59', an 80th part; at the temperature of 86°,
which is the average heat of the afternoon in the zone of calm,
the air absorbs Lth of its weight of aqueous vapours; but
when the thermometer goes up to 113° it absorbs a 20th part.
At 68° F. a cube of air contains 252 grains of water. In
the tropics the annual evaporation exceeds that in the tem-
perate zone by from 63 to 73 inches, being from 90 to 100
inches.
The point of saturation is the maximum of aqueous Point of
vapour capable of being sustained by the atmosphere at the
time of observation, any increase of which would lead to a
deposit of dew. The temperature of the atmosphere must

always be above this point, at which dew begins to deposit;
if not, the whole surface will be enveloped in perpetual mist,
through which the sun's rays can never penetrate. In the
tropics the height of humidity is 41 miles at the equator.
It follows, then, that the greater amount of humidity in
Western intertropical Africa is in the regions between Sierra
Leone and the equator, and the least in the Gambia and
Senegal, since, as the temperature rises in arithmetical pro-
gression, the dryness of the air is accelerated in geometrical
progression. The effects of humidity, or the absence of it, on
the constitution, we shall hereafter consider. '
The dew-point, as we have before seen, is that temperature
at which the air has its maximum of saturation with moisture,
so that the least fall of temperature leads to a deposit of
moisture. It is deposited less on hills than plains, the cooling
process being more copious in the latter than in the former.
Of the method of finding the humidity and saturation of the
air, as well as the dew-point, I must refer my readers to
Chapter 1.—The Introduction. My observations on these
points are unfortunately limited, being confined principally to
the Gold Coast and Bights.

BAROMETRIC PRESSURE-OZONOMETER-AMOUNT OF CLOUD-

rinciple of.
In 1646, through the independent researches of Pascal and Barometer,
Torricelli, it was ascertained that a column of water 34 feet
high, and a column of mercury 30 inches high, each exactly
counterpoises a column of air of an equal base, extending from
the level of the sea to the summit of the atmosphere; and the
next year the former observer discovered that there exists a
distinct and constant relation between the rise and fall of the
mercury in the Torricelli instrument and the changes in the
temperature of the atmosphere, produced by rarefaction or con-
densation, by elevation or descent, each of which is dependent
on the unequal distribution of heat.
My observations on the barometric pressure in Western Period of
Africa are, unfortunately, very limited, but it appears that the and minimum
maximum height of the barometer takes place during the obs
blowing of the harniattan winds, and consequently from De-
cember to February; and the minimum during the tornado
periods, at the beginning and after the rains. The barometer
always falls at the approach of rain or wind, and begins to rise
during it. The cold, dry, dense air of the harmattan raises the
barometric column, whilst the rarefaction of the air preceding
the tornado storm depresses it. The greatest range of the
barometer in the Gambia, Senegal, and Casamanza, occurs in
the month of January; in Sierra Leone in April or May; on
but it onnons that the maximum

the Gold Coast and Lagos in September; the least range in
the first named places, in March, April, and May; in the second
and third places, in February.
It has been ascertained that for every inch which the mer-
cury in the barometer rises or falls, the boiling point of water
is increased or diminished by 1°-76; therefore, if the baro-
meter rises or falls one-tenth of an inch, there is an eleva-
tion or depression of the boiling point by 0°176 F. Mr
Fahrenheit took advantage of this to ascertain the height of
Barometer in mountains, and "he proposed, that in order to find the differ-
mountains. ence in feet between the upper and lower stations, pure water »
should be boiled in an open vessel at both stations, and the
difference of temperature at which it boils should be multi-
plied by 5:30, which will give a close approximation to the
height of the upper above the lower station. From the con-
joined temperatures of the atmosphere at the stations, 64° are
to be subtracted, and the remainder is to be multiplied by the
one-thousandth part of the height already found, to which it is
to be added. This is the correction for the difference of the
temperature at the stations. A further correction is necessary
for the figure of the earth and the latitude of the place."* This,
on the West Coast of Africa, amounts to about one foot in addi-
tion to every thousand of the calculated elevation.
As an example, let us imagine water to boil at the level of
the sea opposite Freetown at 212° F., and at a height by the
side of Sugar-Loaf Mountain at 210°. The temperature at the
sea level being 84°, and that at the higher station 80°, the
actual height is thus found,
Temperature of water, 212° – 210° = 2 530 = 1060
= approximate height.
Temperature of atmosphere, 84° +80° = 164 – 64 = 100
x 1.060 = 100 + 1060 = 2060.
Latitude, 2:060 x 1 = 2:060 + 2060 = 2062:06. The actual
height of the spot examined.

by M. Vidi, a native of France, which is called the " Aneroid « Aneroid
Barometer."* It " consists of a flat circular metallic box, 4% descriptio
inches in diameter, and 14 inch thick." Within is an ex- an
hausted copper drum, having a thin corrugated upper plate or
head. From the centre of this last an upright metallic shaft
springs, "which, as it rises or falls by the varying amount of
atmospheric pressure exercised on the drumhead," multiplies,
through ingenious and complicated springs and levers attached
to its upper end, "the delicate movements thus propagated to
it;" these are marked by an index which traverses a graduated
dial, corresponding in inches and tenths with the scale of the
mercurial barometer. I have given a few observations taken
with this instrument in the Military Hospital at Sierra Leone.
A column of air, extending from the surface of the sea to
the top of the atmosphere, which is equal to about 45 to 50
miles, exercises a pressure upon one inch of surface, of 15 lbs.,
or more correctly, 14:75 lbs.; and according to Professor Schmid
of Jena, the entire weight of the atmosphere on the whole sur-
face of the earth is 612,489,851,187,053 tons. An average-sized
man exhibits a surface of 15 square feet, or 2160 square inches,
and therefore at the level of the sea sustains a total atmospheric
pressure, equal in all directions, of 32,400 lbs., or nearly 141
tons.
The barometer presents steady diurnal changes, depending
on the amount of aqueous vapours. There are two maxima,
viz., one at about 9 A.M., and the other at about 10 P.M.; and
two minima, one between 3 and 4 P.m., and the other at about
4 A.M.
For the rules necessary to be observed in the use of the
barometer as a weather glass, see the introductory chapter.
At present all the stations of the British, Dutch, and Ozone in
Spanish Governments on the West Coast of Africa are more or Africa.
less confined to the sea coast. The French Government has
most of its stations on the sea coast, and a few in the interior.
These stations are well supplied with ozone from their posi-

tions, ozone being abundantly generated from the surface of
the sea; it is the most powerful oxidising agent yet known,
and it has a powerful affinity for malarious or paludal poisons,
which it rapidly decomposes ; it is more plentiful at night,
when malaria is very rife, than in the day, when it is less so.
. It is a natural ingredient of atmospheric air, and consists of
three equivalents or atoms of oxygen and one of hydrogen. Ac-
cording to Schönbein, it is one of the "chemical antipodes and
antidotes to all oxidable miasmatic and malarious gases and
emanations disengaged from putrefying animal and vegetable
substances, converting them into innocuous matter, and thus
purifying and sustaining the entire salubrity of the atmo-
sphere. In short, so hostile to organic miasmata, so incom-
patible with them is ozone, that the presence of the latter
enables us to affirm the absence of the former, and the healthi-
ness of the locality in which it is found." The observations in
Freetown show the existence of but small quantities of ozone.
This must be due to its destruction by miasmatic agencies
which it decomposed; and since vegetation and the foliage of
trees generates a large quantity, the Sierra Leone Government
should take advantage of this, and plant trees in the streets of
Freetown.
In another place I shall fully consider the effects of ozone
in the atmosphere in the treatment of malarious fevers. There
has been no ozonometric observations made in the Gambia,
and I have not heard of any in Senegal.

sphere. They are useful in moderating the temperature on the
surface of the earth, preventing vegetation from being scorched
by day, and radiation of the earth's heat at night, and conse-
quently opposed to the deposit of dew. Through the clouds
the evaporation which is continually taking place on the sur-
face of oceans, seas, and rivers, is carried through the agency
of the wind into the interior of continents in the form of rain.

present endless varieties in different latitudes, and this is
governed by the unequal distribution of light and heat, caused
by the spherical condition of the earth; by its obliquity in
relation to the equatorial plane; by its axial diurnal revolu-
tion, and by "its motion in its elliptical orbit, by which every
part of the surface between 23} north and south latitudes are in
turn exposed to the perpendicular influence of the sun's rays."

autumn, and winter; but their respective dates of commence-
ment and termination differ materially, each having special
reference to their respective climate. Thus, with the first, i. e.,
the ancient Greeks, spring commenced on or about the 20th
of March, when the sun enters the first degree of Aries, and
terminates on or about the 7th of May, at the heliacal rising
of the Vergiliæ or Pleiades: with the second, i. e., the Egyptians,
spring occupies the months of January and February : with
the third, i.e., the English or modern, spring commences at
the vernal equinox, on the day or hour when the distance of
the meridian altitude of the sun from the zenith is at a mean
between the greatest and the least, which is the 20th of March,

and terminates on or about the 21st of June, as soon as the
sun is about to enter the first degree of Cancer.
With the first, the summer commences from the 7th of May
to the heliacal rising of Sirius, a star of the first magnitude
in the constellation Canis major; or on the heliacal rising of
Arcturus, a star also of the first magnitude in the constellation
Bootes or Arctophylax, which takes place about the 15th
September; sometimes it is reckoned from the heliacal rising
of Procyon, in the constellation Canis minor: with the second,
the summer commences in March and continues on to the end
of August: with the third, the summer commences on the
summer solstice, or the hour when the sun attains its maximum
distance from the equator, or northern declination, i. e., 21st
June, and terminates on or about the 22d of September, just
as the sun is about to enter Libra.
With the first, the autumn commences on or about the
15th September, at the heliacal rising of Sirius, Arcturus, or
Procyon, and terminates about the 5th of November; or the
heliacal setting of the Vergilice or Pleiades: with the second,
the autumn commences in September and terminates with the
last day in October : with the third, the autumn commences
on the beginning of the autumnal equinox, or the day the
meridian distance of the sun from the zenith is at a mean
between the greatest and the least, viz., about the 22d Septem-
ber, and terminates on or about the 21st day of December,
just as the sun is about to enter Capricornus.
With the first, the winter commences with the heliacal
setting of the Pleiades, on or about the 5th November, and
terminates on the day the distance of the sun's meridian alti-
tude from the zenith is at a mean between the greatest and the
least: with the second, the winter commences in November
and terminates in December: with the third, the winter com-
mences on or about the 21st of December, on the winter solstice,
when the distance of the sun from the zenith is greatest, and
terminates at the vernal equinox.
From the foregoing, therefore, it proves that amongst the

sideration, and the different latitudes and local peculiarities of
the different places; but for the sake of uniformity I might
divide it into four seasons or quarters, viz., the summer, rainy,
harvest or autumn, and harmattan.
The summer season commences on or about the 15th of
February, and terminates about the end of April, or more pro-
perly on the 15th of May, occupying about 89 or 90 days.
The rainy season commences about the 15th May, and ter-
minates on the 31st August, having a duration of 108 days.
The harvest or autumn commences on the 1st September,
and terminates on or about the 15th November, having a
duration of 76 days.
The harmattan commences about the 15th November, and ter-
minates about the 15th February, having a duration of 93 days.
But this cannot be said to be literally true in all parts of
the whole West Coast, as it is characteristic more of the climate
of Sierra Leone and Liberia. In the region of the trade winds
(vide Chap. VII.), the summer commences on the 15th February
and terminates about the 10th June, and sometimes the rains
do not commence until the 1st July, and terminate in the
beginning of September. In the northern portion of the zone
of calm, or region of variable wind, including Sierra Leone
and Liberia, the rains commence on the 1st of May, the
harmattan in December. On the Gold Coast and Bights the
rains commence in the beginning of April, and there is scarcely
any harmattan; the period from October to March being very
hot, may be regarded as the summer season. For all prac-

period, but this varies in different parts of the coast. In the
regions of the trade winds the maximum of heat is felt; then
the heat is greater in Sierra Leone and Liberia than the Gold
Coast and Bight of Benin, from the peculiar and perfect
exposure of the latter to the influence of the sea breeze.
eter In the Gambia and its interior the average maximum ther-
mometer in this season is 106°; the medium, 100°, and the
minimum about 83º. At Sierra Leone and Liberia the average
maximum is about 85°, the minimum about 80°, and the
minimum, 79°. Of the barometer the average maximum is
30:41 inches; medium, 29.95; minimum, 29.87. On the

The horizon at its approach has a red or purple tinge. The
air, oppressively hot, is surcharged with fine white sand,
the breathing interrupted or greatly quickened, the nasal
membranes burn as the wind enters it. I was under the
influence of two of these winds. Its exact counterpart can
only be represented by a blast from the furnace, or the sudden
opening of a heated oven. The pores of the body are so relaxed
that they yield profuse perspiration; the exposed sentient
surface burns as the heated air approaches it; individuals are
prostrate and gasp for breath. The drinking water in the most
porous Teneriffe cooler becomes lukewarm ; drinking tumblers
are so hot that they require to be submerged for some minutes
before being used. There is never a necessity for the use of
blotting paper, the last written word being dried up in a second.
Vegetation suffers materially from the effects of this wind.
The leaves dry and become disarticulated, the young plant
stinted and withered, and no amount of watering will keep an
herbaceous plant in vigour; the ground is parched and cracked
in various directions; the clay for the time becomes almost as
hard as bricks.
Persons suffering from diseases of the lungs suffer most
intensely from this wind. They are much prostrated and
oppressed; they feel an unaccountable cold chill all over their
body, and no amount of hot clothing seems to reduce the chill ;
they pant for breath as "the hart panteth after the water
brooks," but every heated puff gives them no satisfaction what-.
ever. I have seen cases where they lay restless for hours, as
if death would be the only relief to their sufferings. The most
pleasant sensation is felt when cold water is thrown over the
face, or when the face is covered with a wet thin cambric hand-
kerchief, and exposed to the current of the heated air.
The night is the most distressing part of the twenty-four
hours. The bed-clothes are as hot as the natural heat of the
body. The least slumber produces the most profuse perspira-
tion, and before morning the nightgowns must be changed four

or five times. Indeed, I have known individuals to damp
their bed linen before going to rest without suffering the least
injurious effects from it.
This wind, which is allied to, if not identical with, the
Simoom of the desert, is the same as the gadim, or east wind
of the Old Testament, or the shurgiyeh of the Arabs. Reference
is made to it in Job xv. 2, in Hosea xiii. 15, and in Ezekiel
xvii. 10, xix. 12. "Behold, being planted, shall it prosper ?
shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it? it
shall wither in the furrows where it grew."
When only the ordinary winds blow, the atmosphere of the
Ganibia region contains a larger quantity of aqueous vapour
during this season than that of any other part of the coast.
The maximum quantity is generally after noon, and the mini-
mum before sunrise. On the Gold Coast the maximum of
heat is between one and two o'clock, through the accession of
the south-west sea breeze.
During this season of the year whirlwinds are very frequent,
and in many cases dangerous. Their constant and violent
gyratory or whirling motion from or about a central axis, is
caused by two currents of wind having opposite directions,
blowing in close proximity with one another. Both cannot have
the same velocity, and the stronger attracts the weaker into
its own movement, diverting it from its own course, and thus
keeping up a continual movement. Before the latter changes its
course it undergoes a certain amount of condensation, and the
degree of this determines the force and velocity of the whirl-
wind. Their axes are placed in curvilinear or rectilinear line
with the surface of land or water, and they inove with the
moving atmosphere around them.
There are several cases known in the interior of the River
Gambia, between M'Carthy's Island and the falls, where
vessels have narrowly escaped being upset by whirlwinds
in the river. In 1864, the "Diamond,", a small craft
which was loaded with a deckload of ground nuts at Fattah
Tendah, was caught in one of these movements, and was

quickly deprived of the temporary bulwarks made of thick
mats with which it was supplied, and would have been
capsized but for the alertness of the captain.
In the next chapter it will be shown, that as the temperature
increases the air becomes drier; for every increase of 27° F. it
becomes double, so that whilst the temperature increases in an
arithmetical progression, the dryness increases in a geometrical
progression. Thus, the interior of the Gambia region, where
the temperature sometimes exceeds 112° F., the atmosphere
contains less moisture than the atmosphere in Sierra Leone,
Liberia, the Gold Coast, and Bights, where the temperature
seldom exceeds 90° F. How far this dry atmosphere is more
conducive to health than the moist warm air, I shall consider
in another place.

THE RAINY SEASON—MAY, JUNE, JULY, AND AUGUST.
servations.
Ar this season of the year the meteorological phenomena are General ob-
numerous. The atmosphere is generally cloudy, heavy, and
misty, with occasional lightnings and peals of thunder. The
evenings are generally very dark, or if the moon be present,
it is seen through a misty atmosphere. Shooting stars are
occasionally present, running in every direction, at a distance
apparently of about 1000 feet from the surface of the earth,
proving that the atmosphere is highly impregnated with electric
fluid. There are at the commencement occasional showers of
refreshing and cooling rains. The thermometer and barometer
present much variation. Now every one begins to prognosticate
"what kind of a season it would be." Some are glad to have
a more refreshing and moist weather, but dread the sequelæ of
the commencing rains; others are filled with unpleasantness at
the anticipation of a drawback in the trade, especially with sur-
rounding tribes; whilst a third, the horticulturists, sharpen their
hoes and garden implements with delight; and the agricul-
turist, with an agility that is delightful to behold, digs, rakes,
and prepares his fields, looking out for an abundant harvest.
From May the rain gradually increases until July and
August, when it comes down with terrific rapidity, swelling
large streams into navigable rivers, converting brooks into
rivulets which sweep away every vegetable that is planted
near them, and overflowing the banks of small streams. Many
pasture lands are inundated, so that in many places water

may be seen oozing from the earth. The thatch in grass-
roofed houses is sometimes torn away by its tremendous,
rapid, and unremitting torrents, so that in some huts the
inhabitants are washed whilst enjoying the visible caloric
emanating from a blazing fire. Bridges built pseudo-substan-
tially disclose the unskilfulness of the architecture, and man
is obliged to shelter himself under the canopy of some cloth of
Manchester or Glasgow manufacture, supported by curiously-
wrought whalebones and pine-wood.
Everything in the vegetable world seems pleasing;" the fields
luxuriate in the abundance of their vegetable stores ; the trees
rejoice in their leafy pride; the varied flowers raise their
heads; whilst beauteous nature revels in the soft voluptuous-
ness of her own creation ;" and man views with glowing
pleasure the resuscitation of the lifeless plants.
Rain is produced by two currents of air of unequal tem-
perature, but of equal degree of saturation, meeting together in
equal volume. The resultant temperature is the mean of the
two; but the invisible aqueous vapour not being the mean, but
exceeding that of the mean of the resultant temperature, the
difference is deposited in the form of rain or dew. Thus, if at
Freetown, or at the foot of the Cameroon Mountains, the tem-
perature of the air be 86° in a state of absolute saturation, and,
being specifically lighter on ascending to the top of Sugar-
Loaf or the Cameroon Mountains, meets with a cold air, which
reduces its temperature to 59°, it will part with the fortieth
part of its weight of aqueous vapour in the form of rain.
Rain, then, is the cooling down of a saturated air below its
point of saturation. The dryness of the air at every increase
of 27° F. is doubled; thus, at 32° it holds the 160th part
of its weight of moisture; at 59°, the 80th part; at 86°, the
40th part; and at 113°, the 20th part.
The quantity of rain-fall is very much affected by the
phases of the moon; it increases when the moon crosses the
equator, and about new moon; then near the full moon it is
very heavy; at full moon, and during her decline to the

taken up by
equator, there is a minimum quantity of rain; but this depends
on the relative position to the sun.
The drops of rain vary in diameter from the one-third to the
one-thirtieth of an inch, and might be caused by various circum-
stances. If the separated moisture or aqueous vapour, several
feet above the surface, pass through a stratum of air warmer
than the mean of the two from which it had been separated, it
might suffer suspension in it, or fall in very small drops; but
when it passes through a colder stratum of air, the size of the
drops become increased during the descent.
In passing through the air, rain-water contains a large Substance

small quantities of carbonate of ammonia, nitric acid, nitrate
of ammonia, sulphurous acids, and sulphuric sulphuretted
hydrogen, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids, chlorides of
sodium and potassium, carbonate and sulphate of lime, and
traces of nitrogenous organic matter. In fact, "the rain, in
falling, carries with it everything that floats in the atmo-
sphere, and which is not essential to its constitution; it
brings back to the earth what came from the earth; and while
it thus purifies the atmosphere from hurtful adulterations,
restores to the soil these numberless volatile substances,
where they have abundant opportunities of forming not only
harmless, but useful combinations" (Mulder).
The fall of rain in intertropical Western Africa is not daily
throughout the year, but only at particular seasons, and this is
caused by the change in the direction of the trade-wind. In
the Gambia region, including Senegal, the rain does not com-
mence before the 10th June, very often not before the 1st
July; at Sierra Leone and Liberia about the 1st May, and on
the Gold Coast and Bight of Benin about the 1st of April.
The commencement of the rainy season is always marked Tornadoes,
by two, three, or more tornadoes, and it answers to the breaking of
up of the monsoon. The word " tornado " is derived from the
Portuguese travado, which means a thunderstorm. At this
time of the year, as well as after the rain, when the tornado

season again approaches, there is an evident increase of ozone
in the atmosphere, caused by the highly electrified condition
of the atmosphere. The occurrence of a tornado is generally
marked with premonitory symptoms. At first a cold breeze is
felt, which is soon followed by a clear, white, heavenly canopy,
giving the atmosphere a kind of light rusty appearance. At
once a dusky white spot is observed, pointing E.S.E., or E., at a
great altitude, which gradually descends, spreading at the same
time until it reaches the horizon, forming sometimes a cone—the
base on the horizon, and the apex above; this spreads laterally
until a half or a quarter of the visible horizon is covered with
impenetrable darkness. Nature now seems to lie in dormant
vitality, and its functions to be seized with a paralytic stroke ;
the most profound quietness pervades the whole earth ; the
leaves are perfectly at a stand still, not a creature is to be seen
about in the street; the whole system now becomes oppressed
with a mingled sensation of awe and apprehension of some
stupendous phenomena. A once a blast of lightning vividly
flashes from sky to sky, and then darting on the negatively elec-
trified ground is followed immediately by a distant tremendous
reverberating explosion, which startles every terrene animated
being. A slight whirlwind is afterwards observed whirling with
some velocity the light ponderable material found in the streets.
At length a vehement, irresistible gust of wind rushes from the
gloomy horizon with immense impetuosity, sweeping every un-
substantially fixed substance before it, uprooting trees, carry-
ing away slates and bamboos from the tops of houses, and
sometimes even the roofs and chimney tops, and filling the
atmosphere with an immense quantity of infusorial protozoa;
then follow thick pellets of rain, which as it were retreat for
a time, returning and terminating with a furious deluge, which
falls in one vast sheet rather than in drops.
The above is a general description of a tornado. It will be of
some interest and of more practical value should I here parti-
cularise all the various changes, carefully observed and noted, of
two tornadoes as they occurred on the West Coast of Africa.

The observations were made whilst our troops were stationed
at Quittah, on the Slave Coast, in the Bight of Benin.
At 4.14 P.M. there was a dark, bluish-black cloud on due E.,
which extended in the next quarter of an hour to E.N.E. and
E.S.E.; at 5 o'clock it had extended to S.E. by S., and then to
due S. The appearance of the cloud from the horizon to 1°
above was dark bluish-black, above this it was white; the latter
suddenly and rapidly descended and overclouded the former.
During this period there was a dead calm all over the atmo-
sphere; not the least movement was traceable in the most
fragile branch; the sky towards S.W. by S. to N.N.E. was per-
fectly clear. At last the pent-up wind seemed, as it were, to
overcome the difficulty, and the cloud was thrown all over the
canopy; the wind now rushed from E.N.E., accompanied with
a deluge of rain.
It will be observed that, in this description of a tornado,
there was no lightning nor thunder, as is sometimes the case ;
the observation was made on the 1st of May.
The following are the particulars of another tornado, which
took place about the latter part of March on the same coast :-
Wind on the beginning of the tornado E.; darkness all over
the heavens, and thunder towards the east. No rain at the
beginning; haziness all over the canopy, especially towards the
sea, with heavy fog drifting from east to west. A pleasant
light rain now fell in small drops, and lasted for a short time,
which was followed by a violent gust of wind, and a clearness
over the whole atmosphere from E. to S.E. The wind
now stopped for a short time, but immediately returned with
great force and velocity. A dense fog now covered the horizon,
the greatest distance that could be seen around being less than
half a mile, more or less covered with fog. Twenty minutes
after this the wind gradually decreased and the rain became
more tense. Grumblings of thunder now began to be heard
from S. to E., and increased in frequency and intensity; the
wind became vehement, and the rain gradually ceased. About
ten minutes after, the wind decreased, but the rain increased ;

the thunder became violent from the zenith to S. W. by W.;
then to E. by S. 1 S., and then S.E. The wind now alternated
with the rain ; the thunder from N.W. to S; then heavy
rain fell, with thunder to E. zenith S., and terminated in
S.W. The sky began to get clear; the thunder continued in
severity, with vivid flashes of lightning in various directions,
and after a time all the phenomena ceased, and a most pleasant
sensation was felt.
There are at this period of the year, especially at the closing
of the rains or harvest, repeated recurrence of forked or pene-
trating and vivid flashes of sheet lightning, which in many
cases occasions a peculiar sensation of a delightful and agree-
able character on the exposed sentient surface. Mr Hutchinson
describes it as "a dash of increased heat simultaneous with a
vivid flash of lightning;" and the late Dr Baikie, as "a feeling
of warmth in the face." This feeling I believe to be caused by
an increased development of ozone by each flash, which, being a
powerful and energetic oxidising substance, oxidises the oxidis-
able from transpiration emanating the surface of body. After the
After effects tornado, the most pleasing sensation is felt; the air is refresh-
ingly cold, clear, and exhilarating, containing a large quantity
of oxygen, and the constitution much invigorated ; for in the
second tornadal observations above described, the thermometer
fell from 86° to 78°, the hygrometer was 3°, dew-point 74°,
saturation of the atmosphere 881.4, and tension of aqueous
vapour 0.957. There was an increase of 2° in the ozonometer.
In the Gambia region, towards the approach of the rainy
season, the wind, which had been most constantly blowing
from the monsoon points N., N.E., and E., now blows all the
day with violence from S.W., W., and N.W., which greatly
cools the atmosphere, although in some days the thermometer
goes up as high as 106º. The temperature before sunrise is
very chilly, and individuals are very much subject to colds and
coughs. The rains here are ushered in by one or two dirt

commenced literally on the 22d June. A few days previously

there was a severe dry gale from the direction between south-
east and north-east, blowing with tremendous velocity every-
thing before it. Its approach was indicated by a deep grum-
bling noise a mile off, and the moving column of air appeared
as a dense black fog, but was composed of dirt; it removed all
the light surface earth, and wafted it along with great velocity,
and unless individuals were under shelter, it was impossible to
breathe without taking into the lungs a large quantity of dust.
It continued with varied velocity for half an hour, and then
gradually subsided. On the 21st the mid-day sun was very
oppressive; towards evening a strong south-west wind blew,
the atmosphere clear, the moon bright and the heavens starry;
at 3 A.M. of the 22d the rains were ushered in with a severe
north-east wind blowing into a tornado.
On the Gold Coast and the Bights the rains commence
earlier, but do not continue until September. They terminate
about the beginning of June, occasioning the former rains. The
latter rains commence about the beginning of July, and ter-
minate at the end of August. But in Liberia, Sierra Leone,
the Gambia, and Senegal, when the rains once commence,
they gradually increase until towards the end.
From the Rio Pongas to Liberia the rains are more plentiful Calculation
than at any part of the coast; but the quantity varies a great of
deal every year. The maximum quantity which fell at Free- Sier
town, Sierra Leone, according to the observation which was and 1860.
taken at the military hospital in August 1860, in the twenty-
four hours, was 2:61 inches, which was on the 28th of the
month; in September it was 4:27 inches on the 1st; and in
October, 4:65 on the 6th. The minimum was in August, :04
on the 10th ; in September, .05 on the 23d ; October, .01 on
the 28th. The total quantity of rain during the whole of
August was 26.86 inches; in September it was 25-35 inches ;
and in October, 13.80 inches. In April of the same year, the
total quantity which fell was 3:56 inches; in May it was 10.24

If we refer to the tables published by Boyle, as the observa-
tions taken in the same hospital in the months of June, July,
and August 1829, it will be found that the quantity of rain
which fell must have been enormous, and was quite sufficient
to inundate the whole of the country, mountainous though
it is, and goes far to prove that there are sensible differences
between the meteoric phenomena of the last thirty years and
the present time.
The maximum quantity of rain in the twenty-four hours in
June 1829, was 4:40 inches on the 11th ; in July it was 14:15
inches on the 10th; and in August 16.00 inches on the 23d.
The minimum quantity in June was 1:10 inches on the 8th;
in July it was 1.00 inches on the 16th ; and in August 1.00
on the 29th. The total quantity of rain during the whole of
June was 64:55 inches; during July it was up to 125.55
inches, and in August it fell to 123.80 inches.
In 1858 the total quantity of rain which fell in the three
months, viz., May, June, and July, as observed in the gauge
kept at Fourah Bay, Freetown, was as follow :-May, 8.95
inches ; June, 12:27 inches ; July, only 23.50 inches.

in 1858, was 34:72; whilst the total of the six months in 1860,
viz., April, May, June, August, September, and October, was
95:04. The difference between the quantity of rain which fell
in May 1858, and the same month in 1860, was 1.34 inches in
favour of the latter year; whilst the difference between June
1829 and June 1858, and between the same months in 1829
and 1860, are all in favour of 1829–viz., in the first case it was
52.28 inches, and in the second 49:32. In 1860 of the same
month there was more rain than in 1858 of the same month by
2.96 inches. July 1829 had more rain than July 1858 by
102.05 inches, and August 1829 more than August 1860 by
96.94 inches. It is evident, therefore, that if the table of Boyle
be correct, of which I have not the least doubt, the quantity of
rain in 1829 must have been excessive. The quantity in June
alone is nearly twice the quantity in May, June, and July of
1858, being 64:55 and 34:72 respectively; and the quantity
in August alone of 1829 exceeds the quantity of the six months
in 1860, viz., April, May, June, August, September, and
October, by 28-76. The sum total of the rain which fell in
the three months, June, July, and August of 1829, exceeds the
sum total of the quantity which fell in the three months, May,
June, July of 1858, and the six months, April, May, June,
August, September, October of 1860, by 174:24 inches, or more
than double the quantity by 44:48 inches.
What, most of my readers will ask, is an inch of rain ?
And what equivalent in avoirdupois weight must be under-
stood by these figures, 303.90 inches, 34:72 inches, 95:04
inches ?
An inch deep of rain in one acre of land yields 22,622:5
gallons of water; but 277.274 cubic inches is equal to one
gallon, therefore, an inch deep of rain in one acre of land is
equal to 6,372,640 cubic inches of water, since an acre, accord-
ing to the English measurement, consists of 6,272,640 cubic
inches.
Rain water must be considered as the purest of natural
waters, especially when collected after a long continuance of

rainy weather, and even then it will be found to contain an
appreciable quantity of atmospheric air, together with some of
the gases floating in it, to the extent of about 21 cubic inches
of air in 100 of water. Distilled water, therefore, is the best
material for experiment, a gallon of which weighs 10 lbs.; and
one inch deep of rain being equal to 22,622.5 gallons of water,
consequently the rain-fall on an acre of land is equal to 226,225
lbs. avoirdupois; but 2240 lbs. is equal to one ton, therefore
an inch deep of rain weighs nearly 101 tons, or more correctly,
100.993 inches.
The quantity of rain, therefore, which fell in an acre of land
at Freetown, Sierra Leone, in the months of June, July, and
August of 1829, was not less than sixty-six millions six hun-
dred and fifty-nine thousand five hundred and sixty pounds
avoirdupois of water, or six millions six hundred and sixty-
five thousand nine hundred and fifty-six gallons of water, or
thirty thousand three hundred and ninety tons. Allowing
Freetown to be about three miles square, it will contain one
thousand nine hundred and two acres; and, therefore, the
quantity of rain which fell in all Freetown for the three
months in 1829, if measured, will not be less than twelve
billions six hundred and seventy-eight millions six hundred
and forty-eight thousand three hundred and twelve gallons
of water, or one hundred and twenty-six billions seven hun-
dred and eighty-six millions four hundred and eighty-three
thousand one hundred and twenty pounds weight of water, or
fifty-seven millions eight hundred and one thousand seven
hundred and eight tons of water. What an enormous quan-
tity for only eighty days of rain !!!
Leaving unnoticed the quantity of rain which fell in the
three months of 1858, which was represented by 34:72 inches,
let me consider that of the six months in 1860, which amounted
to 95.04 inches; there were twenty-one million two hundred and
eighty thousand nine hundred and sixty lbs. of water, or two
millions one hundred and eighty thousand eight hundred and
ninety-six gallons, which is equal to nine thousand five hun-

191
dred and four tons of water in an acre. But the whole of Free-
town has been shown to contain no less than one thousand
nine hundred and two acres of land, so that the quantity of
rain, which fell in the whole of Freetown in 1860, is represented
in pounds avoirdupois by forty-seven billions six hundred and
eighty-seven millions two hundred and seventy thousand and
four hundred, in gallons by four billions seven hundred and
sixty-eight millions seven hundred and twenty-seven thousand
and forty, and in tons by eight millions and seventy-five
thousand six hundred and eight.
But there were 208.86 inches of rain in the three months of
1829, more than in the six months of 1860, i.e., there fell in
an acre of land at Freetown forty-six millions seven hundred
and eighty-four thousand six hundred and forty lbs. of water,
or four millions six hundred and seventy-eight thousand four
hundred and sixty-four gallons, or twenty thousand eight
hundred and eighty-six tons of rain more than in the year
1860.
It might be doubted that so large a quantity of rain-fall
could have taken place in 1829, whilst in 1860, and other
years, so small a quantity is noted; but it must be remem-
bered that the rain-fall is very irregular from year to year,
especially in a mountainous place such as Sierra Leone, and this
remarkable difference might be traced in other parts of the
world :-Thus, in Bombay in 1824, the quantity of rain-fall
was 34 inches, whilst just two years previously, viz., in 1822,
the quantity was more than treble that, it being 112 inches.
Again, in the Bengal Hurkaru of September 16, 1845, we
find the following, quoted by Martin :-"The Englishman is
informed that seventy-four inches of rain fell in Arakau during
the last month, and that fifty inches had fallen during the
first twelve days of the present month. The whole fall during
the monsoon to the 15th August, was two hundred inches."
In 1835, on the 10th May, sixteen inches of rain fell in Calcutta
in the brief space of twelve hours.

At the commencement and the termination of the rainy
season the rain falls almost always only in the night, and, as a
general rule, more rain falls at night than in the day by one-
fifth. So also more rain falls on mountainous districts than on
plains, and more in the neighbourhood of the sea than at
sea.
At this period rainbow is of very frequent occurrence. This Rainbow, de-
phenomenon is seen, when the sun is shining and a rain shower prognosis of.
falling at the same time, as a coloured circular arch in the
heavens. Morning rainbow appearing in the south-west, with
a south-west wind blowing, indicates approaching rain ; and
with an easterly wind, indicates fair weather. Evening rain-
bow appearing in the east, with a south-west wind, indicates
fair weather ; but with an easterly wind, it portends approach-
ing rain.
Descartes and Sir Isaac Newton have investigated and con-
clusively explained the causes of the rainbow. It is produced
" by the sun's rays falling upon drops of rain near the upper
surface, where, being refracted, they pass to the side of the

and snow.
drop which is farthest from the sun and the spectator, whence
they are reflected towards the lower surface; and on quitting
the drop they suffer a second refraction. Each pencil of rays,
on emerging from the drop, consists of parallel rays of light,
which produce in the mind of the spectator the perception of
brightness. Light is, therefore, twice refracted and once reflected
within each drop of rain or vesicle of vapour," so that a rain-
bow is only seen when the falling rain is opposite the sun.
In the month of August I have frequently noticed the fall
of hailstones in the mountainous district of Sierra Leone; they
are generally of an inch or half an inch in size, and caused by
drops of rain suddenly frozen on their passage to the earth.
Snow, which is the visible aqueous vapour composing clouds
in a frozen state, has also fallen in Western Africa. A writer
in the African Times, August 1863, thus gives an account of
one occurrence :—"On the morning of the 10th or 12th of May
last the atmosphere was very heavy, and there were signs of
the approach of a great deal of rain; a thick cloud was observed
towards the east, and a cold easterly wind was blowing. This
was at Swadore, near to Winnebah. It drizzled a little, and
then there followed a heavy fall of snow—real condensed
snow-not like hailstones, but in small icicles. The natives,
as well as the European officers, were struck with astonish-
ment. ... This may be received as corroborative evidence
of the statements of travellers in Eastern Africa, who reported
that they found mountains covered with snow." This state-
ment was true, as I saw several officers who were present when
the phenomenon took place.
When atmospheric electricity passes between the earth and
a cloud, or between two clouds, lightning is produced; and
the report that is occasioned through it forms thunder. In
Western Africa lightning is very dangerous, and frequent
observations corroborate the statement, that it generally strikes
the south-east aspect of buildings, and never the northern.
When forked or in sheet its duration is only to both part of a
second; but when in the form of fireballs, it may last for
Lightning
and thunder.

several seconds. In a thunder-storm the nitrogen and oxygen
of the atmosphere combine suddenly, and nitric acid is the
result. These storms sometimes destroy the magnetism of the
needle of the compass, "and occasionally invert its magnetic
poles."
At the beginning of the rainy season and the autumn several shooting
meteoric phenomena are observable in the evening—fireballs or
shooting stars, flying in various directions in the atmosphere,
or descending slantingly on the earth. I have many times seen
the atmosphere lighted up in a most charming manner by these
balls. These phenomena are connected with the stones fallen
from the atmosphere described by ancient writers. They are
meteoric stones or aerolites (aër, the air, and lithos, a stone);
and when analysed, are found to consist of 54 parts of silica,
36 of oxide of iron, 9 of magnesia, 3 of oxide of nickel, 2 of
sulphur, and.1 of lime.
During this season mosquitoes and sand-flies abound in
Africa, and are very troublesome. In the Gambia region both
of these are very annoying; at Sierra Leone, Liberia, and
the Gold Coast, less so, there being but few mosquitoes, except
at the swampy mouths of rivers, and no sand-flies. In the
Bights of Benin and Biafra mosquitoes are plentiful. The
audacity of this insect is thus described by the late Dr Baikie,
in his descent from the first Niger expedition :—"Mosquitoes
crowded on board, possibly to welcome us on our return; but
the pleasure of meeting was not reciprocal, nor could we per-
suade them to take a quiet hint and retire. I detected one
settling in the most cool and impudent manner on the back of
my hand, preparing to enjoy an extemporary banquet. I
fancied I recognised this savage intruder as being the same
which had, during our ascent, committed on me an assault to
the effusion of blood; but, in the heat of my indignation, I
sacrificed this sanguinary gnat without allowing time for
mutual recognition, so that this question of identity must
remain for ever a doubtful point in history."

viametrical
THE harvest or autumn is a very unhealthy season. At its
commencement, in some parts of the coast, there is little or no
rain, whilst in others there is plenty of it. In the regions of
the trade-wind-Gambia, Senegal, and the Casamanza—there is
generally very little rain in September, and scarcely any at all
in October. The same is the case with the Gold Coast and the
Bights; but there are very severe thunder-storms and tor-
nadoes, and heavy gales of wind. At Sierra Leone and Liberia
there is always plenty of rain in September (as may be seen
Average plu- from the pluviametrical register of the former place, recorded in
observations. the last chapter), and a little in October. In the Gambia region
the month of October is very hot and oppressive, the atmo-
sphere being well supplied with moisture from the drying
swamps; and the heat, ranging to 100° F., is less bearable
than the dry atmosphere of April
The thermometer at its maximum in the first section
averages 93° ; at its medium, 86°; at its minimum, 74º. In
Sierra Leone and Liberia the average maximum is 84°;
medium, 78°; minimum, 70°. On the Gold Coast and in the
Bights, the average maximum is 83°; medium, 76°; minimum,
72º. According to Bogle, the barometer at its maximum is
30° 15'; medium, 29° 84'; and minimum, 29° 30'.
The weather now, especially at the commencement of the
Condition of season, is very changeable; the rains, less frequent, sometimes
descend with great rapidity and violence ; at others in small,
short drizzles, which are very disagreeable. Vegetation is now
weather.

in full maturity, the fruits and plants are gathered, and some
of the leaves wither and fall to the ground; vegetable putre-
faction takes place, stimulated both by the moisture from the
sea and the heat of the sun, and becomes a fruitful source for
the exhalation of malaria.
During the greater part of this section the south-west mon-
soon is the prevailing wind; towards the latter part of October
the wind shifts from this quarter towards east and north-east,
and then commences the north-east monsoon. In the region
of the calms the land and sea breezes alternate, occurring at
almost regular intervals.
The harvest terminates in the harmattan or cold season, Hurricane in
about the 15th November, at which time a peculiar pheno-
menon, which I have designated hurricane in the clouds, oc-
casionally takes place. It occurs generally high in the regions
of the clouds, and causes great wonder and surprise amongst
novices who have only observed it for the first time. It happens
at any time during the twenty-four hours, morning, noon, even-
ing, or night, and commences with the atmosphere appearing to
be perfectly stultified—everything in dead quietness—a heavy
cloud concealing the heavens just over head, and appearing so
solid that it might fall in one heavy mass. A rumbling noise
now commences, low at first, but gradually becoming loud,
very different from that of thunder, but resembling, in a most
marked degree, the noise of a paddle-steamer, or that of a rail-
way carriage whilst passing through a tunnel. This brings out all
the inhabitants who are within doors, and is caused by electricity
passing suddenly between the strata of clouds and meeting
with some disturbance; the rumbling is followed by loud de-
tonating sounds, as if a powerful Leyden jar encompassing the
whole atmosphere was being discharged, and the whole atmo-
sphere becomes highly charged with electricity. This con-
tinues for about ten minutes, when a few heavy drops of
rain fall, the wind gradually begins to rise from south-west,
dispersing the clouds, and the atmosphere becomes as natural
as before. So like, indeed, is this electric disturbance to the

paddling of a steamboat, that I was entirely deceived when
first I heard it at M'Carthy's Island, at about three o'clock in
the morning, and was under the impression that the colonial
river steamer had arrived in port. The natives interpret this
as the termination of all rains for some months, and true

six or seven months.
servations.
HARMATTAN OR COLD SEASON.
General ob- This season commences about the middle of November and
terminates in the middle of February, occupying a period of
three months. The name harmattan is derived from the
Fantee aharamanta, a designation of the season when this
wind blows, from aharaman, to blow, and ta, tallow or grease ;
since at this season the weather is so dry and parching that the
inhabitants are obliged to keep their skin soft and moist by
the use of grease. It blows along the whole Western Coast of
Africa, extending from Cape de Verde, in lat. 15° N., and Cape
Lopez, in lat. 0° 36' 10", S. and long. 8° 40' E. Its intensity
decreases as we leave the Gambia region to leeward. In
Senegal, Gambia, and Casamanza it blows from E. and N.E.,
in Sierra Leone from E.S.E., on the Gold Coast from N.E., and
Description at Lopez from N.N.E. The approach of the harmattan is
generally indicated by the dropping of the leaves of trees, which
do not putrefy as in the preceding season, but are dried up,
so that they are prevented from being the source of malaria.
Vegetation of every kind is affected; all the tender plants, and
most of the productions of the garden, are destroyed; the grass
withers and becomes dry like hay ; vigorous evergreens suffer
from its pernicious influence; " branches of the lemon, orange,
and lime trees droop; the leaves become flaccid, and so parched
as to be easily rubbed to dust between the fingers, should the
harmattan blow for several successive days." It is generally
accompanied by a thick fog or mist, extending out at sea in
some cases to three leagues, which Baron Roussin considers to
be sand in extreme fineness, and not inaptly compared with
of harmattan.

the characteristic London fog, differing, however, from it in its
physical effect on the system. An idea of the nature of the
fog may be obtained from the fact, that in the height of this
season the sun at near noon might occasionally be seen through
the fog as white as the moon.
One great peculiarity of this wind is that of extreme dryness.
All nature seems to feel this effect. The ground is dry, parched,
and cracked in various places; the grass withers, trees lose
their green foliage; chinks are opened in the roofs of houses;
the doors and windows become dried up, forcibly split, and
cannot properly fit; the furniture made of the most seasoned
wood loosens, warps, and cracks audibly; books bend concavely;
wine-glasses or tumblers forcibly crack on the sideboard with-
out the application of any violence. In the human body it
produces great dryness of the throat, a sensation of thirst,
which is to relieve the parched or dried up pharynx ; the lips
are chapped, and bleed occasionally; the surface of the body
crisps, and the whole system suffers from great uneasiness.
So early as in 1796, Mungo Park, the great African traveller,
thus speaks of the harmattan wind :—"After the rains the wind
sets in from the north-east and produces a wonderful change
in the face of the country. The grass soon becomes dry and
withered; the rivers subside very rapidly, and many of the
trees shed their leaves. About this period is commonly felt
the harmattan, a dry parching wind, blowing from the north-
east, and accompanied by a thick smoky haze, through which
the sun appears of a dull-red colour. This wind, in passing
over the great desert of Sahara, acquires a strong attraction for
humidity, and parches up everything exposed to its current.
It is, however, reckoned very salutary, particularly to Euro-
peans, who generally recover their health during its continu-
ance. I experienced immediate relief from sickness, both at
Dr Laidley's and at Kamadia during the harmattan. Indeed,
the air during the rainy season is so loaded with moisture,
that clothes, shoes, trunks, and everything that is not close to
the fire, become damp and mouldy, and the inhabitants may be

said to live in a sort of vapour-bath ; but this dry wind braces
up the solids which were before relaxed, gives a cheerful flow
of spirits, and is even pleasant to respiration. Its ill effects
are, that it produces chaps in the lips and afflicts many of the
natives with sore eyes."
I have sought in vain, from a great many English and
French treatises on the harmattan wind, for an account of the
origin of this strange wind. Every one agrees that it is from
the desert, but the proximate cause seems not as yet to have
been discovered. To me it appears that its origin may be traced
to the following causes. A large portion of the sandy desert
of Sahara is within the tropics, and this sand has a special
attraction for the sun. During the months of July, August,
and September, little or no rain falls on it, it being within the
region where the trade-wind is more or less constant. Towards
the end of September, and during the whole of October, and
sometimes the beginning of November, the atmosphere is hot
and sultry, the heat oppressive, and the thermometer in some
days rises beyond 100° F. even in the West Coast towns. In
the sandy desert the heat is excessive; the sand becomes
perfectly dry and parched.
This sultry and heated period lasts until the end of October,
when the wind shifts from the west, south-west, or north-west,
towards east, north-east, or south-east, just as the winter or
cold portion of autumn commences in the temperate zone. The
cold winterly air travels exceedingly fast from the poles
towards the equator to replace its heated sultry air, which
rapidly ascends. On passing through the sandy desert the
cold winterly air is deprived of its moisture by the parched up
sand, so that it arrives towards the coast on lands beyond the
desert as a cold, dry, parching wind. In the northern portion
the cold air blows for days continuously, and then shifts for a
time to allow a heating process to take place. The air becomes
heated, another rush takes place, and so it continues, alternat-
ing irregularly, until towards the close of the winter, when the
air from the temperate and polar zones becomes warmed as it

traverses Southern Europe before passing over the desert, where
it receives additional heat, and arrives on the coast as a hot
wind.
The cold atmosphere of the harmattan is, in reality, the
cold winterly air of the temperate zone passing rapidly into
the tropics, slightly modified by local causes. The dry,
parching character is acquired whilst passing through the desert
of Sahara, the sands of which, yawning for moisture, quickly
deprive it of its humidity, and thus we have it as a cold, dry
atmosphere. The haze or fog, as Roussin has remarked, is
obtained from the light sand of the desert wafted away by the
cold breeze as it passes through it in fierce velocity to replace
the heated air of the coast. All those places which lie on the
west and south-west of the desert receive the harmattan wind
more or less constantly and regularly for three months in the
year, as it is in Senegal, the Gambia, and Casamanza, and their
interior countries ; those south, or bordering on the south,
more sparingly, as in Pongas, Nunez, Sierra Leone, and a part
of Liberia ; and those having but small connection with, and
a great distance from it, have the wind occasionally and very
sparingly, and their only chance of getting it at all depends
entirely on physical causes, as on the Gold Coast and in the
Bights. The light sand detached from the desert is carried to the
regions where the wind blows, where it deposits a part as it goes
along, and places where it continually blows receive more, and
places where it sparingly blows receive less. The cold dry air
abstracts from vegetation, from the surface of the earth, from
the bodies of man and beast, and from all material substances,
all the moisture that it possibly can get, and, consequently, at
this season, as we have before said, the ground is parched and
dry, the leaves of trees wither and fall, the frames of houses be-
come loose, dry, and cracked, and a dry sensation felt.
During the blowing of the harmattan wind, the temperature Variation in
of the atmosphere is more dry even than at any other period
of the year, especially in the Gambia region. The variation
which at other seasons ranges between 20° to 40°, is now re-

duced to only 7° in some days. This is when the harmattan
breeze blows during the whole of the twenty-four hours. Some-
times it blows only in the morning, and then shifts to south-
east, when the wind becomes hot in the afternoon, at which
time the range of temperature becomes very great.
The thermometer at its maximum in the Gambia region
averages 90°; medium, 86°; minimum, 64° : Sierra Leone and
Liberia, maximum, 83°; medium, 78°; minimum, 76°: Gold
Coast and Bights, maximum, 82:10°; medium, 79°; minimum,
76.5°. During the blowing of the harmattan wind the baro-
meter rises to 31 inches, and keeps there for days, and then
gradually falls until it assumes its normal standard.
It must be understood that the harmattan wind does not
blow continuously during the whole of the season, but only
for some days. In the intermediate days, in the zone of calms,
the regular interchange of land and sea breezes takes place. In
the zone of the trade-winds an easterly or south-easterly wind
blows. It is sometimes so strong that the atmosphere, which
is very hot outside, is very cold indoors, from the constant
change in the general sentient surface. The wind is so strong
that the dust flies about in every direction, and whirlwinds are
frequent in squares. This wind does not produce that curva-
ture of books and depredation to furniture which is the
characteristic feature of the winds of the season. This easterly
wind is very unhealthy, and when it blows individuals gene-
rally complain of uncomfortable feverish sensations, as well as
of disease of the internal secreting organs.

CHAPTER XII.
1. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.—2. DISEASES OF THE HOT SEASON.
"WHOEVER," says Hippocrates, "would investigate medicine
properly, and practise it successfully, should first consider the
seasons of the year and their different effects; the winds
common to all countries, and those peculiar to each locality;
the aspect of towns and cities in relation to the winds and
rising of the sun; whether the ground be naked and deficient
in water, or wooded and well watered ; and whether situated in
a hollow, confined locality, or on an elevated and cold site."
These were the principles that guided the practice of ancient
physicians, and this shows that in those days they not only con-
sidered the importance of sanitary reform, and the necessity
of sanitary measures for the improvement of the health of the
inhabitants of towns and cities, but that they advocated their
adoption.
We have in the preceding chapters entered fully into the
physical state of the different stations in Western Africa, their
sanitary conditions, as well as the seasons which govern their
various effects on health ; and as Arbuthnot has justly re-
marked, each season has its special disease, which is the result
of fixed physical or chemical laws, and not as a matter of
accident, so that it will be my province to bring into pro-
minent notice the diseases peculiar to each of the seasons

into which the climate of the West Coast of Africa has been
divided.
Proneness of When we consider the proneness of Europeans to disease
disease in the in intertropical Africa, and the yearly waste of life which is
occasioned by increase of that class of population, without in-
creased sanitary improvement, we are of opinion that great
advantages would result, were the authorities to make it a
point to ascertain what races of men are best fitted to in-
habit and develop the resources of the different colonies,
and the limits within which they could properly thrive and
increase.
M. Budin has giving the following "statistics of the sanitary
condition and mortality of forces by land and sea, as influenced
by season, localities, age, race, and national characters," quoted
by Martin. He considers that
1. The losses of armies from disease greatly exceed those in
time of war from the sword and fire of the enemy. In the
Walcheren expedition in 1809, the mortality of the English
army amounted to 16:7 deaths by wounds, and 332 by diseases
per 1000 of the strength.
2. The most trifling losses are experienced in general by
troops serving in their native country, and they augment in
European armies in a direct ratio as these approach the equator.
The inverse takes place with negro troops, among whom mor-
tality increases obviously in the direct ratio of their removal
from the tropics.
3. Even during a residence in their native country, European
armies are subject to a mortality exceeding, in a sensible
manner, that of the civil population at a corresponding age.
In certain tropical countries, Sierra Leone for example, the
mortality of the soldiers (483 deaths per 1000) surpasses the
proportion of deaths, which occurs in England among the male
population, at the age of 100 and upwards (454 per 1000).
4. In localities bordering closely upon each other, the mor-
tality often differs in a very marked degree. This ought to be
seriously considered in the selection of military stations and

places for garrisons, as well as in the choice of sites for barracks
and hospitals.
5. In tropical regions the annual number of deaths ranges
within very wide limits from one year to another, so that the
mortality of a single year cannot seem as a basis for estimating
the mean mortality of these countries.
6. In the most unhealthy tropical climates the judicious
choice of good positions on elevated grounds will often secure
to armies—composed of men of the Caucasian race—a per-
fectly healthy condition, worthy of the most favoured regions
of temperate climes. The degree of elevation required varies
in a marked manner with the geographical latitude and longi-
tude of the place. Residence on the high grounds is fatal to
negro troops.
7. The geological nature of the soil exerts a decided influ-
ence, not only on the sanitary condition and mortality of
armies, but also on the presence or absence of certain defects
which render a man unfit for military service.
8. The increase of the mortality of armies, especially in
warm climates, is determined in a great measure by the marshy
character of the localities occupied.
9. The mortality of the army in the different quarters of the
world considerably exceeds that of the navy.
10. In the temperate regions of Europe, the density of the
population in garrison towns tends to affect the sanitary condi-
tion, and augment the mortality of the troops. The relative
density of the population of the different quarters and streets
of a large town should be seriously considered in selecting
sites for barracks and hospitals.
11. Numerous facts militate against the hypothesis of a pro-
gressive amelioration in the sanitary condition of European
troops in warm climates in general, and particularly in tropical
regions, as an effect of length of residence.
12. In a military point of view, the knowledge of the patho-
genic march of the seasons in different parts of the globe, and
of the relation of the sanitary condition of armies with the

has not yet received the attention it deserves.
13. The pathogenic influence of the seasons is in a strict
dependence upon the quality of the soil, the latitude, longi-
tude, and elevation of the places, their position in the northern
and southern hemispheres, and the nationality and race of the
soldier.
14. In all countries where the influence of age has been
studied, the lowest mortality has been found to be that of sol-
diers from eighteen to twenty years of age.

genic action of climate, so that, under precisely similar circum-

DISEASES OF THE HOT SEASON.
Animal heat The hot season of Western Africa comprises the months of
February, March, April, October, and November. During this
period the heat of the sun is excessive in some places, and in
others it is only moderated by the sea breeze; the animal heat,
which in cold climates averages only 98°, increases from 2007
to 30:6. This determines the fluids of the body towards the
surface. There is a diminution of the number and depth of the
inspirations—a diminution of the quantity of oxygen inspired,
as well as in the percentage of carbonic acid expired; the
blood becomes venalised; the biliary secretion increases; the
urine contains a larger quantity of saline matter. The cutane-
ous surface is called upon to show increased activity, and to
perform vicarious duties, thus relieving the blood of the carbon
which the rarefied air prevents the lungs from removing. The
increase of this animal heat is considered to be dependent, to a
certain extent, "on the more rapid circulation and metamor-
phosis of the blood." The hot weather exercises at first a
stimulating, and then a sedative and depressing effect on the
great nervous centres.
"The hot season," writes Sir R. Martin, "swells the exterior,

and produces that general chubbiness of appearance which is
so remarkable in the torrid zone, even where the weight of the
body is sensibly diminished. It increases the animal heat, and
accelerates the pulse, accompanied by a prodigious increase of
the pulmonary and cutaneous transudations. It produces ner-
vous excitability varying in degree in most persons—an ex-
altation of the general sensibility ; eruptive diseases, latent
during the cold season, become actively developed ; and the
cutaneous vessels even in healthy persons are excited to the
extent of producing the distressing eczema solare, known in the
tropics by the name of prickly heat.
" Undue exposure, excessive fatigue, mental depression, or
neglect of temperance in diet, result in ardent fever, with
some serious local determination, and that very frequently to
the cerebral organs, occasionally to the liver. But though this
is admitted, under the measures of precaution, dictated by
common sense and experience, the very hottest are yet the
healthiest of our seasons, and of our stations also, which goes
far to prove that it is not heat alone that does all the mischief,
but something else in the climate, and in the constitution and
habit of the stranger European, not common to the native of
the country.".
During this period of the year there are many cases of diar- Diarrhea
rhwa and dysentery, and proportionally more so in places such tery in the
as the Gold Coast, where water is scarce, and the people live on"
tank or muddy swamp water; or in St Mary's and its neigh-
bourhood, where the well water is very brackish ; or at Lagos,
on the deltas of the Niger, where the water at this season is
highly impregnated with animal and vegetable matter. In
places where good and pure water is plentifully provided they
are not common, but form only occasional diseases. At
M'Carthy's Island, and in the countries interior of the Gambia
region, the month of October is the most unhealthy of this

MEDICAL CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.
Dysentery and diarrhea of the most fatal kind are of frequent
occurrence; virulent types of fever are very prevalent and
deadly. It is the worst month of this season.
The months of February, March, and April, although the
hottest in the year, especially in the Gambia region, are the
most healthy. The heat is only uncomfortable, and produces
great laxity of the constitution, yet it is the most healthy
period; there is scarcely any record of deaths, especially in the
interior countries, where the ground is parched and dried up,
and no swamp is anywhere to be seen. It is the ground-nut
season, and the time at which each merchant performs a great
deal of labour, and yet there is scarcely any case of fever, dysen-
tery, or diarrhæa; there may be now and then a little derange-
ment of the liver, but otherwise there is very little necessity for
a doctor. At M'Carthy's Island, where I acted as physician to
the natives, the dispensary was generally crowded during the
whole of the year, commencing in June, until the hot winds
began to blow, when there was scarcely a case in for months.
This proves without a doubt that the higher the temperature,
unmixed with humidity, the more healthy is the climate; but
if the temperature is high and surcharged with moisture, the
climate becomes very deadly.
At Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Gold Coast, and Bights, the
weather not being so hot, and being mixed with moisture from
their close proximity to the sea, the season is not so very
healthy as in the Gambia region, although in the two former
places it is comparatively so; and in the latter places the in-
habitants suffer much from diarrhea and dysentery.
The following is the medical statistical report of the Anama-
Anamaboe boe station (Gold Coast), forwarded by me to the civil autho-
rities whilst acting as physician to the natives in 1861 :-
" During the quarter ending the 31st March there were no
less than 920 patients in daily attendance in the dispensary
for medical aid. These present heterogeneous diseases, which,
for the sake of convenience, I have classified under four great

principally Badagry and Lagos. In the month of October, in
M'Carthy's Island, and St Mary's at Sierra Leone, and Liberia,
diarrhea and dysentery are of occasional occurrence during the
commencement of the rains, from the water being contamin-
ated with dead animal and vegetable matters which are washed
down into it, but they are only occasional diseases in these
places.
Lightning, The air during this period, especially from Sierra Leone to
electricity. the leeward coast, is highly charged with electricity; lightning
vivid and of long duration, and distant roars of thunder, are fre-
quent and constant. These fill the atmosphere with increased
quantities of ozone, which, as I shall hereafter prove, possess con-
siderable influence in checking the manifestation of fever. It
is now a well-known fact, that the best time for Europeans to
arrive on the coast so as to be exempt, at least for a time, from
fever is in November. This rule is strictly observed by the
Gambia merchants and the Church Missionary Society.
In November, on the coasts leeward of the Gambia, viz., from
Sierra Leone to the Bights, we have the acme of thunder-
storms, which are generally accompanied by fearful flashes of
lightning, thus filling the atmosphere with large quantities of
electricity.
The following are the observations of M. Pallas, of the
French Army in Algeria, as to the effects of electricity in
health and diseases (Martin):
"1. That just as light and air are the essential agents of
vision and respiration, so electricity is the functional agent of
innervation.
" 2. That the greater number of diseases, and especially those
which belong to the class of neurosis, are occasioned by the
exaggerated influence of general electricity, of which clouds,
storms, and marshy regions are the most fruitful sources.
" 3. Marshes in their geological constitution, and in the
effects which they produce upon the economy, present the
greatest analogy to the galvanic pile. Thus their action is
much the more baneful, as they contain certain proportions of

213
water, and their activity is considerably increased when the
water contains organic or saline matter in a state of solution.
This explains why salt marshes, and such as are near maran-
tine rivers, are the most insalubrious. The drying up or sub-
mersion of marshes produces analogous conditions to those of
a galvanic pile deprived of humidity, or which is under water,
and the effects of which are then insignificant. :
" 4. The researches of philosophers and physiologists have
shown that the electricity produced by our machines exerts a
special action upon the nervous system. Experience and
vigorous observations of facts prove that the diseases which
are produced by marshy atmospheres are primarily nervous,
and become inflammatory only by the reaction of the nerves
upon the vascular system, inducing consecutive, local, or gene-
ral irritation."
The neuroseo are occasioned generally by the effects of
electricity, and intermittent fevers have a similar origin; that
is to say, they are due to the electrical emanations of the
marshy pile, which are very active in hot countries, and not
to miasmata, which have never been met with.
I have before stated that in tropical climates the temperature Perspiration
of the body rises from 2° to 31° beyond its natural temperate
standard, but this increase does not go on in any proportion to
the increase of the atmospheric temperature. When this is
90° or 112° in shade, the temperature of the animal heat is
about the same, and this superabundance, which might accumu-
late through the increased heat of the surrounding medium,
the all-wise Creator has supplied animate beings with an appa-
ratus for carrying off. The great sweat glands remove from
the system, by means of the perspiration, all excess of heat. "To
obtain an estimate of the length of tube of the perspiratory sys-
tem of the whole surface of the body, 2800 may be taken as a
fair average of the number of pores in the square inch, and
700, consequently, of the number of inches in length. Now, the
number of square inches of surface in a man of ordinary height
and bulk, is 2500 ; the number of pores therefore 7,000,000,
in tropics.

and the number of inches of perspiratory tube, 1,750,000—that is,
145,833 feet, or 48,600 yards, or nearly twenty-eight miles."
This is a most important calculation, and shows what mischief
to the system will be the result when the functions of such an
extensive surface are obstructed.
The perspiration, therefore, is the great regulator and mode-
rator of the internal heat of the body. Through it, an individual
can live in the hottest weather; and by the power inherent in
him of generating heat, he is able to live in the coldest clime.
Mr Erasmus Wilson, in his "Treatise on the Skin," has most
truly stated that man can support the intense heat of the
tropics without much elevation of his inward heat, and that he
can live where the mercury is rendered a solid mass like lead, by
cold, without the most trifling depression of his vital warmth.
"But," writes he, "it must not be supposed that the constitution
of man is the same in these two opposite conditions ; it is, in-
deed, widely different; in the one he enjoys what may be
termed a summer constitution; in the other a winter constitu-
tion—the first harmonising with the summer heat, the second
resisting the winter cold.
Prickly heat. At this time of the year prickly heat is found to be very
troublesome, especially amongst new comers—the red pimples
or eruptions appearing in the breast, arms, neck, and sometimes
all over the body, producing the inost disagreeable and annoy-
ing sensation which none can understand except those who
have suffered from it. It is, however, a sign of good health,
and there is no remedy as yet that could be regarded as speci-
fic. Cold and acid lotions, lime juice, sulphuric acid lotion,
cold baths, cooling drinks, have all been used, but in vain.
The only remedies are palliative, consisting of "light clothing,
temperance in eating and drinking, avoidance of all exercise in
the heat of the day, open bowels," and the use of a large fan at
night.

l'espiration. The necessity for hydrocarbonaceous food is there-
fore lessened. Less of the elements of respiration'ought to be
taken in the food than would be taken in colder climates. In
consequence of the internal increase of temperature, less inter-
nal heat is required.
"Exercise increases the heat of the body by increasing the rate
of circulation and respiration. In a very hot climate all in-
crease of heat is undesirable. Moreover, the excessive heat ren-
ders muscular action impossible, because the circulation is
chiefly directed, in consequence of the activity of the skin, to
the surface, in order that fluid may be furnished for evapora-
tion, to keep down the heat of the body, to prevent the parch-
ing of the surface which otherwise must ensue.
"In consequence of the lessened muscular action, less of the
albuminous constituents of the food are required to supply the
waste of the muscles.
"Hence, in hot climates, less of both kinds of food should be
taken, and nature points this out in the absence of appetite.
To force an appetite stimulants are taken, and then the system is
overloaded with nourishment. The excessive perspiration re-
quires an excess of liquids ; but instead of water alone, sugar
and spirit—the elements of respiration-are taken with the
water as beer; and the spirit, by its stimulating properties, is
doubly injurious.
"The excessive flow of blood to the surface (the conse-
quence of the high temperature), no doubt prevents, for a time,
the evils resulting from an excess of the two kinds of food.
The chemical changes and evaporation going on in the skin
draw the circulation to the surface of the body, just as the
flame of the lamp draws the oil up the wick. Whilst the
high temperature lasts, this increased action of a flow to the
surface is kept up. It is probable that the action of the heart
is thereby made feeble by the excessive suction of the skin, as
we see it frequently is, temporarily, by the perspiration bath.
As soon as the temperature falls, the blood ceases to flow in ex-
cess through the skin. According to the degree of cold it is

almost driven from the surface. It accumulates within, and
congestions and inflammations are produced. Free action on

ness.
Within this range we meet with the most unhealthy period of Unhealthi-
the tropical year, the commencement of the rains and its ter- "
mination; and sometimes from meteoric causes, during the
whole of the rains, fevers of the most severe type are prevalent.
The temperature at the commencement of the rains falls a
great deal; the occasional showers produce a refreshing and
delightful feeling; the atmosphere becomes very moist and
warm ; vegetable and animal life, which before were in a
state of dormant vitality, now put on renewed life and vigour;
decomposition of animal and vegetable matter, accelerated by
the heat and moisture, is very rapid. The atmosphere is very
heavy in the mornings and evenings, and the horizon is covered
with fog and haze. When the heat of the sun is felt, it pro-
duces a great increase in the perspiration, which through the
moist air seems to exude from the various pores of the body
by transudation, and not by evaporation. The muscular
system becomes very much relaxed, the action of the heart
weak; there is a congestive state of the internal organs through
the venalised condition of the blood, and its receding from the
surface.
When the rains have not been plentiful at the commence-
ment, only coming occasionally, and being succeeded by very
hot days, when there has not been much thunder and light-
ning before and during its commencement, fever of the most
relaxing and congestive character, or epidemics of yellow fever,

are generally the consequence. Dysentery and diarrhæa are
also prevalent in places where good water cannot be obtained.
In Western Africa the commencement of the rains is more
unhealthy than their termination, although this period is gene-
rally very sickly.
There are many circumstances which combine to render the
season unhealthy-
Circumstan- l. The occasional occurrence of rain, with the subsequent
unhealthi- heat, leads to the formation of stagnant pools, rich in vegetable
and animal putrescent matter.
2. The clearing of the fields by farmers in preparation for
sowing, deprives the country of the salutary effects of vegetable
life, in absorbing the poisons of malarious effluvia emanating
from stagnant pools and other sources.
3. The diminished vitality of all the functions of the body;
and,
4. The great want of electric agencies in the atmosphere
(thunder and lightning), and the consequent diminution of
nature's universal disinfectant—ozone.
To prove that the commencement of this season is even
more unhealthy to the native population, I shall here quote
at length my medico-statistical report of Anamaboe station,
from 1st April to 20th May 1861, forwarded to the civil
authorities :-
The numerical relations between sickness and health during
the half section of the second quarter of the year, form an
interesting data for inquiring into the relative healthiness or
unhealthiness of the different sections of the year.
From meteoric circumstances, as well as practical observa-
tions, it is now universally acknowledged that the second quar-
ter of the tropical year is the most unhealthy part of the year.
During the first quarter of the year the number of daily
patients attending the dispensary to the 31st of March,
amounted to 920; whilst during the half section of the second
quarter, viz., from 1st April to 20th May (scarcely two months),
the number of daily patients was 1114.

219
The average daily number of patients who attended the
dispensary for the first quarter was 12:2, whilst for the sec-
tional part of the second quarter it was 22.2, showing an in-
crease of 10 per cent of daily attendance. From these facts
alone it is evident, that at this quarter of the year the station
under consideration was far more unhealthy than the preceding.
I shall now enter into detail respecting the different diseases
treated, and shall follow the division I had formerly adopted,
viz. :-
I. ZYMOTIC.
II. CONSTITUTIONAL.
III. LOCAL.
IV. VIOLENCE AND ACCIDENTS.
There were no less than 566 cases of zymotic diseases daily
treated. The most frequent were—rheumatism, 116; and
gonorrhæa, 100. It is remarkable that the number of dysen-
teric cases was fewer than was expected for the time of the
year; this may be accounted for from the fact that the
natives possess potent medicines for it, and, except in extreme
cases, they do not apply to the dispensary; so also with fever.
There were 83 cases of constitutional diseases; and 386 of
local diseases, of which ulcers (100) were the most frequent ;
violence and accidents numbered 79 cases.
I shall now conclude by stating, seriatim, the number of
daily cases treated in the dispensary, as well as those daily
treated in the houses of Poll Tax patients.
I. ZYMOTIC.—Ophthalmia, 60; diarrhæa, 12 ; dysenteria,
chronica and acuta, 30; febris intermittens, 22; hemicrania,
6; rheumatisma, 116; gonorrhæa, 100; strictura urethræ, 40;
scabies, 42; dysmenorrhagia, 60; porrigo, 18; orcheitis, 60.
II. CONSTITUTIONAL.--Debility, 45; phthisis pulmonalis, 10;
scrofula, 28.
III. LOCAL.--Hemiplegia, with spasmodic contraction, 60;
otitis, 26; bronchitis, 54; pneumonia, 18; dyspepsia, 6; con-
stipatio, 85; odontalgia, 10; psoriasis, 8; ulcers, 100; pedi-
culæ, 8 ; hydrocele, 9.

IV. VIOLENCE AND ACCIDENTS.— Vulnus incisum, 30; con-

The unhealthy season commences later in the Gambia region
than on any other part of the coast, as the commencement of
the rains is later. The sickly weather begins about the end
of June and during July. At Sierra Leone and Liberia the
rains commence early in May, and the sickness then begins to
manifest itself; and it is a known fact, that the report of epi-
demic is generally heard of one or two months at Sierra Leone
ere it is heard of in the Gambia. On the Gold Coast station
the commencement of the rains is not so unhealthy, from the
exposed state of the different stations to the constant sea
breeze and the perfect ventilation which is the result. Lagos
and other parts in the Bights, not being so much exposed as
the Gold Coast, are very unhealthy.
One of the causes of the unhealthiness of the beginning of
the rains is the diminution of atmospheric ozone. The effect
of this important agent in malarious fever has occupied my
particular attention. Being stationed for some time in the hot-
beds of malaria, I had ample opportunities of observing the
various changes which take place in the system when under
the operation of both.
The quantity of ozone in the atmosphere has an indisput-
able effect on the influence of fever in malarious districts;
when it exists in large quantities cases of fever are generally
few, and when in small quantities, fever is more frequent and
of longer duration.
When the quantity of ozone in the atmosphere is very large,
one may with impunity expose himself, in places where
malaria is rife, without the manifestation of its constitutional
effect for days or even weeks; and although a large quantity
of ozone in the air destroys evidently a large quantity of the
substance we know as the harbinger of fever, itself, at the
same time, undergoing decomposition and destruction, yet
still that which remains may be inhaled in sufficient quantity
to lead to a paroxysm, although prevented from manifesting

221
itself by the powerful influence of ozone, which is taken into
the system by respiration and impression on the exposed sen-
tient surface.
It would appear that the quantity of ozone taken into the
lungs, or the quantity taken into the system, in an undecom-
posed state, is insufficient to neutralise, or destroy in toto, the
quantity of malaria accumulated in the system. When the
latter is in large quantity, it can only prevent it from mani-
festing its paroxysmal phenomena. Two cases which I care-
fully watched will be sufficient to illustrate the opinion
above stated. An officer who lived with me in the same fort
was very fond of sporting. During the latter end of April
1860 he was accustomed to go out shooting every morning in
the marshy swamp along the banks of the lagoon, in the
Bight of Benin, but he was never ill. The quantity of ozone
in the atmosphere was very large, ranging, at an average—the
maximum during day, 8°; minimum, 1°; during the night,
maximum, 9º.2; minimum, 2°. When the quantity diminished,
which it did in the middle of May, none being detected on some
days, the maximum average in the day was 1° ; minimum, 0°2;
in the night, maximum, 595; minimum, 0º4. Without at
all exposing himself, he had a severe attack of remittent
fever, which was only cured after a large quantity of quinine
had been administered ; and without a subsequent exposure,
he had a fit regularly every two weeks as severe as the first, and
to put a stop to its mischievous effects on the system, I ordered
quinine to be taken a day before the end of the two weeks, or
the expected day of the attack, which had the desired effect of
preventing its recurrence.
The other case is my own, occurring during the latter part
of June of the same year. I was accustomed every evening to
go out shooting on the marshy banks of the lagoon, and was
perfectly free from any attack of fever, although from the small
quantity of rain which fell, and the unusual burning heat of
the sun, I was perfectly certain that a large quantity of malaria
was being generated from these sources. The quantity of

ozone in the atmosphere was then very large, being, during
the day, maximum, 10°; minimum, 1°; and during the night,
maximum, 8°; minimum, 39. I desisted from the expedi-
tion from having no small shot, and used then to take
my walks on the shores of the Atlantic, and consequently
beyond the reach of malaria. But a week after, when the
ozonometer fell, the feverish symptoms began, producing entire
loss of sleep, with severe headache, and continued for three
days, but were subdued on the fourth day. The quantity of
quinine taken was comparatively small, being only six grains.
A week after I had another attack, but three hours later than
the first. I now, however, took the precaution of taking
quinine on the morning of the next Saturday, and similarly
for some time, until I was perfectly free from fever. Other
like cases might be cited, all tending to prove more or less
the point in question. Sometimes the quantity of malaria
taken into the system is so great that the small quantity of
ozone absorbed is not sufficient to keep it in check, and in
such a case the effect quickly manifests itself.
When there is a large quantity of ozone in the atmosphere, a
small quantity of quinine alone is sufficiently requisite to check
malarious fevers. Six grains are sufficient in an ordinary case;
but when the quantity of ozone is small, more than double that
quantity will be insufficient, and, indeed, in many such cases I
have been obliged to give from fifteen to twenty-four grains
before I could check its progress.
The conclusions to be deduced from the foregoing are :
1. That the larger the amount of ozone in the atmosphere,
the smaller will be the number of malarious fevers prevalent or
manifesting themselves; on the contrary, the smaller the quan-
tity of ozone the greater and more fatal will be the number of
cases of fever amongst the population, coeteris paribus.
2. The quantity of ozone in the atmosphere, even when
large, does not neutralise the whole of the malaria generated
from the different beds scattered on the earth's surface, but a
certain quantity is always left, which is absorbed and accumu-

223
lated in the system until a quantity is received sufficient to
overbalance the vital changes in the different essential organs,
or the proper motion of the sympathetic action, leading to the
development of the fever.
3. That in cases where there is a large quantity of ozone in
the atmosphere, the quantity received and absorbed through
the lungs and the general surface into the system undecom-
posed, aided by the chemico-vital changes, is able to check the
manifestation of its influence, but not entirely to annihilate it.
4. That when the quantity of atmospheric ozone is small,
and consequently a small quantity, or none at all, is absorbed
into the system, the chemico-vital changes being no longer
able alone to prevent the manifestation of the poison, the fever
bursts forth in full vigour.
Chemistry has not as yet supplied us with the means of
collecting and preserving ozone to any length of time. Being
a powerful oxidising agent, its formation is easily followed by
its decomposition or deoxidation; and when the chemist will
tell the physician that he has found a method by which he can
not only form a large quantity of ozone, but preserve it for a
considerable time undecomposed, the physician will say that
he has at his command a powerful means for checking the pro-
gress of malarious fever far superior to that of quinine.
From noticing the effects of small quantities of ozone in the
air on patients suffering from fever in malarious districts, I am
led to conclude, that should the chemical experiments succeed,
we shall be able to cure endemic fever as soon as the symptoms
begin to manifest themselves, and the system will be freed from
the tedious and exhausting process of cold and sweating stages.
Although the quantity of ozone in the atmosphere may be
small when compared with the constituents of the air, being,
under ordinary circumstances, according to M. Bérigny of Ver-
sailles, only one part in ten thousand, yet it must be admitted,
that when in any quantity, some portion cannot but be absorbed
in the mucous and general surfaces, and be able to affect the
system. This is clearly proved, when we consider that a

healthy man in twenty-four hours absorbs no less than
576.000 cubic inches of air; that he breathes twenty times in
a minute, and at such times takes into his lungs twenty cubic
inches of air. This volume of air, impregnated with any sub-
stance, hygienic (ozone) or mephitic (malarious), comes in
contact at each respiration with no less than 201.600 square
inches of absorbing surface in the air-passages and bronchial
cells. If, then, the ozone in the atmosphere is pretty well
developed, a quantity could be absorbed sufficient to check or
put a stop to a moderate quantity of malaria.
Along the Bights, on the Guinea Coast of Africa, the lagoon
is the source of the most deadly emanations; and I may here
quote, verbatim et literatim, a sanitary report of Quittah station
(Bight of Benin) for the two weeks ending the 31st May
1860, which I forwarded to the principal medical officer of the
Gold Coast command :-
"In viewing the sanitarium for the last two weeks of May,
I have to report very unfavourably with respect to the amount
of disease, when compared with the corresponding weeks in
the preceding months. It substantiates the now universally
believed fact, that the beginning of the rains is the most un-
healthy time in the year, fever being more virulent than at any
other period, even more than at the harvest or end of the rains.
" The sanitarium of Quittah station may be examined inter-
nally, that is, within the fort, and externally, in the town and
neighbouring villages. In the fort much mischief does not
exist amongst the men. Besides two cases of fever, there were
one of Guinea-worm and one of orcheitis, viz., one in 5:3 ill.
" In the towns and neighbouring villages there had been
several cases of fever, some very severe, others mild, both
amongst native and foreign inhabitants, either of long or short
residence.
" It would appear that vessels in the roads are not exempt
from it. Not that the infection travels over the sea, haud
quaquam, but they obtain the infection by landing, as soon
becomes manifest. Facts corroborate this statement, for the

captain of the 'St Hiliers,' a merchant brig from Jersey, was
landed a corpse at Quittah, a few days ago. From inquiry I
found that four days ago he landed at Lagos, and on his way
from that place to Quittah, which occupied only three days
under sail, he had the fever, and died just as the vessel arrived
in port. .
" Meteorological phenomena went decidedly to account for
this unhealthiness. On the 11th and 26th there was not the
slightest trace of ozone in the atmosphere, whilst in some days
only 0°1, 0º2, and 0°:4 could be obtained, contrary to the high
degrees I had obtained in the preceding months. The maxi-
mum degree of thermometer was in the morning, 81°:10; noon,
86°; eveniny, 83°45. Minimum-morning, 75°; noon, 80° ;
evening, 78°. Dew-point.—Maximum-morning, 78°; noon,

noon, 87700; evening, 906°0. Minimum-morning, 818°4;
noon, 675º.2; evening, 695º8.
"What, then, is the origo mali ? I answer, the lagoon par
Cxcellens."
It has sometimes been asserted by foreign inhabitants, re-
siding south of the Volta, that the lagoon does not give out
malaria, that, in fact, it is healthy—advancing, as a presumptive
reason, that "its water is a salt water, and salt water is op-
posed to malaria." When we consider the number of cases of
paludal fever which occur in the region, and that the only
marsh is to be found in the lagoon, one could hardly account
for it otherwise. I have always maintained, and I do still
positively believe, that the lagoon is the source of this pesti-
ferous poison.
1st, Because it contains a less amount of salt than the water
of the sea, the proportion being about one-fourth.
2d, Because at its banks vegetable and animal putrescent

matters are to be found, which, when washed of their salt by the
rain, form an abundant source of malaria.
3d, Because its banks, which extend about 250 to 300 feet
(breadth), covered with low, rank grass, form generally several
beds, which receive the rain-water, and become stagnant pools,
which are prolific in the generation of littoral poison.
Paludal or littoral poison is given out in deadly quantity
from these sources, drifted by the W., W.S.W., N. and N.E.
winds; cæteris paribus, it becomes pernicious to individuals re-
siding in those tracts of land lying on the border of the sea.
Ergo, the lagoon is undoubtedly the source of malaria.
To prove more substantially that the lagoon is the fons et origo
mali, on the evening of the 18th May I went down the banks
of the lagoon, and walked slowly up and down for twenty
minutes, exposing myself in every conceivable way to the
effects of malaria. Every circumstance was favourable to its
generation. The breeze was blowing from W.S.W., along a
tract of the malarious beds for at least twenty miles; the vege-
tation near where I stood had been removed by farmers, and
rank vegetation and pools of stagnant water were almost under
my feet. On referring to the meteorological observation which
I kept, I found the ozonometer to be as low as 0°.5; during the
whole of the day the thermometer was 84°; dew-point, 73° ;
hygrometer, 9° ; saturation of the atmosphere, 69508; tension
of aqueous vapour, 1°104. The quantity of ozone, which is
nature's grand and stupendous neutraliser of malaria, was
remarkably small. This is proved to be a positive fact by
comparison with the corresponding day of the two preceding
months, which we find to have been in March 6°•4, and in
April 4º1 The other observations on the same evening in
April stood as follow—thermometer, 85°; dew-point, 78°;
hygrometer, 7°; saturation of the atmosphere, 771°:1; tension
of aqueous vapour, 1°-241.
I returned to the fort, and as a precaution, in order that,
should I get the fever, it might not be too strong, I took one
grain of the disulphate of quinine. I slept very sound that

night; but in the morning I felt a little seedy, though I thought
nothing of it. I lost my appetite, and began to feel a degree
of lassitude, langour, and weariness, as the day advanced, and
I felt that I could not apply my mental powers to anything.
I therefore lay down quietly. At two o'clock I felt a burn-
ing sensation all over my body, commencing from my feet. I
had a severe headache, and, in fact, all the symptoms of remit-
tent fever in the form in which it generally attacks one. The
sweating stage came on at half-past seven, and I was then re-
lieved, but still suffered from severe headache. I now used the
proper means for preventing its reappearance, which succeeded.
The next day I felt much better, but rather weak, and suffered
from slight headache, and in three days after the exposure I
felt as well as before.
The facts to be gathered from this are, not only that malaria
exists in the lagoon, but that it also exists in a very concen-
trated form ; that its influence is speedily manifested in the
system, although it is probable that in some individuals it may
not show itself for some days.
The lagoon, therefore, or its banks, form several beds from
which are generated certain deadly poisons, which, in contact
with the human system, produce those phenomena known as
fever, quod erat demonstrandum.
Whilst considering the subject of ozone in reference to fever, Lesions in
I cannot pass over the very important view of Mr Richard thetic system
Hughes as to the periodicity of ague, and the rationale and milarious
modus operandi in the treatment with quinine and arsenic. fer
Hitherto we have been perfectly ignorant of the action of
quinine in rapidly checking the debilitating and deteriorating
effects of ague, but the views now entertained seem to throw
some light on the subject.
He argued, from the coincidental effects produced by the
cold stage of ague, viz., the chill, desertion of the blood from
the superficial capillaries, and the consequent paleness, dry
and rough skin, and sunken features, quick and anxious re-
spiration, feeble pulse, and diminished secretion; and that pro-
the sympa-
fever.

duced by the galvanization of the sympathetic nerves in the
neck, as exemplified by the experiments of M. Broun-Sequard,
viz., dilatation of the pupils, desertion of the blood from the
superficial vessels, diminution or absolute check of the secre-
tions, and the lowering of the temperature and all vital func-
tions, *_that the cold stage of ague may be produced artificially
by the excitation of the sympathetic nerves upon which de-
pend the contraction of the blood-vessel. The hot stage is
produced by a natural reaction of the blood-vessels to even
beyond their natural calibre, which phenomenon is observed
also in the division of the sympathetic nerve.
From noticing these circumstances, he came to the conclu-
sion that the sympathetic system was the part of the organism
specially affected by malarious poison, and that the phenomena
of ague depend on a periodical excitement of it by the poison,
"followed by an unequally immoderate reaction in the oppo-
site direction, which latter at length settled down the equili-
brium of health."
As I have served for some time in the hot-beds of malaria,
where aguish and other paludal fevers were of daily occurrence,
and where the atmosphere teems with pestiferous ghastly mias-
matic exhalations, especially at some seasons, from the com-
bined sources of the ever-swampy banks of the lagoon, lake
pools of stagnant fresh water, and ochletic poison from the effete
matter of both man and beast, made indiscriminately in the
streets and lanes of large and populous towns, I think I may
be allowed to offer an opinion on the subject.
The view as to the sympathetic system being the organism
attacked by malarious or paludal poison, will enable us to
explain many of the concomitant symptoms of intermittent and
other fevers; and although pathological lesions have not as
yet been found in that system enough to enlighten us as to its
true nature and condition, yet still we are enabled, by the
various changes in the viscera, in the neighbourhood of, and
abundantly supplied by, the sympathetic system, to believe

that there must be some changes in the sympathetic ganglia
which lead to those morbid changes in these visceræ.
One great and troublesome symptom is the severe vomiting
or nausea which invariably accompanies ague in Africa. As
the sympathetic system governs the functional action of the
stomach and bowels, then, as a necessary sequence, its derange-
ment produces a derangement also in the healthy actions of
that organ. There is generally, in these cases, an aversion to
food, but very great thirst. The vomiting in many cases is
exceedingly alarming, and prostrates the patient, especially if he
has been addicted to a too liberal use of alcoholic liquors. It
may be assumed, that the deranged sympathetic nerve which
supplies the stomach leads to the secretion of substances from
the blood which produce a constant irritation, and which
cannot be sustained, and therefore must be evacuated. The
secretion of only a small quantity keeps up a constant state of
nausea without any evacuation, and the cessation bespeaks the
restored healthy action of the nerve.
Effects of ague on the spleen, liver, and lymphatics. The
spleen, I need not add, is supplied with a lash of nerves from
the splenic plexus of the semilunar ganglion. By repeated
occurrence of ague, as in several cases I have seen on the coast
of Africa, the spleen becomes very much hypertrophied. It
becomes reduced in size by the use of quinine and iron and the
iodine paint, but another attack of ague, or even undue exposure
to the malarious poison, although without the manifestation
of the fever, is sufficient to produce re-enlargement. .
This enlargement has hitherto been considered as produced
by the poison in the blood, but several considerations have led
me to doubt the truth of the assertion. When we consider the
effect that will be produced by undue excitement or irritation
of the lash of nerves with which it is supplied, the increased
activity which is given to the vessels distributed in it, and the
enormous engorgement which will follow as a consequence, the
undue enlargement is at once explained. This enlargement,
in the first case, if the nervous excitement is not much pro-

longed, gradually disappears without the use of any medica-
ment; but when it assumes a chronic character, its reduc-
tion becomes exceedingly slow; it seems as if it would
become permanent, and therefore requires the use of powerful
drugs to reduce it. In children the reduction takes place
quicker than in adults ; for in many cases under my care, no
sooner was the quinine, iron, and iodine paint employed, than
the enlargement began rapidly to reduce.
The effects on the liver are not so well marked as in the
spleen, as the enlargement, although definite, is still slow, ex-
cept when accelerated by the too immoderate use of spirituous
liquor.
The lymphatics of the intestines being supplied by the
sympathetic nerves, share the same fate, but the swelling is
generally moderate.
Headache.—In some individuals I have seen ague begin with
severe headache, after an exposure in malarious districts. The
headache is generally very intense, with burning sensations all
over the body. This, in most cases, is accompanied with a
feeling of nausea, and assumes the character of nervous head-
ache, which pain, according to Dr Symonds, is located in the
vaso-motor of the sympathetic nerves of the brain and skull.
In almost every case of ague the patient suffers more or less
from headache.
The periodic fits.-From arguments drawn from the rhythmi-
cal action of the heart, and the periodical monthly phenomenon
of menstruation in the female uterus, both of which organs are
principally supplied with, and exclusively animated by the
sympathetic ganglia distributed in them, Mr Hughes draws the
conclusion, that the periodical character of ague is dependent
upon a periodicity impressed upon the sympathetic system,
and manifested in all the phenomena, morbid and natural,
over which it presides.
Assuming this data to be correct, the action of quinine and
arsenic, and also of ozone, can be easily explained by admitting
that they produce a powerful effect upon the sympathetic

constituent
system. The two former medicines are introduced through
the proper channel, viz., the stomach, and the last, ozone,
through the lungs, and by an immediate effect on the sympa-
thetic nerves distributed over the general sentient surface. This
powerful effect is remarkably observed in the case of a flash of
forked lightning, which leads to the formation of extraordinary
quantities of ozone in the atmosphere.
The observations above detailed respecting the powerful
check ozone has over malarious fevers, its existence putting a
veto on the effects of malarious poisons, go far to substantiate
this opinion ; although it might as well be stated here, that in
some extraordinary seasons, from purely epidemic influences,
fever breaks out amongst the inhabitants, ozone being mode-
rately plentiful in the air; but in these cases the fever is easily
subdued.
A few months ago Dr Bence Jones and M. Dupré, whilst Quinine a

closely resembling the alkaloid of cinchona, which they call
Anima quinoidine, and which they regard as the earliest pro-
ducts of the downward passage of albumen. Dr Bence Jones
believes that quinine acts by supplying artificially a natural
constituent of the animal economy which has been destroyed
by the poison of marshy swamps or other causes.
The experiments were made with a view to ascertain the
rate at which substances passed into and out of the textures.
"They chose quinine because of its effects, or rather the effect
of an acid solution of it, upon light. Quinine was given to one
guinea pig and withheld from another. Both were killed.
The organs and tissues of each were subjected to a process of
heating in a water-bath with very dilute sulphuric acid, and
from the tissues of the one that had not taken quinine was
extracted a fluorescent substance, the solution of which acted
on the spectrum almost precisely as the solution of quinine.
Not only by the mode of its extraction from the tissues and its
behaviour towards light was this substance not to be distin-
guished from quinine, but in its chemical actions with various

other substances."* When this shall have been confirmed by
further similar experiments, and by experiments also on the
bodies of men and animals residing in malarious districts, we
may then possibly arrive at a most satisfactory explanation of
the action of quinine.
Ozone a It has also been lately attempted to prove that ozone is a
stituent of natural constituent of, or present, in the human blood. Herr
Kühne made some experiments to prove its existence, but he
did not obtain it in the gaseous form. He considers, however,
" that when blood saturated with carbonic oxide is perfectly
free from oxygen and incapable of absorbing oxygen, it never-
theless possesses the power of converting the oxygen with
which it comes in contact into ozone." The action of blood
corpuscles he considers to be like finely divided platinum ;
they ozonise the oxygen, without undergoing any change
themselves.
Dr John Day of Victoria has been experimenting with
ozone as a means of purifying the air. He obtained ozone in a
very simple way, viz., by moistening the interior of a bell glass
receiver, or a large mouthed glass with ether, and plunging
into it a glass rod previously heated in a flame of a spirit lamp.
The reaction produced was truly characteristic of ozone. It
quickly destroyed sulphuretted hydrogen, converted sulphite of
lead into sulphate, liberated iodine from iodide of potassium,
rapidly decolorised a solution of sulphate of indigo, thus proving
that it possesses powerful bleaching properties, oxidised iron
and silver when slightly moistened, coagulated albumen and
casein, altering their colour, and giving them a greenish tinge,
and inhaled for some time it produced intense headache and
sore throat.
Ozone thus made keeps for a long time within the bottle,
and can be taken out by rubbing any substance, a towel, for in-
stance, in the interior of the bottle; the towel becomes ozonised,
and remains so for some time. "Viewing ozone as oxygen in
a dynamical condition," says Dr Day, "its increased activity

giving it the power of rapidly converting the products of animal
and vegetable decomposition into innocuous compounds, I began
to test the power of this chemical ozone in a privy, the atmo-
sphere of which was highly charged with sulphuretted hydro-
gen, and probably other deleterious gases. Before commencing
operations, I placed a vessel containing a weak solution of per-
manganate of potash on the seat, the lead being raised. In an
hour the colour was perfectly destroyed. I then placed large
glass jars, which had been ozonised by means of ether, and a
hot glass rod in several parts of the privy; and by this, and
other methods about to be described, I have kept the air so
pure, that a solution of permanganate of potash, of the same
strength as that first used, will retain its colour for several
days." By the means here adopted, sheets, blankets, beds,
clothing, bandages, lint, and many other substances, might be
ozonised and used as powerful disinfectants.
Ozone is generated by the vapour of the oil of turpentine,
oil of cajeput, carbolic, and pyroligneous acid, creosote, naphtha,
coal-tar, and even chloroform. Might it not be of great ser-
vice when epidemic visitation takes place, that ozone should
be used for purifying the air of chambers, &c. ?-or be continu-
ally used in places where malaria is continually generated ?

of 1866.
Yellow fever Every inhabitant of the River Gambia will long remember
the epidemic outbreak of yellow fever during the year 1859,
and no one will forget the ravages which a pestilential endemic
outbreak committed amongst the few European inhabitants of
Bathurst in 1866. The demon of the marsh had an unfettered
scope over the whole population, white and black — the
former suffering from yellow fever of the most malignant form,
and the latter from bilious remittent fever, and dysentery and
diarrhoea. The cry ran through every lip that the destroying
anget was hovering over the small swampy island of St Mary's,
and "who will be spared to see the end of the season?"
St Mary's, as we have seen, is surrounded on the west, south-
west, and south, by the most pestilential mangrove swamp,
over which, during the blowing of the south-west monsoon,
the wind must pass, and waft its deadly emanations into
the town of Bathurst. When the rainy season commences
with much lightning and thunder and plenty of rain, this
poisonous exhalation is greatly neutralised, although not entirely
destroyed, and the season is considered healthy, because the

type of fever is generally mild, being mostly of the intermittent
variety. When there is little thunder and lightning, and
a plentiful quantity of rain, the type of fever is more severe,
being of the remittent variety, accompanied with severe conges-
tion; but when the demon of the marsh is allowed to exercise
its deadly influence unrestrained by any such phenomena, there
being no thunder or lightning, and but very little rain, fever
of the most malignant type becomes prevalent, such as yellow
fever and ardent congestive fever.
The commencement of the rainy season of 1866 in the Meteoric ob-
River Gambia was marked with unusual calm, the thermo-
inetrical observations during the months of May and June,
instead of being higher than those of July and August, were
comparatively lower. The fall of the thermometer in May,
after the hot days in April, was not gradually maintained, but
the thermometer again rose in July and August, when it
should have been further lowered.
The maximum daily thermometrical observation for the
month of May was 99°, and this was the height about the latter
part of the month, and during eight days. In June it was 99°
for nine days, especially during the latter part. In July it was
99° for no less than twenty days out of the thirty, and for
August 99° during fourteen days of the month, proving that the
maximum thermometer of July and August was not lower
than that of May and June, but that there were, in fact, more
hot days in the first two than in the last two months.
The minimum daily thermometrical register was in May 60°
during ten days; in June, 60° during fifteen days; in July,
60° during twenty-three days; and in August, 60° during
twenty-two days.
The mean observations prove also that the months of July
and August, instead of being colder, were hotter than the months
of May and June. The maximum mean daily thermometer in
May was 80°.9 during two days of the month ; on the 29th
it was 79°4; in June it was 84°2 during one day; on the
20th it was 82°:8; 21st, it was 82°4; 3d, it was 82°-2. In

July it was 85° during one day; on the 15th it was 83°:9;
11th, was 83°:8; 14th, was 830:6. In August it was 85°:1
during one day; on 2d, it was 84º ; 4th, it was 83°1.
The minimum mean daily thermometer in May was 70°.1
and 70°6 during two days; in June, 75°0 and 750.8 during
two days; in July, 78°:0, 78°.1, 78°.6 during three days; in
August, 70°:1, 72°:3 during two days.
The maximum daily range shows that the highest range was
more persistent in July and August than in May and June,
when the contrary should have been the case. The maximum
daily range of the thermometer in May was 39° during only
one day; for three days it was 38°; in June it was 39° for
four days, and during four days it was 38°; but in July it
was 39° during fourteen days, and 38° during seven days;
in August it was 39° for ten days, and during eight days it
was 38°.
In examining the minimum daily range, we find that the
months of July and August show the highest range. In May
it was 21° during one day in the month, and the next lowest
register was 23°. In June it was 23° during one day, the
next lowest being 27°; but in July it was 29° during one day,
the next lowest was 33° ; and in August it was 27° during two
days, and the next lowest was 29°
The pluviametrical observations prove also that the rain-fall
was extremely small; in fact, we might justly state, in a com-
parative point of view, that there had scarcely been any rain
during the months of May, June, July, and August, the quan-
tity being only sufficient to allow animal and vegetable
putrefaction to take place undisturbed. In May there were
only two days of rain-fall, and the quantity in inches was 10:4.
In June it was still less; a slight drizzle on the 23rd, the
quantity :01 inches. In July the quantity was 6.72 for
thirteen days of rain, and in August the quantity was 19.84
for twenty days of rain. In the preceding chapter (X.,
page 187) I have shown that at Sierra Leone the total quan-
tity of rain-fall in 1829, for the month of June, was 64:55

METEORIC OBSERVATIONS.
237
inches; for July, 125.55 inches; and for August, 123-80. Still
later, in 1858, the total quantity for May was 8.95 inches,
which is more than the quantity of rain-fall in July 1866 at
the Gambia by 2:23 inches; in June it was 12:27 inches; and
in July, 23:50. In 1860, the quantity in May was 10-24
inches; June, 15:3 inches; and August, 26.86 inches.
It will be seen at once from the above, that the quantity of
rain-fall in the River Gambia for 1866 had been remarkably
small, after making all allowances for its position within the
zone of the trade-winds, the whole quantity for the four
months of May, June, July, and August, being only 27.71
inches; that is, 0-85 inches of rain-fall more than what took
place at Sierra Leone for the month of August in 1860.
Again, on the breaking out of the monsoon, in the month of
May and in June, there are always thunder and lightning,
fierce and vivid, which purify the atmosphere from the deadly
emanations which are produced by the occasional rain and the
accompanying heat. In 1866, however, there was no tornado
or lightning, and thunderstorms were not heard. It was a
calm, quiet season, and the old inhabitants prognosticated that,
should the weather continue, there would be a great deal of
sickness. The practical governor, with his clerk of works, Mr
J. B. Campbell, went about the town ordering the inhabitants
to clean their streets, to drain all stagnant pools, to root out
rank vegetation, and to observe bodily cleanliness, as they an-
ticipated cholera or other malignant fever.
The wind was at this time blowing from south-west and
north-west, over an extensive unhealthy mangrove swamp
seven miles in length, scarcely less dangerous than the classic
Pontine marsh ; the rank vegetation was just growing; the
ebb tide left amongst it and the aerial roots of the man-
groves, deposits from the sea and river; the burning heat, with
the little rain, favoured exhalations from the alluvial soil of
which Bathurst is composed, as well as the deadly effects
of Half Die, which during the waumie is half under water.
All these neutralised the efforts of Governor D'Arcy and his

clerk of works, and yellow fever of the most fatal type broke
out amongst the inhabitants.
Being stationed, at its first outbreak, in the sanitarium at
Cape St Mary's, I was enabled to compare the effects of the
south-west breeze in the two places when I was ordered in.
At the Cape the air was moist, exhilarating, and pure, containing
a large quantity of ozone, which it derives from the surface of
the sea. As one enters into Bathurst, only a distance of seven
and a half miles, the air is oppressive, and has the properties
of a "tainted vapour-bath." It produces a feeling of langour
and oppression, of general lassitude and weakness, with a pro-
fuse and exhausting perspiration ; vital activity seems to be
much weakened and diminished; all energy forsakes the body,
and man seems to vegetate rather than live. This was my
feeling when I first rode up from Cape St Mary's to Bathurst,
when the yellow fever was making a terrible havoc amongst
the few European inhabitants in the colony.
The first case of yellow fever was in a large French house.
The clerk, who was very temperate, as most Frenchmen are in
tropical climates, was attacked under circumstances of rather a
peculiar nature. He was up in the morning in perfect health,
and was engaged weighing some cow-hides. There was among
them one hide which had not been properly dried, and had
become putrefied, and the smell from it made him vomit a
great deal. Even the native labourers who were employed
were sick froin it. The clerk took to his bed, black vomit
came on, and he died from a decided and rapid case of yellow
fever. This took place about the end of June. In July
and beginning of August, as we have seen, the thermometer
continued persistently high, and there was only a small
rain-fall. The fever spread through the town with increased
violence, and one, and another, and another, fell victims to its
deadly grasp. The agent and another clerk died in that French
house, and the rest ran away to a more healthy clime. Amongst
the victims of the yellow fever were two medical officers, viz.,
Dr Hammond, staff assistant surgeon, who had only a few days

before arrived from England, and Dr Calvert, staff surgeon and
principal medical officer, who was much respected and deeply
mourned by the inhabitants, and who having taken an active
part in the epidemic visitation of yellow fever in the Gambia
in 1859, had volunteered to come from his station at M'Carthy's
Island to Bathurst.
From the foregoing it will be perceived that the yellow fever
in Bathurst, River Gambia, in the year 1866, was purely
endemic, that it had its origin from local and atmospheric
causes, and that it was confined only to a very limited area.
When the yellow fever was raging, Governor D'Arcy, with the
aid of his councillors, passed a most important ordinance,
which might really serve as a guide to all the Coast Govern-
ments. He formed a Sanitary Commission, consisting of five or
six members, whose duty it was to attend to the cleanliness and
other matters relative to the health of the town. I shall here give
the ordinance in full, trusting that when such a fearful visitation
takes place, as is almost always the case at the beginning of
the rains at Freetown and Sierra Leone, similar measures will
be adopted for saving the lives of Her Majesty's subjects :-

causes of the
yellow fever.
About the beginning of September there was an entire Meteoric
change in the meteoric state of the country. The ther- cessation of
mometer, which had been constantly high, began steadily to v
reduce. For the first few days of the month the quantity of
rain-fall was plentiful and constant. During the outbreak
there was a constant grayish or bluish-gray haze over the
town of Bathurst, commencing from Half Die to the burial
ground, which was seen from the Cape, and which was not dis-
persed by the breeze. This heavy cloud was no longer visible,
but only a mist, easily dispersed as soon as the sun was up.
The wind was still blowing from the malarious swamp, but
the atmosphere seemed more bracing and less depressing.
For nine successive months, i.e., since December, there had
scarcely been any thunder or lightning. In the thunder
months of May, June, and July, there was none heard, nor
was there any lightning; but now the reserved electricity
seemed, as it were, to explode with immense rapidity and force.
Every evening and night the lightning, in splendid forms of
zig-zag, sheet, and forked, flashed from skies to skies, and
then darted on the negatively-electrified ground, accompanied
with tremendous roars and explosions of the vast atmospheric
Leyden jar. On the night of the 12th instant, at 12 o'clock,
there was such a severe thunder-storm, without rain or tornado,
that it woke nearly all the inhabitants from their deepest sleep.
The heavens seemed to quake in such a way as had not been
heard for years. The morbific influence of the marsh was in-
capable of withstanding the produce of so powerful an agent.
The grayish-blue mist, which had for nearly six weeks hung
over the town of Bathurst, was dispersed. All the yellow
fever cases began rapidly to decline; no new case, even
amongst new arrivals, was registered; the Europeans, instead
of having the yellow jack, now got mild remittent fever; and
the natives, who were laid up in scores with severe bilious
remittent, now got the mild intermittent. The number of
European inhabitants at the time of the outbreak was thirty,
and fifteen fell victims to its deadly grasp.

Yellow fever
and sea
voyage
The endemic outbreak of yellow fever, therefore, we might
fairly state, died away, principally from the materies morba
being destroyed by the products of lightning and thunder-
storms, and the draining and flooding effect of heavy rain.
In the epidemic of yellow fever in Sierra Leone in 1858 and
1859, there was not one case in the barracks, which, as we
have before described, is situated on a great elevation in the
centre of the town. This proves how powerfully hygienic is
elevation in preventing the spread of malarious disease, and
should lead to the occupation of the high lands behind the
city.
It was the practice during that epidemic to send men who
were suffering from yellow fever on a sea voyage by the con-
tract mail steamer; the result proved this practice to be very
injurious. In a commencing case, the sea air, with the incon-
venience of " on board the ship "under a tropical heat, seems to
accelerate the effects of the poison by acting on the liver.
From all the accounts I could gather from the captains, there
was not a case of recovery amongst those who embarked
whilst suffering from the fever. They generally died before or
about the fourth or fifth day. Most of them suffered from severe
delirium. Of three cases that died on board the " Ethiope"
in one of her voyages, two were delirious for a couple of days
before death, and one for twenty-four hours. The black vomit
commenced as soon as they were conveyed on board. Towards
the ebb of life their lips, teeth, and tongue became blackish-
blue, and in severe cases there was bleeding from the gums.
In some of the cases on board the contract steamers the
nervous system was hyperästhetically affected, the lips and
muscles quivered convulsively, speaking produced great excite-
ment and exhaustion, the thirst was craving, with ability to
drink any quantity of water, but no desire for food, and not
much purging. In one case, twelve hours before death, the
patient ate an enormous quantity of food. Not one of those
who had gone on board after the yellow fever had been con-
tracted, escaped ; one died six hours after leaving port. It is,

therefore, against every precedent to advise a person labour-
ing under yellow fever in Western Africa to travel by sea ;
they have better chance of recovery on land; but as soon as
they become convalescent, and are able to move about, a sea
voyage produces in them a most beneficial result. Exactly
the contrary is the case with intermittent and remittent fevers,
which begin to decline as soon as the patient enters the
vessel.
During this season of the year Guinea-worm is more pre- Guinea-worm
valent on the Gold Coast than at any other time; the cold'
season seems to be its period of irritation, although it may
occur at any other period. This may be explained from the
supposition, that during the hot season the temperature of the
body is uniform, especially in the exposed lower extremities of
the poor, which is the general abode of the worm ; but during
the rains, the worm, occurring amongst those who go bare-
footed and expose their feet to wet and cold, and consequent
changes in the temperature, feels the change, and if loaded with
ova, endeavours to make its escape; it then causes severe in-
flammation and a blister over the part where it intends to
make its exit, and then protrudes through it.
Elephantiasis Arabum, also, is very troublesome at this Elephanti-
season, and generally commences at this time, especially when
it is caused by. Guinea-worm. The leg begins gradually to
enlarge, with very little or no pain at all, and increases without
stopping, through all the seasons, when once it has commenced.
This disease is noticed in Dix Cove, Gold Coast.

this season of the year in countries where it is endemic. It is
greatly favoured by the cold, and commences with a soft, very
yielding tumour. In one case that I saw, the whole of the
neck was swollen, deglutition was impeded, and much pain and
inflammation accompanied it. In the majority of cases it
begins very insidiously, and the glands swell gradually with-
out attracting the notice of the patient; then, from being soft
and yielding, it becomes hard. There is no hereditary ten-
asis,

dency in most of the cases, and it occurs amongst the strong

M'Carthy's, several miles inland of the River Gambia ; the
soil appears to contain a large quantity of lime.
DISEASES OF THE HARMATTAN OR COLD SEASON.
harmattan in
Effects of the This season has been justly considered the most healthy on
small-pox. " the coast; fever is of very rare occurrence. The harmattan
cold, dry wind of the desert places a veto on animal and vege-
table decomposition, and, consequently, on malarious exhala-
tions, and, consequently, malarious fever is uncommon in this
season. Those suffering in convalescence are restored to their
proper health; all malignant diseases, as if by magic, dis-
appear; ulcers quickly cicatrise, and cutaneous eruptions are
arrested. Even the most dreadful outbreak of small-pox can-
not withstand it; the pustules soon heal up, and the disease
disappears. If the best vaccine matter be used for inocula-
tion whilst the harmattan wind is blowing, its effect is nulli-
fied, and the system becomes perfectly exposed, as an unvac-
cinated patient, to the baneful influence of the epidemic. It
has exactly the same effect with the exanthematous fevers,
curing them by hastening the different stages, or without
allowing them to run their regular course. In the year 1770
there were on board the "Unity," at Whydah, about 300 slaves.
The small-pox broke out among them, and it was determined
to inoculate. Those who were inoculated before the harmat-
tan came on got very well through the disease. About
seventy were inoculated a day or two after the harmattan set
in, but not one of them had either sickness or eruption. It
was imagined that the infection was effectually dispersed, and
the ship cleared of the disorder; but in a very few weeks it
began to appear among those seventy. About fifty of them
were inoculated a second time; the others had the disease
in the natural way. A harmattan came on, and they all
recovered, except one girl, who had an ugly ulcer in the

In the interior of the Gambia and Senegal, the harmattan Effects of the
blows more regularly for days, and even weeks continually, the sentient
than at any other part of the coast. The air is dry, and pro-
duces a sensation of a sharp cold, which is pleasant. This
cold is superficial, and an individual generally feels an increased
degree of activity ; "the skin reddens, and, in extreme cases,
the limbs have a tendency to stiffen, instead of yielding to the
irregular and involuntary motions which constitute shivering."
An unpleasant dryness is felt in the mucous coat of the
nostrils as the wind passes along it; the hair bristles fearfully;
the lips chap and split; the kidneys are called upon to do
more work; there is very little, if any, perspiration, even after
a long walk; the sudorific glands are in a quiescent state,
as well as the sebaceous follicles, which is remarked by the
dry, harsh feel of the surface, now deprived of its unctuous
secretion. Those who have resided in the tropics become
goose skinned and shrivelled, their hands becoming uncomfort-
ably dry.

pleasant dry sensation. Individuals are generally subject to
fevers, which might have been prevented by the preceding
harmattan days. The fever is, however, peculiar, and charac-
terised by a feeling of general lassitude, uneasiness, slight
headache, burning in the nostrils, a burning heat in some
individuals, a coldish sensation all over the body, a pretty good
appetite, but no decided prostration or fever, and in a few days,
with some individuals, without even taking any medicine, the
fever subsides of itself.
Sometimes when the harmattan blows for several days, and
the kidneys do not act sufficiently, the bowels act vicariously,
and relieve the system of the superabundant accumulation,
and diarrhea sets in and continues in spite of all remedies.

It causes very little pain, and sometimes none at all, and is
characterised by copious watery discharges, coloured by loose
fæcal matter. As soon as the cold wind subsides, and the skin
resumes its action, the diarrhæa also gradually subsides, and
the patient returns to his usual health.
The diseases of this season consist of disease of the internal
organs. The blood recedes from the surface, and accumulates in
the interior; indurated, sub-acute inflammation of the liver
and spleen are common; hæmorrhages sometimes take place ;
there may only be slight derangement of the hepatic functions,
consisting of" irregularity of the bowels, with motions of various
colours, and fætid or insipid odour; general languor of body
and mind; slight nausea, especially in the mornings, when we
attempt to brush our teeth; a yellowish fur about the back
part of the tongue; unpleasant taste in the mouth on getting
out of bed; a tinge in the eyes and complexion from absorp-
tion of bile; the urine high coloured, and a slight irritation in
passing it; the appetite impaired, and easily turned against fat
or oily victuals; irritability of temper, dejection of mind, loss
of flesh, disturbed sleep." But sometimes this increases greatly,
and the patient becomes affected with jaundice, with or without
any pain in the region of the liver. Chronic eruptions are
repelled, and sometimes are followed by headache.
As in India, so in some parts of Africa. "In the old resi-
dents," says Sir R. Martin, "the appetite fails, accompanied by
an oppressive sense of abdominal fulness; and when this
state is not met by a suitable change of diet, clothing, and
some medicine to act upon the skin and bowels, visceral con-
gestion, ædema of the lower extremities, or some more active
disease, may ensue. New-born infants suffer materially from,
and are sometimes destroyed by, the impression of our cold
season on the unguarded and delicate surface. The abortions
of the cold months have always appeared to me connected with
acute nervous congestion ; and the intermittent states of the
pulse and the epigastric pulsations, common to old Indians at
this season, are increased by this state of the great nervous

trunks. The kidneys act during the continuance of the cold
weather with diabetic violence, the urine being limpid, and
they only cease to do so on the return of a warmer season, and
consequently equability of circulation, causing moisture of sur-
face. The biliary excretion, in excess during hot and rainy
seasons, is here diminished, as indicated by the whitish or clay-
coloured state of the alvine discharges, following the reverse
order of what takes place in the instance of the kidneys."

perament suffer most severely from gout and rheumatism at
certain seasons of the year, occasioned either by excessive
debauchery, undue exposure, or hereditary predisposition; and
in a great many cases we can only account for the cessation
from meteoric circumstances. I have seen patients suffering
most severely from the worst forms of gout and rheumatism,
with flying pains all over the body, swollen joints, intense local
pains, with a deposit of what is wrongly called chalk-stone,
before the occurrence of the harmattan wind; and when it
blows, all, like a spell, disappear; the swelling is greatly
reduced, there is no pain, and the patient is able to move
about with ease and comfort, and generally expresses himself
to be "jolly;" but no sooner does the harmattan cease, and the
N., S., or N.W. winds begin to blow, than the symptoms
gradually begin to reappear, much to his discomfort. The
best remedy used by the natives in the Bight of Benin for
gout and rheumatism is the fat of the boa-constrictor. I have
never had an opportunity of examining its effects; but judg-
ing from the statements of the natives, it seems to possess a
powerful penetrative action. It is employed also in con-
sumptive pains in the chest, which, they say, it greatly relieves.
During the harmattan season pregnant females suffer a good Impregna-
deal from cold and coughs, which they describe as far exceed-
ing any other time; and they also observe that the cold is less
felt when in an unpregnated state, although the weather is of
the same temperature. They, however, feel lighter and more

able to move about than previously, if they have suffered from
great weight and heaviness. Labour during this season is very
quick. It takes about three-fourths of the ordinary time.
The patients generally complain of severe cold and trembling
just before and after the commencement of labour pains. The
pains then come on, and the uterus seems to act with double
energy and force. The pains are principally dragging lumbar
pains. After delivery, severe pains are felt all over the lumbar
and pelvic regions, and in the hip joints; but they continue
only for a short time, and then disappear. This wind has an
invigorative effect on the galactophorous glands. A dry, scanty
breast now secretes a large and abundant quantity of milk.
The young infant at this season of the year suffers much
from cold, especially amongst the lower class. The babe is said
to cry much more than at any other time, and is much more
troublesome in nursing. Glandular swellings are common
amongst them, especially those three or four years of age,
which generally run on to the formation of matter. The prin-
cipal glands affected are the parotid, submaxillary, and glandular
concatinatæ. Sometimes the swellings are so large that they
extend the cervical fascia to such a degree as to impede the
healthy action of the large vessels, and interrupt breathing. A
most extreme case of the kind came under my notice on the
Slave Coast in the month of January 1860. The patient was
a girl of five years of age, and during the occurrence of a severe
harmattan in the beginning of the month had suffered from the
glands of the neck. When I saw her the parotid, submaxillary,
thyroid, and all the other glands of the neck had become
involved. The cervical fascia was considerably stretched; she
suffered from severe pain, and was quite unable to turn her
head one way or the other. The breathing was very stertorous
and hurried, ranging from 50 to 56. She had a slight cough, and
her deglutition was much impeded. The child, which was said
to have been strong and stout, was now reduced to a skeleton;
the eyes, standing out of their orbits, staring ghastly; cheek
sunken, and the bones of the face prominent; the great

cervical vessels and air-passages were so compressed that their
proper functions were entirely interrupted, and that, with the
inability to take food and the dyspepsia, led to ill nourishment
of the system and deprivation of the blood. The child was, in
fact, dying from inanition. A lancet discharged a large quan-
tity of matter; the pain diminished; the number of respirations
fell; the breathing became more natural; a revival was observed
in the countenance; and the child, who was at death's door, now
looks lively, and enjoys its meals.

MORTALITY AND REGISTRATION OF THE BLACK TROOPS AND
INHABITANTS IN WESTERN AFRICA.
Dr T. Graham Balfour, F.R.S., Deputy Inspector-General of Mortality of
Hospitals, in his able summary of the health of the army allº
over the world, published in the "Statistical Reports of the
Army Medical Department" for 1859 to 1862, gives the follow-
ing as the rate of sickness and mortality of British troops on
the West Coast of Africa :-
WEST AFRICAN STATIONS.
1. In Sierra Leone the sickness is represented by 740 admis-
sions, and the mortality by 29.53 deaths per 1000 of mean
strength.
2. At the Gambia the sickness is represented by 978 admis-
sions, and the mortality by 33.74 deaths per 1000 of mean
strength.
3. On the Gold Coast the sickness is represented by 624
admissions, and the mortality by 26.45 deaths per 1000 of
mean strength.

mortality compared with the admissions, is greatest on the
Gold Coast.
The most prevalent miasmatic diseases in Sierra Leone are
as follow :-
Paroxysmal fevers, represented by 98 admissions per 1000
mean strength; rheumatism, by 56 per 1000; dysentery and
diarrhoea, by 20; eruptive fevers, by 23 per 1000.
The most prevalent on the Gambia are :-
Paroxysmal fevers, represented by 294 admissions per 1000
of mean strength ; dysentery, diarrhoea, and cholera, by 58 per
1000; eruptive fevers, by 44 per 1000; rheumatism, by 28 per
1000; ophthalmia, by 13 admissions per 1000 men.
The most prevalent on the Gold Coast are :-
Dysentery, diarrhoea, and cholera, represented by 31 admis-
sions per 1000 mean strength; rheumatism, by 26 per 1000 ;
ophthalmia, by 19 per 1000; paroxysmal fever, by 11 admis-
sions per 1000. Smallpox and measles are sometimes epidemic,
and Guinea-worm among parasitic diseases holds a prominent
place. Indeed, in 1861, this affection was the cause of one-
third of the admissions into hospital; and it is worthy of
remark, that in that year not a single case occurred among
the troops at Sierra Leone and the Gambia.
The two following tables will show the greatest number of
annual admissions and mortality in the stations on the West

Registration On the West Coast of Africa the Registrarship of Births,
Deaths, and Marriages is not vested in the medical profession,
and, consequently, it will be impossible to get accurate returns
of the causes of death. How will these Registrars appear if, in
the Central Government, a Medical Registrar-General was
appointed, and the following instructions, which were sent by
the Registrar-General of all England to his two thousand two
hundred reporting officers, were sent to them?-
"If the deaths registered during the quarter have been above
or below the average, state whether, in your opinion, the fact
is wholly or partially to be accounted for by sanitary arrange-
ments, by increase or decrease of population, the weather,

small-pox, measles, scarlatina, whooping-cough, fever (in-
cluding typhus, typhoid, relapsing, infantile fever), cholera,
diarrhoea (including bowel coinplaint), dysentery, bronchitis,
or other diseases. Also with regard to increase or decrease of
births, you may mention any circumstance to which it may be
attributed. By average' must be understood, not the average
of numbers in other quarters of the year, but the average of
corresponding quarters in four or five previous years."
This proves at once that we shall ever be ignorant of the pro-
per death rate 'until the plan is remodelled. And now that the
whole coast is placed under a Central Government, the Gover-
nor-General should appoint medical registrars in the different
colonies, should have a Medical Registrar-General in Sierra
Leone, and should have quarterly or half yearly reports sent as
to the rate of mortality, which should be summarised by the
Registrar-General, and published for public information in the
Government Gazette. There will still be some fallacy in the
report, which will be unsatisfactory until the people be com-
pelled to get a medical certificate for each death. I hope this
suggestion will meet with the approbation and consideration of
the Central Government.

MEDICAL CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.
These tables only show the number of cases of diseases
amongst the liberated Africans who were taken from the slave-
ships and forwarded to the Kissy Hospital. The slaves are
generally in a wretched state of health when landed, and sub-
ject to every kind of disease. The tables there do not show
the number of admissions and the mortality amongst the popu-
lation at Kissy, but only the number amongst the emancipated
slaves.
The following tables of the mortality of the River Gambia
from 1859 to 1866 were kindly furnished me by Mr Thomas
Johnson, the registrar of births, marriages, and deaths, ex-
pressly for this work. In 1859 and 1866 the colony was
visited with yellow fever, and consequently the mortality
amongst the small European population was very large.

From this table it will be seen that the proportion of male
deaths above female is very great, and this takes place after
manhood has been attained, between 20 and 40. The total
number of deaths at this period, between the years 1859 and
1866 (up to the 12th October), was 500, of which 170 were in
excess of male to female population. In childhood, i.e., between
1 and 7, the male infants seem more predisposed to disease
than the female, and the excess of mortality during the same
period is 66.

population in Bathurst, between the years 1859 and 1866
(12th October), of a population of nearly 6000 inhabitants, was
1665, of which 977 were males, and 688 females ; the lowest
mortality was in 1865, viz., 178 ; the highest in 1863, when
there was famine in the land, the total being 316. The death
rate of the male population is much in excess of that of the
female ; of the 1665 deaths there were no less than 289 male
deaths over the female. The smallest difference of mortality
between the male and female was in 1865, when there were
20 male excess; the greatest difference was in 1862, when
there were 51. For every death of 2:8 females 3 males died;
the average yearly excess of male deaths from 1859 to 1866
was 36.1.

The number of births bear no proportion whatever to that of
deaths; there is a slight increase in the number of male over

number of male births was 432, and that of female births 380;
the grand total of all the births registered being 812. The

little or no immigration into it. The population is barely

They will all die out. Do the local authorities require any
more forcible argument for the necessity of rigid sanitary re-
forms? Within eight years the deaths exceeded the births by

servations
tion,
In every part of the globe, an individual attempting to re- General ob-
side in a climate which is opposite to or varies from that to False infatua-
which he has been accustomed, must conform to certain rules
and regimen, regulating his habits to that of the climate he
intends to reside in, and if he expects to keep his health, must
endeavour to profit by the experience of those who have resided
for some time in it. Europeans fresh from Europe are very
generally found to praise the climate in the tropics as the best
in the world; especially if they have been in the south of
Europe, you will hear them say that it is quite as good, if not
better; and they will unnecessarily expose themselves to a
great many injurious climatic influences, and pooh-pooh any
advice to the contrary offered them by persons whose long resi-
dence and experience in such matters should carry with it
great weight. Such individuals have generally within a few
weeks or months to pay most dearly for their folly, and should
they be lucky enough to outlive their opinions, soon tell a

different tale. I knew an eminent judge who had resided for
some time in the south of Spain. On his arrival on the Gold
Coast, finding that the south-west sea breeze was very bracing,
and the air tolerable but bearably hot, he walked about from
one part of the town to the other under the noon-day sun. He
could not endure the slow pace of a carriage, which in that
part of Africa is drawn by men ; and on one occasion he jumped
out and raced with the native drivers. What was the result?
He soon took fever, congestion of the brain followed, and he
became a victim of the climate,-or rather of his infatuation,
within six weeks after his arrival.
How true, then, are the remarks of Captain Williamson (who
resided for some twenty years in India), when writing of the
folly of some new arrivals, who unnecessarily exposed them-
selves to the injurious influence of the climate. "Nothing,"
said he, " can be more preposterous than the significant
sneers of gentlemen on their first arrival in India-meaning
thereby to ridicule or to despise what they consider effeminacy
or luxury. Thus several may be seen walking about without
chattahs* during the greatest heats. They affect to be ashamed
of requiring aid, and endeavour to uphold, by such a display
of indifference, the great reliance placed on strength of consti-
tution. This unhappy infatuation rarely exceeds a few days;
at the end of that time, we are too often called upon to attend
the funeral of the self-deluded victim." One cannot be too
cautious, especially on his first arrival in tropical climates ;
he has so to moderate all his habits of life—his drink, sleep,
exercise, &c.—as gradually to adapt his constitution to the
necessitudes of the climate. A mistake at the commencement
may lay the foundation of the most serious and complicated
diseases in future years. What madness will it be considered
if a native of a tropical climate, in residing in the temperate
zone, carries there with him his tropical habits ! A few days
alone will suffice to bring him to the consciousness of his folly,
and reduce him to the dust from whence he came. What is

PRECAUTIONS FOR HEALTH OF TROOPS.

injurious in the one case is also injurious in the other. A
native of a temperate climate, on making the tropics his
abode, should gradually adapt himself to the climate, and
should particularly observe the minute points in tropical
hygiene.
Besides, the death of every new comer tells very much
against the climate of the country. The individuals themselves
are seldom blamed for it; the deadly nature of the place re-
ceives all the blame which their bereaved friends can give, and
the progress of the governing influence is checked. The country
becomes the sufferer in another way. It is deprived of the
civilising influence which radiates from them. It prevents
others from attempting to reside in it, and generally only the
most reckless and desperate will venture to do so.
The subject of tropical hygiene has been ably considered by
many writers on tropical diseases; and in the following con-
siderations I intend to adopt the plan proposed by Dr Johnson,
and most elaborately improved by Sir R. Martin, and regard
tropical hygiene in the light of DRESS, FOOD, DRINK, EXERCISE,
SLEEP, BATHING, and the REGULATION OF THE PASSIONS.
Before considering these various points, I shall here quote
the summary of the precautions sent by the French Minister
of War to the troops in the East (Danube), to be observed for
the preservation of their health, as I think valuable hints
might be obtained from it for the guidance of habits in the
tropics:*-
" The Council of Health has been charged by the Minister Instructions
of War to examine the precautions most proper for maintain- Council of
ing the health of the troops in the countiy to which they are
called to make war. The Council has drawn up detailed
instructions, from which the following particulars are extracted
as necessary to be observed with the greatest care :-
"1. It is necessary to be always so clothed as to be proof
against the sudden chills to which one is liable, at all seasons,

from the abrupt changes of temperature which very frequently
happen in nearly all parts of this country.
" 2. In summer the best protection against sunstrokes, which
are often very dangerous, is never to leave shelter without
having the head covered.
"3. Cleanliness of person, clothes, and dwellings is imperi-
ously required by the nature of the climate.
"4. Wherever practicable, the face, and particularly the
eyes, should be frequently washed daily, after exposure to dust.
"5. The feet should not be washed with cold water, espe-
cially when heated after a march.
"6. The greatest care is needed for protection against the
freshness of the nights, even when the heat is extreme. It is
dangerous to remain clad only with the shirt during the night.
At the bivouac, and in the tent, the soldiers should be very
carefully covered.
"7. When the camp is pitched near a marsh, a tank, pools
of stagnant water, or a valley, the chief openings of the barracks
or tents should be in the opposite direction. In these bivouacs
every possible means should be employed to counteract the
invariably noxious vapours exhaled by such foci of infection.
At night the openings of the barracks, with the exception of
those indispensable for ventilation, should be closed.
"8. It is wrong to sleep in immediate contact with the
ground; perfectly dry substances, not easily permeated by
moisture, should be interposed. For this purpose fresh branches
or vegetable matter should never be used.
"9. Water drunk in large quantity is always injurious. If,
after a fatiguing march, a stream of water is met with, thirst
must be sparingly satisfied, and the water reserved for subse-
quent use.
"10. When only a small quantity of water is procurable,
instead of swallowing it, the mouth should be gargled as long
as possible, and the water rejected as soon as it is warm.

by any source, either by perspiration or rain, communicates a
cold sensation over the whole of the body. Woollen fabrics,
being bad conductors of heat, feel very uncomfortable, when
the temperature of the surrounding medium far exceeds that of

the body; and when it is a little below it, will be found to
be too slow a conductor of the heat of the body. Cotton,
therefore, is the material best suited for tropical climates.
"The cotton dress," says Sir R. Martin, " from its slowness of
conducting heat, is admirably adapted for the tropics. It must
be recollected that the temperature of the atmosphere, sub dis,
in the hot seasons, exceeds that of the blood by many degrees;
and even in the shade it too often equals, or rises above the
heat of the body's surface, which is always, during health,
some degrees below 97º.
"Here, then, we have a covering which is cooler than linen,
inasmuch as it conducts more slowly the excess of external heat
to our bodies; but this, though a great advantage, is not the
only one.
"When a vicissitude takes place, and the atmospheric tempe-
rature sinks suddenly far below that of the body, the cotton
covering, faithful to its trust, abstracts more slowly the heat
from it, and thus preserves to the wearer a more and more
steady equilibrium. To all these advantages must be added
the facility with which the cotton absorbs perspiration. While
linen so circumstanced would feel wet and cold under a breeze,
and even occasion a shiver, the cotton dress, as stated, would
maintain an equable warmth."
1. A cotton undershirt should always be used; and if drawers
be worn, those made with cotton are best.
2. Cotton socks, as a general rule, should be always worn. If
about to travel a long distance, and there is a probability of
walking through swamp, woollen stockings, not very thick, are
preferable.
3. Shirts made of cotton, with linen fronts, should be worn.
The warm Crimean shirts (flannel) should only be used on
special occasions, i.e., when travelling or 'in an expedition.
When worn for every-day purposes, they look dirty, are
rather too hot, and feel heavy. The wool irritates the skin and
increases the perspiration, the converse of which being what
we require.

4. Collars should, when we can legally do so, be avoided.
The shirt-band should be very free.
5. Chemises and night-gowns or shirts made of cotton material
should be preferred to linen. The rule is, cotton should always
be next to the skin.
6. At night use cotton sheets for covering, or if linen, lay
on cotton. When the temperature is high and the bed linen
hot, cover with a thin flannel blanket.
During the hot season at M'Carthy's, when the temperature
at bed-time is 100°, I have found sleeping between linen sheets
to be unhealthily warm, for this simple reason, the linen easily
conveys the heat to my body. Woollen and cotton are cooler,
which is proved in the following experiment :—"Let two beds
be placed in the same room during the day, when the ther-
mometer stands at 90°, and let one be covered with a pair of
blankets, the other with a pair of linen sheets." On removing
both coverings in the evening, the bed with the blankets will
be found cool. Being a non-conductor of heat, they prevent the
external heat from penetrating; whilst the linen bed and the
linen being a good conductor, transmitting the heat to every-
thing beneath it, is hot.
: 7 Whatever hat is worn, the crown should be well protected,
or covered with several folds of white turban.
8. An umbrella should always be used when obliged to go
out of doors during the heat of the sun.
9. The boots should be provided with thick soles, especially
during the rainy season. When wet and damp they should be
immediately changed.
10. The body linen should not be changed too often; twice
a-day is quite sufficient, especially aniongst new arrivals.
"To change morning and evening is enough for all and
every purpose, even in the hot and rainy seasons; and to
change oftener is simply injurious. The property which fre-
quent change of linen has in exciting the cuticular secretion,
accounts for the superior health which accompanies cleanliness
in our own climate, and, on the contrary, for many of the diseases

of the indigent and slovenly, which are so frequently connected
with or dependent on irregularity or suppression of the cuticular
discharge. But though this is true, by the injudicious, nay,
injurious habits, of too frequent change of linen in a tropical
climate, the fluids on the surface of the body, already in excess,
are thus powerfully solicited, and the action of the perspiratory
vessels, with all their associations, morbidly increased, instead
of being restrained."—Sir J. R. Martin, "Influence of Tropical
Climates," &c.
11. When caught in a rain, and the linen becomes wet and
damp, it should be immediately changed, and the body sponged
with hot water and vinegar or lime juice.
12. In places where dysentery or diarrhea is prevalent, a
cotton or flannel waistband should be worn, especially at night,
to keep the bowels from sudden impression of cold.
Rules for
regulation of
food.
11.--Food.
As it is necessary to change the food when one resides in the
polar regions, so as to increase the heat of the body, so it is
necessary, when we attempt to reside in a tropical climate, to
moderate the quantity and select the quality of our food.
Since the heat predisposes to congestion and the development of
febrile excitement, we should so regulate our diet as to mode-
rate the former, whilst at the same time we neutralise the latter.
1. Before getting out of bed, or before going out of doors,
a cup of tea, coffee, or chocolate should be taken.
. 2. The breakfast and dinner hours should be stated and
regularly kept.
3. At breakfast the viands should be very simple and plain,
especially amongst first arrivals, consisting of eggs, either plain
boiled or poached, a little fish, unbuttered bread, and tea or
coffee.
4. If the dinner be late, at a little after noon, about two
o'clock, a little bread and butter might be taken, with a glass
of beer (or porter preferable), or still better, draught ale. A
glass of sherry or port might be taken for a change.

FOOD.
277
5. The dinner should be at about four, or half-past four; but
when this is inconvenient, it should not be later than seven
o'clock. It should be the principal meal, and should not be too
heavy, in order to ensure a natural and refreshing rest.
. 6. Suppers ought always to be avoided in the tropics, where
a good rest at night is essential for the preservation of the
health and vigour of the mind and body.
8. When dinner is taken early, tea or coffee should be taken
at seven or eight, and will be very much relished.
9. Excess in eating and drinking should be particularly
avoided; excess will be known by a general feverish sensation
after the meal. Dr Clark truly states that much of the suffer-
ing of the Europeans on the Gold Coast is occasioned by over-
feeding.
10. The sub-acid fruits, such as oranges, pine apples, and
grenadillas, will be found very agreeable and refreshing. But
the European on his first arrival should carefully watch the
effects of the various delightful tropical fruits which he eats,
as they act differently on different constitutions. He should
gradually select those which are suitable to him. Thus the
mangrove is said to be stimulating and heating, and might, in
an unseasoned European, bring out pustular eruptions or boils ;
the plantain, even when ripe, is astringent, and consequently
not well adapted for those who are habitually constipated.
Oranges (sweet) are always wholesome taken in the morning or
afternoon, and so is the banana. In a previous chapter I
have described fully the fruits found in intertropical Western
Africa.
11. Unripe fruits should be avoided, especially in places
where dysentery and diarrhoea or cholera is rife.
12. Condiments or spice should not be used by new comers in
the tropics ; they should not force their stomach, with an already
good appetite, to increased and unnecessary action. When,
however, by long residence the tone of the general constitution
and of the stomach begins to fail, then their use will be bene-
ficial.

servations.
III.—DRINK.
General ob- It is a physiological fact that a man in good health does not
require the use of wine or spirits, or any stimulating liquor.
It produces no beneficial result in his constitution, and in the
tropics acts rather injuriously, even in small quantity, by in-
creasing that febrile state of excitement which is the conse-
quence of the heated atmosphere. Indeed" during the first two
years of residence, at least, the nearer we approach to a per-
fect aqueous regimen in drink, so much the better chance have
we of avoiding sickness, and the more slowly and gradually
we deviate from this afterwards, so much the more retentive
will we be of that invaluable blessing HEALTH." It has be-
come the habit of some men in the tropics, on opening their
eyes in the morning, to have a "good stiff shot of brandy" the
first thing before rising; and I have seen cases where a bottle
of brandy has been nearly consumed before breakfast. No-
thing is so injurious to the constitution as this habit. It does
not at all satisfy the thirst, but leaves a desperate degree of
craving for the bottle—the bottle, which, in many cases, never
ends until delirium tremens supervenes.
Sir R. Martin has given a most instructive example of the
different effects of aqueous and spirituous drinks and liquors in
increasing or decreasing the thirst, which we will here quote in
extensio, as it may prove beneficial to many who have made up
their minds to reside in the tropics :-
"We will suppose two gentlemen to be sitting in a room, in
the East or West Indies, just before the setting in of the sea
breeze, both complaining of thirst, their skin hot, and the tem-
perature of their bodies 100°, or two degrees above the natural
standard. One of them, pursuant to the instructions of Dr
Currie, who never was in a tropical climate, applies to the
negus, beer, or brandy-and-water cup, and after a draught or
two, brings out a copious perspiration, which soon reduces the
temperature to 98°. It will not stop here, however, nor will
the gentleman, according to the plan proposed; for instead of


## p. 279 (#303) ############################################

DRINK.
279
putting the bulb of the thermometer under his tongue to see
if the mercury is low enough, feeling his thirst increased by
the perspiration, he very naturally prefers a glass or two more
of the same stimulating draught, to support the discharge'-
still, however, stopping short of intoxication. Now, by these
means the temperature is reduced to 97° or 964, in which
state even the slight, and otherwise refreshing chill of the sea-
breeze checks more or less the cuticular discharge, and paves
the way for future maladies.
"Let us now return to the other gentleman, who pursues a
different line of conduct. Instead of the more palatable and
stimulating drinks he takes a draught of plain cold water.
This is hardly swallowed before the temperature of the body
loses, by abstraction alone, one degree of heat at least. But
the external surface of the body, immediately sympathising
with the internal surface of the stomach, relaxes, and a mild
perspiration breaks out which reduces the temperature to its
natural standard, 98°. This simultaneous relaxation of the
two surfaces completely removes the disagreeable sensation
of thirst; and as the simple 'antediluvian beverage' does
not possess many circean charms for modern palates, there
will not be the slightest danger of its being abused in quan-
tity, or of the perspiratory process being carried beyond its
salutary limits. Nor need we apprehend its being neglected,
since from the moment that the skin begins to be constricted,
or morbid heat to accumulate, the sympathising stomach and
fauces will not fail again to warn us, by craving the proper
remedy."

4. Sherbet will be found salutary, and any quantity may
be taken, as it is wholesome and grateful.
5. Any quantity of ice might be taken ; it is not only agree-
able and salutary, but it revives the spirits, strengthens the
body, and assists digestion.
6. When aqueous regimen cannot be kept, the best and
lightest wine that could be safely used is good claret (and
water).
7. For those of weak constitution a glass of porter in the
afternoon is very strengthening, and in the tropics is better than
bottled ale.
8. Brandy is unnecessary; it increases the febrile excitement
of the body to a marked degree, which is followed by a corres-
ponding depression of the vital functions. It should only be
used when prescribed by the medical attendant.
9. When, after long exercise before dinner, or hard bodily
exercise, it is found on sitting at table that the appetite is
gone, take a glass of sherry and bitters, and this will excite
the action of the stomach.
10. Warm tea or coffee after severe marches in the sun will
be found a refreshing beverage (Martin).
11. A newly arrived European in the tropics should never
attempt to imitate the old residents in the use of the magic
bowl. He must always consider, that what the old topers can
take with seeming advantage, will prove death to him.
12. During seasoning, when a course of temperance has been
fully entered on, under no consideration must an occasional
debauch be committed, as the system is very much subject to
endemic and epidemic tropical diseases (Martin).

lows, then diminished action of the skin and visceral secretions,
and then an "inequilibrium of the blood." Again, it is in-
jurious to take no exercise at all, for it is equally necessary
for the due performance of all the functions of the body that
a certain amount of exercise should be taken.
1. New arrivals, in places where there are good roads, should
take gentle exercise on foot every evening. It should on no
account be fatiguing.
2. In the damp and rainy season exercise in the morning
should never be taken. Due time should be allowed to the
sun to disperse the malaria which accumulates on the surface
of the earth.
3. In houses where there are long piazzas or verandahs, a
walk within them in the morning will be found strengthen-
ing and agreeable, and not at all injurious.
4. Passive exercise on horseback is strengthening to the
young, and with new arrivals will give a gentle impulse to the
functions of the whole body.
5. Dancing, except for a short time in the cold months, is
injurious. Every dancer in the tropics knows too well the
feeling in the whole system, after a dance continued throughout
the night.
6. Passive exercises, in carriages or palankeens, is very ser-
viceable to those who have long resided in the tropics, and
whose circulation is very languid.
7. With children hoop-racing is an agreeable and bracing
exercise, as it exercises both the mind and the body.
8. Shampooing is both useful and salutary, it invigorates
the circulation after fatigue or long inaction, and excites the
insensibility of the cuticular secretion (Martin).
9. Before dinner one hour's repose is very salutary, and

places the stomach in a condition most favourable for the re-
ception of food.
10. On no account must exercise be taken under the rays of
a noon-day sun, or when the sun's rays can be felt.
11. Walking out in the night should always be avoided; it
is injurious in every respect.
Dr Macculloch, in his work on Meteorology, says truly that
"no one fears a summer evening, or even a mild winter night,
unless, indeed, he finds a dew. Yet here lies the very danger.
A land of meadows, and parks, and ponds, and rivers, and
woods, is a thousand times more hazardous than all the nights
of all the winters that ever were. This is the real night air to
be feared, even though the grey mist should not rise or the dew
should not fall. To take a pleasant evening walk by the banks
of the river, or the lake, to watch the trout rise at the even-
ing flies, to attend the milking of the cows in the green
meadow, to saunter among wet groves until the moon rises,
listening to the nightingale—these, and more of such rural
amusements and delights, are the true night air, the malaria,
and the fever."
12. The swing is an exercise which will be found grateful
and salutary, especially if done in-doors when it is rainy.
It will relax the cutaneous vessels, and produce a determina-
tion to the surface, and consequently very beneficial, especially
to those who are suffering from torpidity (Martin).
Rules for

bathing.
V.—BATHING.
Mr Erasmus Wilson, in his excellent "Treatise on the Skin,"
has laid the aphorism of health to be," by food, by raiment, by
exercise, and by ablution, to maintain and preserve an agree-
able warmth of the skin." Cleanliness, says the sacred writer,
is next to godliness. In no climate is there a greater neces-
sity for the performance of good ablution than on the West
Coast of Africa. The enormous calls on the cutaneous vessels,
which result in an excessive discharge of their secretion, lead
to an accumulation of extraneous matter on the surface, which,

283
if not removed, produces a mischievous effect on health. The
stomach is at first disturbed, and then a series of disturbances
take place, which involve most of the viscera of the body.
Regular ablution, therefore, is a necessity in the tropics; but
there are certain rules which must be laid down for the obser-
vance of those who reside in the tropics.
1. In the tropics a bath should be taken once at least every
day.
2. The best time for taking a bath is an hour or half an hour
before breakfast. The body is then cool and the stomach
in excellent condition for the morning repast.
3. When a bath is taken twice a-day, the bath, which must
always be cold, should be taken an hour or half an hour before
dinner. It is very refreshing, especially after a hard day's
work, removes the sensation of thirst in the stomach through
sympathy with the skin, and, in a great measure, mitigates
nervousness.
4. With the temperate and healthy the cold bath should
always be taken. It is delightful, and advantageous in keep-
ing the skin cool and moist, and reducing the sense of internal
fulness.
5. Amongst the intemperate the cold bath is dangerous, and
should not be indulged in. The tepid bath will be found more
serviceable.
6. To persons suffering from visceral diseases the tepid or
warm bath is the only safe bath that could be used with advan-
tage, and once a-day is quite sufficient.
7. During the cold weather, and at the blowing of the har-
mattan, to persons who have suffered from enlargement of the
spleen and liver, from dysentery and chronic diarrhæa, a warm
bath is a necessity.
8. The relative temperature of the baths should be as fol-
lows :—"Cold bath, from 60° to 75°; tepid bath, from 85° to
92°; warm bath, from 92° to 98°; hot bath, from 98° to 112°.
9. During the hot weather, when the temperature in the sun
ranges from 120° to 140°, the cold water should be kept in

the sun for some time, and an agreeable tepid bath will be
obtained.
10. Amongst habitual topers, and those who are in the
habit of keeping late hours, whose abdominal viscera, in con-
sequence, are in an irritable state, and the balance of whose
circulation is disturbed, the cold bath immediately aggravates
the symptoms, and leads to fearful congestion. The warm bath
is a necessity.
11. Before using the cold bath, it is not necessary to wait
until one is cooled down first. Amongst the delicate it is bene-
ficial to be first immersed in a warm bath before plunging into
the cold, which will produce a healthy reaction (Martin).
12. We find it the habit of many to take a bath a few
minutes after their meals. This is injurious, and should be
avoided, as it interferes with the process of digestion, and
might result in functional derangement of the stomach.
Rules for
regulation of
sleep.
VI.—SLEEP.
Good sound sleep is necessary for the enjoyment of good
Of health in the tropics. Those who have habituated themselves
to going late to bed predispose their constitution to every form
of disease, and put a limit to their earthly existence. It must
be remembered that temperament has a great influence in the
extent and manner of our sleep. The great physiologist, Dr
Carpenter, says, " A plethoric habit of body, sustained by full
diet, usually predisposes to sleep, provided that the digestive
powers be in a vigorous condition. Persons of this constitution
frequently pass nine or ten hours in slumber, and maintain
that they cannot be adequately refreshed by less. On the
other hand, thin, wiry people, in whom the nervous tempera-
ment predominates, usually take comparatively little sleep,
notwithstanding the greater activity of their nervous system
when they are awake; but their slumber, while it lasts, is
generally very deep. Persons of lymphatic' temperament,
heavy, passionless people, who may be said to live very slowly,
are usually great sleepers. But this is rather because, through

285
the dulness of their perceptions, they are less easily kept awake
by sensorial or mental excitement, than because they really
require a prolonged cessation of activity."
1. Regularity in the hours of going to sleep is very im-
portant in the tropics. Between nine and ten will be found
the best time.
2. The apartment should be cool, and every means adopted
to keep it so; but the individual should be completely kept
from draught, and from the sudden changes of temperature
and the humidity of the atmosphere which is peculiar to the
tropics.
3. Every circumstance by which the sleep can be disturbed
should be obviated. Thus, in places where mosquitoes and
sandflies are prevalent, proper curtains should be used.
4. It is always most preferable and desirable to go to bed
with a clear head. The habit of much drinking at night dis-
turbs the sleep and renders it unrefreshing.
5. Those who are habituated to late hours and baccha-
nalian riots, will find themselves much relieved from the after
consequences of the imprudent habit by bathing their head
with cold water before going to sleep.
6. Reading late at night in the tropics is a habit not to be
encouraged, for the nervous system has enough of excitement
during the hot and busy hours of the day, and requires repose
at night.
7. When there is a feeling of tension, heat, headache, throb-
bing, and other unpleasant sensations in the head, we should
lie down quietly, and endeavour to get a sleep, for it is certain
that something wrong is going on in the brain, and rest and
quietude are most likely to relieve it.
8. Sleeping until too late in the morning, when the sun has
ascended to a great distance above the visible horizon, produces
lassitude and want of energy in individuals in the tropics.
9. Rising at daylight and enjoying the fresh and cooling
breeze of the morning, in a verandah, or beyond the reach of
malaria, is very healthy and invigorating.

10. During the blowing of the hot simoom, in the hot season,
in the interior of the Gambia, or the sirocco of the east, when
no dew falls, sleeping in open verandahs is not only safe, but
advantageous. On the other hand, during the rains, the har-
vest, and harmattan, such a habit will be found most destructive
to life; in fact, there are many cases in the Gambia where
men, whose names I might mention, have continually exposed
themselves in this way, contrary to all advice of their friends,
and thus laid the foundation of acute diseases, which have
proved their death-warrants.
11. The dyspeptic, namely, those who suffer from flatulency,
heartburns, and griping pains, are occasionally troubled with
nightmare, which disturbs their rest. They should take car-
bonate of soda and a little peppermint, and always keep their
bowels regular.
12. Late suppers, cheese, and other flatulent food, and all
indigestible fruits, should be avoided at night. This rule is
particularly incumbent on the dyspeptic.

VII.-REGULATION OF THE PASSIONS.
Moseley, quoted by Martin, has said that in the inhabitants
of hot climates there is a promptitude and a bias to pleasure,
and an alienation from serious thought and deep reflection,
unless sickness obtains an absolute control over the body.
"The brilliancy of the sky and the beauty of the atmo-
sphere," he observes, " conspire to influence the nerves against
philosophy and her rigid tenets, and forbid their practice among
the children of the sun." The effects of great heat on these
"children of the sun" I have considered at some length in
Chapter III. ; but I think Sir Ranald Martin has hit the right
string, when he says that the " removal of religious and moral
restraint, the temptations to vice, the facility of the means, and
the force of example, are the real causes of this bias to pleasure."
That able observer has truly, and feelingly pointed out
where the real cause of this propensity is to be found. "The
monotony of life," he says, "and the apathy of mind so con-

spicuous in hot climates, together with the obstacles to matri-
mony, too often lead to vicious and immoral connections with
native females, which speedily sap the foundations of principles
imbibed in early youth, and involve a train of consequences
not seldom embarrassing, if not embittering every subsequent
period of life. It is here that a taste for some of the more re-
fined and elegant species of literature will prove an invaluable
acquisition for dispelling ennui—the moth of mind and body."
1. A strict moral principle is beneficial in the tropics.
2. The Christian religion has a more beneficial influence on
the minds of men in the tropics than either Mohammedanism
or any other religious tenets.
3. Slothful and squalid habits should be avoided. The
saying is true that "a slothful, squalid-looking population in-
variably characterises an unhealthy country."
4. Every substance or circumstance which induces nervous-
ness and excitability of the nervous system should be avoided.
5. Persons accustomed to licentious indulgences are to be
avoided, especially on first arrival.
6. Always keep the mind occupied in doing something;
never sit down and allow the thoughts to go astray.
7. Agreeable society should always be courted, as it relieves
the mind a great deal. The society of real ladies will be
found preferable to any other.
8. The occupation of lofty buildings, or buildings in elevated
portions of a town or city, has a very beneficial effect on the
mind. The converse is also true.
9. In order that the moral principles might be more easily
kept, the new arrival should watch over and prevent any laxity
in habits or principles acquired in his early religious training.
10. The companionship of persons of irritable and violent
temper should, as much as possible, be avoided, as in the
tropics such habits are peculiarly catching, and have an injurious
effect on the health.
11. Too hot diet, or hot condiments taken in excess, have an
injurious influence on the passions.

" The use of certain kinds of food and drink may tend to
confirm or impair certain moral habits. Sometimes it may
operate directly, and by the immediate impressions which it
produces ; at other times by the different states of health or
disease which it occasions, or by the changes in the fluids and
solids which result from it; for all these different alterations in
the system soon manifest themselves more or less distinctly
in the ordinary dispositions of the will and understanding"
(Canabis).
12. A poor diet and a simple vegetable diet affects the
passions injuriously, and therefore should be avoided.
"The poor diets prescribed by the legislators of various
religious orders have never had the effect of diminishing the
venereal appetite, bùt have, on the contrary, inflamed these
propensities the more, or disordered the imagination in dimi-
nishing the physical forces; and thus men have been rendered
more feeble, more unhappy, and more easy of domination"
(Canabis)
Before concluding this part of the work, I shall here detail
certain precautions necessary for the prevention of some of the
diseases peculiar to tropical climates.

fevers.
1.—MALARIOUS FEVERS.
From the foregoing chapters it will be seen that malarious
of malarious fevers are most common in districts which are ill drained, and
abound in stagnant marshes and collections of decayed vegeta-
tion; that they hover about the banks of rivers, the borders
of marshes, the edges of pools; that they predominate very
generally in the neighbourhood of pig-styes and badly-con-
structed drains, and take special delight in the incense of
putrefying animal matter; that they are repugnant to fresh
air, and when left to themselves, will linger for years amidst
scenes of filth and corruption, and fold in their deadly embrace
all human beings who are so unfortunate as to be thrown into
their company. As a preventive, then, the primum mobile

of our action should be to drain the land, to use stringent
means for preventing the accumulation of decayed vegetable
or animal matter, and, consequently, to put a stop to all mias-
matic effluvia or exhalation.
With regard to the individual who must be exposed to
malarious fever, or "who has once had the fever," says Dr
Watson," he should, in whatever place he may happen to be,
avoid exposure to extremes of cold and heat, and the neglect of
changing wet clothes—wet shoes and stockings, for instance.
"In malarious districts, in tropical climates, for example,
persons should bear in mind the fact, that the miasmata are
much more virulent in the night time than in the day, and
closer to the surface of the earth than in the higher strata of
the atmosphere. They should refrain, therefore, from going
out late in the evening, or early in the morning, in countries
where ague is rife; should take care not to go out fasting ; a
good hot breakfast should be first taken, or, at any rate, some
moderate stimulant. A crust of bread, or a glass of wine, or a
small quantity of ardent spirits, will fortify the system against
the pestilential miasma. Generous diet and fair allowance of
fermented liquor are proper, also, for all persons in aguish
countries."
To substantiate the fact that good living is a safeguard
against malarious fevers, I will add an example which I
noticed in the late Ashantee expedition with an officer of the
1st West Indian Regiment. Lieutenant S- arrived at the
encampment at the Praah on the 30th April, full of strength
and vigour, having just arrived from the West Indies in the
transport. Ten other officers came up with him. Unfortu-
nately, he was not only a vegetarian but a water drinker. He
was able for a week to attend to the duties of the camp, after
which he gradually became weaker. The countries around the
encampment had not in cultivation vegetables which contained
a sufficient amount of protein compound necessary for his
nourishment. He was the first laid up, and he had a most

severe attack of malarious remittent fever; and only ten days
after his arrival I was obliged to send him down to the
coast, where for many weeks he lay in a precarious state, and
for a long time still refused to take any meat or wine. Seeing
the dangerous state into which he had brought himself, he altered
his creed, and began to take beef tea, chicken broth, and wine,
which rallied hin a great deal; but his constitution being too
weak and prostrated, he gained strength very gradually; and
fearing a relapse which might prove fatal, he was invalided to
England.
I should strongly recommend that persons who reside in
malarious districts, or who in any way are exposed to the in-
fluence of malaria, should now and then take the sulphate of
quinine, as it serves as a preventive; or should the person be
attacked, he will have a milder and more manageable disease
than another who has not been so protected. For the very
valuable maxim, which every one knows either from per-
sonal experience or from that of others, should be followed,
which is conveyed in the homely proverb, Prevention is better
than cure. Better, did I say? Infinitely better, because it un-
shackles the system from those concomitant miseries which
would otherwise have fettered it. The best mode of giving
quinine for such a purpose is in the form of quinine wine;
four grains to every ounce of sherry, of which an ounce
should be taken every morning before going out, and repeated,
if requisite in the afternoon. I shall here give one illustra-
tion, out of many which might be brought forward to substan-
tiate this position. In 1852, an expedition was undertaken by
the Admiralty for two purposes: First, of exploring the river
Tsadda from Dagho, the point reached by Allen and Oldfield
in 1833, as far eastward as possible; and, secondly, of endea-
vouring to meet and afford assistance to Drs Barth and Vogel.
Accordingly, the iron steam-schooner 'Pleiad, under the
command of the late Dr Baikie, ascended the Niger. The
Europeans on board were armed with quinine as a prophylactic,
which they took whenever they had occasion to go on exploring

PRECAUTIONS AGAINST YELLOW FEVERS.
291
expeditions, and after three months' voyage in the interior of
Africa, along the swampy banks of a large river, all returned
safe, and in sound health. Of the effects of quinine Dr Baikie
wrote, "Of the measures employed as hygienic, most were of a
general nature, the only more specific one being the free use
of quinine. The amount of sickness was very little, so that,
except with the scorbutic cases, Dr Hutchinson's really medi-
cal duties were not onerous. Of the Europeans the most
exposed to the climatic influences were Mr Harcus, Mr
Guthrie, Mr May, and myself. Mr Harcus was chiefly ex-
posed during the day, and suffered only from frequent head-
ache, and from the effects of the sun's rays. Mr Guthrie,
besides undergoing daily an immense amount of fatigue, slept
regularly on deck, and nevertheless escaped entirely. Mr May
and I were ashore whenever opportunities occurred, and as
often by night as by day. We had frequently to land in
swamps, and other unhealthy spots, yet Mr May had only one
very short and not severe febrile attack. I, in addition, always
slept on deck, and was roused regularly at twelve o'clock, and
three in the morning, for the purpose of recording meteorologi-
cal observations, but while in the river I had constant health.
I mention these circumstances," he goes on to state," to show
that, under proper precautions, Europeans may not only live
quietly, but even commit with impunity what some years ago
would have been considered a terrible indiscretion."
Among other things that should be guarded against is the too
frequent use of drugs, especially calomel, and other mercurials,
which have actually killed far more people in bygone years in
tropical climates than even fever. "Calomel has no real or
curative effect on malarious poison, but only adds fuel to the
fire, as the unfortunate to whom it is administered has to con-
tend against two poisons rather than one." Avoid, also, too
liberal use of intoxicating liquors.
Additional precaution is necessary, especially in the navy, Additional
when an invasion of YELLOW FEVER is threatening. For indi- for yellow
vidual safety the comprehensive maxinn of Celsus should always tever.

be consulted, viz., by timely avoiding the various predisposing
and exciting causes, until the physical sensibility of the system is
reduced by habit; and in proportion as this advice is adhered
to, the naval practitioner may be assured that not only the
chance of sickness will be greatly diminished in his own per-
son, but that in a well-regulated ship, aided by the earnest and
judicious co-operation of the officers, the lives of the men
under his charge may be preserved to an extent beyond his
expectations in ordinary seasons and circumstances. He must
always remember that the prevention is more important than
the treatment.
"The most speedy means of prevention," says Sir J. R.
Martin, "in respect to towns and garrisons will always be
found in the removal of both the sick and the healthy to a
locality where the temperature is sufficiently low, such as a
neighbouring elevated range, or dry, well-ventilated ground.
The next most ready means is segregation."
Quinine should be used twice a-day, and should be con-
tinued for a longer or shorter period, as may be found neces-
sary. The other necessary naval precautions may be thus
epitomised. "Whenever fever makes its appearance on board
ship, the vessel should at once proceed to sea, and to the coolest
atmosphere within reach."
The most immediate measures of prevention should be to
alleviate direct solar exposure, to prevent fatigue, and excesses
in the use of spirituous and fermented liquors.
Seamen should be kept as remote from unhealthy coasts as
is consistent with duty, anchoring some miles out to sea during
the night especially
Duties in boats should be conducted during the mornings
and evenings, avoiding alike the noon-day heat and the deadly
emanations from the shores common to the night.
When men are landed a careful and well-selected encamp-
ment should be chosen on high and dry ground.
Meals should be regularly served and carefully cooked, and
no more spirit ration should be issued than is customary.

PRÉVENTION OF DYSENTERY AND DIARRHEA. 293
Coffee should be given early in the morning as a habit, and
after unusual fatigue, cold, wet, or mental depression; and
labour ought not to commence till coffee has been taken.
Holds of ships should not be cleaned on the spots where the
fever has originated, or during its prevalence, but the cleaning
should be deferred till the arrival of the vessel in a colder
latitude.
Green wood should not be placed on board ship in hot
climates. It ought to be barked, and partly charred.
The inhabitants should use a nourishing but not stimulat-
ing diet, and should maintain a cheerful and confident temper.
Never go to an infected spot with an empty stomach, or
when the body is exhausted by fatigue and perspiration.
Those who are accustomed to drink a large quantity of beer
should give it up. Sherry or port, or a little brandy and water,
will be found more serviceable, and less likely to excite the
liver.
When there is a suspicion that yellow fever is approaching,
the strong, robust, newly arrived individuals should at once be
put to sea, or removed to a climate where the temperature
is not above 60° F. If this is impossible, they should seek a
mountain retreat where thorough ventilation is certain to be
secured by strong winds; or remove to the borders of the sea,
where the strong sea-breeze is able continually to sweep the
foul air generated from the soil. They must always remember
that they are the most susceptible to attack.

Celsus has truly remarked, that by timely avoiding the pre- Causes and

exciting causes without making any remarks, leaving my
readers to deduce the prevention.

III.—CHOLERA.
The prevention of cholera is a most important subject, and,
in countries where the disease is occasionally epidemic, it
deserves the consideration of every one.
During the outbreak of 1865 the Public Council of Hygiene
and Salubrity of Paris for the Department of the Seine, pub-
lished a series of admonitory instructions and recommendations,
of which the following is an abstract:-
1. Tranquillity of mind.
2. Moderate, healthy, and regular nourishment.
3. Clothing which will prevent exposure to sudden transi-
tions of temperature.

4. Free ventilation of dwelling-houses, and avoidance of
over-crowding.
5. Avoidance of physical and mental fatigue.
6. Attention to the earliest symptoms of diarrhea.
The instruction continues, It may be affirmed that, with rare
exceptions, however sudden the attack may be, the cholera is
yet preceded by symptoms which may induce fear as to its
development. The commonest of these symptoms is diarrhea,
however slight; and such is its importance, that the removal
of the symptoms, immediately on its development, will suffice
to prevent the malady. It would, therefore, be dangerous to
let the diarrhea continue; and, consequently, as it may be
arrested by every simple means, they may be resorted to before
the arrival of the doctor, who ought always to be sent for with-
out delay. Those means are the following :-Partial or com-
plete abstinence from food, the use of rice and its preparations,
an infusion of camomile tea, and copious injections with a
decoction of marsh-mallow and unprepared starch.
When there are symptoms of cholera, such as watery
diarrhoea, vomiting, cramps, coolness and blueness of surface,
&c., the following recommendations are given :-
The instant any of these symptoms show themselves, a phy-
sician must be called for, and, while waiting his arrival, the
means adopted must be the following:—The skin should be
heated and warmth obtained by placing a bottle of hot water,
or heated bricks wrapped in a sheet, at the feet of the patient
and between the legs. He must be covered up in warm sheets
and several blankets, between which hot irons or a warming-
pan should be agitated up and down, so as to act upon the
whole surface of the body. While these steps are in prepa-
ration, or even in progress, the limbs should be rubbed for a
considerable time with force with the palm of the hand, a soft
brush, or a piece of flannel, which latter may be moistened
with camphorated brandy, brandy alone, or eau de Cologne;
and these should be done by two persons seated at each side
of the patient, taking care not to uncover him. The drink

given should be a hot infusion of linden, tea, or peppermint,
tinctured with a few drops of brandy. Should these tisanes,
however, appear to increase the vomiting, gaseous water and ice
in small pieces may be advantageously resorted to, and sina-
pisms down over the legs and thighs. It will always be well,
if possible, to let the patient be in a separate room, so as to
place him in the most favourable conditions for salubrity.
The precautions to be taken during convalescence will be inti-
mated by the physician who may be called
Regulations Dr Clark, of the 84th Regiment, anticipating the cholera
84th Regi- outbreak in Malta, drew up the following series of regulations
for the guidance of the officer commanding:
"1. Perfect cleanliness of barracks and immediate neigh-
bourhood.
2. Careful inspection and purification of drains, privies, and
ashpits.
3. Ventilation of barrack-rooms at all times, and airing of
beds and bedding, with rubbing and brushing of walls and
floors every second day.
4. Care in selection of vegetables for consumption, and dis-
couragement of eating ices.
5. Use of a cholera belt.
6. Hot coffee to be issued to each man before leaving quar-
ters in the morning. Men suffering from diarrhea to go into
hospital at once.
7. Troops to be prohibited from visiting infected neighbour-
hoods.
8. On cholera appearing in any portion of the barracks
then occupied, it is to be vacated at once, and the force attacked
to be removed into other barracks or camped out."
Regulations In the present outbreak (1866) the College of Physicians
Physicians of has given the following instructions for the treatment of
cholera:-

medical officer, Mr Simon, addressed a letter to the College of
Physicians relating to the expediency of issuing instructions

TREATMENT OF CHOLERA.

to captains of merchant vessels, "how they should act when
proper medical attendance cannot be procured, so as to provide
for the health of their crews against attacks of cholera,' the
following is the substance of the reply forwarded by the
College:-
Their lordships request to be informed whether, in the
opinion of the College, any, and if so, what suggestions might
be issued as representing the present state of medical know-
ledge and experience with regard to the drugs which should
be given, or other treatment which should be adopted, in
attacks of cholera, and especially in the beginning of the
disease, when proper medical attendance cannot be procured.
Their lordships, at the same time, submit to the College a copy
of the instructions issued on previous occasions. With reference
to that part of the instructions on which their lordships par-
ticularly request the opinion of the College, viz., that which
relates (1.) to the necessity of avoiding purgative medicines
during the prevalence of cholera, and (2.) the measures to be
adopted when cholera appears on board ship, the Committee
think-
1. That when opening medicine is required, the mildest
should be selected, as castor oil or rhubarb. Glauber's salts
and Epsom salts are dangerous. The common belief that pro-
longed costiveness should not be interfered with during the
prevalence of cholera is erroneous.
2. That the master should ascertain by inquiry, morning
and evening, whether any of the crew are labouring under
diarrhoea; and if so, the following recommendations are sub-
joined for his guidance:
3. That if a man be attacked with diarrhoea, he should,
whenever it is possible, be sent to bed and kept warm, and
some aromatic and astringent medicine, containing a small
quantity of opium, should be given to him at once, and should
be repeated every hour or two, according to the severity of the
purging. It is suggested that ten grains of the aromatic
powder of chalk and opium (of the " British Pharmacopoeia")

should be so given in half a glass of peppermint water or weak
brandy and water. Should this medicine not be at hand, five
measured drops of laudanum may be substituted for each dose
of the powder.
Large doses of opium, or of ardent spirits, should be avoided.
If the diarrhea should result from bad or obviously indigestible
food, or if the discharges are unnaturally offensive and attended
with griping pain, it would be desirable to give a dose of either
of the gentle laxatives above-named before administering the
opiates.
The diet should consist mainly of beef tea or broth, gruel, or
rice.
If the discharges become colourless and watery (the purging
being of the kind commonly called "rice water purging"), and
be accompanied with vomiting and coldness, the opiates should
no longer be persisted in, and spirituous liquors should be
avoided. The patient should be strictly kept in the recumbent
position; he should be allowed to drink water freely, and
should be abundantly supplied with fresh air. Warm applica-
tions should be used to the feet and legs, and a mustard poul-
tice should be applied to the pit of the stomach. Cramps may
be treated by rubbing the affected parts with the warm hand.
In all cases medical advice, when obtainable, should be ob-
tained as soon as possible."
The following INSTRUCTIONS to commanding, medical, and
other officers of the army, for their guidance at a time when
there is reason to anticipate an outbreak of cholera, or when it
is actually prevalent among the troops, has just been received
by the author (September 1866):-
"Officers whose duty it is to see to the health and comfort of
the troops are especially required to exercise the utmost vigi-
lance at a time when cholera is prevalent, or when there is
reason to believe an outbreak may be expected."

"MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED IN ANTICIPATION OF A THREATENED
INVASION OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN MILITARY STATIONS.
I. Medical officers should make themselves acquainted with
every arrangement of their corps, and the condition of every
locality in and about the barracks, in order that they may be
in a position to suggest, for the consideration of their com-
manding officers, not only improvements in ordinary matters,
but arrangements of a more temporary character applicable to
an exceptional period.
II. Nuisances should be removed, and cleanliness enforced
outside barracks, by calling on local boards, or persons entrusted
with power to remove nuisances, to put these in force.
III. As much space as is practicable should be afforded to
each individual in barracks. On this account any existing mis-
appropriations should be restored to their proper use.
IV. Ventilation of all the buildings should receive careful
attention, not only by remedying structural defects when prac-
ticable, but by enforcing the full use of the means of ventila-
tion, in keeping open all apertures intended specially for ven-
tilating purposes.
V. The instructions laid down in the Queen's Regulations
regarding the cleansing and supervision of barrack-rooms are
to be carefully observed. The floor of the rooms should not
be washed in wet weather. The regular airing of bedding, and
its exposure out of doors in fine weather, is to be attended
to. And if epidemic cholera appears in the country, it would
seem desirable to cleanse and lime-wash ceilings and walls of
all barracks, hospitals, quarters, and stables.
VI. All sewers, latrines, urinals, and ash-pits should be in-
spected frequently, and their cleanliness ensured by an efficient
system of frequent flushing and cleansing. Any accumulation
in such places should be scrupulously removed, as it must be
borne in mind that during the prevalence of an epidemic it is
injudicious to disturb old accumulations. A free use of lime
is enjoined.

VII. Every source of water supply should be investigated, and
the possibilityof contamination by percolation from sewage, or
from surface impurities, looked to. An examination should be
made of the water, and any such impurities detected in it
should at once preclude its use for drinking or cooking purposes.
VIII. Attention is to be directed to the soldier's rations, and
care taken that they never fall below the standard quality; and
the men are to be enjoined to be careful as to what they eat,
and the purchase of any articles deemed indigestible or
deleterious to health should be discouraged as much as
possible.
IX. As much variety as possible is to be afforded in the
cooking of the rations.
X. The canteen is to be frequently visited, and its supplies
carefully examined.
XI. It is unnecessary for medical officers to recommend any
change in the ordinary duties of the men, as long as they are
not excessive, beyond suggesting the advisability of reducing
the night duties to the minimum that the necessities of the
station will permit, and pointing out to the commanding
officer, that any duty subjecting the men to wet clothes or wet
feet should be avoided when possible, and when such exposure
is unavoidable, that the wet articles should be changed as
speedily as possible.
XII. Medical officers should make frequent inquiry as to the
existence of diarrhoea amongst the men; and in the event of
affections of the bowels being prevalent, should enjoin an im-
mediate application to hospital for medicine, not necessarily
with the view of the men being detained in hospital.
In addition to the foregoing instructions, when the disease
has appeared among the inhabitants in the vicinity of a military
station, or among the military of the station, the following
are to be carefully attended to :-
I. The occurrence of cholera in places where troops are sta-
tioned is immediately to be reported to the Director-General
by the principal or senior medical officer, without waiting for

301
its appearance being officially announced by the local board of
health.
II. A daily report, as accurate as can be obtained, of the
progress of cholera amongst the civil population where troops
are stationed, will also be required from the principal or senior
medical officer.
III. The men should be prohibited going into the infected
districts, pickets should be placed to prevent them. It may
be advisable to confine the troops to barracks, and prohibit
any but the most necessary intercourse with persons outside.
IV. All families living out of barracks should be brought in,
if it be possible to do so without over-crowding. If the season
permitted they might be encamped, or if there were danger
of overcrowding, houses admitting of partial or complete isola-
tion might be hired.
V. Men rejoining from furlough, or under any circumstances
from a distance, or recruits arriving, are to be separated from
the other men for at least a week.
VÍ. Good fires are to be provided in the barrack-rooms to
increase ventilation, and to diffuse a cheerfulness, which last
should be promoted in every way.
VII. Disinfectants, such as chloride of lime or zinc, prepara-
tions of carbolic acid, perchloride of iron, or other approved
preparations, should be used in latrines, urinals, sewers, ash-
bins, and other similar places, twice daily. A non-commis-
sioned officer with a fatigue party should be instructed in the
performance of this duty, which is to be rigorously carried
out, and either the quarter-master or orderly officer should be
held responsible for its execution. Disinfectants will be ob-
tained from the barrack department on the spot.
VIII. Married men (if out of mess) should each be provided
with a ration the same as the single men.
IX. The men are to be cautioned against intemperance, and
every means adopted to repress it, and night passes must be
prohibited.
X. Tea or coffee is to be issued to the men before going on

morning or night duties; and every man to have his break-
fast, if possible, before leaving the barrack-room for parades or
other duties.
XI. On the occurrence of a case of cholera among the troops
a report is to be forwarded by the senior medical officer to the
Director-General, and continued daily until further orders.
XII. Questions of importance not admitting of delay may
be telegraphed to the Director-General by the principal medi-
cal officer.
XIII. On the appearance of cholera in a corps, it should be
camped out when practicable, provided the season of the year
will permit of it. Good ground should be selected beforehand,
and arrangements made by the Quarter-master General's de-
partment.
XIV. Health inspections are to be made at morning and
evening parades, and a daily inspection of every individual
attached to the regiment, but the avoidance of all unnecessary
alarm cannot be too strongly enjoined.
XV. Each soldier is to be provided with two cholera belts
as part of his necessaries. Flannel shirts ought also to be
worn.
XVI. It has been found desirable, during the prevalence of
cholera, to boil and filter through charcoal all drinking water.
XVII. The minds of the men should as much as possible
be occupied and amused. Every game or employment tending
to recreation, or to induce healthy exercise, should be pro-
moted. Occasional marches for short distances into the
country, without arms, might be advisable.
XVIII. Diarrhea should be most carefully attended to
during the prevalence of cholera, and non-commissioned
officers are to be instructed to order all men to hospital
whom they may detect suffering from looseness of the bowels.
Sentries should be placed in the vicinity of the latrines, and
men found going twice in quick succession to the rear should
be sent to hospital immediately. It might be advantageous
for the better detection of this usually painless affection, that

303
tickets be provided for the men, and every time a man went
to the rear one of them handed to the sentry; but a man not
having his ticket should be allowed to pass, and his name
reported to the orderly sergeant. A room for observation in
hospital should be provided for such men, and their motions
treated as in the case of cholera patients. Medicines are to be
kept prepared for issue to such cases, day and night, and, to
avoid delay, a supply should be placed in the hands of non-
commissioned officers in barracks, to be exhibited to men while
preparing to go to hospital.
XIX. The place whence a patient is taken from barracks is
to be thoroughly washed, the bedding and bedstead removed,
and fumigation made by chlorine or nitrous acid gas. The
barrack bedding is to be removed with cholera or suspicious
cases to the hospital.
XX. If, however, it is found that any preponderance of cases
of cholera or diarrhea occur in any building or rooms, the
medical officers should carefully examine the locality with a
view to detecting or remedying any unsanitary condition.
Should such be appreciable either in the building or its vicinity,
the building or room should be vacated and fumigated with
chlorine, nitrous, or sulphurous acid fumes, and the walls and
floors scraped and cleansed, and the former lime-washed before
reoccupation.
XXI. When cases occur in camp, the ground should, if pos-
sible, be changed, as so successfully practised in India; but
where this may be impracticable, as would usually be the case
at home, the tents should be struck, and the ground cleansed
and aired before repitching them.
XXII. If the troops are not camped out, the regimental
hospital is to be appropriated to the treatment of cholera, and
the ordinary cases of sickness accommodated in barracks, in
rooms set apart and equipped for the purpose, or, where this
cannot be done, in a hired house—an application for carrying
out the latter arrangement being previously submitted to the
Director-General. Should the troops be encamped, all the sick

will be treated in tents, the tents for cholera patients being
placed in an isolated position.
XXIII. Medical officers are to visit their hospitals fre-
quently. They will be required to be always available for any
sudden call on their services, and when cholera prevails in the
corps, they are not to leave the barracks except under impera-
tive necessity.
XXIV. Great caution is advisable in the use of medicines
of a purgative character during the prevalence of the disease.
XXV. Cases among the wives and children of soldiers are
to be treated in the female hospital, where such institutions
exist, provided the regiment is not camped out. In stations
where there is no female hospital, application should be made
to the proper authorities for a room to be allotted or accom-
modation to be hired.
XXVI. The women should be warned that if they or their
children are attacked with diarrhoea they must at once go to
hospital.
XXVII. The patient's barrack bedding is to be used in
hospital. The purveyor will provide palliasses and pillows with
straw in the event of a change being requisite. All the hair
mattresses and pillows are to be removed from the hospital to
equip the rooms set apart for the treatment of the ordinary
cases of sickness when cholera attacks the troops.
XXVIII. When the barrack bedding is no longer required
for use the straw is to be burnt, and the bedding disinfected,
and treated in accordance with paragraph 7, page 40, Medical
Regulations (boiling water being used). The foregoing is ap-
plicable to hospital sheets, blankets, clothing, and other such
articles of hospital equipment as may be used. But such por-
tions of the soldier's kit as cannot be so treated should be ex-
posed to the air and sun for a week, fumigated, and beaten.
It would be advisable not to take them into use until the
epidemic had quite ceased.
XXIX. The stool and vomit should be passed into vessels
and deodorised, at once removed, and carefully buried deep,

and at a distance from the possibility of percolation to any
water supply; or a latrine could be set apart into which they
could be thrown, which should not for the time being be used
for any other purpose, and care should be taken that no other
latrine or water-closet is so used.*
XXX. The attendants upon cholera patients should not be
taken from this special work to attend on other cases of dis-
ease so long as cholera exists in the barracks or hospital. They
are to be enjoined to wash their hands well whenever they
have been in contact with the discharges of the sick.
XXXI. Corpses are to be removed to the dead-house without
delay, buried as soon as possible, but never conveyed to the
graveyard on men's shoulders.
XXXII. Post-mortem examinations are to be performed in
such cases, and under such modifications as may be necessary.
By order of the Secretary of State for War.
EDWARD LUGARD.
* The power of the dissemination of cholera by means of the excreta is
now so generally believed, and has been asserted by so many eminent
members of the medical profession, that it cannot be overlooked in consider-
ing preventive measures at the present day.

In the above summary the observations in Sierra Leone
must be regarded, as yet, as incomplete. I have not had the
advantage of being stationed for military duties at Freetown,
or I should, from personal investigation, and researches in the
records of the colony, have been able to gather sufficient inte-
resting information on the points under consideration; but I
hope I shall be able in time to do so.
