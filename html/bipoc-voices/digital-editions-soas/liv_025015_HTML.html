<h3 id="h3-title" class="center large">CAFFRES.</h3>
<h4 class="overhang left"><em>Extract of a Letter from Mr. Brownlee, (who was originally sent out by the London
Missionary Society in 1816, but who is now a Missionary to the Caffres, under the direction of
the Colonial Government) to Dr. Philip, who introduces it to the secretary as follows:</em>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">M<span class="small">Y</span> D<span class="small">EAR</span> S<span class="small">IR</span>&#8212;The friends of the Society will be very much gratified with the enclosed
communication. It is extracted from a letter of Mr. Brownlee, dated Jan. 28, 1822. I hope Mr.
Brownlee, with his associates, will, by the blessing of God, be enabled to carry on this great
work among the Caffres, happily begun by our late excellent Missionary, Mr. Williams.
Considering the short time Mr. Williams was engaged in that interesting Mission, the good he
appears to have been the instrument of doing is truly great, and entirely refutes all the
nonsense which has been advanced against missions to savages. The harvest is great, O that the
Lord may send us abundance of such men as Pacalt and Wilhams into his vineyard. Under the
blessing of God, all depends upon the character and qualifications of the Missionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;c. J<span class="small">OHN</span> P<span class="small">HILIP</span>.</p>
<hr class="bv-hr-double"/>
<p>I A<span class="small">M</span> much obliged to you for the information communicated in your last letter. As it respects
us in our work, I have little to communicate; we have no reason to be discouraged; and since I
wrote to you, we have had a considerable addition to the Institution, so that the members
belonging to it exceed 200. Some of them have made considerable increase in knowledge; and from
what I can learn from close observation, it appears there is a sort of general desire for
teachers expressed by many of the distant Caffres. I believe were Missionaries to go to any part
of the Caffreland, if not too near to Gaika, they would be able, in a very short time, to
collect a congregation. All the people who came here lately belonged to a kraal that was
formerly near the Institution on the Cat River. The head of the kraal died in May last, and his
conduct ever since the death of Mr. Williams was like that of one who had tasted that the Lord
is gracious. It was his constant practice, after he had gained a little knowledge, to
communicate the same; and for this purpose they met in a large hut, built on purpose, twice a
day for worship. And in all the different vicissitudes they experienced since the above
mentioned period, wherever they wandered, they erected a hut for the worship of God, amidst the
reproach and persecution of the surrounding Caffres.</p>
<p>On the day in which <em>Sicana</em> died, all of the people of the kraal met as usual for
worship in the morning. He was present, and addressed his audience in a very solemn and
affecting manner to the following effect: "I now speak to you for the last time, from a
conviction that this day I shall die. It has pleased God to afflict me with sickness; but to
this I have been resigned, knowing that God can both give health or disease as he sees fit. My
soul and body are both in his hands. You are in the midst of wolves, therefore as quickly as
possible remove to the teacher, as he is the only friend you have in this land, and rather than
give up the service of God suffer death, as the situation of all without Christ is wretched.
They are dead and without God. On my decease, go and say to all the chiefs amongst the Caffres,
that God's word is sent amongst them, and they will do well to listen to it, otherwise they may
expect the most serious consequences.</p>
<p>He died at the time he signified, and his last injunction has been complied with, and the whole
of the people that belonged to his kraal came here in June, and I am happy to say that their
conduct for the most part is superior to that of the other people who have been much longer at
the Institution.</p>
