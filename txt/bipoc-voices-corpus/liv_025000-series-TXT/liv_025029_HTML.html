  <p>MY DEAR FRIENDS,â€”I, Chenjee, your affectionate girl, send my salams. Up to this day, 17th
    April, 1849, I have attended the Missionary-school at Bellary, supported by kind friends at
    Sunderland, and, by the help of God, I try to learn the truths of his Word daily. On Sunday
    morning I go to the Mission Chapel to repeat my lessons to her. I do all I can to assist my kind
    mistress in teaching the younger girls. I need your support and feel very thankful to you for
    all you have done for me and my school-fellows. Psalm xxv, 5: "Lead me in thy truth, and teach
    me thy statutes."</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">With many salams,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">Yours affectionately,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">CHENJEE.</p>
