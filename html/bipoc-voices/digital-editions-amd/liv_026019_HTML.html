  <h5 style="text-align:center;">TAMAHANA TE RAUPARAHA.</h5>
  <p>Then I went to Wellington, and sold my pigs for 5<em>l</em>. With the money
    I bought plates, knives, cups and saucers, sugar, and tea. My servant
    helped to pack up the things, and we brought them to Otaki. Then I
    made a feast. I got a large pot, very large, with no top. I put the tea,
    and sugar, and milk, in it, all together. I had only a few cups and saucers,
    so I put a cup to two men, and a saucer to two men. Then I got plenty
    of food. I had a little mill. We ground some flour, and made bread.
    We had no oven then, but baked it in the ashes. We got, too, pork, and
    fowls, and geese. After all was ready, when prayers in the church were
    finished in the evening, I spoke to the chiefs, and the friends who had
    said I was proud&#8212;about twenty of them, or more. I told them to come
    to my house to a meeting, for I had new talk to tell them. I did not
    tell them about the feast. I went to the door of my house to see the
    people come in: those who had blankets on I stopped, but those who had
    coats and trousers I let come in. Then the men in blankets were very sorry.
    They said, "We are poor, we have no coats." I said, "I will not let
    people come to my house in blankets; but if you will tell me you will
    throw away your blankets and wear English clothes, then I will let you
    come this time." They said they would do so; so I let them come in,
    and they promised they would go to Wellington and sell pigs, to buy
    coats and trousers. I was not angry with them when I did not let them
    come in. I loved them, only I wished them to be like English. When
    the people saw the fest they all said "Oh!" and they held up their hands.
    I am sorry I cannot make a picture of my people when they first saw it,
    as they stood all surprised, with their mouths and their eyes wide open.
    Then they ate and drank, and were very happy. They could not cut
    with the knives: they took the food in their hands, and dipped their cups
    in the great pot, and drank them all off at one time. And they did not
    spread the butter on the bread: they scraped it up in large lumps, and ate
    it; and they said, "Ah! English food is very good. You are clever:
    we will follow you." I said, "Now you have finished the food for the
    body, I will tell you the other food for the heart that I wanted you to
    come here for. God has taught me this way, that we should all come
    together in it. I am glad you have come English way in making your
    town, your houses, and thrown away your bad ways. First of all, as
    we said when our minister baptized us, we threw away the bad works, and
    believed in God; then we threw away our bad houses, which before had
    been dark, like our hearts had been. Now I want you to <em>go on</em>, to throw
    away the bad food and bad customs. Have plates, knives, and forks.
    <em>Go on, go on.</em> Now, my dear friends, how do you like English food? I
    see how fast your hands have carried it to your mouth, and I think you
    like it very much." All held up their hands, and said, "Yes, yes! your
    words are true." I said, "Very well: all right. Now I want to talk
    one word more to you. We have finished the house of God, we have
    finished the houses for our bodies; and now it is right that we should take
    care of the food for our bodies. I should like you to make a water-mill
    to grind our corn&#8212;not a little mill for the hand, but a large one, fit to
    be the brother to the town." They said, "Ah! we cannot do that.
    Where is the money?" I said, "You sell flax, and corn, and pigs, to the
    English, and get money: with some buy clothes and things for yourselves,
    and give some to the mill. Go, too, and work on the English
    road, and their farms, and earn money for the mill." All held up their
    hands and shouted, and said, "Very true."</p>
  <p>We did so. Ruta made butter, and I worked in my farm and sold my
    corn, and we gave 30<em>l</em>.; Martyn and his family 100<em>l</em>.; and all gave
    some. In two years and a half we had collected 300<em>l</em>. Then soon we
    got another, for which we paid 200<em>l</em>., and also one at Porirua, for 150<em>l</em>.
    I worked with my hands at the ground, to help get the money. Then all
    the people went the right way.</p>
  <p>Then I thought again, and my heart said it would be a good way to
    have a baker, a butcher, and a store for clothes, in our town. After a
    time, that, too, was done.</p>
  <p>Then I said to my father, "Now you have come on shore again, let
    us go on with the large church, the largest in New Zealand, which you
    began before, larger than the one in Waikanae." My father said, "O
    yes!" and he spoke to the people, that they should cut wood. I had then
    given up the power to my father, and when he went wrong I showed
    him the right way. Then we all went into the bush to cut wood&#8212;the
    totara wood&#8212;for the church. The totara is the strongest wood in New
    Zealand, and very beautiful too. When we had cut the wood, then we
    began to build. We were two years and a half in building it."</p>
  <p>The next object which Tamahana thought of was a college, in
    which the most promising of the natives might be trained as catechists
    and schoolmasters, so that the people might well be instructed,
    and Christianity take root amongst them. It was the hope of
    accomplishing this which brought him to England, that he might bring
    his plans before the Committee of the Society. But we shall let
    him speak his own thoughts on this subject in a subsequent Number.</p>
