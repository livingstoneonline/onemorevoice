Preface.
SINCE my journey "Across Africa," much has been done
to open up the Dark Continent; but I am afraid that
British people in general do not realize how important
to us as a commercial nation is the future of Africa,
and we are unfortunately allowing foreign nations to
benefit by the labours of Livingstone, Burton, and
other British explorers.
Our possessions in South Africa are destined to play
a great part in the future regeneration and civilization
of the whole continent. Fifty years ago the country
occupied by the Transvaal Republic was practically
unexplored: it was in 1849 that Livingstone discovered
Lake Ngami; in 1859 that he discovered Lake Nyassa ;
in 1857 that Burton and Speke started on the journey
which resulted in the discovery of Lake Tanganyika
and Victoria Nyanza; while in 1863 the journey of
Speke and Grant, which solved the question of all ages
as to the sources of the Nile, was finished. Since then
Baker has discovered the Albert Nyanza.

PREFACE.
I have crossed Tropical Africa from east to west,
being the first man of European blood to succeed in
what was considered an impossible task; Stanley has
traced the Congo from Nysugwe to the Atlantic; and
now missionaries, explorers, and traders are rapidly
spreading in all directions, and we must not forget
that the hero Charles Gordon was one of our African
travellers.
In this book for boys I have endeavoured to give a
sketch of times which are, though in point of years but
yesterday, fading out of the memory of men. Where
the giraffe and gnu grazed, the flocks of the farmer
find sustenance; and even the dreaded Kalahari Desert
is being shorn of its terrors, and at no distant time
may be occupied by squatters who, in wealth and pros-
perity, will rival those of Australia.
The boys of Britain must remember that the future
of the British Empire will depend upon them, and the
more they know of her vast dependencies the more
fitted they will be for the duties and responsibilities of
that glorious heritage.

JACK HOOP E R.
EARLY REMEMBRANCES-TOM BATTEX-WINTER EVENINGS-A HOLIDAY-HAMOAZE
-OHANNEL SQUADRON-THE THREE BRIGS-READY, OH !
My earliest remembrances were of a country cottage
embowered in roses, situated in a lovely Cornish village
not far from Plymouth, where I lived with my widowed
mother. My father had been a warrant-officer in the
navy, and had lost his life in an action with a slaver,
leaving my mother with but scanty means of sub-
sistence.
Some of my father's prize-money was obtained by
the exertions of his old ship-mates, and with it my
mother purchased the tiny cottage where we lived, and
intrusted the remainder to her brother, who was a
prosperous ship-chandler at Falmouth; which, in addi-
tion to her pension, gave her what she required for food
and clothing for herself and me.
Until I was fourteen years of age I lived happily
with my mother, who taught me all she knew, and also
sent me to a school kept by an old gentleman who pro-

EARLY DAYS.
citement a great de board one
fessed to teach the rudiments of a sound commercial
education, and instil the elements of navigation into
the heads of would-be skippers of coasting brigs and
schooners.
Our only excitement was an occasional trip to Ply-
mouth, where it was my great delight to visit the men-
of-war, and especially to get on board one old ship the
Swiftsure, lying up in ordinary, where one of the ship-
keepers was a pensioner who had served with my father,
and used to tell me many yarns about his bravery and
seamanship
From this old friend I learned how to pull, and steer,
and manage a boat under sail, as well as to make most
of the sailor knots and splices; as, although my mother
made me promise never to go to sea whilst she was
alive, Job Motram said there was no knowing what
might turn up, and all these things might some day
prove useful
As I got to be a big boy my mother used to let me
go down to Torpoint with one or two of my friends
and school-mates, and there meet Job Motram in the
boat belonging to his hulk; and with him we used
sometimes to sail up the Tamar, at other times to go
fishing in the Sound or Cawsand Bay, or, as on one
ever-to-be-remembered day, make a trip round the
Eddystone.
On that day my special chum, Tom Batten, was to
come, whose father was boatswain of the Tyne frigate,
which, according to Tom, was the smartest craft that

had ever been, or ever would be, in the British Navy;
and besides him two of our school-fellows-Willie
Wotton and Joey Lorton. Both these were sons of
skippers of brigs which traded from Plymouth, and
their great ambition was some day to go to sea in the
paternal craft.
Tom and I, as belonging in our estimation to the
Royal Navy, at all events by descent, used, as a rule,
rather to despise these homely brigs, though we never
failed to avail ourselves of an opportunity to go on
board when either the Sarah Jane or the Plymouth
Lass came into harbour, and were always kindly treated
by their worthy skippers.
Tom Batten was the same age as myself to within a
few months, but was a taller and more powerful boy,
with dark brown eyes and brown curly hair, as active
as a monkey, and a thoroughly good swimmer. He
was our leader in all our sports and amusements, and
I looked forward with regret to his early departure to
join one of Her Majesty's ships as a boy.
Although we were such chums, I was very different
from him in appearance, being small for my age and
slight, with flaxen hair and blue eyes.
Out of doors I always followed his lead, and had to
be content with striving to emulate him; but at our
books it was different, and I easily outstripped him in
navigation and the other subjects our old master taught
us, though, to tell the truth, he took little trouble over
them, averring that his ambition in life was to be like

A HOLIDAY.
his father, the boatswain of a smart frigate, and in that
position book-learning was not of much use.
Still on the winter evenings, whilst my mother was
busy with her needle mending my clothes or darning
my stockings, and her candle was still burning, Tom
used to come over from his mother's cottage, which was
but a short distance from ours, and listen to me reading
Robinson Crusoe and one or two other old books of
nautical adventure which had belonged to my father,
and which my mother had preserved as sacred relics.
Willie and Joey were ordinary hearty and honest
English boys, devoted to the sea; and being two years
younger than Tom and myself, were our admiring fol-
lowers, and only too delighted to accompany us on any
of our cruises and adventures.
This day we all started for Torpoint as soon as our
respective mothers would let us, for it had long been
arranged that Job Motram should take advantage of his
having a holiday on the Queen's birthday to get permis-
sion to have a larger boat than he could usually obtain,
and take us for a sail round the Eddystone Lighthouse.
I remember my dear mother, as my share of the
provisions we were to take, had made me a pilchard
pasty, and Tom had a huge piece of plum-dough, or
as he called it in west country vernacular, "figgy-
dowdy;" and the other two brought bread, cheese, and
a piece of cold pork; whilst, after much persuasion, Mrs.
Batten and my mother had given us a stone jar of
cider to drink.


## p. 19 (#21) ##############################################

"WHAT CHEER?"
Thus equipped, we arrived at the hard* at Torpoint,
and found that we were more than half an hour before
the time which Job Motram had fixed for us; and to
while away the time we amused ourselves with hunting
for crabs under the loose stones at the landing-place.
After waiting for a time which seemed interminable
we made out the Swiftsure's boat coming in towards
us steered by old Job, and having as passengers some
of the other pensioners living up in ordinary, who were
going to take advantage of the fine May day to stretch
their legs ashore, and forgather with some of their old
ship-mates who lived near Torpoint.
"What cheer, my hearties ?" hailed Job. "I hope
you'll all be as ready to answer your muster when
you're called for duty as you are now when you have a
bit of a spree under way.
"Now I've landed my passengers, tumble on board.
Here you, Tom, you go forward and work the head-
sheets-Jack Hooper here shall steer for a bit; and you
other two lads can work the main and mizzen sheets
with me.
"What have you in your bundles ?"
"We've brought food with us for the day, and
mother and Mrs. Batten have given us some cider."
"That's right; let's stow our hold before we start," he
said, as he put our supplies into the lockers with which
the boat was fitted. "I've trusted to you for the

THE CHANNEL SQUADRON.
rations to-day; my old woman has enough to do to look
after the children and herself to feed me when out on
a holiday."
'All was soon in order, and we shoved off from the
Torpoint hard, and with an ebb tide making under us
began to beat out of Hamoaze.
Past the leviathan three-deckers and the coquettish
brigs, the dashing frigates and stately two-deckers that
dotted the surface of the Hamoaze, we made our way,
old Job having a story to tell about each, pointing out
the Canopus as being one of the prizes taken during
the French war, and still holding her own among the
men-of-war of the day. Devonport dock-yard and its
huge sheds, where fresh ships were being built, and
where usually ship - wrights and calkers looked like
nests of busy ants among the ribs of the half-finished
monsters, attracted part of our attention; though the
day being a holiday, none were now at work. Mount
Edgcumbe and its lovely woods were soon passed, and
we then made a lay between Mount Wise and Drake's
Island, and fetched into the Sound, where the Channel
squadron of four two-deckers and three frigates was
lying at anchor.
"Now, my lads," said Job Motram, "you may have a
good look at the wooden walls of England. It's nigh
upon forty years since first I broke a biscuit on board
one of His Majesty's (as they were then) ships, and I'm
still alive and hearty ; but there's been many a change
since I first served under the pennant. See, now, there's

the Arethusa and Leander; why, they are line-of-battle
ships in disguise—not but what they are handsome as
ships can be, though those smoking craft they have
now they say will take the place of them all soon."
"All right, Job; we must get out to sea if we are to
fetch the Eddystone. Can't we lay out for Cawsand
now?" said Tom. "Jack, you put the helm down and
go round. Never mind Job; he'll tell us about the
number of guns and their weight. What does it mat-
ter about a ship's guns? Look at the masts and rig-
ging: the Arethusa's twice as neat aloft as the Lean-
der.—Now, Job, who's the best man — boatswain or
gunner?"
"Never you mind, Tom; you do your duty whether
you're in the gunner's crew or in the fore-top, and you'll
find that you'll get on. What would be the good of a
man-of-war without guns?" .
"All right, Job. There are three brigs lying in Caw-
sand Bay: one is just home from the West Coast, and the
two others are only just commissioned; let us have a
look at them."
" All right, my boy.—Jack, you steer for the middle
brig—the black one. I think she's the Waterwitch,
which has taken more slavers than ever another ship.
She was a yacht once."
With the steady breeze that was blowing we soon
came up to the brigs.
"Sure enough," said Job, "she is the Waterwitch,
and the other two are the Childers and Frolic."


## p. 22 (#24) ##############################################

"READY, OH."
"Look at the Frolic: she's the biggest brig in the
service; that boom mainsail of hers would make a
driver for the flag-ship of the Channel fleet there. But
the Waterwitch is the beauty. I remember how her
boats were nearly lost in an action with a slaver up a
river in Africa ; I was there, too, as coxswain of the
pinnace of the Melampus, which was attached to the
Waterwitch for the service."
"How was it, can you tell us ?" said I.
"All right, Jack, my boy, I will some day; but now
we must get round on the other tack and stand for the
Mewstone, and perhaps then I'll try and spin you a
yarn."
" Thank you.---Tom! mind your head-sheets. Ready,
oh! Helm's a-lee," and round the boat came.
When the sheets were all hauled aft, Tom said he
wanted to hear the yarn, and said Joey or Willie must
keep the look-out.
Job said, "I can settle for you all to hear; I can sit
by the main shroud; and if we reeve a line from the
tiller, Jack can steer sitting close to me, and the rest
can keep the look-out in turns."
These arrangements were soon made; and Job seeing
all right, began telling us stories of his life on board
ship.

AFTER a few more tacks we got near the Eddystone
Lighthouse, and Tom proposed that we should pay it a
visit.
Job Motram looked up and said, "Ay, lad, we can get
there if you like. It's a long time since I've been here,
though at one time I did think of bearing up for the
lighthouse service; but I gave it up when I thought
how lonely it would be if your mate died, as happened
once, and the man left alive had to keep his chum's
dead body in the lighthouse for six weeks before he
could get a chance to communicate with the shore.
Bill Cundy, who was an old messmate of mine in that
same Melampus we were talking of, is in this Eddy-
stone, and he likes it; but he has never had a wife,
and never cared much about speaking to any one."
We shortened sail under Job's directions, and then
paddled the boat up to the iron stairs which formed
the landing-place to the lighthouse. It was nearly low

tide when we got there, and the rocks were partially
bare and showing a great hollow under the foundations
of the lighthouse.
"That does not seem over safe," said Job; "but Bill
tells me, though the sea sometimes washes right over
the top of the lantern, and the whole thing rocks and
trembles, that you are as safe here as on board the
Swiftsure up the Tamar. But there he is coming to
give us a line to make the boat fast.
"Hallo, Bill! how are you?"
"What! is that you, Job, my hearty? Welcome!
And who are the lads ?"
"Why, they're my youngsters. Here's Jack Hooper
-you remember his father as boatswain of the Volage;
and Tom Batten-his father's boatswain of the Tyne;
and the other two lads are their schoolmates. And
to-day being a holiday, we have all come out for a sail;
and seeing it was smooth water, we thought we'd give
you a hail."
"Right; come along, only some one must stop in the
boat, or she may get a heave from the swell and be
smashed to pieces in a moment."
"I'll stop. Let the youngsters see the lighthouse.
We should be getting back soon. Where's my pipe
and baccy?-Jack, look in my monkey-jacket for them.
Not there; why, I never put them there, I know.
"What is it? Why, you young rascal, what's that?"
he asked, as I gave him a new pipe and a bag full of
tobacco. "Where did you get that ?"

EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE.
"Oh, I've been saving with Tom here to get this for
you; but we shouldn't have been able to do it if the
Plymouth Lass hadn't been in last week, and we got
some tobacco from Captain Lorton."
"Thank you, my lads. Now look smart and have a
run round the lighthouse, for we must leave soon if we
are to be back before dark."
We four boys were soon in the lighthouse, and
looking with wondering eyes at all the various fit-
tings and contrivances for economizing space."
First there was the room where coal and stores were
kept; and then another with the oil-tanks; and above
that again the keepers' living-rooms, with tiny win-
dows of thick glass, and everything scrupulously neat
and clean,-every bit of metal-work polished as bright
as possible, and the wood of tables and stools scrubbed
to a snowy whiteness. But our great delight was
when, after passing through the lamp and cleaning
rooms, we came out on the gallery round the bottom
of the lantern.
Here we could see away up and down Channel, and
amused ourselves by picking out the different points on
the shore that we could make out or rather thought
we could, for Maker Church was the only landmark
we agreed upon.
Bill Cundy then took us into the lantern itself,
with all its wonderful reflectors and glasses. We
would fain have lingered here for some time, and, if
allowed, have touched and examined all; but Cundy,

"POOR LAD!"
who kept a careful look-out, hurried us away, saying
the breeze was rising, and it would not be safe for Job
to remain alongside any longer.
We ran down through the different compartments of
the tower and soon found ourselves again in the boat,
and with a hearty farewell from Bill Cundy, we
shoved off and laid the boat's head for Plymouth
Sound.
As soon as we were fairly on our way we asked Job
to go on with his yarns, which he was nothing loath to
do, and continued to amuse and interest us till we were
close to the breakwater.
"Now, my boys, here we are coming into the Sound.
No more yarning; we must look where we are going.
What's that? There's a gun from the flag-ship and
the blue-peter hoisted. The Channel squadron is go-
ing to sail; there's a sight for you."
Unfortunately we could not remain to see the ships
leave, as Job Motram had to be on board the Swiftsure.
by sunset, and the afternoon was already far gone; so
we ran in across the Devil's Bridge, through Barnpool,
and up Hamoaze, till we landed again at Torpoint.
Here we found Mrs. Wotton, who, when she saw me,
threw her arms round my neck and began kissing me
and crying, and saying, "Poor lad! poor lad!"
I was at a loss to understand what this might mean,
and felt it rather beneath my manhood to be thus em-
braced in public, when she said, "Oh, your mother!
your mother!"

TOM'S CONSOLATION.
"What is the matter with my mother?" I asked.
"She's ill, and asking for you. The doctor's there,
and Mrs. Batten and Mrs. Lorton. Come, my poor
boy."
Hearing my mother was ill, I did not wait for an-
other word, but rushed off as fast as my legs would
carry me towards our cottage, my heart beating as if
it would burst my body, and tears streaming from my
eyes.
I was soon perforce obliged to moderate my speed,
and heard dear Tom running after me, saying, " Cheer
up, Jack; maybe your mother'll soon be better. You
know there's Thomas Sawyer and Samuel Datchet
both had the doctor in to them last winter, and both
are well now."
This somewhat comforted me; though, if I had re-
flected, perhaps the comfort would not have been great,
as Thomas Sawyer had broken his leg, and the doctor
had docked him of it below the knee, so that he
now stumped about on a timber toe; whilst Samuel
Datchet had indulged so much in hollands and rum
that he had seen visions of all kinds of horrible things,
and had been placed under keeping till he returned to
his senses.
Arriving close to the cottage, I met our worthy
parson, who had been to read and pray with my
mother, and who said, " Jack, my boy, you must act
like a man. Your mother has been very ill, and the
only chance that she has of recovery is perfect quiet.


## p. 30 (#32) ##############################################

A SAD SIGHT.
Now, dry your tears and go in to her; I will be there
again in five minutes."
In a moment I was in my mother's room. She was
lying on her bed, almost as white as the counterpane
and dimity curtains, and there was a sort of hushed
feeling of stillness in the room. The casement was
half open, and a branch of roses hung in, giving a scent
to the air. By my mother's bed were Mrs. Batten and
the doctor, all the other women who had come to her
assistance having been peremptorily dismissed by the
peppery but warm-hearted medico.
"Now, lad," said the doctor, "you may kiss your
mother, but you mustn't make her talk. I will go and
see some other patients, and be back in a couple of
hours.—Mrs. Batten, you're a sensible woman; don't
let these two talk, and give Mrs. Hooper ten drops out
of this bottle, in water, every half-hour," and so saying,
he bustled off.
My mother was so wan and weak she scarcely seemed
like the mother I had left, as bright and happy as I
had ever seen her since my father's death, when I
started to go for our trip with Job Motram.
She smiled at me, and made me lay my head on the
pillow beside hers, and then kissed me as if she would
put her whole soul into the kiss.
The clergyman came in and said, "Now, Mrs. Batten,
you must not allow this, it is very bad for our patient;
and, my dear Mrs. Hooper, remember you must be
cheerful and get well for the sake of this boy."

MY MOTHER'S ILLNESS.
"Here, Jack, you've seen your mother; let her be
quiet now and try to sleep, Dr. Jones says that will
be the best thing for her. Come with me into the
other room."
When we got into the outer room the clergyman,
Mr. Polgarth, told me that he had been sent for about
two o'clock by Mrs. Batten, who, coming over to my
mother's cottage, as was her constant custom, found
her in a fainting state on the floor, and in falling she
had cut her head severely. On the arrival of Mr. Pol-
garth and Dr. Jones, she had been placed on her bed,
and was beginning to recover consciousness; and after
examination Dr. Jones was able to find out that her
seizure had been caused by disease of the heart of long
standing. She might recover for a time, but could not
be expected to live long, whilst if any fresh attack
came on she must be carried off at once.
The good parson then knelt down and read to me
some of the prayers from the "Visitation of the Sick,"
and explained how life and death are both in God's
hands,-how he giveth and how he taketh away.
Mrs. Batten came out soon after with the good news
that my mother was sleeping peacefully.
When Dr. Jones came back, he said he would wait
till she awoke; and I, being very tired by my long
day of boating, and feeling heavy and weary from
grief, allowed Mrs. Batten to make a place where I
could lie on the floor near my mother's bed, where,
with a promise from her that I should be awoke the

LAST WORDS.
moment my mother moved or spoke, I lay down and
was soon fast asleep.
About midnight I was awoke and heard mother
asking for me.
"Here I am, darling mother."
"Come here, my dear Jack, and let me kiss you and
bless you. I shall not live to the morning, for I feel I
am going to have another attack, and that, I know,
will kill me."
"O mother, mother! don't say so," sobbed I.
"Be brave, my boy; I want you to promise me al-
ways to be true to yourself and true to your God, and
be a good Christian. I know you will go to sea now;
and I hope it will be in the navy. Your father's
papers and certificates your Uncle Jonas has got at
Falmouth, and he has my little money; and this cot-
tage may be sold, so that whatever happens, my darling
boy, there will be something to keep you from want."
"My darling mother, I will do all you wish."
"Now, my boy, get my Bible and read me the Ser-
mon on the Mount."
I did this, though my eyes were so blinded with tears
I could scarcely distinguish the words; and as I was
finishing, my mother gave a gasp, sprang half up in
the bed, and fell back.
All was over, and I was doubly an orphan. I could
hardly realize that my mother was dead—that I was
never to hear her voice again, and that she in whom
I had ever found a sympathizing confidante in my

KIND FRIENDS.
33
boyish joys and sorrows was never more to lend her
ear to my stories of school and play. I threw myself
on the body and kissed it passionately, weeping bitterly,
till kind Mrs. Batten drew me away, and then, under
the torpor that arises from great grief, I fell into a
heavy slumber.
It was not till late the next morning that I awoke,
and then all seemed so hushed and still. As I looked
round I remembered my loss, and getting up, hurried
into the room where my dear mother's body lay.
Kind and reverend hands had arranged the corpse,
and the bed was spread over with roses from the bush
which covered our cottage walls. As I came into the
room, Mrs. Batten and Tom went out, Tom giving me
a grip of the hand as he left which more than any
words could have done told me how he felt for me.
I kissed my mother's brow, now so cold that it sent
a chill through all my body, and then sinking on my
knees by the bedside, poured out my heart in prayer
that I might be able to follow her last advice.
Some time passed while I was in the room by myself,
and then I heard Mr. Polgarth's voice calling for me.
I went out to him, and he in well-chosen words did his
best to comfort me and encourage me. He was not
only kind in words but also in deed, for he wished me
to go up to his tiny vicarage and remain there until
my Uncle Jonas should come from Falmouth. But
Mrs. Batten would not hear of this, and said that her
house was the place to shelter me.

UNCLE JONAS.
By kind persuasion I was drawn away from our
cottage and taken to Mrs. Batten's, where I was cared
for by Tom and his little sister Annie, a sweet little
girl of ten, who kissed me and said, " Dear Jack, your
mother's an angel now; and when we are angels we
shall see her in such a lovely place—finer than any of
the gardens here, finer and bigger than Mount Edg-
cumbe itself."
Her artless talk and Tom's rougher sympathy, which
evinced itself in trying to force upon me all his most
treasured possessions, had their effect, and after a time
I felt a sort of relief from my violent grief.
The next two days passed quickly away, and on the
evening of the second my Uncle Jonas (who was my
mother's half-brother) arrived from Falmouth. He
was very different from his sister, — a big, burly,
blustering man.
On the morning of the funeral I was taken to have
my last look of my mother, as she lay, looking calm
and peaceful, in her coffin, before the lid was screwed
down. The idea that I should never look on that kind
face again or ever hear her loved voice in this world
was too much for me, and I burst into a paroxysm of
tears and grief, and would not leave her until my uncle
came and took me away by main force.
At the funeral, notwithstanding my grief, I could
not help feeling a certain sense of importance from my
holding the position of chief mourner, and being in the
possession of an entire new suit of black clothes, which

35
in some manner alleviated my grief and enabled me to
bebave with becoming decorum; though, when the
earth was dropped on the coffin and Mr. Polgarth said,
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust," my tears
burst out again and would not be controlled,-and
indeed Mrs. Batten and the other neighbours who were
present, as well as Tom and his sister, joined; and old
Job Motram, who, with five other pensioners who had
been shipmates of my father, had carried the coffin to
the grave, could be heard making sounds not altogether
compatible with their age and manhood.
When the funeral was over we went back to the
cottage, where my uncle assumed charge of everything.
Will there was none, but all knew that my mother
trusted him in everything, and no one made any objec-
tion. He said that he had already been long enough
away from his business, and must go back again by
that afternoon's coach through Saltash, and that I and
my clothes were to be sent by the next day's carrier,
and that he would make arrangements about the
cottage, and in the meantime he would be much
obliged if Mrs. Batten would take charge of the key. -
When he had gone, Tom, who was fearless and out-
spoken, said he was not much of an uncle, and advised
me to leave him as soon as possible and join the navy,
as otherwise he would turn me into a counter-jumper,
or some other animal of the sort.
His mother interfered to stop him, and said Mr.
Snaresby (such being my uncle's name) was no doubt a

PARTING GIFTS.
very good man. "Now, Jack, remember," she said,
"you are to obey your uncle, and by doing that you
will please your mother."
I also received much homely and kind counsel from
Mr. Polgarth, who gave me a prayer-book, and exhorted
me always to hold to that and my mother's Bible as
my guide in life.
Next morning my scanty belongings were packed in
a deal box; and Mrs. Batten, who had seen my prayer-
book, made me a bag so that I could keep it always,
and she advised me to take care of it always in words
that had the same meaning, if they were expressed in
a more homely way than those of Mr. Polgarth.
When the time of parting drew near, all my friends
assembled to bid me good-bye and God-speed.
My old master gave me an epitome of navigation, in
which he had written my name in his best copperplate
handwriting ; Job Motram brought me a sailor's ditty-
bag, fitted with needles and all necessaries for sewing;
Tom, who must have drawn upon his mother for the
funds, for he was ever penniless, gave me a knife,
which held, besides a big and small blade, a saw, a
gimlet, and other wonderful contrivances, the like of
which I had never before seen; Joey and Willie had
clubbed together, and, no doubt under their mothers'
advice and with their assistance, had bought me a
pilot-jacket; whilst dear little Annie brought me a pin-
cushion, with the assurance that she had worked it all
herself.

SAM PODDER- PITY-ARRIVE AT FALMOUTH-MY WELCOME-SLEEPING QUAR-

PUNISHMENT.
TIME and tide wait for no man, and even the most
patient of carriers must remember his horse and cus-
tomers; so my farewells were cut short, and I had to
drag myself from the arms and embraces of my friends,
and was put in the cart of Sam Podder for conveyance
to Falmouth.
He smacked his whip, and his horse, which seemed to
want no other signal, started off at once at a curiously
slow trot, which pace it maintained over hill and dale,
seeming exactly to know when to stop.
Mr. Podder, whom I regarded as a very important
personage, had to call at many villages and farmhouses,
and had to tell all the news of the day to the busy
good-wife, or the master himself if he chanced to be
in the way: the news mostly was the price of butter
and cheese at Plymouth and Falmouth, how much a
score of hogs might fetch, or what the fishing-boats
were doing

AT FALMOUTH.
I was kindly treated at the various farmhouses,
getting a draught of milk at one, and a crust of bread
and cheese and a cup of cider at another, and so on,
and warm pity from all the inhabitants when they
heard that I was an orphan. And when we drew nearer
to Falmouth I was also pitied for having to live with
Jonas Snaresby, who, as one warm-hearted dame said,
would never suffer by what he gave away; and she,
as she kissed me on leaving her door, forced a huge
slice of cake into my hand as she remarked she'd war-
rant that it would be little supper I'd get that night if
we arrived after seven o'clock; and also told me that
her son, Tony Truscott, was a Falmouth pilot, and lived
down by the waterside, and that if ever I wanted help
I could go to him for advice and assistance.
At half - past nine we drew up in front of Mr.
Snaresby's low-browed shop, which was almost closed,
only a tallow candle shedding a faint light on a portion
where a couple of apprentices were busy packing up
an order that was to go on board an East Indiaman
that was going to sail the following' morning. Inside,
at the far end of the shop, a half-open door let out a
brighter gleam of light, and certain savoury smells
gave promise that Dame Truscott's forebodings about
supper might not prove true.
" Is Mr. Snaresby inside ? I've brought his nephew
and box," said honest Podder.
An answer was heard from the parlour to the effect
that I was to be put down with my box and wait

A COLD RECEPTION.

in the shop until Mr. Snaresby could come and see
me.
"Good-bye, Jack," said Podder. "Some day you'll
be wanting a trip to Plymouth, in order to put on a
blue shirt; and remember that while Sam Podder is
alive you are always welcome to a lift. Good-bye, and
God bless you, my lad;" and so he left me standing
in the middle of the shop with my box by my side.
I was rather puzzled by the way in which I found
myself left, and waited for a few minutes expecting
that my uncle or his wife would come to see after me;
and then mustering up courage, I walked up to the two
apprentices and asked where my uncle was.
" His uncle !" sneered the elder of the two, a lubberly
lout, sixteen years of age, Noah Clubbins by name;
s you won't find no uncle here. Mr. Snaresby told us
that out of charity he was going to give you shelter ;
but you ain't no nephew of his, nor of the mistress
neither, for that matter. You will have to work here
in the shop under us gentlemen. Harry Tregear here
has to sweep up now, but that will be your business."
Harry Tregear, a smiling boy, said, "Oh, I daresay
we can manage that."
Here we were interrupted by the advent of Mrs.
Snaresby, a tall, raw-boned woman with high cheek-
bones and a prominent nose, who entered the shop and
commenced scolding Noah and Harry for neglecting
their work, whilst to me she administered a box on
the ear for hindering them; and then drawing me into

SLEEPING QUARTERS.
the inner room by the collar said, " Come here, you
brat, and let's have a look at you. There, Priscilla"
(this was my mother's name) " was never much, and
you're a poor thread paper of a chap; I doubt if you'll
pay for your keep."
My uncle, who was sitting by the table with a
glass of rum and water at his elbow, interposed with,
"Never mind now, Mrs. Snaresby ; I'll find something
for him to do in the morning. You had better send
him to bed now."
"Very well. Here, you brat, get your box and fol-
low me."
I meekly followed my mistress—for so I must call
her-into the shop, and there shouldered my box and
followed her through a long passage out into and
across a yard lumbered with empty casks and cases,
and up an outside staircase into a species of loft, where
four boys were already sleeping, and where there were
two vacant truckle-beds. "Here I'll put another bed
for you to-morrow. You must make it out with Tre-
gear to-night; that's his bed," said the mistress, and
turning away she left me in the dark.
I was too strange and amazed to know what to do,
and so sat down on my box and indulged in a hearty
cry. After about half an hour I heard steps and
voices, and recognized Noah Clubbins' and Harry
Tregear's voices as they entered the loft.
"What's this?" said the former, as he kicked
against my box and nearly fell over me. "Why,

A FIGHT.
crying in our bedroom ! the brat, as the mistress calls
him, must be taught that crying is not allowed
here.
"Now then, blubberchops," said he to me as he
struck a light, "get up," and at the same time he
dealt me a hearty kick. His heavy boot wounded me
and brought blood; but though severely hurt I sprang
to my feet, and, remembering how Job had taught dear
Tom Batten and myself to spar, threw myself into a
fighting attitude, and hit Noah a blow right between
the eyes.
"Tregear, come and help me; the young whelp has
hit me. I'll thrash you if you don't come."
"Do your own dirty work; let Hooper have a
thrashing if you can give it him. He's not a bad
sort; and I know the old one intends to make it hot
for him. I heard her talking to Jonas about him."
The noise woke up the other occupants of the room ;
and though they were all evidently averse to Master
Noah, still there seemed to be a feeling that a new-
comer, and he one of the smallest boys in the room,
should not challenge the bully of the loft.
"I'll soon polish him off," said Noah, and making a
rush tried to grapple with me; but I was too quick
for him, and stepping to one side hit him a severe
blow on the side of the head. He turned again, and
this time was more successful, and managed to get
hold of me. For some time we wrestled without any
advantage coming to either, when at last I tripped over
POLU,

my box, and we both came down with a heavy crash
to the floor.
Noah now tried to get hold of my collar and bang
my head on the ground; and it would have fared
badly with me if Harry Tregear had not interfered
and insisted on fair-play, the others standing neutral
or siding with Noah, as they considered him to be
the winner.
Harry dragged Noah off me, and would have had to
encounter his wrath if I had not sprung to my feet
and dared my antagonist to come on again.
We had continued struggling for some time, and I
was beginning to get the better of my opponent, when
steps were heard approaching; and there was a general
rush into bed, and only Noah, Harry Tregear, and
myself were left to meet the wrath of Mr. and Mrs.
Snaresby.
My uncle said, "Here, what's this ?-Noah, I can
trust you. What is all this noise and disturbance
about? Tell me at once, that I may punish the of-
fenders."
Noah answered, " Please, master, I was coming to
bed after making up the order which is to go on board
the Hereward to-morrow morning first thing, and
found Hooper here, who was complaining of you and
the mistress, and when I told him to be quiet he
abused me and struck me; and then he and Tregear
set on me and beat me, and Tregear helped him, or he
would not have prevailed against me."


## p. 43 (#45) ##############################################

IN THE LOFT.
43
I burst out with, " It's a shame; it's not true."
"None of your language, sir. I can trust Noah
Clubbins as a truthful lad.—Now, Tregear, what have
you to say? Your father shall know of your conduct."
"Why, sir, what Noah says is not true. Hooper
was sitting on his box when Noah kicked him."
"Noah, is that true?"
"No, sir, it's all false. He said the mistress was an
old hag, and I spoke to him for abusing so kind and
good a mistress."
Here Mrs. Snaresby made a pounce on me, and seiz-
ing me by the hair cuffed me soundly. Harry Tregear
also came in for some discipline from her husband.
Evidently Noah Clubbins was a sneak, and accustomed
to curry favour by tale-bearing.
"No bed for you to-night, you brat," said my aunt
to me as she drove me up a ladder into a kind of upper
loft, where there were some boxes and sacks, and into
which she locked me.
There was no space for me to stand upright in this
den, which was close under the tiles; and here, sore
and bruised and suffering sadly from the kick from
Noah's heavy boot, which had nearly broken my side
in, I was left to my own reflections.
Next morning I heard the apprentices called up, and
expected to be released from my prison; but it was
not till noon that any one visited me, and then Harry
Tregear came up with a hunch of bread and cheese
which he had secured for me, and which he managed

SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
to pass in through a hole which had been contrived
for a similar purpose by previous occupants of the den
where I was confined.
He told me that my box had been opened by my
uncle and aunt, and all my little belongings ransacked,
and some things thrown away, but that he had saved
them for me.
He said his father was on board a coastguard cutter,
and in some way was in Jonas Snaresby's power, and
that he in consequence suffered much from the way in
which he was treated; but he had never seen such un-
provoked ill-usage as had greeted me the night before,
and he had little doubt that Noah had been instigated
to bully me, as he was tale-bearer-in-chief to the mis-
tress, and her great pet, if she could be said to indulge
in such weakness towards any one.
"Now I must be going," he said. "Eat that quick,
for you are to be had downstairs after our dinner at
one to be whipped before us all for attacking the good
boy Noah. Good-bye."
I was ravenously hungry, and ate the bread and
cheese, but was afterwards almost choked by thirst.
I could not but feel how different was my position
from what it had been only a short week before; but
I thanked God that I had found a friend in Harry
Tregear, which seemed to be the only ray of light in
my fate.
I heard the church clocks striking one, and then the
step of my aunt coming up to the loft. The key was

SUMMARY PUNISHMENT.

turned, and I was ordered to come down and receive
the punishment due to my misdeeds.
I followed her meekly enough, feeling sore and un-
tidy, my new black suit being all torn from my struggle
with Noah, and covered with dirt and dust from the
place where I had had to pass so many weary hours.
After we crossed the yard we entered the passage
which led to the shop, but instead of following it for
its full length we turned into a large, bare room, with
a table and some stools in it, where my uncle and all
his servants and apprentices, except those actually
necessary to attend to the shop, were assembled.
My uncle seemed to look very angry when he saw
me. He placed me in an open space in front of them
all, and said, —
"You all see this boy. For years I have supported
his mother and him ; and now when his mother dies I
bring him here out of charity, instead of letting him
go to the workhouse, and the first night he comes here
he behaves badly, and strikes a good boy like Noah.
I am determined not to allow such conduct. I am sorry
to say his evil example has already spread, and Harry
Tregear has been induced to steal food for him."
My uncle then and there gave me a good set flog-
ging, which made me think my previous state of sore-
ness one of bliss and comfort, and then gave one to
Harry for having brought me food; and I was then
sent back to my place of confinement, where I was
left without a visitor till the following morning.

FEVER-RUN WILD-NEWS OF THE SHOP-RECALLED TO WORK-FRIENDLY IN-
TEKFERENCE-JOB'S ADVICE-PATCHING THE BOAT-OUR SAILS-PUT TO SEA. --
WHEN the next morning arrived, Noah Clubbins came
to release me and order me down into the shop. He
found me lying on my back in a high fever, and at
times raving of Job Motram and Tom Batten, fancy-
ing myself again on some boating cruise with them, and
at others calling for my mother.
He was so frightened that he beat a hasty retreat
and called for my aunt, who came up and ordered me
to be taken down into the sleeping loft below, where I
was laid on one of the truckle-beds. Of this I was
unconscious, and it was only when, some four days
after, I recovered my senses that I heard from Harry
Tregear what had happened. .
When I began to get better, it was found that I had
been so weakened by my illness that I was of little
use in the shop, and I was employed on errands; but
the fever had so weakened my memory that I made
many sad mistakes, and for some time I was allowed

RUNNING WILD.
47
Here, among the boatmen, pilots, and fishermen, I was
kindly treated, for stories of my having been badly
used had got abroad, and some of the men had known
my father; and often I used to spend whole days, and
sometimes even nights, without going back to the shop.
My delight, as before, was in boating, and whenever I
got a chance I was afloat; and my strength of body
and mind, under the influence of fresh air and exercise,
began to improve rapidly.
Harry Tregear, whenever he could escape for a mo-
ment, used to come and look me up with news of the
shop and my uncle and aunt, and reported how Noah
Clubbins was becoming more of a sneak and bully,
and still more trusted by his master and mistress than
ever.
Fortunately, I had been relegated to the kennel
under the roof for a sleeping-place, and had managed
a fastening to the door, so that I was unmolested at
night, and could keep safely my Bible, prayer-book,
Tom's knife, and old Job's ditty-bag, in which latter
was little Annie's pin-cushion. All these had been
recovered for me by Harry Tregear, aided by the maid
of Mrs. Snaresby, who had found where her mistress
had put them.
Truscott the pilot I had often met, and he had fully
borne out what his mother had promised for him; and
when the cutter to which he belonged was in port, I
had many a hearty meal on board of her.
At the same time that I was running wild among

the boats, I often watched the ship and boat builders,
and picked up a knowledge.of their work which stood
me in good stead in my after-life.
These halcyon days, however, were fated not to con-
tinue; for it came round to my aunt's ears that I was
considered a smart boy, and she therefore thought that
I might be made of use in her husband's business; and
she one morning made a raid on my den under the
roof, and ordered me to come down to the shop and
share in its labours.
Here I was made to sweep, run errands, carry par-
cels, and lift goods about for the packers when any
orders came in, and in this work made the acquaint-
ance of some of the stewards of the packet-brigs which
used to carry the mails to South America and the West
Indies, and sailed from Falmouth. .
Carrying down the goods purchased by them was
perhaps the most enjoyable of all my duties, as it
brought me among my friends of the waterside, and
enabled me sometimes to have the delight of having a
sail out to the brigs in a shore-boat.
Otherwise, my lot was a dreary one, as I had to act
as loblolly-boy to all the apprentices and shopmen, and
wait on them at their meals; and after they had done,
to content myself with such scraps as they might leave,
whilst chastisement for my supposed misdeeds and
neglects was constant.
One day I saw the Plymouth Lass lying at anchor
in the harbour, and determined to tell Captain Lorton

of my troubles. Unfortunately for me, he was obliged
to sail without being able to come and see my uncle,
and all the immediate result of my attempt at obtain-
ing mediation on my behalf was the receipt of a most
extraordinarily severe thrashing from my uncle for ne-
glecting my work.
Some days after, Job Motram made his appearance,
having walked from Plymouth to interfere, in order to
obtain better treatment for me; but my uncle said he
was my natural guardian, and that he would allow no
interference. Job was not allowed to speak to me in
the shop or house; but by waiting about, he managed
to meet me outside and tell me all the news.
Tom Batten had shipped on board of the Arethusa,
which ship had sailed for the Mediterranean; Joey and
Willie were still at school; and Annie was a brave
little lass, who sent kisses and messages to her dear
brother Jack.
"Now, Jack, my son, I don't want to tell you to cut
and run ; but from what I can hear, if ever a lad had a
right to go, you are the one. You say your mother
told you to obey your uncle. That may be so; but she
didn't know that he'd ill-use you. Mind, I know the
cottage was your mother's, and she had some money in
your uncle's hands, so his saying that she owed him
money and that the cottage is his, as he did just now
to me, is not true; but I don't know how we can prove
it. But he is a grasping land-shark, if ever there was
one; and his wife is as bad as he, if not worse. The

only comfort I see for you is that lad Tregear. He
seems honest; but then, he is nearly as badly treated
as you are. Mind, boy, if you do run, I'll hide you in
the Swiftsure, and all the uncles and aunts in Fal-
mouth will never find you out."
Soon after this poor Harry Tregear lost his father,
who was drowned in attempting to save the crew of an
Austrian brig which was wrecked on the Manacles, a
dangerous reef a few miles outside Falmouth; and his
treatment became even worse than it was before.
He and I now laid our heads together, and at last we
determined on running away.
In one corner of a boat-building yard there was an
old boat which had been given up as useless by her
owner, and which Harry and I had occasionally launched
and paddled about, but which had now become too leaky
even for us. This we now begged for, and it was given
us as our own without any difficulty. We then asked
for nails, bits of copper, tin, rope, and all sorts of odds
and ends, and by degrees we managed to patch the
old craft up until we made her water-tight and fairly
sea-worthy; and we were as proud the day we got her
launched as if we had built the finest ship that ever
floated.
Our next difficulty was masts and sails; and when
they were procured, we intended to sail round to Ply-
mouth and remind Job of his promise of a hiding-place.
Every morning before my uncle and aunt were stir-
ring we were down on the beach looking over all the

drift-wood that came to shore to try to find pieces
suitable for our purpose; and by degrees we got to-
gether a bowsprit and main and mizzen masts and two
good yards; but for oars we were obliged to be content
with pieces of board nailed on to the end of stout sticks.
Still, they would answer their purpose.
As for sails, at first that was more difficult. We
looked over our scanty wardrobes to see if there were
anything out of which we could make them, but could
not, as I had only two shirts, and one was very ragged;
and Harry was worse off than I, for though he also
boasted of two, they were both so ragged as to be more
articles of faith than of clothing.
At last fortune favoured us, for one day we had to
take a large quantity of goods on board a packet-brig
that was just about to sail for Rio, and in the boat were
a quantity of biscuit-bags belonging to the steward.
Coming alongside, we found the lieutenant-command-
ing in a regular fume at losing a fair wind; and the
moment we touched the side he tripped his anchor and
stood out. We passed the things up as quickly as we
could, but this bundle was the last and was forgotten,
and we let go the tow-rope before remembering it; and
on our holding it up, the steward hailed us to say we
could keep it.
"Sails, Harry, my boy," I said.
"Right, Jack; we'll get to work to-night about
them."
Our bread-bag suit was soon made, and now all we

required was some provisions for our cruise. Empty
bottles we could have for the picking up, and we soon
mai put enough on board filled with fresh water to last us
a week and act as ballast. But food was more diffi-
cult, as we were hearty, growing lads, and our appetites
were too keen to enable us to save anything from our
meals.
At last we made bold to lay our case before Tony
Truscott, who when he heard it said he would pro-
vision us, though, if we wanted to run away to sea, we
could do it in his cutter; and he would see that some
one of his friends among the skippers of the outward-
bound ships would take us on board and look after us.
We were not wise enough to take his advice, and
preferred our own cranky old craft to any other; and
one dark night in the month of April, nearly two years
after my mother's death, Harry and I put to sea in the
Pelican, as we had named our craft after Drake's
famous ship, having relieved our minds and consciences
by giving to Master Noah Clubbins a repayment, as
far as we were able, of the many thrashings with which
we had been graced owing to his insidious and tale-
bearing tongue; and when we had tired our arms in
the meritorious work, we tied him up hand and foot,
and put him into my den under the roof.

PETER STEINDRUP-HIS FARM-THE RAVAGES OF LIONS.
THERE was a light south-westerly wind blowing, with
a nice soft rain, which made it so dark that one could
scarcely see one's hand before one as we pulled out of
Falmouth Harbour and made sail towards the Eddy-
stone Lighthouse.
We had no covering, and only the clothes we stood
up in, and soon began to find it very cold; and at last,
in order to avoid getting numbed to death, we had to
take in our bread-bag sails and roll ourselves up in
them for the warmth they might afford, and let the
Pelican drift with the tide.
We had both for some nights been sleeping but
little, as we had been watching for a chance to escape,
and soon were sound asleep.
When we woke it was broad daylight, and the wind
had changed, it now blowing from the north-east; and
we were almost out of sight of land, having drifted
down Channel during the night.

ADRIFT.
We at once made sail and attempted to beat up, but
the breeze freshening our sails did not stand very well,
and we had to be constantly repairing them; and at
last we gave up the idea of getting to Plymouth, and
determined on letting the boat run and chance our
being picked up by an outward-bound ship.
Several passed us by, both running down Channel and
beating up homeward bound; but none took any notice
of our attempts to attract their attention, and we began
to be afraid, as the sea was getting up, that our crazy
craft would not stand the weather if it got much
worse.
About three in the afternoon, to add to our difficul-
ties, she sprang a leak, and one of us had to keep on
constantly baling; and we began to think that we
would have done better if we had accepted Tony Trus-
cott's offer instead of risking ourselves in the Pelican.
The leak we tried to stop with the means at our
disposal, and at first it seemed as if we were success-
ful; but it again broke out and got worse, so that one
could hardly keep the water down. We at last deter-
mined to sacrifice part of our sails, and both got down
in the bottom of the boat to try to stuff some of the
bread-bag, which we unravelled, into the place where
the water was coming in.
Whilst we were employed about this, we were sud-
denly disturbed by being nearly capsized by some
vessel passing so close as to bump against us. On
springing to our feet, we found that we had been nearly

run down by a large topsail schooner yacht, which
was rounding-to and shortening sail a little way to
leeward of us.
We instantly got out our makeshift oars and pulled
down to her, and were soon on board, and the Pelican
left to her fate. The owner, Mr. Penton, asked what
on earth we were doing so far at sea in such a crazy
craft.
We related our story as well as we could; and Mr.
Penton, who was a gentleman of about eight and
twenty, said he would be doing right if he took us
back to Falmouth, but that he would not beat back
there now, as he was outward bound and had a fair
wind, so that we could make ourselves useful on board
the Idalia, as his yacht was called, and told his skipper
to look out for some kit for us, and put one in each
watch.
The skipper took us forward and showed us the
forecastle, where there were a couple of spare bunks,
which we were told would be for us; and out of the
slop-chest gave us jerseys with the yacht's name,
Idalia, worked on the breast, red nightcaps, and blue
trousers, which were a welcome change to the clothes
that we had come away in, which were worn and
patched and wet through.
We found the crew of the yacht all hearty and
kindly sailors, there being twelve of them before the
mast, besides the skipper, two mates, and cook and
steward.

STUDYING NAVIGATION.
On our asking the reason of there being so big a
crew, we were told that Mr. Penton, who was a very
rich man, had lately lost his wife, to whom he had
only been married for a few months, and had made up
his mind to absent himself from the world for three
years, in the hope that by that time he might have
recovered from his grief. None of the men knew
where he intended to go ultimately, but their first
port was to be Madeira.
We soon shook down into our place among the crew,
and tried to do our best to make ourselves useful; and
were fortunate enough to please Mr. Penton, who said
he could quite believe that two decent lads like us
would not have run away from Falmouth unless we
had had very good reasons, and that as we were both
orphans, he did not see what we could do better than
take to the sea for our living.
One day whilst I was working on the quarter-deck
he began speaking to me about what I had learned at
school. And when I told him I had commenced to
learn navigation, he said he thought it was a pity that
I should not continue its study; and he made it after-
wards a point to give Harry and myself lessons every
day for two or three hours, and in a comparatively
short time I was able to do the ordinary rules of navi-
gation, and take the altitude of the sun sufficiently
well to navigate a ship.
We cruised about for some months, visiting the
West Indies and South American ports, and after

AT THE CAPE.
61
wards we ran over to the Cape of Good Hope. On our
arrival there the Idalia wanted a thorough overhaul and
refit, and Mr. Penton determined on leaving her to be
repaired, whilst he went on a shooting expedition with
some of the officers of the " fighting Ninety-second,"
which regiment was then in garrison at Cape Town.
Major Brownlow and Captain Smithson were two
old friends of Mr. Penton's, and they found no difficulty
in obtaining leave; and they were accompanied by
their soldier-servants, Bates and Stevens, who had been
with them ever since they had joined the service.
Mr. Penton, after some consideration, decided on
taking only Harry and myself from the yacht; whilst
he engaged a Dutch hunter, Jan van Neeldt, to act as
guide, and Hottentots for taking charge of his horses
and driving the waggons.
We had some little time to fit our waggons, of which
there were two for travelling in the veldt. Each wag-
gon was drawn by a "span," as it was called at the
Cape, of sixteen bullocks; and in order to prevent
difficulties from loss of animals, Mr. Penton bought a
spare span of sixteen more.
His two friends and their servants were mounted on
horses which had been broken in to shooting, and
their servants also each led a spare horse ; whilst Mr.
Penton bought four horses, on two of which he mounted
Harry and myself. He also took four mules for carry-
ing water or stores, in case he might wish to leave the
waggons for a time.


## p. 62 (#64) ##############################################

CAPE WAGGONS.
I may as well describe these waggons, which for
some time were to be our homes.
They were very large, being nearly sixteen feet long
by eight wide, and very solidly built. The wheels
were very high and strong; and great grease-boxes
were fitted over the axle-trees, which had always to
be kept supplied with tar and tallow to prevent fric-
tion; and the pole, or " disselboom," as it was called,
was as big and strong as the mast of a ten-ton boat.
The waggons were covered with a high canvas tilt,
which served as a protection against sun and rain;
and on either side was a canvas sheet, which, when we
halted, could be pegged out to the ground, so as to
afford extra shelter from rain, or spread out as an
awning against the rays of the sun.
Inside, the bottoms of the waggons were fitted with
boxes and lockers, in which all our provisions and
ammunition were stowed, and some of which were
water-tight, so as to contain a stock of water when
passing any waterless tracts. These boxes and lockers
were so arranged as to form a level surface, on which
beds and blankets could be spread; whilst to the sides
of the tilts there were fitted beckets, in which the
rifles and guns of the party were hung.
In addition to provisions, wines, and ammunition,
we had to lay in a stock of stores of all kinds, and
carpenter's and blacksmith's tools for repairing any
possible damage to the waggons, and a grindstone for
sharpening the axes which we would require for

cutting trees to make a laager in places where there
was any danger, or to repair a broken axle or a dissel-
boom. There was also a store of rope and hide thongs,
for the harness of the bullocks, and two tents, besides
camp-chairs, tables, and cooking traps.
To stow all away properly took much time, and
Harry and I, though assisted by Bates and Stevens,
found a great difficulty in finding a place for every-
thing. Iron pots and casks of tallow and tar we hung
underneath the axle-trees; and on the driving-seat we
had a big tarpaulin, which would answer for many
purposes, and when spread over the disselboom would
act as a shelter for our Hottentot drivers and servants
in bad weather.
In all we mustered a strong party--Mr. Penton and
his two friends, their servants, Harry and myself, Jan
van Neeldt, and eight Hottentot and Kafir drivers
and servants, ten horses, forty-eight bullocks, and four
mules, and half-a-dozen large dogs, which were of a
mongrel sort of breed, but which Jan said would be
useful in attacking a lion or other dangerous game, as
they had been broken by their previous owners to divert
the attention of the big game from the huntsman.
All being prepared, we set out, Mr. Penton intend-
ing, as it came out when we were starting, to go on,
after his friends' leave was up, and perhaps make the
sea-coast at the mouth of the Orange River, and that
he would send his final orders back to his yacht when
they left him.

NEW EXPERIENCES.
Our first week's march out of Cape Town had little
to cause excitement. We passed through the farms of
several settlers, and were most hospitably received by
all of them, Jan van Neeldt prevailing upon those of
Dutch extraction to be more friendly than they usu-
ally were to Englishmen.
Harry and myself at first found ourselves very much
adrift on horseback, and lost much of our skin and had
many falls; but as we were determined to make the
best of it, we rapidly got into the way of managing
our steeds; and as Mr. Penton made us take charge of
our own horses altogether, we soon knew them, and
mine, which I named Pelican, after our old boat, began
to follow me like a dog, and come to my voice or
whistle. Bates and Stevens could not understand how
I managed this; but then they always made the Hot-
tentots groom their horses and feed them.
Both Bates and Stevens, however, were very favourable
specimens of the British soldier. They had enlisted when
their masters joined the army, being sons of the game-
keeper and the coachman respectively of the fathers of
the major and captain, who were country squires in one
of the midland counties; and they had during all their
period of service continued as servants of their masters
and naturally enjoyed much of their confidence and
many privileges. They were thoroughly acquainted
with all relating to guns, horses, and dogs, and imparted
to Harry and me much useful knowledge on these
subjects.

A PATRIARCHAL BOER.
65
After a week's travelling of about thirty miles a day
we arrived at a large Dutch settler's farm, who lived
in a patriarchal manner surrounded by his children
and grandchildren, who assisted him in cultivation
and looking after his flocks and herds, in which they
were aided by a number of Hottentots and Kafirs.
Their farm was situated on the southern slope of
the Zwarte Berg, which we had to cross over to reach
the great Karroo plains, where our first hunting was
to commence, and which was as far as their leave
would permit Major Brownlow and Captain Smithson
to go.
The old Boer, Peter Steindrup, was a very fine speci-
men of the old Dutch settler, and his numerous sons
and grandsons, besides being herdsmen and agricul-
turists, were also all devoted to hunting, and constantly
made long expeditions to the north in search of skins,
ivory, and ostrich feathers.
Two of the sons were now away on a hunting and
trading journey; but there were six other sons and
their wives, as well as those of the absent ones, and all
had families. There were only two daughters of the
old man, and they were married, and their husbands
had settled down with the rest of the family.
It may easily be imagined that all these people re-
quired a good many buildings to live in, which, with
the large barns and warehouses, formed a considerable
village, all of which was surrounded by a strong en-
closure. Outside were the huts of their native re-

tainers and hangers-on, who numbered nearly two
hundred
Old Steindrup told us that he had settled there when
quite a young man, between forty and fifty years be-
fore, when the country was almost entirely in the
hands of the natives.
Inside the enclosure were a number of waggons, and
at night the horses and many of the cattle were driven
into it. Outside were other enclosures for the rest of
the cattle and sheep, his flocks of the latter amounting
to over three thousand, which had just been sheared,
and all hands were now busy in packing the wool for
transport to Cape Town.
The eldest son, Heindrich, gave us all quarters in his
house, and in the evening, after supper, began talking
about the earlier days of the settlement, when they
had had to trust to their guns and their own courage
for defence against the natives, who by no means
acquiesced quietly in the appropriation of their land
by the new-comers. Even now, he said, though they
were comparatively secure, they had to contend with
robberies of their flocks and herds by unsettled parties
of the natives and with the depredations of wild beasts.
Quite lately, indeed, they had lost several cattle from
the ravages of lions, and were thinking, as soon as the
wool was sent off, of organizing a hunt to get rid of
these unwelcome neighbours.
It did not require much persuasion on the part of
Mr. Penton and his friends to induce Heindrich and his

SUNDAY passed quietly as a day of rest, as Mr. Penton
always insisted on its being kept so; and on the Monday
morning we set out to search for the lions, which we
expected to find at a distance of about twenty miles.
Two Hottentot herdsmen had arrived during the
night, and reported that two cows had been carried off
on the previous morning from a place where they were
in charge of a herdsman, and that there would be no
difficulty in following up the spoor.
Besides our party, which mustered twelve, including
Jan and four of our native followers, there were
Heindrich and two of his brothers, Piet and Wilhelm,
who were accompanied by four natives, so that we
were a large party. The mules were loaded with a
tent and necessary furniture and provisions, and all
the party were mounted. Besides our dogs, we also
had a nondescript pack belonging to Haarlem, as Stein-
drup called his settlement.

PATIENT WAITING.
We did not get away before eight o'clock, and it was
past two before we arrived at the place where we were
to camp, where there were a few small huts, in which
the Hottentot herdsmen of the Boers lived. They had
an enclosure of cactus round them; but this was not
large enough for all our horses and the mules, so we
had to set to work to cut down bush, which here mostly
consisted of the mimosa, called by the Dutch" kameel-
dorn," from its being browsed on by the camelopards.
After about three hours' hard work, in which both our
clothes and skins had suffered from the thorns, we had
a good fence round a space where we could picket all
our animals comfortably.
Close by was a vley, or water-pool, and here the lions
were supposed often to come for water, and we there-
fore dug some pits, in which the sportsmen could watch
for their coming. In one of these Mr. Penton took his
post, and I accompanied him to act as his gun-bearer,
and Jan also came to tell him how to act; in another
were Major Brownlow and Captain Smithson and one
of their servants; whilst in another the three Boers
were stationed. .
After our evening meal we all repaired to our lurk-
ing-places and settled down for a patient wait. The
first few hours passed away without anything coming
near us; and if the others were to be judged by my
own feelings, they must have been intensely weary,
and would all have been glad to be back in their beds.
About half-past eleven the moon rose, and soon after

AN APPALLING SOUND.
we heard the unearthly yells and screams of hyenas,
and almost directly saw two of them coming to drink.
They remained near the banks of the pool for about
half an hour; and then, when they left, half a dozen
buffaloes came and lay down and wallowed in the
mud on its banks. They were soon joined by some
antelopes, and among them were some elands, which
sorely tempted my master, who was new to African
sport, to take a shot at them. But Jan restrained him,
telling him that the lions would soon come.
A constant succession of animals kept on visiting the
water; but there were no signs of the prey we were
waiting for until about two o'clock, when we detected
signs of uneasiness among some antelopes which had
only just arrived, and this was communicated to the
other animals that were near. Soon after we heard a
sound, which to me seemed most appalling, and which,
I thought, must surely be the roar of a lion, and
whispered to Jan to ask him if my surmise was true.
He nodded his head in token of assent, and making
signs to keep perfect silence, motioned to Mr. Penton
to get his rifle ready.
The first roar was repeated, and was answered by
others; and soon we had the pleasure and excitement
of seeing a magnificent lion walk slowly out from the
trees which stood some two hundred yards away from
the water, and majestically approach its brink. Follow-
ing him at a distance of about twenty yards were two
lionesses and four cubs.

SHOOTING LIONS.
75
By some curious magnetic feeling, all the hunters
restrained their hands and did not fire, but allowed the
old lion and his family to come to the water in peace.
When there, they commenced drinking leisurely; and
then the three old animals lay quietly down, whilst
the cubs gambolled about like kittens, and came jump-
ing on their mothers, though they did not venture on
any liberties with the old male, who once or twice,
when they came too near to him, hit them a buffet
with his paw, which sent them yelping away.
This exhibition went on some time, and was a sight
to behold for which frequenters of menageries and
zoological gardens would have been willing to pay
almost any amount. But at last the old lion got up and
gave the signal for departure, and also for his own
death: for as he rose to his feet the guns of the hunters
went off almost simultaneously, and when the smoke
cleared away somewhat we could see that the big lion
had fallen down almost dead; that one of the lionesses,
with one of her legs broken, was trying to get away;
and that the other was trying to induce one of the
cubs, which had been killed outright, to come away
with her. The wounded lioness and the three cubs
were soon out of sight in the jungle.
I gave Mr. Penton his second gun, and set to work
to recharge the one he had fired; and he, taking a
steady aim, fired again at the lion, and hitting him
right in the forehead, put an end to his misery.
Heindrich and his brothers we could hear shouting

GREAT TEMERITY.
something in Dutch, which Jan explained to us was an
exhortation not to quit our ambush, as the lioness
who had lost her cub would be in a very dangerous
temper, and would certainly attack the first person she
could set eyes on..
Major Brownlow now fired a second time, and
wounded the lioness, who, on recovering herself from
the shock, left her cub and sprang towards the pit in
which he was, and had come nearly half the distance,
when she was checked by another bullet from Captain
Smithson. This, though crippling her, did not kill her;
and it was not until two more shots had been fired-
one by Jan van Neeldt and the other by Heindrich
Steindrup—that she was finally finished with.
Mr. Penton, who was delighted with the results of
the night's work, now sprang out of his hiding-place
and went towards the lion, in order to examine the
first he had ever seen in a state of nature. He was so
quick that Jan was not able to prevent him; and I
followed him, heedless of the remonstrances showered
upon me. But we soon had cause to repent our
temerity; for scarcely had we got to where the dead
lion was lying and Mr. Penton had put down his rifle
to examine him at his ease, when another lion dashed
out of the bush and made straight towards us.
I fortunately had Mr. Penton's second rifle still in
my hands, and though I had scarcely ever fired a gun
in my life, I aimed instinctively at its head, and was
fortunate enough to inflict a severe wound, which

QUITE STUNNED.
checked his progress, though the enormous recoil of
the heavy rifle knocked me down backwards, and I
fell on the carcass of the dead lion.
Mr. Penton managed to profit by the short delay
given him to repossess himself of his rifle and fire
again; but whether he was nervous or fired too
hurriedly I do not know, but he missed the fresh
comer completely, and it continued its progress towards
him. Dropping his rifle again, he essayed to drag me
towards our pit, but was forced to desist, as the lion
closed on him so rapidly, and had to leave me lying
across the dead one, whilst he attempted to make the
best of his way to his refuge.
I was so dazed and stunned by my fall that I had
no idea of what was going on, and lay like one dead
or stupified. This was perhaps the luckiest thing
possible for me; for, passing me by without notice, the
lion pursued Mr. Penton, and would doubtless have
caught him if it had not been knocked over by a volley
from all the rest, which left it helpless on the ground.
By this time I was recovering my senses, and looking
round, seeing what was occurring, I picked up both the
guns, and ran after Mr. Penton.
By the time we were settled in our places again it
was nearly five o'clock; and though we heard jackals
and hyenas and the distant roaring of lions, nothing
more visited our pool, and the rising sun soon enabled
us to quit our lurking-places and examine the results of
the night's sport, first going to the big lion, which was

A SPLENDID ANIMAL.
a splendid animal, and, according to Heindrich and his
brothers, the finest they had ever seen.
Its measurement, from the tip of the nose to the tip
of the tail, was sixteen feet nine inches. The lioness
was also a very fine specimen ; and the one which so
nearly caught Mr. Penton was young, and though of no
extraordinary size, its skin was in such good order that
it quite made up for any trifling deficiency in bigness.
Some of the natives were told to remove the skins
and bring them down to the camp, whence, after being
stretched, they could be sent to Haarlem Farm, where
Heindrich had promised to arrange for their being dressed
and prepared; whilst the rest went down to the tents,
where Harry Tregear was waitinginaflutter of excitement
to know what had been the result of our night's watch.
I went to him and related all that had happened ;
and then, after a hasty breakfast, was not sorry to
follow the example of Mr. Penton and the rest and
indulge in a good sleep, which was very invigorating
after the day of hard work and the sleepless night I
had gone through.
At noon we were all on foot again, as the wounded
lioness and cubs had been traced to a rocky hill or
kopje some little distance away, and it was determined
to try to drive her out of this with the dogs. The
horses were all saddled, and we mounted, Harry Tre-
gear, after earnest petition to Mr. Penton, being per-
mitted to accompany us; and the camp was left to the
tender mercies of some of the Hottentot herdsmen.

A ROUGH COUNTRY-THE DOGS AND THE LION CUBS—THE LIONESS SULKY—THE
MAJOR IN DANGER-THE THIRD CUB-A BROKEN STOCK-VIRTUES OF RAW
HIDE-CAPE SMOKE-NEWS OF MORE LIONS-WOUNDED DOGS.
WE rode off across a very rough country, interspersed
with nullahs and bits of thorny jungle, and having
many kopjes scattered about on its surface. The kopje
we were bound for was distant from the camp about
an hour and a half's ride, and the necessity of approach-
ing it up-wind and surrounding it carefully made it
quite half-past two in the afternoon before we could
send the dogs in to turn the lioness out.
Though the pack would have been considered a
motley and disreputable lot in an English hunting-field,
they were admirably adapted for the work they had to
do, and dashed in among the rocks as cheerfully and
eagerly as if the antagonist they were about to meet
were one about the easy conquest of which there could
be no question.
The sportsmen remained mounted at the foot of the
kopje, the surface of which was too steep and rocky to
permit of men on horseback ascending it easily.

A SULKY LIONESS.
At first the dogs worked silently, but we soon heard
a regular charivari of barks and growls, intermingled
with the moaning and roaring of the lioness and cubs ;
and soon we saw two of the cubs making their way out
of the rocks, closely pursued by four of the dogs, who
were coming to very close quarters with them. When
Jan van Neeldt saw this, he rolled out a string of
African-Dutch objurgations, and called the dogs off, as,
although they might have mastered the cubs, still the
latter were sufficiently large to do them serious injury.
Responding to his voice, the dogs adopted a different
policy, and while harassing and worrying, kept out of
the reach of the paws and teeth of the young lions, and
cleverly inveigled them into the plain, where one was
shot by Mr. Penton and Piet Steindrup killed the
other.
Whilst this was going on on one side of the kopje,
the lioness and the other cub broke cover on the other,
being surrounded by all the rest of the dogs. She was
evidently very averse to coming out into the open, and
her broken leg hampered her movements very much.
Captain Smithson, who was the first to see her, tried
a shot; but his horse swerving, he missed her, and
luckily did not hit any of the dogs. These kept on
making dashes towards the lioness, and as she made
springs at them, retreating, and so drawing her further
on, until at last she turned sulky and stood at bay with
her rear protected by a corner in the rocks. From this
coign of vantage all that the dogs could do would not

A VERY CRITICAL POSITION.

move her, and one or two that approached her too
closely got severely punished for their temerity.
At last Captain Smithson, who by this time had
been joined by Major Brownlow and Wilhelm Stein-
drup, persuaded them to join him in attacking her on
foot; and intrusting their horses to some of the Hot-
tentots, they dismounted and commenced the ascent
of the kopje.
The slipperiness of the rocks, and the quantity of wait-
a-bit thorns which grew amongst them, rendered their
progress very slow and difficult, and they had often to
pay more attention to their own proceedings than those
of the lioness; and during one of the intervals when
they were not watching her, she broke through the
dogs and came towards them.
Major Brownlow, who was in advance, hearing an
increase of barking and yelling among the dogs, looked
up and saw that she had got on the top of a rock some
little distance from him, and was about to spring.
Instinctively he drew back, and, his foot slipping, he
rolled down some distance; and the lioness springing
at the same instant, though crippled as she was her
spring was not a very powerful one, also fell and rolled
down close by him.
Major Brownlow was quickly on his feet; but as he
had dropped his rifle, and neither Captain Smithson
nor Wilhelm could come to his assistance at the mo-
ment, his position was a very critical one, as the lioness
recovered herself almost as quickly as he did, and was

TAE COUP DE GRACE.
again making for him, when she was attacked and her
attention attracted by the dogs who had been engaged
with the cubs on the other side, and who now boldly
rushed at her.
Major Brownlow looked for his rifle, but could not
see it, and was for seeking safety in flight, when at
that moment he heard the report of the heavy roer*
of Wilhelm, and had the satisfaction of seeing the
lioness again roll over. This time her other fore leg
was broken. But though so disabled she did not lose
her courage, and tried to propel herself with her hind
legs alone in the direction of her assailants.
We, who had been attracted from the other side of
the kopje, now came on the scene just in time to see
Captain Smithson administer the coup de grace to the
lioness in the shape of a bullet through her head.
The third cub was still missing, and Major Brownlow
proposed that they should attempt to capture it alive;
but Jan and the Boers overruled him, saying that this
one was too large, but that another family of lions had
their den a short distance away, where there were re-
ported to be some very young cubs, but that if they
were to be captured very different tactics must be pur-
sued from those we had followed on this occasion.
Whilst this discussion was going on, the cub was
seen stealing along behind some rocks, and Mr. Penton
put his rifle in Harry's hands and told him to take a
shot, as he had never fired at a lion before. Harry,

A DISASTROUS RESULT.
who was still on his horse, tried his hand, but the result
was more disastrous to him than to the cub; for as
he turned sideways in his saddle to fire he did not sit
very tight, and the recoil of the rifle, the same which
had occasioned my downfall the previous night, knocked
him backwards out of the saddle, and he fell to the
ground with the rifle, breaking the stock as he did so,
whilst the bullet was seen to strike a rock at the top of
the kopje about fifty feet above the cub.
Two shots from Captain Smithson and Piet Stein-
drup, however, finished its career, and thus we had ex-
terminated the whole of the family of lions that we had
seen at the vley the night before.
Harry, when he picked himself up, shook himself
and declared himself to be all right, though there could
be little doubt that he had received some shrewd knocks
and bruises. But when his eyes fell on the broken
stock of the rifle, he looked very rueful indeed; and
Mr. Penton, though he restrained himself, was evi-
dently very vexed at the damage done to his favourite
weapon. .
"Major," he said, "when you go back to Cape Town
I shall have to ask you to let me have your rifle, to
replace this one."
" Certainly, you shall be welcome; but that can be
mended easy enough."
"Mended! what do you mean? You can't find a
man to make a new gun-stock out in the wild here ?"
"No; who ever thought of such a thing? A piece

of raw hide is all you want, and your stock is stronger
than ever."
"Raw hide ! how can you mend a stock with raw
hide ? who ever heard of such a thing ?"
"Well, my dear fellow, it is evident you have not
had much experience of roughing it, or you would have
known that raw hide, out in the veldt, has to mend
everything—from a broken disselboom or an axle-tree
to a whip-handle—and I may be sure that one of the
Steindrups will have his gun-stock mended with hide.
Ay, I'm right; both Piet and Heindrich have hide on
their stocks."
Heindrich, at Major Brownlow's request, brought his
over and showed the stock, which had been badly
broken, but which was rendered as strong and firm as
ever by a piece of raw hide which had been laced
tightly round it when wet and suffered to shrink, thus
gripping all the pieces together solidly.
"Piet there has not broken his yet, nor has Wilhelm.
But those guns are new. Piet has put the hide on to
save his, and Wilhelm ought to do the same; but he
has been too lazy. Every other gun in my father's
house has been broken, and mended with hide," said
Heindrich.
"There, Penton, you see it will not be a difficult
business. A bullock is sure to be killed at the camp
to-night in honour of this hunt, and Jan can put your
rifle to rights in an hour. You had better make him
show those two lads of yours how to do it also, as it

may prove very useful when you are further up
country."
"All right, I'll see to it. So you see, Tregear, you
need not look altogether frightened out of your life;
I will not quite kill you this time."
We soon were on our way back to the camp with
the skins of the lions, and found when we arrived
there that those that had been obtained the night be-
fore were cleaned and pegged out, and had an oppor-
tunity of judging accurately of the enormous size of the
lion which had been first shot.
We were none of us loath to rest after the night and
day's excitement, and Harry informed me in confidence
that he felt as sore as ever he did after being thrashed
by Mrs. Snaresby with the door-batten, which was a
favourite weapon of hers.
As the major had predicted, a bullock was killed,
and in addition a quantity of the vile spirits known as
"Cape smoke" was served out to the natives; and they
soon were all engaged in orgies round their camp-fire-
yelling and drinking, and dancing and squabbling, look-
ing against the fire-light like a lot of black demons
in the infernal regions. The noise did not last very
long, for the allowance of smoke had been liberal, ...
and they soon were all asleep and none of us were
sorry when quietness permitted us to follow their
example.
Early in the morning we were all on foot, and a dis-
cussion was entered into about the major's design of

capturing a cub, or possibly two, to take back to Cape
Town with him.
Piet said that Moses, one of their Hottentots, had
news about the lions mentioned the day before. They
had a lair in a patch of thorn lying at the foot of a
kopje about ten miles off, and, as far as the report went,
there were an old lion and lioness, three half-grown lions,
and the lioness had a litter of young cubs only a few
weeks old.
After some discussion it was decided that we should
ride off there with the dogs and some fire-works which
Mr. Penton had brought with him, and try to drive the
lions out; and when they were disposed of, to look
after the cubs.
When, however, we came to muster up the dogs, we
found that two of ours, and three belonging to the
Dutchmen, were not fit for work owing to the wounds
that they had received the day before. One, indeed, of
those which had attacked the lioness when she was
making for Major Brownlow had such a serious rip
down one flank, that Jan had been obliged to sew
him up on our return to camp.
Jan assured us that they would be all right in a few
days; and if the scars which garnished the hides of
these lion-dogs were to be taken as any criterion of the
risks that they had run, they must have had as many
lives as all the cats and kittens that came from St.
Ives on a certain famous day.

FIRE THE BUSH–THE LIONESS AND HER CUBS-JAN'S HORSE BOLTS—HARRY'S
PLUCK-OUR PROTÉGÉ-A FEEDING-BOTTLE="VERRY GOOT JUNKERS"-
NERO'S CAGE-GROOT BOCK.
THERE were still enough dogs to furnish a very good
pack, and we mounted and rode off cheerfully.
When we got near the kopje, we found that the
patch of thorn in which the lions were supposed to lie
was separated from its base by about a hundred yards;
and Wilhelm proposed that he and one of his brothers
should dismount, and, hobbling their horses, take up
their position among some rocks at the lower part, so
as to be able to fire successfully if the lions broke in
that direction.
On careful reconnoitring, all the most recent tracks
were found leading to the thorns; and greatly to our
delight, the thorn was much of it so dry as to give a
good chance of burning it down, and driving all the
lions out by that means.
The suggestion to set fire to the bush was soon acted
on, and only Harry and myself were left at the weather-
end to watch what might happen, whilst the rest

THE LIONESS AND HER CUBS.
withdrew to the other end to look out for the lions
bolting
The fire blazed up merrily, and there was no need for
either dogs or rockets to drive the lions out, for we soon
heard shouting and firing from the other end, and were
in a short time witnesses to a most pathetic instance of
maternal devotion and wisdom.
As we were watching, we saw the lioness come out
through the smoke and flame carrying one of her cubs
in her mouth; and though when she saw us she seemed
inclined to falter in her purpose, she deposited it safely
in a bunch of bush that had escaped the flames, and
then dashed back into the fire again.
Harry was for at once going and seizing on the cub
which she had brought out, and which was evidently
younger even than had been reported by the Hottentots;
but I stopped him, as I thought that if the lioness
found this one safe on her return, as she had evidently
gone back for another, she would again go in case she
had any more in the burning bush.
My opinion proved to be correct, for she soon re-
appeared with another cub which she dropped along-
side the one she had brought before, and then turned
back again at once into the midst of the flames. This
time she was absent a still shorter period, and returned
with a third cub, which she laid down by the side of
the other two, and then commenced licking and fond-
ling them.
After a minute or so she got up, and evidently was

looking round to choose her line of retreat; so I sent
Harry to gallop round to the rest of the party to tell
them what we had seen, whilst I remained to watch
the proceedings of the lioness with her cubs.
After a few moments of consideration, she again took
up one in her mouth and started at a swift run for a
small patch of rock and bush about a quarter of a mile
distant, and had nearly reached it, when I saw Mr.
Penton, Major Brownlow, and Jan accompanying Harry
back. The lioness saw them at the same moment, and,
dropping the one she had been carrying, rushed back to
the defence of her other two cubs.
Jan immediately on arriving where the cubs were
had dismounted, and I had to shout as loud as I could
to warn him of the approach of the lioness. Mr.
Penton and Major Brownlow both fired at her, but,
being on horseback and the lioness moving quickly,
though they both struck her, their bullets did no more
than increase her rage and determination.
Jan tried to jump on his horse; but the animal,
though a well-trained veldt horse, was too frightened
to stand still, and, breaking loose, galloped away. Harry
and I were still possessed of loaded rifles, and Major
Brownlow and Mr. Penton were busy with reloading
theirs; but Jan had left his on his saddle, and his horse
had carried it off, so that he was on foot and defence-
less, except for such assistance as he might receive from
Harry and myself.
I rode towards the spot determined to do my best,

HARRY'S PLUCK.
when I was astonished to see Harry spring off his
horse, rifle in hand, and advance to the assistance of
Jan. His horse too bolted off, and mine tried to follow
its example, so that I had to exercise all my power and
energies in restraining him, and could not render any
assistance with my rifle.
Harry, however, with a courage and steadiness for
which I had never given him credit, stood up and
waited for the advancing lioness; and when she was
only twelve yards off, fired a shot into her shoulder
which went right through her heart; and giving three
convulsive bounds, the last of which landed her close
to Jan, who was doing his best to escape, she fell
dead.
The major and Mr. Penton were loud in their praise
of Harry's pluck and steadiness; but Jan, though his
life had been saved, said very little, and did not at all
alter his usual manner.
The cubs, for the capture of which all this toil had
been undertaken, were found to be quite uninjured.
They were jolly little beasts about the size of a re-
triever, and after Major Brownlow had selected two,
which he said he would give to the governor at Cape
Town on his return, Harry and myself interceded with
Mr. Penton to spare the life of the other one and let
us keep it.
After much urging he did so. "But," said he,"mind
it is on the condition that you two take all the trouble
of looking after it and feeding it; and if it ever becomes

dangerous it must be killed at once. I know well how
such pets usually end."
Harry and I had no forebodings, however, and joy-
fully took the charge upon us.
We had some little trouble in managing to get our
protégé to camp, as Mr. Penton told us he quite meant
what he said, and we had to carry it in turns on the
pommel of our saddles, which, as its claws were some-
what sharp, did not promise to be easy; but after a few
minutes, during which all the party were laughing at
my difficulties, and the way in which my horse plunged
about, much to my discomfiture, as he occasionally got
a sharp scratch from the cub, kindly Wilhelm Stein-
drup took a dressed hide which he had over his saddle,
and helped me to swaddle up my unwilling nursling,
so that he could neither injure himself nor any one else.
Wrapped up like this, I lashed him on to the D's,
with which my saddle was plentifully provided, and
found no more difficulty in carrying him.
At the camp there was a repetition of the previous
night's orgies; but Harry and I were too busy managing
quarters for our pet to pay any attention to what was
going on. Our first trouble was to feed him and to
make him a cage which would be secure, in which he
could travel in the waggon, and which would be strong
enough and not too heavy.
We easily procured an empty stone jar, and made
him a nursing-bottle out of it, with a mouth-piece made
out of a piece of a regimental glove, which Bates was

A TRIUMPHANT RETURN.
cutting up to use for the same purpose for the major's
two cubs ; but for them no travelling cage was neces-
sary, at all events for the present, as Heindrich promised
that they should be taken care of at his father's farm
until the return of the two officers.
With the assistance of Bates and Stevens, who were
most kind, we got a quantity of small strong poles,
which we cut into suitable lengths to make bars for
the top and sides, and then we made eight pieces of
flat wood four inches wide by two thick, half of which
were four and half six feet long. These we let into
each other, so as to form two oblong frames, and pinned
them where they crossed. The ends were allowed to
cross a little, and to strengthen them we cut long narrow
strips of raw hide and lashed them securely. In these,
with a piece of hot iron bar, we bored holes to receive
the poles, and before we went to sleep that night had
the satisfaction of seeing these frames finished, and
enough poles cut for our purpose.
Next morning we all packed up and returned in
triumph to the farm of Peter Steindrup with our cap-
tives and trophies.
The old Boer was delighted, on our return, to hear of
our success in exterminating these two families of lions,
which had long been levying a heavy black-mail on
his herds and flocks; and when Wilhelm, who was evi-
dently his favourite, told him the whole story of the
hunt, he was pleased to say, between the puffs of the
big china pipe which was his inseparable companion,

NERO'S CAGE.
that Harry and I were two "verry goot junkers,"—a
verdict which we felt very proud of.
The two officers were in a hurry to get over the
Zwarte Berg into the great Karroo plains beyond, where
they heard game of all sorts and kinds was very
plentiful, and where in consequence they would be able
to enjoy good sport.
Harry and myself busied ourselves with the cage for
our pet, and Mr. Penton kindly got the Boer patriarch
to allow his carpenter and blacksmith to assist us and
our two allies, Bates and Stevens, in its completion; and
in consequence we were able to make a much more
complete job of it than we had hoped.
The bottom was formed of solid planks, which were
nailed strongly on to the lower frames; and an iron rod
was fixed at each corner, to give it extra strength and
- solidity. The bars were fixed round all the sides, and
the centre of the front fitted with a door with a good
solid bar and bolts.
* Over the top ends and back we then nailed some
stout canvas which was amongst the stores in the
waggons, and a trough was fitted in front for food and
water, whilst a flap of canvas was fitted to come right
down in front and tie, so to exclude all light when
necessary. When this cage was half filled with dry
grass, we put Nero, as we called our pet, into it, and
were delighted to see him coil himself comfortably
away.
This cage Jan and the drivers managed to lash on

to the rear of one of the waggons, so that we could at
any time during the march look after Nero's comfort,
and when we camped lower it down on the ground.
The two cubs, which were to be left behind, were
put into a large out-house, where they could be kept
safely and comfortably until the time arrived for them
to be sent to Cape Town.
We had been so busy about our cage that we had
little time to attend to anything else, and therefore
were rather astonished, when we came into the house-
place for our supper, to find that Heindrich Steindrup's
eldest son, a young man of twenty, whom we always
knew by his nick-name of Groot Bock, given him on
account of his enormous size, was to accompany our
party as an assistant to Jan van Neeldt, and that Mr.
Penton had bought some more horses and dogs.
We had always known that Mr. Penton acted rather
on impulse; but these purchases and the engagement
of Groot Bock seemed to point to a much bigger journey
than he had any intention of when he left Cape Town;
and so did his conversation during the evening, as it
showed he contemplated going on beyond the Kalahari
Desert to the north.
This did not trouble either Harry or me, for we had
neither kith nor kin to care for us; and though I had
kind friends in Cornwall, still I had heard nothing of
them for so long, that it was only when I overhauled
my treasures, and looked at my Bible, prayer-book,
Tom's knife, and dear little Annie's pin-cushion, which

thought of the days of my childhood. As for the time
that I had been sheltered under the roof of my uncle
at Falmouth, it only seemed like an evil dream, and it
sometimes required the presence of Harry Tregear to
persuade me that all was true.

SKINS-A HERD OF ANTELOPES-A DUST STORM-FRIGHT.
The journey over the Zwarte Berg was a very stiff pull,
and Peter Steindrup advised us to make it with double
teams, so as to arrive on the other side with our cattle
still in good condition, instead of having them dragged
to pieces by the exertion of hauling the heavy waggons
over the mountainous country.
This advice was too good to be neglected, and Mr.
Penton arranged with him for the hire of a team of
sixteen horses, which would be accompanied to the
summit by Piet, who would then return with them.
At six in the morning we in-spanned or put the bul-
locks and horses into their places under the yokes, and
the two waggons, with their long lines of oxen and
horses, drew out of the enclosure, headed by Jan van
Neeldt and Groot Bock, who was a great deal too stoical
to show any grief at parting from his family, and whose
great size, and the weight of the enormous roer (or long
single-barrelled elephant-gun) which he carried, ren- .

dered him a heavy load for any horse to carry; and we
were much puzzled as to what he was to do when, as
seemed inevitable, the steed he bestrode got knocked up.
I asked Piet, who was riding by me and Harry close
in rear of the waggons, where we could attend to Nero,
who seemed comfortable in his cage, and to show some
signs of knowing us already, for some solution of the
difficulty.
Piet only laughed and pointed to a bullock running
by Groot Bock's side, which I noticed had a thong
twined round its horns and made fast to a piece of
wood thrust through the cartilage of its nostril.
"What! ride an ox ?"
"Yes, ride an ox; and you may be all very lucky if
you all have oxen to ride in two months. Groot Bock
is so big he always rides one, except when near a farm
or town, and when hunting."
Harry and I looked at each other in astonishment,
and we thought how our shipmates on board the Idalia
would stare if they saw us mounted on oxen, they
having been quite enough amused at the sight of the
ox-drays and waggons at Cape Town.
After we had got about a mile from Haarlem, we all
halted to allow Peter Steindrup and his family to bid
us farewell, and had to share a parting glass to the
success of our expedition.
The worthy old Dutchman insisted on our taking
with us half-a-dozen cows to supply us with milk, and
a dozen sheep, and then bid us a hearty farewell. At

ASCENT OF THE ZWARTE BERG.

w of
this moment Groot Bock, when he had to take leave of
the old vrouw his grandmother and his mother, showed
some signs of emotion, but on a hint from his father
cantered on to take his place at the head of the party.
The whips cracked, the heavy waggons creaked and
groaned, and with a parting cheer from our friends of
Haarlem, we again went on our way; and it was not
long before we found the wisdom of having double
teams to our waggons, for the ascent became very
steep, and even with the great amount of hauling
power at our disposal, it was as much as we could do
to get up some of the steeper slopes.
It was not until the evening of the second day that
we camped on the summit of the Zwarte Berg; and
Groot Bock said we were lucky indeed to have made
the ascent so quickly, for he had often, when working
with only single teams, been a week from Haarlem,
when the roads were heavy to where we were now
encainped.
· From the ridge there was a beautiful view, the great
Karroo plains at this time of the year being green, and
the clumps of kameel-dorn and other trees covered with
verdure; and away across the smiling plain to the north
we could see the forms of the Nieuwveld Mountains,
whilst behind us lay the plains and hills through which
we had passed, and Groot Bock insisted that he could
distinguish his grandfather's settlement of Haarlem.
All of us were glad the tiring ascent was over, and
were quite ready to enjoy the repose of the camp; but

NERO AND THE MILK.
105
Harry and I, after we had attended to our horses, and
assisted Bates and Stevens in looking after those of
our masters, had to attend to Nero, who seemed to
appreciate cow's milk quite as much as he could ever
have done that of his mother, and took to his bottle as
readily as any civilized baby
We took him out of his cage to feed him, and the
knowing little brute seemed quite to understand what
it was for, and did not attempt to struggle or resist us,
as he had done at first.
The quantity of milk that he consumed was some-
thing enormous; and if it had not been for the kindly
gift of Peter Steindrup, we should have been sorely
put to it to feed him, though we were delighted to find
that he would suck and chew a piece of meat or hide
for hours during the march, whilst he rested comfort-
ably in his cage, and relieve us of the necessity of con-
stantly attending to him.
The dogs at first seemed to view him with suspicion ;
but two which Harry and I called mine, and named
Pickle and Pepper, because of their curiously coloured
coats, came and played and romped with him as if he
were one of themselves.
As a sleeping-place, Harry and I had given to us, at
our own request, one of the wings of the leading wag-
gon; and here, as we had no companions, we made
Nero sleep between us, whilst either end was guarded
by Pickle and Pepper. We had our hammocks slung
to the wheels of the waggon and to stout stakes in the

ground; but in fine dry weather, such as we were
having now, we preferred to spread our beds on the
ground, and play with our four-footed pets until sleep
overpowered us.
The descent of the Zwarte Berg was not so tedious
or tiring as the ascent, but had to be performed with
great caution. In addition to skidding and chaining
the wheels, we cut down largish trees, and trimming
the branches, made them fast behind, so as to act as
additional drags; and even these, in some of the steeper
pinches, were not sufficient, but we had to make a stout
rope fast to the rear axle-tree, and taking turns round
any suitable trees, actually lower the waggons down
the slopes. Notwithstanding our having to take all
these precautions, we got down quickly, and one day
sufficed for us to get into the Karroo plains.
On the way down, Mr. Penton and the two officers
shot a quantity of francolin and quail, which formed
an agreeable change at our evening meal; and Harry
and I congratulated ourselves on the presence of the
Hottentots, as they were only too glad to pluck the
game-a disagreeable job, which would otherwise have
fallen to our share, as it had often done on board of the
Idalia, where the steward had by no means regarded
us with the same favour as his master and the crew.
Our camp was formed near a watering-place, round
which there were quantities of tracks of animals of all
kinds, which augured well for the prospects of our
shooting being successful.

A NIGHT ALARM.
107
As the night was already falling when we camped,
we did not build a fence, but contented ourselves with
enormous fires, which we trusted would keep away all
visits from lions or other dangerous wild beasts; but
notwithstanding this precaution, we were waked in the
middle of the night by shouts from one of the Hotten-
tots who had charge of our sheep, that a hyena had got
into the middle of his flock and worried two or three,
and that the rest had been stampeded. The noise
caused great confusion among all our bullocks and
horses. The latter were all hobbled, except the ones
belonging to Harry and myself, Mr. Penton, and the ::
two officers, which were tied to the disselboom of the
waggons where we were sleeping.
We were all instantly on our feet, and soon the roars
of lions told us that some of these brutes were in dan-
gerous propinquity; and before long two came right
into camp, and we were all in fear that in the darkness
they would prove dangerous customers. Harry and I
picked a couple of rifles, and determined if the lions
came near us to do our best to shoot them. Jan and
most of the Hottentots scrambled into the waggons as
the safest place, and Mr. Penton and his friends tried
to get into a position where they could fire at the lions
without danger of harming any of our people or animals;
and for a few moments all was quietness, none of us
daring to think what would be the next move of the
lions.
Mr. Penton had a large lantern fitted with a reflector,

THE LIONS AND THE LANTERN.
which he used to light up the interior of his waggon,
and this had been left burning; and one of the Hot-
tentots, with more wit and courage than his fellows,
bethought himself of it, and bringing it out of the
waggon, turned the light full in the faces of the lions.
They were so dazzled and startled by the light being
flashed suddenly in their eyes, that they stood stock
still, while their every feature, and almost every hair,
were plainly visible to Harry and me.
"Now, Harry," I said, "be a man. I will take the one
to the right, and you the one to the left. Take good aim."
"Right, Jack !" he said; and, levelling our rifles, we
fired at the lions, which were not more than twelve
paces distant, and had the great good fortune to drop
them both in their tracks.
Mr. Penton and his friends came running to us when
they heard the report of the rifles, and seeing the lions
dead, were loud in their praises of Harry and myself ;
nor was the Hottentot who had thought of the lan-
tern forgotten, and he was also rewarded with some-
thing more substantial than thanks, and was well satis-
fied with himself for his happy thought.
| Groot Bock and Jan, with the Hottentots, went out
to try and drive the animals in, but with small effect;
and when the morning broke we could see them
scattered about the plain, with the exception of two
horses and half-a-dozen bullocks, which had followed
Groot Bock's riding bullock in when that well-trained
beast had come in to its master's call.

VISITED BY BUSHMEN.
109
All who had horses at once mounted and went after
the cattle; and after some hard riding over the treach-
erous ground, which was full of cracks and holes, and
would have been impassable to steeds less sure-footed
than ours, they were all recovered, except five sheep.
But by the time they were all again in camp, it was
too late to think of making a good trek that day, and
we therefore set to work and made a corral, in which
to keep our cattle, and took especial care to have the
horses well picketed.
Just before sunset we saw a party of people coming
to us across the veldt; and as they got near, Jan pro-
nounced them to be Bushmen. There were seven men
and four women, and two of the latter carried babies
tied on their backs in sheep-skins. When they came
into camp, we found that they had been wandering
about in the plains hunting ostriches; and hoping that
we might prove to be traders, had, on seeing our fires the
previous night, come in to see if they could sell their
feathers.
Groot Bock advised them to go over the Zwarte
Berg. to his father's house; but they seemed to have a
horror of the Dutch, and could not be persuaded to go
there.
Major Brownlow and Captain Smithson bought a
few feathers, and exchanged some blankets for their
karosses or skin rugs, which were most beautifully
dressed. When the officers had finished their pur-
chases, Bates and Stevens took to trading, remarking

A AERD OF ANTELOPES.
that many a good lark at Cape Town might be had off
the profit on some ostrich feathers and skins, and that
as they had come thus far, they did not see why they
should not make the best of it.
Mr. Penton was far more interested in their reports
about game, and was delighted to hear that it was
fairly plentiful, though they said the great quantities
of which he had heard would not be encountered until
after crossing the Orange River.
As they said that as good a camping-place for hunt-
ing as could be found, without going away very far,
existed about twenty-five miles away, where there were
good water and forage for the cattle, it was decided
that we should go there and form a permanent camp,
until the leave of Major Brownlow and Captain Smith-
son was expired, and make hunting expeditions from
it; and that afterwards Mr. Penton, if he still had the
idea, might travel to the north in search of more game.
· Next morning we were soon under way, and the
waggons and cattle went direct, under guidance of the
Bushmen and Jan van Neeldt, to where the camp was
to be built, whilst Groot Bock took charge of Mr.
Penton, his friends, their servants, and Harry and
myself, to see if we could not find some sport on the way.
We had not gone far before Groot Bock pointed out
a herd of antelopes grazing away to windward of us.
He pointed out that they had sentinels posted, to give
warning of the approach of any danger, and that there-
fore they had evidently been disturbed, and would be

approached with some difficulty. He suggested that
Harry and myself, as being the two lightest of the
party, should circle round one flank and drive the ante-
lopes down to near where we then were, where the
main body of the sportsmen could wait in ambush for
them behind some clumps of bush which were scattered
over the plain.
In order that we might ride light, we left all our im- .
pedimenta, such as guns, water-bottles, and blankets,
behind us, and started off at a hand gallop in the direc-
tion pointed out to us. We soon drew up near the ante-
lopes, and devoted all our attention to passing by them
unobserved. By careful dodging from clump to clump
of bushes, we managed to elude the vigilance of the sen-
tinels; but behind some of the bushes we had to wait for
a long time whilst their gaze was turned in our direction.
So intent were we on our duty of turning the ante-
lopes (which, as we afterwards learned, were elands),
and so lost in astonishment at their great size and
beauty, that we paid no attention to the weather or
anything else, until we were rudely disturbed by a vio-
lent squall, which struck us, and at the same time as
we looked up we saw the whole air was full of dust,
which was coming down on us like a thick fog-bank.
The wind with the squall suddenly altered its direc-
tion, and placed the elands right to leeward of us, and
the same instant they started off as hard as they could
go away from the storm. Harry and I set our horses
going after them, to try and turn them, as the direction

in which they had started would take them away from
Mr. Penton and his friends. In a few moments, how-
ever, we had to come to a stop, as the air became so
full of dust that we could not see, and we had to dis-
mount and lead our steeds. The wind seemed to in-
crease in strength and fury, and we could scarcely keep
our feet, and right glad was I when I found myself
near some bushes of thorn, which afforded a certain
amount of shelter from the fury of the blast.
My satisfaction, however, was not long-lived, as I
found that Harry was not near me, and the wind was
so high that my voice, when I tried to shout for him,
seemed borne away to leeward. I found soon, too, that
I could not shout any longer, for such a quantity of
dust got into my mouth and throat, and the wind was
so hot and dry, that I became quite parched and dry
and my tongue cracked and swollen.
My fright at the position in which I found myself
was extreme, and, joined to the anxiety which I felt
about the fate of Harry, rendered me so nervous that I
scarce knew what to do. My horse seemed to share my
terror, and broke out into a perspiration and shook and
trembled as if he were going to fall.
After some time I did what I ought to have done at
first, and turned to my Almighty Father to implore his
succour and assistance. As soon as I had said a prayer
or two I was comforted, and felt an inward assurance
that I should pass safely through the difficulty in which
I found myself.

I HEARD afterwards that the storm lasted only an hour
and a half, but to me it seemed interminable; and at
last, when the wind did drop, the air was so full of
dust that one could only see a hundred yards or so, and
I was totally ignorant of which was north, south, east,
or west, or in what direction I should go to join my
companion.
The first thing I did, as soon as I could see suf-
ficiently to move at all, was to proceed in search of
Harry, who I knew could not be far off, as I had
only missed him about five or ten minutes before I
reached the friendly bush which had afforded me shelter
during the worst of the storm.
I at first thought I might track him by his footprints
and those of his horse ; but the whole ground was
covered with a layer of fine dust about two inches
deep, which had completely obliterated every vestige
of spoor of any kind. To wander away in any direc-

FOUND AT LAST.
tion might only lead me further from him, and it seemed
as if the best thing I could do was to remain quietly
where I was.
The atmosphere gradually cleared, and in about half-
an-hour I was able to see objects about a quarter of a
mile distant from me; and I got on my horse and rode
first in one direction and then in another to the farthest
point that I could see, returning after each expedition
to the point I had started from, in order to try a fresh
direction.
On the fifth of these radiating journeys I saw the
dim outline of a horse standing stock still, with his
head down; very much the position in which I had
often seen Harry's horse stand when playing with him.
I instantly rode towards it, and as I drew near called
out as well as I was able, and was rewarded by hearing
a faint cry in response. I urged my horse on, and on
coming to the spot found that my unlucky chum had
fallen into a pit which had been dug for game by some
wandering hunter, and that his horse had only just
escaped sharing his fate.
On my inquiring whether he had hurt himself, he
said he could scarcely tell, but that he felt faint and
shaken and terribly thirsty. Whilst he was speaking
to me he tried to get up, and then found that he had
sprained his foot, and could not bear his weight on it
without pain.
The pit was too deep for me to reach down to him
to pull him out, so I had to take our girths and reins


## p. 115 (#117) ############################################

A FRUGAL MEAL.
115
and make them fast together, and then with a good
deal of trouble I managed to get him on the surface of
the ground again.
We now put on our considering caps, and tried hard
to find some way out of our most unpleasant situation ;
for though we had fortunately found each other, and
Harry had been pulled out of the pitfall, there was no
blinking the fact that we were in considerable danger.
Our thirst was almost overmastering in its intensity,
and we bitterly regretted our folly in leaving our water-
bottles behind us when we started to drive the antelopes.
Suddenly Harry, who was sitting on the ground by
my side, sprang half on his feet, and then sat down
again with a groan as his weight came on his sprained
foot. "I know," said he, "what we can do! I have
some raw hide thongs on my saddle. We can chew
those for a bit. They will relieve our thirst, and pre-
vent our being so awfully parched as we are now."
I instantly went to his saddle and brought away
about three feet of quite green hide, which he had cut
in order to make something for Nero, and which we
now shared between us. Though raw hide is not to be
recommended as an every-day meal, to us at that
moment it came like a Godsend, and we chewed and
chewed away most vigorously.
"Now, Jack," said Harry, after we had been worry-
ing at our raw hide for over half-an-hour in silence,
"we have had our dinner; we should be thinking seri-
ously how we are to get back to Mr. Penton."


## p. 116 (#118) ############################################

116
AT A LOSS HOW TO STEER.
"That's all very well, Harry; but we don't know
which way to go, and as we don't know the points of
the compass, we might be only going further away
from the place where we would be. I'm afraid we
must wait till it clears before we can find in which
direction we have to steer."
"Can't you, Jack, who are always reading, tell us that?
Why not steer by the trees ? I know from books it
can be done. See, the trees are all covered with moss
on one side, and bare on the other. That means that
the prevailing wind comes from the side where the
smooth bark is—at least so you read to me the other
day, and you see I haven't forgotten it."
"Right, Harry; but we don't know which way the
prevailing wind is. I am afraid, unless it clear so
that we can see the hills, we shall have to wait for the
stars before we can make any start."
" That's true, Jack—we must wait; we shall have to
walk and ride all night. Why can't we go to sleep
now ?"
We both acted on this wise and philosophical advice
of Jack's, and slept for some time with the horses'
bridles in our hands. At last we were awoke by a
tremendous roar, and sprang to our feet expecting to
see a lion at least ready to spring on us. Harry caught
hold of his horse to support himself, and then with my
assistance climbed into his saddle.
As I was mounting we again heard the roar which
had startled us, and to our astonishment our horses

117
did not show the slightest sign of fear or uneasiness.
We waited anxiously to know what could be causing
the terrible sounds, when we saw a flock of ostriches
passing near, and through the dust-laden air looming
like a caravan of camels, and from them we heard the
same sound which had startled us out of our sleep.
The rays of the sun were now struggling through
the dust, and we could make out that he was nearly
setting; and judging from his position where the west
was, we set out, as we supposed, to the south-east, in
the hope of finding our camping-place of the previous
night, where we would be sure of water, and might
perchance in the débris of the camp find something
that might be eatable.
Our horses were thoroughly beaten by the storm,
and in consequence it was only at a foot-pace that we
were able to proceed.
Soon after we started the sun set, and darkness came
on rapidly; but the beautiful stars of the southern
hemisphere shone out overhead, and we thought we
should have no difficulty in maintaining a correct
course by them. We jogged along for some time,
feeling the cold bitterly, and at last we became so chilled
and cramped that we could go on no longer.
We dismounted, and making our horses lie down, we
tried to keep ourselves warm by lying up against their
stomachs, but without avail; so I said to Harry, " Look
here, if we don't move we shall be shrammed to death.
We must get up and trudge on."


## p. 118 (#120) ############################################

KINDLING A FIRE.
"How can I walk, Jack ?"
"Well, you must get on your horse; and I will
walk."
"But I shall be frozen, sitting still on the horse's
back."
"No, you won't; we must move on or we shall die
here."
"Well, all right; get up and help me."
We both got up, and made our horses do the same,
when, as they were rising, we saw that they struck
sparks out of stones which were lying on the ground.
"Hurrah, Jack! we can light a fire; we have our
knives, and with one of these stones here we will get
a light, and then will make a fire. We shall be able
to warm ourselves; and if Mr. Penton, as he is sure
to do, sends people to look for us, they will come to
the fire."
"All right; lie down again and set to work to make
something to catch the spark. The grass and leaves
are as dry as tinder; you crumble some up, and then
make a nest of dry grass and put the powder on it,
and I will strike a spark into it."
After some little search I found a suitable stone,
and having satisfied myself that I could obtain a spark
from it with my knife, I set to work and collected a
quantity of grass and sticks, and having formed a
pretty good pile, I asked Harry how he was getting on
with his tinder.
"Oh, all right; I have made a lot of dry-leaf dust, and


## p. 119 (#121) ############################################

A HEAVY DEW-FALL.
119
I have unravelled some of my shirt to mix with the
grass. Now come and strike."
I was somewhat awkward, and both Harry's and my
own knuckles were barked before we succeeded in light-
ing our tinder. As soon as we saw a spark in the
mass we blew gently, and soon had the satisfaction of
seeing the pile I had prepared well on fire.
We now thought that we had better make ourselves
as comfortable as the circumstances would allow us to
be; and off saddled, and lying down on each side of
the fire, with our saddles as pillows, and allowing our
horses, which we knee-haltered, to graze at their own
will, we took another piece of raw hide to chew for
our supper, and then, having said our prayers, we lay
down to rest as well as we could close by our fire.
The sun was some distance up in the heavens when
we awoke in the morning, cold, wet, and weary. A
heavy dew had fallen while we slept, and wetted us
through; but though this was a great discomfort, it
alleviated, in a great measure, our principal suffering,
which was from thirst; and when we were thoroughly
awake we found that some of the vegetation was so
thickly covered with it that we could actually collect
water in our hats and indulge in the luxury of a drink.
All the dust of the previous day had been converted
into a state of half mud, half dust, by this dew; and
the sky was clear and cloudless, so that we could
easily distinguish our starting-point of the day before,
which lay at no very great distance from us, and in

the direction of which our horses had begun to move.
We called to them, and they came back, and after
much difficulty, from being so stiff, I managed to saddle
them both, and then hoisting Harry on his, mounted
my own, and we rode on as fast as we could.
We had not been riding more than a quarter of an
hour before we saw the smoke of a fire near us, and
riding towards it found all the rest of our party except
Groot Bock. They too had been caught in the dust-
storm, and had been forced to camp out for the night;
but having their ordinary accompaniments of rugs, water-
bottles, etc., with them, they had not suffered as we had.
Groot Bock had started off about two hours before
to look for us; and no anxiety had been felt on our
account until about ten minutes before, when they
remembered that we had left our water-bottles behind
and were unarmed.
Guns were at once fired as a signal to Groot Bock
to return; and he soon came into camp, having found
our spoor at the place we had first left the night before
and traced it up to our fire, and then finding we were
coming in the right direction had hastened to rejoin
the party, and was only a short way off when he heard
the guns fired.
All of us were pretty hungry and dirty, and our
first thoughts were to get to our waggons and have a
good meal, and if possible a wash; and Groot Bock,
placing himself in the front, led off at a slow gallop
across the veldt.

A HEARTY MEAL.
121
When we had gone about five miles Groot Bock
reined up, and after looking eagerly away to his left
turned in that direction, signalling us to follow him.
We all spurred on, and in a quarter of an hour met
Jan van Neeldt with the mules and a supply of food
and drinkables; and we were soon all busy in making
. a hearty meal.
Jan reported that the camp had been formed near a
good pool of water, and the laager had been made so
as to come down to one bank of it. The Hottentots
and Bushmen were still busy cutting bush to complete
it. He had felt some anxiety when we did not arrive
the night before, but had put it down to the dust-
storm, and expected we should turn up all safe in the
course of the day; however, as he knew we had no
provisions, he had come out to meet us with some.
Our meal finished we again mounted, and now tak-
ing Jan as our guide rode briskly into camp.

The camp certainly did credit to Jan's selection and
taste. Close by the pool were some fine trees, which,
being very rare in that district, were all the more
welcome. The tents had been pitched under these,
and the waggons drawn up close by them; and the
side canvas stretched out so that they looked like two
other big tents.
All the boxes had been taken out of the waggons
and arranged under awnings made of the tarpaulins.
so as to form tables and seats; and huts had been built
for a kitchen and the native servants. Round these
was a small fence, to prevent any dogs or cattle coming
in ; outside was another division, in which the Hot-
tentots had made huts, and where the Bushmen had
bivouacked; and a large fence was in progress to sur-
round all the camp, and a space to laager the cattle in
at night.
The snowy tents and waggon tilts contrasted well

DIRT VERSUS CLOTHES.

with the dark foliage of the trees; and the greenness
of the grass on which they stood formed a pleasant
relief to the burnt-up appearance of the surrounding
country.
Washing was the first thing all the English thought
of, though Jan and Groot Bock could not understand
why they took such unnecessary trouble to make
themselves clean, saying that they would be as dirty
again in a few days.
In this one among English travellers agrees with
them, and he also alleges that dirt is a capital substi-
tute for clothing; and to show how thoroughly he
acted up to his opinions, he tells a story of how for three
weeks he thought he had lost a sock, and that after
crossing a river at the end of that time he found it
still on his foot.
I do not know about this being quite accurate, but
I do know that when I was able to wash and keep
myself clean I always found I enjoyed better health,
and was able to do more work, than when for any
reason I was obliged to forego it.
Harry and I, however, first had a look at our friend
Nero, whom we found in his cage close by the waggon
where we had our quarters; and he evidently recog-
nized us, and rubbed his nose up against the bars in
token of welcome.
When we had washed and dressed, Mr. Penton
looked at Harry's ankle, and put some wet rags on it.
There was no serious sprain, and a rest of two or

FUTURE OPERATIONS DISCUSSED.
three days would be quite sufficient to put him all
right again.
A council was now held as to what should be our
proceedings, and the Bushmen were examined as to
the best places to go for game, and how it should be
pursued.
After much discussion it was determined that the
next day we should give the Bushmen an opportunity
of exhibiting their method of stalking ostriches, and
that the day after we should go to a swampy place,
where it was likely we should find rhinoceroses; and
that by that time one of the Bushmen would have
returned with some more men, and a hoopo, or trap for
driving game into, be constructed, when we should
have a specimen of this South African mode of
hunting.
When I had cleaned my gun and saddlery and
looked after Harry's and my own horses, I had time
to turn my attention to him and Nero. I found that
Nero, whom he had taken out of the cage, had de-
cidedly grown, and was more able to walk about than
when we first had captured him; and there could be
no doubt that he actually did know both Harry and
myself.
We now made him a collar and leash, and tied him to
his cage, leaving the door open, so that he could go in
and out as he chose when we were obliged to be away.
The hunt after ostriches was begun very early on
the ensuing morning, and Harry was much disappointed

A GOOD IMITATION.

at not being allowed to accompany us. We rode for
some distance away from camp, accompanied only by
the Bushmen, Groot Bock and Jan going to select a
place for the hoopo, and to commence its construction
with the Hottentots.
We were much afraid that our search for ostriches
would be entirely in vain, and that we should have no
opportunity of witnessing the peculiar skill of the
Bushmen in killing them, when at last one pointed
out some dusky objects moving across the plain a mile
and a half away. Mr. Penton, looking through his
telescope, confirmed the idea that they were ostriches;
and we made our way with all speed to a clump of
trees, where we could have shelter from the sun and
view the proceedings without being seen ourselves.
We picketed our horses and sat down under a
shady thorn, whilst the Bushmen prepared for their
performances. Out of a bundle carried by one of the
women they brought three pieces of wood, carved so
as to imitate the head and neck of an ostrich, and
these three of the men tied on the napes of their necks,
so that when they stooped forward they stood upright;
and then they covered their heads and necks with
ostrich skins and feathers, so that when they stooped
forward they formed a very good imitation of the
birds whose destruction they intended to compass.
The arms they used were bows and tiny arrows,
whose points were steeped in a poison made of the
entrails of a caterpillar, called ngao.

OSTRICH SHOOTING.
Thus equipped they made their way out into the
open; and to my great astonishment the ostriches
seemed to pay them little or no attention, though the
difference between the imitation and the Simon Pure
was evident to any one, especially when in motion.
The three false ostriches soon separated, and each by
degrees sidled up to one of the others. As they drew
closer their movements seemed to give rise to some
little suspicion ; but whenever the real birds showed
any sign of fright or trepidation the false ones stood
stock still until they were reassured, and then recom-
menced their approach.
At last they arrived within distance, and then all
three Bushmen shot their arrows simultaneously into
the birds they had selected. One fell dead at once, and
the other two commenced running round and round in
circles and staggering as if they were drunk.
The rest of the ostriches on seeing the curious move-
ments of their companions, instead of making off at
once, seemed resolved to keep up their reputation for
stupidity; for though they moved away a little at first,
their curiosity overcame their caution, and first one and
then another came within range of the poisoned darts,
and fell victims to the deadly aim of the Bushmen.
Although this takes but little time to describe, it
took some time to perform.
The false ostriches now tried another move, which
had been agreed upon before they left the trees where
we were sheltered; and that was, to get beyond the

A STRANGE PRACTICE.

flock of ostriches, and, throwing off their disguise, drive
them down where we were lurking. This they now
did, there being, however, only four for them to drive,
as the whole flock had only consisted in the first place
of nine.
When the birds saw the men and heard them yelling,
they seemed to think of nothing but flight, and com-
menced to run directly in our direction, coming down
on us at the speed of a railway train.
The Bushmen who had remained with us now made
signs for us to quit our cover; and one who spoke a
little broken English made us understand that when
once they had commenced running in this manner
and were thoroughly frightened nothing would turn
them.
"You see, boss, one time ostreedge he plenty got fear
he make run, run all one way."
"What! will nothing turn them ?" said Mr. Penton.
"No; he shut eye and see noting. One time me see
ostreedge mash um head on tree."
"What ! run into a tree ?"
" Yes, boss; he go bang 'gainst tree and mash um
head all in bit. Plenty time they run like be wild, and
one time hit beeste, one time hit horse, suppose boss no
be quick and dodge um."
"Well, there's no time to talk now about this. We
must be ready for them."
"Well, you sabey, boss, what time you see ostreedge
run you no 'tand in um road, or he mash you."

A HERD OF GNUS.
And the Bushman gave vent to a chuckle indicative
of the intense appreciation he had of the fun of seeing
a man run over by an ostrich.
Pickle and Pepper and some of the other dogs were
with us, and when we came out from the trees towards
the line the ostriches were taking they became very
excited, and rushed towards them, barking and yelping;
and one unfortunate which got in the way of one of
the birds received a kick which sent him flying for
twenty feet like a football, and broke several of his
ribs.
The whole of us stood ready with our rifles and fired
as the ostriches passed us, and two more were added to
the morning's bag.
"There, that's a very good bag, my boy," said Major
Brownlow to Mr. Penton. "We had better mount now,
and ride out there where we see that cloud of dust
rising. There will be some game there, if I mistake
not, and it is early to go back to camp yet."
"All right. I wonder what they are. I can't make
out through my glass. They are curious beasts. I can
make out tails like horses, but their heads are like
bullocks."
"Gnus! my word ! let's go after them. I promised
the colonel I'd bring him back a couple of heads and
tails, and I should like some for myself too."
"All right; let's go for them. How's the wind? They
are all feeding now, and we should be able to get within
easy range of them. I had often heard of shooting

at the Cape, but I never believed that the reality would
be anything like what it is."
"Never you fear, though game is not nearly so plenti-
ful now as it used to be. Why, on the other side of
the Zwarte Berg, and even close to Cape Town some
twenty years ago, game used to be so plentiful that
organized shooting parties of all the men that could be
mustered used to go out to slaughter and slay, simply
to prevent all the crops and pastures being destroyed
by the herds of animals that used to come down from
the interior in search of food when there was a drought.
You will see something of the same sort even now, as
you get further north."
"Very well. I think we had better ride up by that
kopje, and then coming out from under its cover we
shall be close to them; and such clumsy-looking beasts
can't have much speed, and even if they are startled
we shall be able to ride them down."
"Don't be too sure. They are said to be faster than
any horse; and when once they are startled they will
travel for twelve or fourteen hours without a check."
Mr. Penton's plan was at once put into operation,
and we cantered away round the kopje he had pointed
out, and coming out from under its cover found our-
selves within about seventy yards of the gnus, who, the
moment they saw us, ceased feeding, threw up their
heads, and after a momentary pause wheeled sharp
round and went off at a pace which quite warranted
what Major Brownlow had said of them.
(29)

A FATAL PAUSE.
.
Though the pause they made was only sufficient to
be noticed, it proved fatal to two of their number, which
were both brought to the ground by the major and
captain, whilst Mr. Penton wounded a third which
lagged somewhat behind the rest of the herd.
"Now, Penton, there's a chance to try the speed of
our horses against a wounded gnu," shouted the major
as he put his spurs into his horse and set him going as
hard as he could.
Bates and Stevens remained behind to skin the two
which had been shot, and the rest of us followed the
major's example.
We seemed to fly over the ground as we urged our
horses to their utmost speed; but the gnus, though
clumsy in appearance, seemed to keep their distance
with the greatest possible ease, and were joined in their
flight by some giraffes and antelopes, which had been
feeding in the direction they took, and it was only by
slow degrees that we gained upon the wounded one.
I suppose we must have ridden some two miles before
we really began to close quickly even on this one; and
Mr. Penton and the major, who were leading, unslung
their rifles to fire on coming up with it, when, without
a moment's warning, it turned sharp round and charged
full at Major Brownlow's horse. The major, who was
an excellent horseman, just managed to pull on one
side, so as to avoid the attack; and the gnu, finding he
had missed, turned almost as quickly and rushed towards
Mr. Penton, and only by a sharp pull round did he

EXCITING SPORT.

avoid being taken in flank, while the gnu again turned
and charged after him.
The sport now became exciting in the extreme, as no
one could fire at the gnu for fear of hitting one of his
companions, and the gnu kept charging at the horses of
all with a most just and accurate impartiality, and we
all had to exercise the utmost caution to avoid being
gored by the sharp horns of the infuriated beast.
At last Captain Smithson's horse, as he was turning
to elude one of the charges, put his foot in a hole and
came down, throwing his rider, who fell heavily, and
being partially stunned, lay for a minute or two mo-
tionless.
The gnu instantly turned to take advantage of his
downfall, and his horns would in another moment have
impaled the prostrate officer if I had not taken a leaf
out of his book and ridden straight at his flank, and as
the chest of my horse came against it, I, my horse, and
the gnu all rolled over together.
I was pitched some yards away, but received little or
no damage beyond a few scratches and bruises, though
if Mr. Penton and the major had not taken advantage
of the gnu being brought to the ground to empty their
rifles into him and put an end to his mortal career, I
should have been in a very dangerous position.
I got on my feet immediately and ran to Captain
Smithson, who was just opening his eyes and wondering
where on earth he was.
The major and Mr. Penton had by this time dis-

mounted, and a hunting-flask was produced, a draught
from which had the effect of enabling the captain to
recover his scattered wits.
All were loud in their praise of my pluck and deci-
sion, as they were pleased to term it; but really I could
lay claim to neither, for my charging the gnu was not
the result of either, but rather of a sort of uncontrollable
influence, though it was certainly most fortunate for
the captain that it took possession of me just when
it did.
We soon stripped the skin off the gnu, and securing
his head and tail, we covered his body with bushes to
keep off birds and hyenas, and then retraced our way
to where we had left Bates and Stevens, who, we
found, had also skinned the two gnus that had been
first shot, and also had packed the best of the meat
into the hides, which they lashed into bundles on the
back of their saddles.
We got back to camp without any further adventure;
and on the way Captain Smithson came to me and
said, " Jack Hooper, my lad, under Providence I owe
my life to you, and come what may you will find that
Herbert Smithson is not ungrateful. I am not a man
of many words, but you will find that I mean what
I say."

I MADE my way at once to see Harry and Nero, and
found them lying down together apparently the best of
friends.
"Well, Harry lad, how's the foot ?"
" All right, Jack. I can scarcely feel any pain, and
the swelling has all gone down; but, hallo! you've
been in the wars yourself. What have you been doing ?"
"Why, what's the matter ?".
"I wish I had a looking-glass for you to see your-
self. Your face is all scratched, and your coat and
breeches are torn in half-a-dozen places, and you don't
seem to walk over comfortably either."
"Oh, I've had a fall; but I shall be all right after a
wash and change. I don't mind the scratches on my
face, for the skin will grow again; but my clothes are
a different matter, for there are no tailors' shops in
these parts, so I must even do my best at patching and
mending."


## p. 136 (#138) ############################################

136
PATCHING AND MENDING.
I soon washed and shifted, and then, after a hearty
meal, I sat down with Harry to my sewing, and told
him all about our morning's sport.
I managed patching my coat and breeches pretty
well, but was much puzzled about my boots, of which I
found that the sole of one had been half ripped from
the uppers, which were also badly torn. I found, after
much trouble and vexation, and trying all sorts of
dodges, that I could make no hand of them, and was
just saying to Harry that I supposed I would soon have
to go barefoot, as I had only one other pair of boots,
when Groot Bock, who used often to come and sit with
us, came to our waggon, and seeing how I was employed
took the boot out of my hand, and looking at it said,
" You will never mend that. You must make a pair of
veldt schoen."
" What are they, and how can I make them ?"
He laughed, and held up a foot which might have
served for a support to an elephant, the size of which
was certainly not diminished by the covering in which
it was encased.
"There they are-veldt schoen. I will teach you how
to make them."
"Many thanks ; let us get on about them at once."
"Softly, I never hurry; but I know where the first
thing you want is, which is a good thick hide," and so
saying he went away and soon returned with a good
square of bullock's hide, and also a piece of dressed
skin, which was beautifully soft and supple.


## p. 137 (#139) ############################################

SHOEMAKING IN THE BUSH.
137
He now made me place my feet on the bullock's hide
and traced a line round them, leaving a space between
it and my foot of over a quarter of an inch. He cut
these figures out and gave them to Harry and myself
to punch holes in all round. He next cut several very
long small strips of hide, and out of the soft dressed
skin other pieces, which I saw at once were intended
for the upper leathers, which he shaped out with
scarcely any measurement of my feet. These he made
fit round the soles, so that the edges were out, and then
laced them closely together with the small thongs, and
in an hour and a half he turned out a pair of clumsy
though serviceable boots, which felt fairly comfortable
notwithstanding there being several spaces in them into
which my feet did not penetrate.
When I complained of this, he said that I must give
up the foolish prejudice we Englanders had in favour
of wearing stockings, and wrap my feet up in rags, which
would be much more comfortable, and that then I need
never have the trouble of taking off my boots except
to put on a new pair.
He now turned his attention to the clothes I had
been mending, and said that in a very short time, if we
were hunting much, I would have nothing to wear if I
still wore English clothes, as the thorns would soon tear
them all to shreds, and I had better make some of skin,
and that the Bushmen who were in camp had several
karosses or dressed skins which they would willingly
sell.


## p. 138 (#140) ############################################

138
BUYING KAROSSES.
He went away, and soon came back with one of the
women, and from her, after considerable chaffering, we
agreed to buy five karosses, three of which Harry and
I intended to make into clothes and two to add to our
bedding.
I had now to go to Mr. Penton to ask him to give me
beads and tobacco out of the store-chest to pay for our
purchases; and when I showed them, and said what
they were for, he and his friends said they must follow
our example.
The Bushwoman and Groot Bock came up, but un-
fortunately before the bargaining commenced she was
allowed to catch a glimpse of the contents of the store-
chest, which seemed equal in value to her untutored
eyes to the mines of Golconda and Potosi, and she in-
stantly increased her prices fivefold.
Luckily Harry had already got the karosses which
we had bought, but the woman went back and demanded
their return, and poured out volleys of angry words
and reproaches framed in the choicest Billingsgate of
the South African Bush. We held her tight to our
bargain, the more especially as Groot Bock told us we
paid her three times more than she would have received
from any trader, and would be perfectly satisfied in an
hour or two. But Mr. Penton and his friends paid dear
for her glimpse of the stores, though Jan and Groot
Bock urged them to defer their purchases for a day or
two, when they would be able to deal for normal prices,
as the idea of the store-chest would have been forgotten.


## p. 139 (#141) ############################################

BUSH CLOTHING.
139
I returned to Harry, after I had paid for the skins,
with thread, beeswax, needles, and scissors which I had
got from our stores, and then under Groot Bock's super-
intendence we ripped up my most dilapidated jacket
and breeches, and using them as a pattern, cut new ones
out of the karosses. We then set to work to sew; but
though the skins had been well softened we found it
very hard work and broke many needles. But we soon
began to be more skilful; and as, following the ex-
ample set in the veldt schoen, we did not mind any
seams showing, we, before we went to bed, had nearly
completed a pair of most necessary garments.
At first we were puzzled what we were to do for
buttons, as they had been forgotten when the store-
chest was stocked; but Groot Bock again came to our
assistance with a camp expedient.
He cut small squares and rounds out of dry hard
hide, and then we drilled two holes in the middle, and,
behold, the most perfect buttons possible, and which
suited the skin clothes much better than any of Euro-
pean manufacture would have done.
In the morning Harry declared his foot to be quite
well, and begged Mr. Penton so hard to be allowed to
accompany the shooting party that he obtained permis-
sion to come with us.
The place where we were to look for the rhinoceroses
was about nine miles from camp, and after early coffee
we started off. On our way we passed the place where
the hoopo was being constructed, and I noticed that the

men were dragging bushes and trees for the fences,
whilst all our oxen were feeding about doing nothing.
I pointed this out to Mr. Penton, who sent Groot Bock,
who was with us on this occasion, to tell Jan to use the
oxen to draw the timber and bushes necessary.
We could see him, as Groot Bock rode up to him and
delivered his message, take off his hat and scratch his
head, and then, turning round suddenly to some men
who were struggling with a large tree, say something
to them, on which they jumped and clapped their
hands, and some at once set off running to where the
cattle were grazing.
After a little more than an hour's ride we came to a
swampy bottom in which there was a good deal of bush,
and in the mud and bush our game was supposed to be
hidden. No one could well walk or ride through the
mud to see if there were any of the beasts lurking in
the bushes, as it was so deep that it would have hampered
their movements considerably, whilst the rhinoceros is
like a pig in the way in which he can get through dirt;
in fact he is nothing but a very big pig with a horn or
two on his snout, and this same horn is nothing more
or less than a conglomeration of bristles, so that it does
not go far to lessen his resemblance to his cousin-ger-
man, the domestic hog.
As we could not go after them ourselves, we had to
have recourse to our dogs, to which animals the rhino-
ceroses have the most deep-rooted aversion and antip-
athy; so all the pack, headed by Pickle and Pepper,

were thrown in, and as Stevens said, it reminded him
of a day by the covert-side in the shires. If it hadn't
been so hot; if there had been fox-hounds instead of
a set of mongrels; if the huntsmen had worn scarlet
coats and top-boots and breeches instead of the most
nondescript garments ; if they were going to ride after
the game instead of shooting it; if we had been going
after a fox instead of a rhinoceros; if they were in En-
gland instead of Africa; in short, if it had been a pack
of fox-hounds being thrown into a spinney or patch of
gorse, they would very much have reminded him of
what they were.
We scattered ourselves round the place so as to be
ready in whatever direction the game might break
cover, and for some little time we waited patiently
without any sign being seen of the presence of the
rhinoceroses; and at last Captain Smithson said he
would go into the swamp and see what the dogs were
about, and instantly put his intention into execution
before Groot Bock could hinder him.
He had not got twenty yards from the edge of the
swamp before his horse got so badly bogged that he
could not move backwards or forwards, and his struggles
to free himself seemed only to cause him to sink deeper
in the mire. Captain Smithson very imprudently got
off, and he, too, found himself unable to move.
Mr. Penton, who had galloped to the place, told us to
knot the hide-ropes we had for picketing our horses
together, and then looking round said that I, as the

lightest, should go into the swamp as far as I could
and then throw the end of the rope to Captain Smith-
son, who could make it fast to his horse, when we could
pull him out of the awkward fix in which he had placed
himself.
I got off my horse, but found that I could only with
difficulty make my way across the quaking surface of
the morass, and until Mr. Penton told me to spring
from clump to clump of rushes I hardly knew how I
was to get on.
When I got near to Captain Smithson I threw him
the rope, and in so doing overbalanced myself and fell
down in the mud and mire; and having loosed my hold
of the rope, I had considerable difficulty in regaining
my footing and getting on to a comparatively sound
piece of ground, from which I made my way back to
terra firma.
Captain Smithson made the rope fast round his
horse's neck, and the other end was made fast to the
girth of Groot Bock's steed, which was the largest and
heaviest of the horses of the party, and the extrication
of the prisoners commenced.

WHILST we were all engaged in this, and not think-
ing much of dogs or rhinoceros, we suddenly heard a
burst of barking, and looking in the direction it came
from, saw a black rhinoceros coming swiftly through
the mud right in the direction of Captain Smithson and
his horse.
We all clapped on the rope to aid in pulling them
out, and we had just made a good start, when one of
the knots slipped, and the part nearest to Captain
Smithson flew back over him and his horse.
We at once tried to get the end from him to join on
to ours, and I went as far as I could towards him with
our part, but he could not in his position throw his end
to me.
Not a moment was to be lost, as the rhinoceros had
evidently taken in the whole position and meant mis-
chief.
Bates and Stevens, assisted by Harry, set to work to

unsaddle the horses, so as to use their girths and stirrup
leathers to lengthen the line, whilst Mr. Penton, the
major, and Groot Bock got their guns ready to fire as
soon as they could get a fair aim at the rhinoceros; but
this was difficult, as the part of the swamp where it
was moving was overgrown with thick vegetation, and
only momentary glimpses could be got of it. At last,
when it was not more than forty yards from the captain
and his horse, Groot Bock threw his ponderous roer to
his shoulder and fired. His bullet evidently took effect,
as the animal stopped for a moment, but then came on
again with increased fury.
At this moment I was able to throw the end of our
line, and was rejoiced to see it caught and firmly knotted
to the piece round his horse's neck by Captain Smith-
son, who gave the signal to haul away again.
This time all the knots held, and he and his horse
were being drawn to the dry ground, when the rhino-
ceros, which had received two bullets from Mr. Penton
and Major Brownlow without in any way checking its
speed, seemed on the point of catching them up before
they could be rescued. No one of his companions dared
fire, as Captain Smithson and his horse completely
masked the animal; but he by a vigorous effort managed
to get his rifle out of its bucket, and shouted to us to
stop hauling and let him fire himself.
His horse was luckily reduced to a state in which it
could not struggle, so he was able to throw himself on
its body and take a steady aim. The rhinoceros was

scarcely seven yards from the muzzle of his rifle when
he fired, and in another moment he would have been
trampled to death or impaled upon its horn.
Fortunately the animal had swerved slightly and let.
him get a sight of its shoulder, for the brain of a rhino-
ceros is so small and his skull so thick that there is a
small chance of a bullet which hits one in the head
doing it any serious damage.
The moment he had fired, and before the smoke had
cleared away, we hauled away again on our line, and
soon had the satisfaction of seeing him standing among
us safe and sound.
The rhinoceros had been severely wounded by his
shot, and had been turned from the direct line, but was
now struggling to land about fifty yards away, and
offering a fair target. Groot Bock with his roer de-
livered a shot which, entering in the fold of skin just
behind the shoulder, penetrated the heart and brought
the animal heavily to the ground.
The dogs had left following this rhinoceros and turned
back into the brake when the firing had commenced,
and we could now hear them giving tongue on the
other side. Saddle and mount was the order of the
day, and Captain Smithson, as his horse, after his
partial strangulation, was not fit for much galloping,
took Bates's, and left him in charge of his own, and of
the carcass of the dead rhinoceros.
When we got round to the other side of the swamp
we saw a sight which must be very rare, and the like of
(29)

A RHINOCEROS DUEL.
which I had never seen before nor since. No fewer
than five rhinoceroses had been driven out on to the
plain, and of these two were very large; indeed Groot
Bock said they were the largest black ones he had ever
seen. These two had evidently had some misunder-
standing, for they were now engaged in a most furious
combat. The other three were smaller ones, and were
making their way leisurely in the direction of another
wallowing-place.
Instinctively, we all drew rein to watch the conflict.
The two huge beasts did not pay the slightest attention
to our presence, but continued their engagement, from
which both had suffered severely when we arrived.
They were when first we saw them at close quarters;
but they soon separated, and stood facing each other,
waiting for an opening to charge. As one turned
so did the other, and the agility displayed by these
apparently clumsy brutes was astonishing.
Time after time did they charge, and inflicted serious
wounds on each other in their blind fury; but they
were so equally matched that for a long time victory
did not seem to incline to either.
At last one gave an opening, and the other charged
fair into its flank, burying its horn up to its root. The
wounded one gave a scream of intense agony and rage
mingled together, which sounded like the howl of some
demoniac, and struggled and wrenched to get free and
turn on its opponent.
"There, Penton," said the major, " those old Roman

emperor fellows never had such a fight as that in their
amphitheatres. Look, that fellow with the horn in him
is getting free. There he is away, and he has wrenched
the other fellow's horn off and got it in his side."
Such was the case—the horn of the one which had
charged had been torn off at the root by the struggles
of the other; but neither seemed to have any idea of
abandoning the struggle.
They again commenced fencing and charging, but
both were evidently getting exhausted by pain and
loss of blood, and their charges became weaker and
feebler. At last the one with the horn gave the other
a shove, which threw him on his side and exposed his
stomach to a thrust.
This opportunity was not neglected, and repeated
stabs were given, the softer skin under the body en-
abling the horn to be easily withdrawn after each
onslaught.
In about five minutes more the prostrate one must
have been dead; but his opponent continued to wreak
his vengeance on his carcass, and would have speedily
reduced it to a shapeless mass if we had not interfered
and attracted his attention by firing at him. As soon
as he felt the bullets he turned and came towards us.
And now ensued a very pretty scene—the rhinoceros
charging the sportsmen, and each man and horse as he
approached apparently waiting to be knocked over, and
then, turning swiftly out of the way, delivering a shot
into the animals flank as he lumbered past.


## p. 150 (#152) ############################################

150
AN ACCIDENT.
It did not take long to despatch this one, and then
we all put our horses into a gallop to follow after the
other three, which were by this time some two miles
away, and trotting along at a good pace as if to get out
of such a fateful neighbourhood.
On coming up, Mr. Penton, Major Brownlow, and
Captain Smithson, each singled out one, and told the
rest of us to ride behind and not interfere unless some
accident took place. These three were all females, and
did not seem so vicious as those we had already de-
spatched near the marsh.
At first the shots fired seemed to have little effect,
but at last the one Captain Smithson was attacking
gave a long grunt and sank down dead. Immediately
afterwards Mr. Penton put a bullet through the spine
of the one he had selected, which had the effect of
paralyzing its hind-quarters and rendering its death
easy of accomplishment. But the one against which
Major Brownlow was directing his efforts seemed now
to have plucked up some of the spirit which had ani-
mated the males; for she turned round to charge him,
and that so suddenly that he, being unable to check
his horse, had to attempt to jump her, but was quite
unable to do so, and he came down a regular crumpling
fall with his horse almost on top of him.
Groot Bock, who had not at all relished being left
out in the cold while any shooting was going on, con-
sidered this an accident which would warrant his inter-
ference, and spurring his horse forward came close up

to the rhinoceros, and, placing the muzzle of his gun
against her shoulder, fired.
The report of the heavy roer was followed immediately
by a grunt from the beast as she sank down on her
knees, and then, turning over on her side, died.
We were all on our feet in an instant to render assist-
ance to the major, who was sitting up in a very dazed
condition and scarcely knowing where he was. Luckily,
he had no bones broken, and was only somewhat shaken
and bruised, and was able, after a pull at his flask, to
mount his horse again, which was in a worse plight
than he, having injured its knees badly in falling.
Groot Bock at once cut off the horns of the dead
beasts, and began to strip off portions of the hides. He
said that with the hide of a rhinoceros one might almost
be independent of iron in the veldt, and that out of those
killed that morning he might select a good stock of
useful pieces.
Our road back to camp, he said, we could easily
follow by our own spoor, and when we got there, if we
sent out the mules he would send all the good parts of
the hide in, and some of the flesh, which he said made
very good pork.
Bates, we found, had nearly skinned the body of the
one first shot, and Captain Smithson's horse had quite
recovered the ill effects of its mud-bath and partial
strangulation.
We soon got into camp, and then, as all the available
men were busy in the construction of the hoopo, I

volunteered to drive the mules to Groot Bock for the
skins and horns of the rhinoceroses, and such of their
meat as he thought fit to send in.
Mr. Penton said he would not allow me to go out in
the veldt alone, and so I had two of the Bushmen
given me to act as guides, called Horoye and Mok-
antse, who, from the respect with which they were
treated by their comrades, were evidently considered
as being of great importance. They seemed to feel no
difficulty in keeping up with me as I trotted along
quietly with the mules, and their eyes were busy the
whole time in searching for marks of game.
Suddenly they stopped, and when I told them to
come on they knelt down and commenced to examine
some footprints on the ground; and as they evidently
seemed anxious that I should see them too, I got off
my horse and looked, and saw that they were the spoor
of a lion, and that they led in the direction that we
were going towards the first rhinoceros.
They expressed signs of great delight, and made
signs to me to show how they would kill it. I was
very doubtful as to whether it would be right for me
to take the mules where there would be danger of
meeting a lion, as I knew Mr. Penton looked forward
to their proving very useful to him; and at the same
time Groot Bock would be expecting the mules, and
might perhaps be in difficulties with this very lion.
I made my doubts known to Horoye in a very im-
perfect manner; but he only laughed, and then shaking

his head he turned out of the line we had been follow-
ing, and pointing to where some vultures were wheeling
in the sky, said, " Groot Bock," and started off at a
good run.
Sure enough, where he pointed to we found Groot
Bock busy with the three small rhinoceroses. When I
told him about the lion, he said I could leave the mules
with him and go with the Bushmen, as, if the lion had
come across the carcass of the rhinoceros, he would most
likely have gorged himself on it and have gone to sleep;
in which case the Bushmen would certainly kill him,
and the way in which they would do it would be worth
seeing.
As they had only the tiny bows and arrows which
they had used the day before in their ostrich hunt, I
felt very doubtful as to their success; but as Groot
Bock insisted that they would kill the lion, and would
not tell me how they would do it, I left the mules with
him and went with Horoye and Mokantse.
When we came near where the first rhinoceros was
lying, Horoye made signs that we were to be as silent
as possible, and asked me to look round and see if I
could find out the whereabouts of the lion. After some
little searching I saw a brownish-yellow mass in the
grass not far from the rhinoceros's carcass, and pointing
it out, Horoye placed his foot on mine, and standing so
for a minute reconnoitred the position.
Getting down, he whispered a few words to Mok-
antse, and then they both went off stealing through

156
BUSHMEN AND LION.
the long grass, of which, just at that spot, there was a
patch about four feet high, and soon the only sign I
had of their whereabouts was the waving of the grass
above them.
In about five minutes I saw them jump to their feet
close to the lion, and Horoye shoot an arrow into him.
The lion at once sprang up with a roar, and was turn-
ing on his assailants, when Mokantse dexterously threw
his skin cloak over his head, so as to blindfold him,
whilst Horoye kept on pouring arrows into him as fast
as he could.
The lion seemed quite puzzled and confused, and
turned and rolled about, trying to free his head from
Mokantse's cloak; but the poison on the arrows soon
took effect, and he began to stagger like a drunken
man. Then as the staggering became more severe, it
was accompanied by a violent shivering and shaking;
and as if to try to counteract this, he planted his four
feet firmly on the ground, as wide apart as he could,
and tried to remain still. This was his last effort; for
in a few more minutes a more violent paroxysm seized
him, and he rolled over on his side dead.
Groot Bock now came with the mules and the spoils
of the other rhinoceroses, to which we speedily added
the horn and such part of the hide of the one left here
as we wanted, and the skin of the lion, which we took
off with the head and paws attached.
On our return to camp, when I told the story of how
the Bushmen killed the lion, it was at first scarcely

credited; but both Jan and Groot Bock said that
expert hunters among the Bushmen often did more
daring things than that, and even speared both lions
and elephants on foot. Horoye said as soon as we
came across any elephants he would be quite willing to
show how it was done; and he and Mokantse went
away perfectly happy with a bunch of green beads, a
dozen leaves of tobacco, and a couple of clay pipes.

ACCEPTABLE NEWS - ROB RESPECTABLY-THE HOOPO--ARRIVAL OF GRIQUAS-
NERO FOLLOWS --BOOK-ENGLISH - PRAYERS -- SHORT-LEGGED FOWLS — NO
TRADER.
Soon after my return to camp, the man who had been
sent to look for other Bushmen came in with twenty
of his fellow-tribesmen, and reported that some Gri-
quas, or half-castes, and their waggons, would arrive
the next day, in the hope of joining in our shooting,
and, no doubt, as Jan said, in the hope also of getting
skins which we might not want.
This news was very acceptable to Mr. Penton, who
thought that possibly among these Griquas he might
find a man who could do rough smith's work, and who
might be induced to accompany him, to do any work
of that kind that might be required on his travels.
In the night, Harry and I, who as usual were sleep-
ing with Nero between us, and Pepper and Pickle keep-
ing watch at the two ends of our annex to the waggon,
were disturbed by a great yelling and screaming right
alongside us; and, jumping up, we found that a Bush
boy of about eleven years old had managed to elude the

159
vigilance of the two dogs, and had crept right up to
our beds in search of any trifles which he might pick
up, and had put his hand right into Nero's mouth, who
had given him a hearty snap, and, though he only had
his milk teeth, had drawn blood.
The intruder was soon caught and his parents sent
for, and he was delivered up to their tender mercies
to be dealt with, as Groot Bock said they would be
sure to punish him well for being found out; and in a
very short time his cries could be heard as he received
summary chastisement, though he tried to excuse him-
self by saying, "Who could be expected to rob people
respectably who slept with a lion in their bed ?"
Order having been once more restored, we all went
to sleep again. Nero, as may be supposed, was made
much of by us for his vigilance, and I went and milked
a cow, so as to be able to give him his bottle as a reward.
We soon all went to sleep again, and with the earliest
symptoms of dawn were all turned out to get on with
the completion of the hoopo.
The hoopo, which is a favourite mode of killing
game among the natives of South Africa, consists of
two long fences in the shape of a very open V. These
fences are sometimes miles long, and increase in height
and thickness as they get nearer to the place where
they join, where a large pit is dug, the edges of which
are protected by logs placed so as to project over the
sides.
All the game in a large tract of country is driven to

160
THE HOOPO.
these fences, and then by them they are guided towards
the pit, into which those that escape the guns, arrows,
and spears of their pursuers fall, until sometimes it
occurs that it becomes so full of victims that some of
their companions are able to escape by passing over
their bodies.
The hoopo, which had been constructed under the
supervision of Jan van Neeldt, was not so big as most,
each of the fences being only a mile in length, and the
pit at the angle about ten feet deep, whilst it was
twenty feet long and fifteen wide.
When we rode to have a look at it, it was found that
the fences were not nearly strong nor high enough near
the pit, and we had to devote the whole of another day
to cutting and hauling bush to strengthen them; and
whilst we were employed in this, Mr. Penton and his
two friends rode round where the men would have to
be stationed to commence the drive.
Harry and I left the men at work about noon, and
came back into camp, as Mr. Penton had told us to
overhaul and clean all his guns and hunting kit, and
to make out lists of his ammunition and stores, and to
find out anything that might possibly be required
whilst we were away in the interior.
This work was interesting to us, and we were very
busy over it when we heard of the arrival of the Gri-
quas, who came with eight waggons and a quantity of
cattle, and were a mixed multitude of men, women, and
children.

GRIQUAS
161
Thinking it would not be wise to show them all our
stores, for fear of exciting their covetousness, I hastened
to close the waggon tilts and tents, and sent to ask the
chief of the party to come and wait under the awnings
we had spread over what we called the dining-room.
An answer was returned that they would prefer making
their laager first, and that then they would come to
pay their respects to our head-man.
Harry and I longed very much to go and have a
look at these people, of whom and their famous chief
Waterboer we had heard a great deal; but we knew
that before we could satisfy our curiosity we should
have to finish the work we were engaged on, and so
we set to work with all our energy to pack everything
away, and put lists of contents on the top of each box,
whilst in a book we entered copies of them, so that at
any moment we could put our hands on anything that
was wanted.
We were just finishing this when we heard Mr. Pen-
ton and the rest come riding into camp, and ran out to
welcome them. Nero, whom we had not been paying
much attention to, as we had been so busy, came for
the first time trotting after us.
We reported what we had done, and gave the store-
book to Mr. Penton, so that he might be able to see
what stores he would require to have sent up after him.
When he had dismounted, he told me to go to the camp
of the Griquas and ask their head-men to come and see
him; and Harry and I ran off, still followed by Nero,

delighted to have the opportunity of gratifying our
curiosity.
On getting into their camp, we were very much
astonished to see all the children, of whom there were
a great many, running away from us as if they were
frightened ; and we could not make out the reason until
one of the men came up. and asked us to send our lion
away, as the children of the Griquas were not accus-
tomed to see them as domestic animals.
Harry had to go back, and I, very much astonished
at the accurate book-English in which I had been
addressed, asked the man who had spoken to me who
was their chief; and he answered me,-
"The people repose their confidence in my guidance,
and I strive not to mislead them."
"Will you be kind enough, then, to come with some
of your people to speak to Mr. Penton, who owns the
waggons you see here? He wants to get some infor-
mation from you."
"I will come to him after worship. It is now the
hour of prayer, and I must conduct the service."
I was very much astonished at this, but afterwards
found out that Waterboer always conducted service
twice a day himself, and the most trusted of his chiefs
followed his example in this, as in many other things.
The waggons had been wheeled up to form a hollow
square, and in this all the Griquas were now assembled ;
and I–I am afraid only out of curiosity—asked per-
mission to attend the service, which was readily granted.

NATIVE RELIGIOUS SERVICE.
163
Going inside the square, we found the men ranged
in order on one side, and the women and children on
the other; and on the entry of my companion, whose
name I found was Samuel, all the people knelt down, the
men uncovering their heads.
Samuel knelt down on a box, which had been placed
in the centre at one end, and gave a long extempor-
aneous prayer; after which he produced a well-worn
pocket Bible, from which he read a chapter, and then
gave a short sermon, in which, with Scriptural language
and much of the sort of exhortation one is accustomed
to think suited to a sermon, he gave some extremely
plain directions as to the conduct of his congregation
whilst they were in qur company, and told them of the
pains and penalties he would inflict if they transgressed
any of his orders.
This being over, he told me that he was ready to
come and see Mr. Penton, and would accompany me at
once.
I was much interested with what I had seen, and
asked my new acquaintance if he and his always lived
in their waggons and were always on the trek. He
said that they moved a great deal, and that the party
which was here now had not settled down for over two
years, as they were in search of a place where they
could live in peace, and not be subject to the exactions
of the Boers; but that most of the Griquas had settled
abodes, only they travelled a great deal, hunting and
trading; and when they did, they, as I then saw, took

their wives, families, and cattle with them, only leaving
a few people behind to prevent any damage being done
to their houses and plantations.
I was amused to see that not only were cattle and
sheep and children brought along with them, but that
there were two or three domestic cats in the laager,
and a quantity of fowls which had remarkably short
legs.
On my remarking this peculiarity in the fowls, my
companion told me that they were much easier to catch
when they had short legs; and as all had to be caught
and put into coops every time they moved, they only
kept such fowls as had very short legs, all long-legged
chanticleers and Dame Partletts being condemned to
the pot.
By this time we had arrived at Mr. Penton's tent,
and Samuel was invited to come in and take a seat.
In answer to the inquiries made of him, he said the
services of all his men, twenty-seven in number, besides
some biggish boys, and their horses, would be placed at
our disposal for the next day's drive into the hoopo,
only stipulating that a certain proportion of the skins
and flesh should be theirs in return; but that as to the
blacksmiths, although he had three or four men that
had been taught by the missionaries, he could give no
answer until the men themselves had been consulted,
and that their wives would have a good deal to say in
the matter.
Mr. Penton offered him some wine or brandy; but he

165
refused, and made a request that no intoxicating liquors
should be given to any of his men, as their chief, Water-
boer, had given an order that his people were to be as
the Rechabites in the matter of wine and strong drink.
He, however, fully appreciated some coffee, and was
delighted with a present of a couple of pounds and some
sugar, and also with some tobacco and pipes.
He, soon after he had gone to his waggons, returned,
bringing with him a quantity of eggs and butter, and
to say that one of his smiths would consider Mr. Pen-
ton's proposal; and offered to barter ivory for coffee,
sugar, and tobacco, and if possible calico, as the women
of the party were in want of dresses.
Mr. Penton had to explain that he was not a trader,
but that, on the contrary, he had the intention of send-
ing for more stores; so that if Samuel would send one
or two of his waggons down for them, he would pay
him well, and Samuel's people could send what ivory
and skins they had down to the nearest trading station
to be sold there; and that if Samuel would agree to
this, he would at once let him have on account all the
stores of which he was not in immediate want.
This arrangement, being mutually advantageous, was
at once agreed to; and it was settled that two of the
Griqua waggons should go down at the same time as
Major Brownlow and Captain Smithson, whose pres-
ence would safeguard the men in charge of them from
any annoyance to which they might be subjected by
the Boers.

EARLY ON FOOT-WILDEBEEST, HARTEBEEST, STEINBOOK-A STRUGGLING MASS
-A SICKENING SIGHT-LEFT IN THEIR MISERY-SCENE OF SLAUGHTER-
ACQUISITIONS TO OUR PARTY.
EARLY next morning all were on foot, horses were
saddled, and every man that could possibly turn out
for the drive of game was on the alert and making
his preparations for the day's sport, and many were
away to their posts long before daylight; indeed, I
believe some of the Bushmen slept out in the veldt in
order to be in time to commence the drive with the
earliest light.
About six o'clock we rode out to the line, which
spread out nearly as far as one could see on either
side, and we could make out that there were many
more men than we had expected engaged in the drive.
As there would be plenty of meat for all, and the more
men there were the better the cordon could be main-
tained, no notice was taken of the presence of these
strangers.
The long line of men swept on slowly and gradually,
the gaps between the men becoming smaller and

167
smaller by degrees. At first we could only see a very
few heads of antelopes and other game, and large
spaces in which there seemed to be nothing; but as the
line advanced they seemed to increase and spring up
from behind rocks and under trees in a most marvellous
and surprising manner.
Wildebeest, hartebeest, steinbock, and lots of other
African-Dutch names came rushing out of Groot Bock's
mouth as he was asked the names of all the different
antelopes which we saw; and at last we were all much
astonished by suddenly seeing a herd of camelopards
among the fugitives, although we could have sworn
that the country had not sufficient cover to conceal
such big beasts. Rhinoceroses, hyenas, and jackals, all
swelled the number of the animals, and the scene at the
pit promised to be one of the wildest confusion.
Soon we could make out that the foremost animals
had reached close to the fences leading to the pit-
fall, and although the fences were here fully twelve
or ten feet high, some of the antelopes escaped by
jumping over them, and others tried to break back
through the line of men.
Tomtoms, bells, guns, and all instruments of noise
were brought into use to frighten the creatures from
this intention ; but some of them persisted, and were
speared or shot, only a very few getting through the
line of beaters.
As they got still closer to the pitfall, they seemed
to be all wedged together in a struggling mass; and Jan

told us that if we wanted to see the scene at the pit,
we must now leave the driving line, and, riding hard,
get through a gap which had been left, so that any
horseman could at any time have an opportunity of
making his way to the back of the fences and pit, so
as to go after any special animals which might get
through.
At the pitfall we found a sort of platform had been
made whence we could see the movements of the game
as they blundered into it, and also have a good view of
the men when the final slaughter took place.
When we arrived the rush into the pit had not com-
menced, but we could see the front of the mass of
animals as they bore down towards certain destruction.
Some wary old gnus seemed to hold back, and made
attempts to get through to the rear, but all in vain; and
soon we could see them being forced to take the fatal
jump by the pressure of those in rear.
It was curious to see how the different animals met
their doom. The gnus, like those above, fought against
being forced into the pitfall, the buffaloes blundered
stolidly on, and many of the antelopes and the zebras
went in headlong and recklessly. Some of the antelopes,
when they found destruction facing them in front and
no escape behind on either side, made most extraor-
dinary bounds to try to get out of the fences, and
several actually alighted on the top of the masses of
thorn-bush which had been piled up to make them.
Others tried to span the yawning mouth of the

pitfall in a single flying leap; but scarcely one suc-
ceeded, the majority striking heavily against the logs
which protected the edges.
The sight was most sickening, and never again since
that day have I taken part in a drive of game, except
when it has been absolutely necessary for the procuring
of food. The giraffes were most piteous in their
struggles to avoid their fate; and after they were
forced into the pit, their long necks stood up above
the mass of other victims, until they were forced down
by more animals coming on top of them.
After a time the pit became so full of carcasses that
the game was able to escape by passing over them, and
even a great rhinoceros which had become entangled
in the mass was able to walk across the mass of quiver-
ing bodies.
Following upon the animals came all the natives,
and bow, spear, and gun were all brought into requi-
sition to slaughter those that would otherwise have
escaped.
At last the scene of slaughter was over, and the
hunters set to work to draw the bodies out of the pit.
Some of the unfortunate brutes, though crushed and
with broken limbs, were not yet dead—the antelopes
which frequented watery places displaying far more
vitality than the others. These unfortunate creatures
the Griquas and Hottentots and Bushmen would have
suffered to continue in their pain, and it required all
the authority and influence of Mr. Penton and his

friends to insure their having their throats cut and
not being left in their misery.
This neglect did not arise out of actual cruelty, but
from apathy and indifference; and even Samuel, who
seemed a most superior man, justified our neglecting
the sufferings of these poor beasts, and inferentially of
all others, by the plea that all beasts were made for
man's use, and that therefore any suffering they under-
went for man's benefit was not to be considered as a
matter of any moment.
The first thing which was to be done after the pit
had been cleared was to skin all the bodies and bring
the skins into camp to dry, for transport to the coast.
As soon as the skins were stripped off and brought
in they were pegged out with the inside upwards, and
all the fat and flesh that adhered to them scraped off.
Other men went in for making dried meat, and innu-
merable small fires were lit, and the meat, cut in strips,
placed on small platforms of sticks, under which the
fires, which were fed with green-wood to cause a smoke,
were made.
The offal and refuse were collected together in several
spots and fire put to them; and though the difficulty of
lighting these fires was great, when once the stuff had
properly caught it blazed up and burned cheerily,
though the smell was sickening.
Mr. Penton went back to camp with us at about four
o'clock, and I could hear from his conversation that he
did not approve of the scene of slaughter we had just

RESULTS OF THE HOOPO.

witnessed, and I was very glad to learn, from what he
said, that there was very small chance of his ever
making another hoopo.
Much meat was brought into camp, and all night
long there was a hideous row from the laughing of
hyenas and the yelling of jackals, which had quickly
assembled to feast on the banquet we had provided
for them; and occasionally the deep roar of a lion
showed that the " king" of the beasts was not above
selecting his meal from the flesh which strewed the
plain.
The results of the hoopo had been so successful that
we had far more meat in our camp than we could
possibly consume, and also that the dried meat would
far exceed all that would be wanted by the Griquas
and ourselves, and so it was decided to send in to the
old Boer, Steindrup, with a letter asking him to send
a couple of waggons to our camp, which would be
loaded up for him with meat, and he was to accept
this as a present, and in return he was asked to store
the skins for us until the two officers began their
journey coastwards.
The day after this hoopo was spent in camp by all,
the horses and men all needing rest, and the work of
drying meat and cleaning hides still continuing.
Among the Griquas was a man who at one time had
been a cook to a merchant at Cape Town, and he came
and asked for the position of cook to our party, which,
as the only cooking we had had done for some time

had been by a Hottentot whom Mr. Penton had en-
gaged as cook on the strength of many certificates, but
who had utterly failed to show the slightest symptoms
of any acquaintance with the art, was eagerly agreed to.
A blacksmith and a carpenter were also found who
were willing to accompany the party, and as both were
married it was agreed that their wives should occupy
the post of washerwomen and clothes-menders to the
party.
Harry and I took advantage also of this day's rest
to get on with our skin clothes, and were delighted in
the evening to be able to show ourselves to Mr. Penton
completely rigged out in bush clothing. He said he
liked our fit-out very much, and made arrangements to
have a similar kit made for himself, well garnished
with pockets.

PHANT- A SAFE DISTANCE-A HEAVY FALL-A SEVERE CUT.
Our time passed away quietly and quickly with shoot-
ing nearly every day, though I was unable to go out
much for some time, as I unfortunately strained my
shoulder in some unexplained manner, and had to lie
up and trust to Harry for a description of the sport.
Left to myself during the long hours that I was
alone, I devoted myself to the education of Nero, who
was rapidly increasing in size and intelligence, and
fortunately remained as docile as when first Harry and
I took charge of him. Indeed, after much trouble he
began to fetch and carry, and great was my delight
when I was able to exhibit him in this accomplish-
ment to Harry on his return from shooting one after-
noon.
When I got well, and was able to ride again, I found
that an expedition was being planned to go after some
elephants which were reported to have been driven into
the neighbourhood, and which, now their leave was

GROOT BOCK RECALLED.
drawing to a close, the two officers were very desirous
of going after.
The Griquas were still camped near us, as there was
a plentiful supply of water and forage for their cattle,
and they intended waiting for the return of the
waggons which had been sent away for stores, before
making any move.
Old Steindrup too had sent his waggons for the
meat and skins; and, much to our regret, Groot Bock
had been recalled on account of the illness of his
mother, and none of his brothers or cousins could be
induced to come and replace him, a story. having got
about that we were going into the unknown country
to the north whence no one who had gone had ever
yet returned.
For the expedition after the elephants there were
the seven English and Jan, with the Griqua cook and
half-a-dozen Hottentots, and the two Bushmen, Horoye
and Mokantse, who were mighty hunters, and had an-
nounced their intention of sticking to Mr. Penton in
all his travels.
For transport we used the mules; but we did not
bother ourselves with tents, as the weather was so fine
that it was much more pleasant to sleep out in the open
than under canvas, so that all we had to carry with us
were a few provisions and some cooking traps.
After three days' riding along the foot of the Zwarte
Berg we began to think that the story of the elephants
was false, and that we should have all our trouble

ELEPHANT-SHOOTING.

for nothing; but that evening, on coming to the place
where we intended to camp, Horoye found some Bush-
men of his own tribe, who told him they had seen the
elephants only a few hours before, and that they would
show us their spoor the first thing in the morning.
Over the fire that night the conversation turned on
elephant-shooting in different places; and Major Brown-
low, who as an ensign had served in Ceylon, told us
how they shot elephants there by going into the thick
elephant-grass and waiting till the elephant, which was
driven towards them, came so close as almost to touch
them, and then to fire at the centre of the forehead, or
saucer, as it is called, where in the Asiatic elephant
there is a small depression and a less thickness in the
wall of the skull, so that there is some chance of a
well-aimed bullet reaching the brain.
If the aim is true, the animal falls dead at once; but
if the hand of the hunter is in the slightest degree un-
steady, or his aim uncertain, he is placed in a position
of great danger, and fatal accidents have often resulted
Jan, who was listening eagerly, said he could not
understand men running such risks as that for amuse-
ment. He said he had shot a good many elephants,
but he had always been mounted and had a lot of dogs
to attract the animal's attention, so that there was not
much danger, and even so he was never mad enough to
venture closer than fifty yards.
"Why, Jan," said the major, "you must waste as
much powder and lead as would buy your elephant,

A WET RIDE.
tusks, carcass, and all; and as for not going close,
Horoye and Mokantse here tell me they will spear an
elephant or shoot it with poisoned arrows."
Jan could not see that. He said it was very well
for Bushmen, but for white men he said the proper
way was to shoot mounted and with dogs.
The major said he would wait and see the next day.
He would commence in the Cape fashion, as he did not
see any use in being foolhardy; but if, as he thought
it most probable, he found that he could approach the
elephants better on foot, he would do so.
We all went to sleep early round the camp-fire, as
we wished to make a start in the morning before dawn.
At four o'clock David the cook woke us and gave
us hot coffee, which was very acceptable; and then we
looked for our horses, which had remained close by,
and seeing their backs were thoroughly dry—a most
necessary precaution to prevent sore backs—we saddled
and mounted, and started off under the guidance of
Horoye's friends.
The heavy dew had wetted all the grass through
which we were riding, and which in places was as high
as the pommels of our saddles, and we soon were as
wet up to our waists as if we had been wading through
a pond; and that our heads and shoulders might not
complain of the preference shown to our legs, every
tree under which we passed bestowed upon us a copious
shower.
In the dim light we had much difficulty in keeping

clear of the thorns and creepers; and the clothes of the
officers, who had not adopted a costume of skins, suf-
fered severely from the wait-a-bits, as a scrubby acacia
is called from its thorns, which are two or three inches
long and recurved like fish-hooks and sharp like needles.
All these discomforts were speedily forgotten when,
as the sun rose over the eastern horizon, we could see
between us and it the dark forms of a herd of elephants.
"One, two, three-five-seven-ten, eleven-yes-
no, thirteen!" cried the major. "Now, Smithson and
Penton, you must win your spurs as elephant-hunters."
The elephants were moving leisurely about near some
trees, flapping themselves with branches, or occasionally
tearing down a soft and tender branch and putting it
in their mouths.
There was no wind, and our approach towards the
elephants was very easy. When about a hundred and
fifty yards off Jan sent the dogs forward, and it was
curious to see how the whole attention of the elephants
was taken up by their apparently despicable foes, and
what ludicrous terror they exhibited when some ven-
turesome cur ran up and snapped at their heels.
We, under Jan's advice, rode up in Indian file, so
that each could halt when he came within distance and
deliver his fire, and then cantering on again give a
chance to the next, till all had fired.
"Well," said the major, "we'll try that for once.
Now, remember, all of you, the shoulder shot is the one.
Aim just at the lower back corner of the brute's ear:

PURSUED.
and all mind I shall try any one by court-martial who
goes a foot behind that.".
So saying, he spurred his horse and rode straight for
the biggest elephant in the herd—a huge bull of at
least twelve feet in height, with enormous tusks; and
at about only fifteen yards (much to Jan's dismay) he
dropped the reins on his horse's neck, and the well-
trained beast at once stood stock still, and the major,
bringing his heavy two-ounce rifle to his shoulder, took
a steady aim and fired.
The bull, who had been apparently trying to shelter
himself from a dog behind a sapling about six inches
in diameter, reeled as he felt the bullet strike him, and
then raising his trunk trumpeted shrilly and turned
in pursuit of the major, who, as he fired, slipped his
rifle into the Namaqua bucket in which he carried it,
and wheeled sharp away to the off-side, and set his
horse going at full speed.
Captain Smithson, who followed the major, having
the elephant come across him, could not manage to get
him enough on his near side to fire with any degree of
comfort or accuracy, and had to spur his horse so as to
attempt to get up alongside the elephant, and try to
fire point-blank into the vulnerable spot when close
alongside.
Jan tore his hair, and shouted and yelled, saying the
mad Englander would be surely killed, and especially
warning Captain Smithson against the danger of ap-
proaching the elephant. These remonstrances he ad-

A HEAVY FALL,

dressed from a safe distance, having pulled up his horse
over a hundred yards from the nearest elephant, and
was from that distance apparently preparing for a
little unexciting and most probably ineffectual target
practice.
Bates and Stevens rode after their masters, whilst
Harry and I followed Mr. Penton, who imitated the
tactics of the major with another large tusker.
He also wounded his, and had to make away at the
top of his speed, and we two boys tried to follow him
to give him another loaded rifle. This was much easier
to say than do, as we had to keep constantly turning
and twisting; and the elephant, although he did not
seem to be exerting himself, kept our horses going at
the top of their speed.
At last one of the turns placed us in the following
position-Mr. Penton straight in front of the elephant,
and about twenty yards away, whilst I was rather less
than that distance behind his right shoulder, and Harry
was just outside me, and all our horses were showing
unequivocal signs of fatigue.
At this moment Mr. Penton's horse put his foot in
a hole and came down on his head, sending his rider
flying some distance over his head. I luckily had my
eyes on Mr. Penton and his horse; and though I had
been told not to shoot, but only to bring up and reload
the guns, as necessary, I thought that this was a moment
when orders might be disregarded, and quick as thought
I brought the gun I was carrying, a double-barrelled

ten-bore fowling-piece, loaded with bullets and a heavy
charge of powder, to my shoulder.
I seemed to come right on the very spot at which
the major had told us to aim, and firing both barrels in
quick succession, I had the intense satisfaction of seeing
the huge beast turn towards me, and as he turned,
cross his legs and tumble down on his side as dead as a
scupper nail.
Harry and I instantly hastened to Mr. Penton's assist-
ance, who we found was considerably shaken and
bruised, and had his gun-stock broken.
His horse was in worse case than he was; for it had
the blood streaming from a severe cut on the upper
part of the outside of the near fore leg, where it had
struck against a sharp stone in falling.
A pull from his flask put Mr. Penton on his feet
again, and then he washed the horse's wound with some
brandy and water, and tearing a sleeve off his shirt,
managed a bandage to keep dirt and flies from getting
into it.
He then told Harry to ride it quietly back into camp,
whilst he took Harry's horse for the remainder of the
day's sport. The smashing of the stock of his rifle he
regarded with stoical indifference, since he had become
acquainted with the marvellous curative powers of raw
hide.

A DARING MANOEUVRE-JACK'S FUTURE-LONG-RANGE FIRING-STOOD LIKE A
ROCK-REELING AND STAGGERING-LION AND BUFFALO FIGHT-COMPLETELY
DISABLED-BUFFALO AND TIGER-FAITHFUL NERO.
WE must now return to Major Brownlow and Captain
Smithson. In a very few minutes the captain managed
to get a shot, and the elephant, which was struck rather
far back, turned on him.
He met Bates as he turned, and was able to change
guns with him; while Stevens, passing behind the ele-
phant, was able to meet the major, and also supply him
with a loaded gun.
Captain Smithson now executed a very daring man-
cuvre. As he was galloping in front of the elephant
he slackened his speed, so that the elephant very nearly
came up to him; then he suddenly wheeled sharp
round to the left and stopped, so that the elephant
passed, near side to near side, at a distance of only a
few feet, and enabled him to plant a bullet in the exact
place pointed out as the deadly spot. He had the satis-
faction of seeing the big animal in a few more steps
pitch heavily forwards, first on its knees, then on its
tusks, and finally roll over on its side.


## p. 186 (#188) ############################################

LONG-RANGE FIRING.
"Well done, Smithson. I'm glad to see you score
over your first elephant. That was a very smart and
plucky thing you did. I see Penton and his boys have
got theirs, and I believe that young Jack Hooper has
had his luck again. I like that boy, and hope Penton
will do something for him after this cruise, as he is too
good to go before the mast in a merchant ship."
"I'll look out for that," said Captain Smithson, "if
Penton doesn't look after him or anything happens to
him. I'll make sure of Jack's future."
I suppose I was not intended to hear the foregoing
conversation; for on our coming up to where the officers
were standing by their elephant, they commenced
chaffing and quizzing me, and if I had not known the
real kindliness of their feelings towards me I might
have felt hurt.
"Now then for some more," said Mr. Penton. "Jan
ard his dogs are puzzling the other elephants. I can't
understand that man. He is a good shot and a good
hunter, and I suppose as brave as inost men; but he
has a funk of elephants, and from what he says nothing
will induce him to trust his carcass closer than fifty
yards to one. I shall stop that long-range firing of his
though; it is only a waste of ammunition, and wounds
and worries the elephants without killing them."
There were still eleven elephants to look after. One
of these had been attacked by Jan with his dogs and
long-range firing, and was showing evident signs of
rage and excitement.


## p. 187 (#189) ############################################

A DARING PROCEEDING.
187
"What a shame!" said the major. "Here, Jack, go
and tell that fellow Jan to stop firing and call off his
dogs. I'm going to shoot that fellow myself."
I rode off to Jan with the major's orders, and that
worthy grumbled at having his sport interfered with,
and said he could not understand what amusement
there was in trying to get killed. His astonishment
increased when he saw that the major had dismounted
and was going towards the elephant, who was evidently
in a very vicious mood, alone and on foot.
I watched anxiously, as did all of us, the outcome of
this daring proceeding, and galloped over to where
Harry was bandaging up Mr. Penton's horse preparatory
to riding it to camp, to ask him what had persuaded
the major to act in what seemed such a foolhardy way.
He said that when they were looking at the wounds
of the elephant shot by Captain Smithson and the
major, it was pointed out by Mr. Penton that the bullet
of the latter was more than a hand-mark behind
the proper spot on the shoulder, and that therefore,
according to his own saying, he ought to be tried by
court-martial; and that he had answered that it had
all happened from this cowardly way of shooting on
horseback, but that if he had been on foot with his
trusty rifle in his hand, the elephant would never have
required him to fire twice; and that, notwithstanding
the remonstrances of his companions, he got off his
horse, and seeing his rifle carefully loaded, started off
after the elephant.


## p. 188 (#190) ############################################

188
A CRITICAL MOMENT.
We watched him carefully as, taking advantage of
every scrap of cover, he made his way towards the left
rear of the elephant, evidently intending to get a good
position for the shoulder shot; but before he could
manage this the elephant made him out and charged
straight at him.
He stood like a rock, waiting the animal's onslaught;
while we, knowing that the forehead shot rarely if ever
succeeds with the African elephant, felt most painfully
nervous on his account, and were utterly powerless to
help him.
He waited till the elephant was about twelve yards
from him, and then fired. The elephant seemed to still
come on, but to be blinded and confused; and the major,
jumping to one side, managed with his second barrel
to put a bullet behind the elephant's shoulder. The
elephant ran on about twenty yards, and then came
down, all in a heap, with a heavy crash. We rode up
to the major, and congratulated him on his escape and
success; and he owned that for a moment or two, when
the elephant was charging him, he had almost expected
to be trampled on and crushed, but that he had seen that
if he tried to bolt there would have been no chance for
him, and that the best thing he could do was to stand
firm and try the effect of a shot at the forehead, which
might check the elephant sufficiently to give him a
chance to jump on one side and get a shoulder shot.
"And, you see," said he, "I succeeded, though I own
I should not like to run the same risk again, and would

sooner try these African elephants from a horse's back,
though, when they are not disturbed or rendered vicious,
I do not think there would be any difficulty or danger
in stalking or shooting one on foot. But now we are
wasting time; let us go after the others."
We all rode after the rest of the herd, which had got
some distance away. But on the way we saw first one
and then another reeling and staggering and turning
about, and generally acting very funnily, and one, just
before we came up, fell down; whilst out of the grass
close by appeared our friend Horoye, who made signs
that he had shot it with his poisoned arrows, and count-
ing on his fingers made us understand that he and
Mokantse had shot six.
"That rather takes the shine out of us, Brownlow,"
said Mr. Penton. "Here we are, seven English, well
mounted and armed, to say nothing of Jan and his
dogs, and two naked savages with bows and arrows
kill two elephants to our one."
"Yes, that's true; and it makes me ashamed of my-
self swaggering about shooting on foot."
We soon after this caught up the other elephants;
but finding that they had very small tusks, we did not
shoot them, but let them pursue the even tenor of their
way, undisturbed by bullets or other missiles.
We left Horoye and Mokantse to cut the tusks out
of the elephants that had been killed, and to bush the
carcasses over to keep the hyenas away, and rode back
towards the camp, very well pleased with our first day's

experience of elephant-shooting. The only person who
looked at all put out was Jan, who did not at all relish
a short homily the major preached him on the sinful-
ness of giving unnecessary pain to any animal.
As we were riding along quietly we saw a great com-
motion going on in some high grass a little way off on
our right, and on going to see what it was, we found a
battle royal going on between a buffalo cow and a lion.
The lion had evidently attempted to make off with
the cow's calf, which was standing a short distance from
the combatants tremblingly watching the continuance
of the fight, and bleeding from some severe scratches
on its haunch.
The buffalo cow, too, had been severely torn; but it
seemed as if the lion was having the worst of it if any-
thing, as he had the marks of his antagonist's horns
plainly showing on his flanks, and only moved with
difficulty.
We drew up and sat for some time as spectators of
this strange fight. The lion always attempted to get
round to the flank of the buffalo, and the latter kept
wheeling round, so as to present her horns to the lion.
Occasionally one or the other scored a blow, but they
seemed fairly matched.
At last the lion, by one severe blow which he made
at the buffalo's shoulder, seemed to turn the balance in
his favour, though both seemed to be getting very ex-
hausted.
At last the buffalo came down on her knees, and the

lion, taking advantage of it, made a spring at her
directly in front. This move of his was fatal, for the
buffalo, recovering herself, received him on her horns
and ripped his belly open. As the lion fell back she
again and again gored him, and in a few minutes she
completely disabled him, and left him weltering in his.
blood, whilst she went off to look after her calf.
Jan wanted to shoot both mother and calf, but was
not allowed, though he was told he could put the lion
out of his misery, which he did with many exclamations
about the curious ways of the English.
Mr. Penton said, "Well, I would never have believed
that a buffalo, single-handed, could beat a lion.—What
do you say, Brownlow ?"
"I don't know. I believe a tiger to be far more
powerful than any lion, and as plucky if not more
plucky than most; and I have heard of instances, though
I have never come across one myself, in which a buffalo
has beaten a tiger; and I believe in the wild-beast
fights which some of the Indian princes have a tiger and
a buffalo are frequently matched."
"Yes," said Captain Smithson. "I went to Hyderabad
once, and the Nizam had a big function* while I was
there, and amongst other shows was a wild-beast fight,
and, as you say, a buffalo and a tiger were matched one
against the other, and this not only once, but three or
four times, and only in one instance did the tiger gain
the victory. But then the buffaloes were specially

selected. I certainly would have given odds on the
lion here in the open."
The lion's skin was so torn and messed by its struggle
that it was not worth taking, so we contented ourselves
with the claws—the major giving Jan a couple of dollars
for them, as he said there were lots of young ladies at
the Cape who would be very glad of them for bracelets
and brooches.
We soon after got into camp, and there we found a
fresh arrival. Nero, who had been left behind with
the waggons, had followed us up, and had come into
our camp and laid himself down on my bed, from which
he would allow no one to dislodge him, and the moment
he saw me he evinced the wildest signs of delight.
On examination we found that he had gnawed through
the thong which secured him to his cage. This sign
of faithfulness on his part was most gratifying to us,
and we made a greater pet of him than we had ever
done before.

Next day we started, leaving Horoye to bring in the
ivory with his friends, to go back to our big camp; and
Nero followed us very well on the road, though we
had at times to carry him, as we travelled pretty fast,
the leave of the major and Captain Smithson being
nearly up.
The second day we sighted a herd of giraffes, and as
the flesh is remarkably good, and we knew that what
we left would be useful to the Bushmen with the ivory,
we rode after them. They saw us some distance away,
and commenced moving off, and we had a smart gallop
after them, and were very much astonished by seeing
one fall down dead as he was moving. We shot two
more, and then pulled up, and came to see into the
mystery of this sudden death.
The animal was very fat, and in good condition,
and skin, mouth, and everything looked healthy. We

and found his chest full of blood, he having burst one
of the vessels of the heart.
The meat that we wanted for that night was taken,
with their hides, which make most beautiful leather,
and put on the mules. The remainder we hung up to
some mimosas, so as to be out of the reach of jackals
and hyenas, and bushed over to keep the birds of prey
away; and then we planted near a stick with a piece
of rag on top, feeling perfectly sure that such a sign
would not escape the sharp eyes of our Bushmen, who
would be coming after us with our ivory.
We reached our camp again all safely, and found
there that the waggons sent away by the Griquas had
not returned, but that some men had come in that
morning who reported that they had left them at the
other side of the Zwarte Berg, and that with them were
the two new waggons of Mr. Penton and one of Stein-
drup's, which was coming to fetch the baggage of the
two officers.
"What do you want two more waggons for, Pen-
ton ?" asked the major. "You have two now for your-
self and the two boys, and can't want more."
"Never you mind; I want them to carry my stores."
"Your stores! Why, you are not going to trade,
are you? You are as rich as Crcesus, and can't want
money."
"No, I'm not going to trade; I'm only going to push
on as far north as I can, and then to turn towards either
coast."

"READY, AYE READY!".

"Why, man, you must be mad. There is no road
much beyond the Orange River. You will be killed and
eaten."
"No, I shan't. I have heard from Samuel that there is
a road to the north; and that though there may be some
difficulty, I shall be able to get up a good distance, and
then turning east or west, as the case may be, make my
way to the coast in the Portuguese settlements. I have
ordered my yacht home to be laid up, and do not mind
if I devote a couple of years to travelling. Perhaps
then I may be able to face English society with some
degree of composure."
"You may do what you like; but you ought to have
asked the two boys whether they are willing to accom-
pany you. Your having picked them up at sea does not
give you the right to dispose of them body and soul."
"Oh, I'm sure they will come. I know the stuff
they're made of; and they would go to the North Pole
or into the mouth of a volcano, with me or any one else,
if they thought there was anything adventurous in it.
-Here, Jack.—Harry, come here. The major says I
ought to consult you before I settle on my plans. Now
I want to know whether you are ready to come with
me."
"Certainly, sir. We are ready to go anywhere with
you."
"What! without knowing where I am going ?"
"Yes, without knowing where you are going."
"Very good. We are going north, and there will be

A GOOD IDEA.
four waggons : one I will look after; one will be under
your orders, Jack; one under Harry's; and Jan will
have to be in charge of the other. Will you man-
age it?"
"Certainly, sir. Harry and I will be delighted."
When we got away by ourselves, Harry and I had
a long talk over our future. With the idea of being in
charge of a waggon we were delighted; but as to what
the journey would turn out we had no idea. The shoot-
ing and hunting we had had since crossing the Zwarte
Berg we had thoroughly enjoyed; and we supposed
that much of what lay before us would be also of the
nature of a magnified and glorified picnic.
But again, we had heard stories of want of water,
and thirst, of deaths of cattle and horses, and hardships
of all sorts; and after much arguing between ourselves,
we thought that perhaps the wisest thing we could do
would be to go and see Samuel, who might be able to
tell us something of what lay before us.
We found Samuel sitting in front of his waggon, the
space round which the waggons were drawn up having
by this time assumed the appearance of a farm-yard.
Cows and their calves, horses, sheep, and hens and
chickens were moving about at their ease, and a number
of scantily-clad boys and girls were romping and play-
ing. The women were cooking and sewing, and the
men who were in camp were mostly busy about the
thousand and one small jobs which a life in waggons
entails.

SAMUEL CONSULTED.
197
Samuel, as soon as he saw us, got up and offered us
some milk to drink; which we gladly accepted, as,
though we had cows, their milking was much neglected,
and we often found that there was no more than suffi-
cient for our tea and coffee.
We immediately opened out our hearts to him on
the projected journey, and he told us all he could.
He said, as far as the Kalahari Desert all would be
comparatively plain sailing, but that crossing that
would in the dry season be a very perilous undertak-
ing, on account of the scarcity of water; and that fol-
lowing up the fertile and watered country to the east
of it, we were likely to meet with opposition from some
of the natives after we had passed through the Bak-
wains, as a tribe of the Bechuanas we would encounter
were called ; and that among the Matabele Kafirs some-
times, if we unfortunately encountered any hostilities
on the part of the chiefs, we might find the wells
poisoned.
The opposition to our advance, he said, would arise
from the fear of the tribes on this line that we might
get through to the tribes behind, with whom they now
possessed the monopoly of trade, and from whose
countries they obtained the principal part of the ivory
sent to the Cape; but that he thought that with proper
management they might be passed by without any great
difficulty on that account.
More serious than the opposition of the natives, in
his opinion, were the difficulties of the climate and

PREPARING FOR A JOURNEY.
country. In some places, at certain seasons, there was
great scarcity of water, and we should have to rely on
roots and water-melons for our supplies; and that in
other places the horses were attacked by an illness of
which nearly all died, and in others there was a fly
whose bite was fatal to horses, bullocks, cows, and
sheep, and that in consequence we should have great
difficulty about our transport.
All these things took a great deal of gilt off the
ginger-bread, but Harry and I thought that the novelty
and excitement of the journey more than counterbal-
anced all the difficulties and drawbacks, and were all
anxiety for the arrival of the new waggons and our
departure northwards. Nor had we long to wait, for
the next day we saw them all coming into camp.
The major and captain had still a few days before
it was absolutely necessary for them to return to their
regiment, and they determined to devote their time to
assisting in the arrangement of our waggons for the
journey before us, and in seeing everything in thorough
order.
The first thing we did was to clear the waggons
completely out, and examine every piece of iron and
woodwork, and see that no flaws or strains existed
anywhere.
When the waggons were seen to be in thoroughly
good order, we fitted on the top of the sides two planks
nine inches wide and running the whole length, which
were hinged together, so that they could be put up or

down at will, and would when up form a protection
against bullets, spears, and arrows.
The tilts were next seen to, and the tops of them
painted white, whilst at a foot underneath was fitted
a second awning of thick white cotton canvas, so that
we should be thoroughly protected against the sun's
rays, and the current of air that would pass between
the two roofs would insure coolness and ventilation.
Along the centre of the floor of the waggons we had
a line of water-casks, which were securely lashed in
their places, and would serve both to carry water when
we came to any arid tracts, and also when emptied of
water would help to float the waggons when crossing
any big streams. The sides and ends were then stowed
with bales of calico and cloth, and in the hinder part
of each waggon was then placed a proportion of the
ammunition of the party.
Boxes were fitted under the driving seats, in which
were stowed our personal effects and mess traps. In
each waggon were reserve kits for the whole party, and
a set of carpenter's and smith's tools, so that any one of
them on a pinch might serve as the means of transport
and a refuge for all.
Cowries, beads, and some other valuable small stores,
were stowed in boxes which lay alongside the water-
casks, and on top of which our beds could be spread.
Spare canvas, rope, hide ropes, nails, forge, tar, tallow
candles, soap, bacon, hams, tea, sugar, tobacco, needles,
thread, and all the things which might be found neces-

STRANGE NICKNAMES.
sary in the wild, and which could not be obtained when
once we were away from civilization, had to be got into
the waggons, and so stowed that one could put one's
hand on them at a moment's notice.
The wheels, disselbooms, and axles were all strength-
ened with iron bands and service of raw hide, and, in
short, everything was done which ingenuity could sug-
gest to prevent accident or damage, and if they did
arrive, to provide for their immediate remedy.
Captain Smithson, indeed, suggested that we were
taking too much, and that many of the things we were
loading in the waggons would only prove an encum-
brance; but Mr. Penton argued that it was much better
to have too much than too little, and it would be per-
fectly easy to throw anything away if we found it an
encumbrance, whilst, as there were no shops in the
veldt, we could not buy anything which we did not
take with us.
We were equally well supplied with animals, having
two teams of sixteen bullocks for each waggon, each
team having its two Hottentot drivers, and besides that
another boy to grease the wheels, look after the tilts, and
generally do all small jobs connected with the waggon.
My boys were called by nicknames given them at
the Cape. The two principal drivers were called Africa
and Nubia; and their subordinates, who walked at the
head of the team, Gog and Magog; and the handy boy
Green Boy; and those belonging to the other waggons
were named in the same absurd fashion.


## p. 201 (#203) ############################################

A STRONG PARTY.
201
Then we had our Griqua cook David, the blacksmith
Moses, the carpenter Elias, and the original Hottentot
cook Timothy, who had been degraded to cook's mate,
in which capacity David found him very useful.
To attend to the horses, of which we now had nine,
there were five more Hottentots, and two for the mules ;
and Mr. Penton had one as a private servant, who had
more brains than most of his confrères, and was digni-
fied by the name of Skipper.
We had also two boys to look after the cows and
fowls, of the former of which we kept six of the best
milkers; so that with Mr. Penton, Jan, Harry, and
myself, we mustered thirty-six, with one hundred and
twenty-eight bullocks, nine horses, four mules, and six
cows. There were also a dozen dogs; and Horoye and
Mokantse, with some of their countrymen and women,
said they would follow us at all events as far as the
Orange River; so that we had a large party, and when
we formed up one day to arrange our order of march-
ing, we made a big show.
We were all well armed, as in each waggon there
were two double-barrelled ten-bore guns, and a two-
grooved two-ounce rifle, and two pair of heavy pistols;
and all our Griquas and Hottentots were armed with
flint-lock tower muskets. Mr. Penton had in addition
a favourite fourteen-bore by Joe Manton, and Captain
Smithson gave me a twelve by Lang, whilst Major
Brownlow, that Harry might not be worse off, gave
him a fourteen by the same maker; and Jan carried

THE FAREWELL.
and trusted in the favourite arm of the Boer, a roer
or elephant-gun, which bore a close resemblance to the
punt guns used in shooting wild fowl; and amongst our
trading stores we had five cases each containing twelve
flint muskets.
All our preparations being made, we said farewell to
our friends and companions; Bates and Stevens, as well
as their masters, promising always to stand friends to
Harry and myself if we should ever meet again; and
Captain Smithson, giving me his father's address in
England, told me that I might always reckon on a
warm welcome if I chose to go there and make myself
known to his people when I got home.
The two officers turned south, to re-cross the Zwarte
Berg; and we, with all our followers, turned north to
make our way across the Orange River into the
Bechuana country, where Mr. Penton said he would
decide on his future proceedings.

THE MARCH NORTHWARDS-RIDING BULLOCKS-SHOOTING OX-A KITTLE ANIMAL
- PANAMA — JAN GROWLINGA SWIRLING TORRENT-RAIN CEASES-NERO
AND THE OX-A FAILURE.
OUR march northwards was for some time uneventful
and easy. We had a good deal of shooting; and Nero,
who was rapidly increasing in size and strength, showed
great intelligence, and fully appreciated going out
hunting with us, and often proved himself most useful
in securirg wounded game.
Mr. Penton now said he was very glad he had
allowed Harry and me to keep him, but said that we
must watch him very carefully, and check the slightest
symptoms of insubordination.
Our route after crossing the Karroo plains took us
over the Nieuwveld Mountains, and then we followed
up the affluents of the Orange River till we came upon
that river where it formed the boundary to Griqualand.
On our way we met several parties of hunters and
traders, and we always kept up our stock of ammuni-
tion by disposing of the skins and ivory we obtained
in shooting to them.


## p. 204 (#206) ############################################

204
A DIFFICULTY.
On the road we also prepared for the loss of any of
our horses by picking out bullocks and training them
for riding; but we found them very hard to break in
and manage, though in one respect they proved most
admirable. Not one of them was in the least gun-shy,
and we could fire from their backs as comfortably as
if standing on terra firma.
Our greatest difficulty was to guide them, and for
some time we were very much puzzled as to how to do
this. The peg through the cartilage of their nostrils, to
which a thong was made fast, was useful to check them
by, and when they were turned out to graze the ends
were made fast round their horns, and the thong then
served to catch them by. Harry thought he would
steer them like a boat by making rheims (leather thongs)
fast to the tips of their horns and using them like the
yoke-lines; but though by strenuous hauling he might
get the animal's head hard-a-port or hard-a-starboard,
he could not make the body and legs to answer to the
helm.
One day I was not very well, and remained lying
down in my waggon instead of riding, and amused
myself by reading a book of anecdotes of travel, and in
it I found a description of a shooting ox in Central
America which turned to every motion of its master's
hand, who did not mount it, but used it as a screen in
stalking deer.
The instant I saw this I thought that the problem
of steering our riding oxen was solved, and I eagerly

TRAINING A SHOOTING OX.
205
looked to see if I could find a description of how this
one was trained.
At the end of the paper this was explained. First
of all it showed how the ox was rendered perfectly
docile and amenable by kind and gentle treatment; and
this was a task requiring care, time, and patience,
because in selecting a shooting ox one with some
temper and spirit was always chosen, as they were
much more intelligent than quiet, sleepy animals.
When it began to know its master well he began
tapping on its horns until they became quite loose
and tender, when naturally it always swerved away
from the one that was touched. The ox was always
encouraged to do this, and at last would turn on a
mere sign. The horns when they were left alone soon
became firm again, and the pain and inflammation
ceased; but the ox did not forget its lesson, and soon
would turn and twist in answer to sign or tap as
quickly and deftly as a circus horse.
I called Green Boy, and told him to go to Mr. Penton
and ask him to come to me.
He soon came, but said he thought I had better get
out and ride if I wanted to speak to him, as he thought
it would do me much more good than lying in a jolting,
creaking waggon.
I followed his advice, and whether it was the fresh
air, or that my head was full of what I considered to
be my discovery, I soon felt better, and eagerly told
him what I had read.

AN EXPERIMENT.
"All right, Jack, my boy, I will be very glad to let
you try your hand; but remember that a man with a
cool head is necessary in all these matters, for your
young ox is a kittle animal to manage."
"All right, sir; I'll be very cool and careful. There
is the ox I have been trying to break in. I think he
will do; but I suppose the first thing will be to separate
him from the rest."
"Yes, you had better do that. You should make
him travel at the rear of the waggon in the day time,
and at night you should keep him tethered. It will be
troublesome work, and if you are not very careful you
may come to grief over it."
I called for Green Boy, and told him to go and get
my ox, which was travelling with the spare teams, and
bring him down to make fast to the tail of my waggon,
where Nero was walking contentedly along in company
with Pickle and Pepper.
When we out-spanned and made our laager that
evening, Harry and I set to work to try our hand on
the ox, whom we called Panama, and after much con-
sultation we came to the conclusion that we should
first make a pet of him; and we set to work to fondle
him and groom him like a horse—an attention which he
seemed thoroughly to appreciate, especially when we
pulled out the great Bush ticks, which are a regular
plague of the cattle in wild travel in Africa, whilst we
were curry.combing and brushing him and getting out
large quantities of hair.


## p. 207 (#209) ############################################

MAKING BLANKETS FOR AN OX.
207
As we did so Mr. Penton came to see what we were
doing, and said, "He may thank you for that now, but
he won't at night when it is cold, unless you give him
a rug. You had better get out a bale of blankets and
fit one now before night. There are some spare girths
and rolls of webbing in a package in your waggon.
Now you must see how you remember the stowage you
have made."
I went at once to a little book in which I had written
down all the different bales and boxes and their con-
tents, and where they had been placed in the waggon,
and with the aid of the men belonging to my waggon
I soon found what was wanted, and with Harry set to
work to cut and fit the blanket so as to make clothing
for Panama.
We found that there was a great deal of sewing
required to make the blanket into the necessary shape
and put on buckles and straps, so we asked if Jan could
not help us, and Mr. Penton at once said that he should.
Harry went to his waggon to tell him and ask him to
come, which he did after some delay, and when he did
arrive began growling very much about having to assist
in the foolishness of English boys. He had his own
waggon to look after, and he did not see why he should
have to help us, or what was the use of putting blankets
on an ox.
Whilst he was going on like this, Mr. Penton came
to see how we were getting on, and to help us himself,
and heard what Jan was saying. He told him at once


## p. 208 (#210) ############################################

208
TROUBLE WITH JAN.
that he was his servant, and had to obey orders; that
he had noticed for some time he was not doing his
work cheerfully or well, and that if he did not improve
he would discharge him when we got to the Orange
River, or if we met any parties of Boers.
Jan said he did not mean anything, but that he was
tired, and had not thought of what he said, and promised
that he would give satisfaction in future.
The trouble with him thus passed over for the time,
but ever after he showed a sulky and unobliging tem-
per, and never looked properly after his share of work
in the camp, entailing much extra labour and fatigue
on Harry and myself.
We managed to make the blanket fit to put on
Panama that night, and next day Harry and I travelled
in my waggon and worked at it, so that it was finished
by the time we got into camp.
As we drew near to the Orange River we had to cross
several of its affluents. These were mostly nearly dry
river-beds with pools of water, and we had not much
difficulty, except in lowering the waggons down the
banks and hauling them up again, which the large
amount of ox power at our disposal enabled us to do
easily enough; but now we came to one, and camped
unfortunately on the near bank, intending to cross the
next morning.
During the night it rained heavily, and when we
woke in the morning we found that what had been the
evening before a dry and sandy channel was now filled

with a swirling torrent of muddy yellow water. The
rain was still falling, and there was no prospect of the
floods subsiding, but rather a fear of their increasing,
and we had to march up its banks in search of a place
where there was a ford, or where the current was suffi-
ciently tranquil to enable us to float the waggons across
and swim the animals over.
We trekked some way up the banks of the stream,
the ground being rendered soft and muddy by the rain,
and making us glad to use all our oxen to haul the
waggons, which from their heavy loads sank deep in
the mire, and we had much difficulty in crossing small
affluents of the main stream.
We marched for six hours, and then all the animals
being thoroughly tired, we laagered for the night.
The next morning the rain still continued, and we,
after much consideration, came to the conclusion that
it would be best to remain encamped there and send
out to look for a ford. Harry and I therefore got our
horses, and with Green Boy and Africa, who were
mounted to accompany us, rode out to examine the
banks of the stream—Jan, whose duty it should have
been, declaring that he was too ill to go out in the rain,
having a bad attack of fever and ague, although he did
not seem very bad, and had a very good appetite.
We had a long and most unpleasant ride, and follow-
ing up the stream found that there was no crossing-
place until we had passed a fall of some height, and
that to get above it we should have to go up a very

TRAINING PANAMA.
hilly and difficult bit of road, which in the then state
of the country could only be surmounted with great
difficulty, and at the risk of injuring both oxen and
waggons.
When we returned with our report the rain had
ceased, and Horoye, who knew the country, told us
that the stream would go down nearly as quickly as it
had risen, and that if we waited a couple of days where
we were we should be able to get across.
Mr. Penton therefore decided on waiting, and the
weather setting in fine, he and Harry went out shoot-
ing, whilst I remained in camp to train Panama, and
also to try to teach Nero some tricks.
I first of all turned my attention to Panama, and
thinking I had made him sufficiently attached to me
to commence the Central American training, I got close
to his shoulder, and commenced tapping his horn with
a small stick, and for some time he seemed to take
little or no notice, so, as in my book the size of the
stick was not laid down, I went and got one slightly
heavier, and again went on tapping.
After about five minutes he began to get restless and
turn and twist about, and I hoped that the lesson was
progressing; but he often turned to the right when I
wished him to turn to the left, and vice versa, and I
am afraid my patience did not hold out, for once when
he turned the wrong way I hit him rather smartly,
when he at once and decisively showed that although
he had been named Panama, he did not approve of

Central American training, for he turned sharp on me
and tried to gore me.
I made a spring and escaped him, and tried to make
for the waggon; but he pressed me close, and there is
no doubt would have injured me severely, had not Nero,
who had been attentively watching the proceedings,
sprung on his shoulders and diverted his attention
from me.
As I did not want to have either my ox or my lion
injured, I had now to think how they could be sepa-
rated. Calling Africa, Nubia, and the other waggon
boys, I got a long rope with a running noose, which we
rove through a block lashed to one of the wheels of
my waggon, and watching our chance we slipped it
over one of Panama's hind legs, and then all clapped
on the end and ran him back to the waggon wheel.
He was now easily secured with a noose at the end of a
pole, which we kept for holding our milking cows by
the horns, and it only remained to make Nero leave
him alone.
I am sorry to say that Nero at first did not obey me,
and I was about to chastise him, when he seemed sud-
denly to become quite quiet, and came running to me
to lick my hand and rub up against me to express his
pleasure at my safety.
I, now Panama was secured, went and groomed and
cleaned him, and spoke to him kindly, and at last had
the pleasure of finding he again regarded me with
kindly feelings, and that I was able to let him loose,

A RELUCTANT CONFESSION.
notwithstanding Nero's loudly expressed disapproval;
and there was some little difficulty in preventing an-
other fight between them, in which Nero, notwith-
standing that he was growing very rapidly, would very
probably have come off decidedly second best.
I have since heard that the nerves at the base of the
horns of an ox are most exquisitely sensitive, and there
can be no doubt that in my attempt at training I put
him to very great pain, and that he did not turn on me
until I had almost driven him wild.
When Mr. Penton and Harry returned into camp I
had to confess my failure, and Harry was rather in-
clined to chaff me and pay me out for having laughed
at his yoke-lines; but Mr. Penton was much more con-
siderate, and said that we could not always command
success, and that if I had not succeeded in this I had
in many other things which I had attempted.

NEXT morning Horoye was proved to be right, and the
water had gone down sufficiently to enable us to cross
without danger, and we got all across without any
harm, except the water getting up into the waggons
and wetting some of the stores, which obliged us to
halt for another day to dry them.
During the night I heard a great deal of noise
amongst the men, and getting up to see what the
matter was, found that several of them were drunk.
I went and called Mr. Penton at once, and he called
up all the sober men, and took their arms away from
the drunken men. He sent Harry to call Jan to assist,
but he returned saying that he too was drunk and
insensible. Mr. Penton at once went to Jan's waggon,
and found it as Harry had reported, and that a keg of
rum which was in the waggon had been broached, and
nearly all was gone.
At ten in the morning an investigation was held into

the night's occurrences, and it was found that Jan had
given the rum to the men who had got drunk the
night before; and some of them also confessed that he
had tried to induce them to promise that after we had
crossed the Orange River they would aid him in per-
suading Mr. Penton to turn to the eastward and march.
to the north of the Vaal River, where some Boers had
lately settled, and that when there the waggons and
their contents could be easily appropriated, and charges,
which would be eagerly listened to by the Boers, made
against Mr. Penton of supplying the natives with arms
and ammunition.
Jan, when taxed with this, said it was all an inven-
tion. He owned to taking some of the rum for himself,
and said that as he was drinking it some of the boys
came and saw him, and he gave them some to bribe
them to silence.
Mr. Penton said that this was a very lame story, but
that he would give Jan another chance; only, if he
found him at any time in future either tampering with
the men or stealing the liquor, he would turn him out
of the camp then and there.
Jan promised to be faithful, and said it was only the
rum he had touched, and he was tempted to it by feel-
ing cold and tired after the wetting he had got in
crossing the stream.
We soon after this came to the Orange River, and
found that it was so broad and deep where we struck
it that we should have to float all our waggons across

A GOOD SUGGESTION.

and swim the animals. The waggons had to be un-
loaded, and the disselbooms unshipped, and tilts
taken down, and the sides were turned up so as to
keep the water out of them as much as possible, whilst
the fastenings of the line of casks along the centre
were carefully looked to.
Our first difficulty was to get a rope across the river,
and we all made several attempts to swim with a light
line, and we were almost giving it up, when Harry said,
" Can't we make a raft ?"
"What with ?" asked Mr. Penton.
"Why, all the water-casks, and the waggon-flaps, and
disselbooms; and if they are not enough, we can cut
some of these rushes and make bundles of them. They
will float; and there are some small trees here which
we can cut down."
"That's very good indeed.—Now, Jack, what do you
say?"
"Why, we can make a very good raft; but why not
make the centre of the body of a waggon? We might
manage to stop any leaks in the floor and sides, and
then lash the casks round it, and bundles of rushes.
And many of the boxes are water-tight; they could all
be used to float it."
"That is a good idea. Harry was the first to plan
the raft, and Jack improves. Now my plan must come
in. We will make the raft into a flying bridge."
"How will you do that, sir ?"
"Why, we will make a rope fast to this tree here,

MARING A RAFT.
and then we will secure it to the raft in a span, so that
one side will receive the force of the current; and then
if we tow it up-stream some little way, the force of the
stream will send it over to the other side; and then
when we let go from the other bank again, she will
swing back here."
" Capital, sir. We will get across quite easily."
The men were soon set to work, and one of the
waggons was run down on to a sand-spit, which pro-
jected some distance into the river above the tree we
had selected as our mooring-post; and there some logs
were laid down as launching-ways, and, the wheels
being taken off, the body was lowered down on them.
The casks were then lashed all round outside, and all
the corners and holes filled up with rushes, and a thick
layer woolded on outside the casks, so as to prevent
their being damaged.
The outside of the raft now looked something like a
boat built of rushes, with enormously thick sides, with
an oblong well in the centre. Over the seams in the
bottom and sides of the waggon body we nailed strips
of tarred canvas; and when we launched our craft we
had the satisfaction of finding that she was very buoy-
ant, and did not leak more than could easily be kept
under by a man baling.
The building of our boat took us nearly the whole
day, and as we did not like to divide our party, we
deferred sending our things across until the next
morning.


## p. 221 (#223) ############################################

CROSSING THE ORANGE RIVER.
221
We sent over on the first trip Harry and eight men
to receive the goods as they were ferried across, and I
was named skipper with a crew of four, whilst Mr.
· Penton, with Jan and the rest, made all the packages
ready for putting on board.
The trip was accomplished very quickly and safely,
and was succeeded by more, the greatest difficulty at
first being found in warping the raft up-stream to the
spit from which she started; as when we put the bul-
locks on to the tow-rope, she bounded in against the
banks. This we overcame by planting some strong
posts in the spit, to which we lashed a pulley through
which we rove the tow-rope.
After all our goods and stores were taken across, we
commenced towing the animals over; but when we had
made four or five trips with them, we found that one
of the bullocks was severely wounded by a floating log
drifting against him and inflicting a great gash in his
side.
As there were many of these in the river, we after-
wards put the bullocks and other animals into the well
of the raft, and found we could stow only four for each
trip across; and as we had a good deal of trouble in
getting the animals on board, having to blindfold some
of them before we could manage it, the work was very
tedious, and was rendered the more so by the way in
which Jan neglected his duties.
When night fell we had only got about half the
cattle across, and the three waggons which had not

222

been dismounted, and some of the stores, had still to be
ferried over.
Mr. Penton sent me across to keep watch on the
north side of the river, with Harry and the men belong-
ing to our two waggons, whilst he remained to look
after Jan and the rest.
Harry and I, full of the importance of our trust,
could hardly sleep; and when in the middle of the
night we heard a grunting and blowing close by where
we were sleeping, instantly jumped to our feet and
seized our guns, which we had laid down by our sides.
Nero was much excited, and was growling and trying
to roar, whilst the mysterious sounds which had aroused
us still continued, and we could not make out what
caused them. Our camp fires were burning well, and
all the men and cattle were quite tranquil, and on the
other side of the river we could see the fires of the
other camp.
As we could not understand the noises, I roused up
Green Boy and asked him what they were caused by.
After listening a few minutes he said, " Sea-cow."
"Sea-cow! what do you mean?"
"Sea-cow live in water and come on land."
"Live in water and come on land !—What can he
mean, Harry ?"
"I'm sure I don't know. Oh! I have it; he means
they are hippopotamuses."
"Surely that must be what he means. Have you
got your rifle ?"


## p. 223 (#225) ############################################

SEA-COWS.
223
"Yes. Are you going to try and shoot one ?"
"Yes. Will you come ? Have Horoye and Mokantse
come across? They were on this side in the afternoon;
but I do not know whether they remained or went back."
"Oh! you may be sure they are here, as Jan is over
on the other side. They will never stop nearer him
than they can help."
"Yes; I know that. I don't think there is any love
lost between them and him."
"I'll go and find them with Green Boy, whilst you
look out for our guns being ready."
"All right, Harry; be quick."
I looked for our guns, and loaded two rifles and
two guns with bullets, and had just finished when
Harry returned with Green Boy and the two Bushmen.
"Now then, Horoye, how shall we manage about
these sea-cows, as Green Boy calls them ?"
Horoye explained that they had come on shore to
feed, and that if we went towards where we heard
them we should very probably be able to get close
and get a shot, and that he and Mokantse would take
their spears and try to spear them. He advised us not
to take Nero or the dogs with us, which, when they had
seen the guns being got ready, had gathered round in
anticipation of a shooting expedition.
The dogs were soon sent away, but Nero would not
give up accompanying us, and we at last allowed him
to go with us; and leaving the camp we went in the
direction in which we had heard the sounds.

CAMP ALARMED.
We had to be very careful not to fall, for the ground
was very rough and full of holes made by the feet of
the hippopotami; but as our eyes became accustomed
to the want of light we were able to get along more
comfortably.
Suddenly I felt my arm gripped by Horoye, who
pointed to a dark mass which I had taken for a heap
of mud, whilst at the same moment Nero gave a warn-
ing growl. Straining my eyes I made out that there
was light underneath the dark mass, and that at one
end was a projecting lump. This was the hippopotamus,
and the lump was his head. He was just beginning
to move, so I brought my rifle to my shoulder, and fired
as nearly as I could at the centre of his head. He
instantly gave a roar and moved forward, whilst Nero
sprang to the front and jumped on his shoulders.
We had not thought of how we should alarm the
whole camp by firing, and were astonished to hear shots
fired on the other bank, and to hear shouts and cries
from both sides.
We could not fire again at the hippopotamus for fear
of wounding Nero, who kept his position notwithstand-
ing all the efforts that were made to dislodge him.
Horoye said something to Mokantse, who rushed
back into camp, and in a few minutes came back with
a blazing torch. By the light of this we could see the
hippopotamus clearly with Nero on his back, and that
he was wounded severely, for blood was streaming from
the side of his head where my bullet had struck him.


## p. 225 (#227) ############################################

SPEARING A HIPPOPOTAMUS.
225
The beast was evidently quite dazed by the bullet
and Nero's attack combined, for he made no effort to
escape, but only tried to dislodge Nero by rolling and
plunging. As he rolled on his back Nero changed his
position; and Horoye, who was watching his oppor-
tunity, plunged his spear into his belly three or four
times, the blood jetting out after each stab. This
seemed to divert his attention from Nero, and he
struggled on his feet again and turned to meet this
new enemy.
As he charged, Horoye jumped on one side, and
whilst Mokantse thrust his torch full into his face,
Horoye planted his spear behind his shoulder and drove
it clean through his heart. The brute rolled over dead,
and I shouted out to Harry, " We have got something
to tell Mr. Penton in the morning."
Scarcely were the words out of my mouth when I
heard Mr. Penton's voice close by me, saying, "Yes,
and you have something to tell him now. What have
you been disturbing all the camp about ?"
"Oh, sir, we've killed a hippopotamus."
"The deuce you have. It's very lucky there's some-
thing more not killed; for when you fired, Jan, who
has been drinking again, jumped up and began firing
indiscriminately. I have had to have him disarmed,
and have left him under charge of the Griquas whilst
I came over here to see what was the matter."
"I'm sorry to hear about Jan, sir; you will have to
get rid of him."

A GREAT FETISH.
"Yes, I suppose I must. But let us have a look at
this animal of yours. Did you kill it at one shot ?"
"No, sir; I got one shot, and then Nero got on it,
and I could not fire again, so Horoye sent Mokantse
for a torch, and when it came he speared the beast."
"Speared it, did he ? that was plucky. But he's a
good fellow that Horoye; I hope he will stop with us.
But I've heard that you can never depend upon their
remaining with any one for any length of time."
"I think he'll go some time with us, sir. He thinks
we have a great fetish in Nero; and to-day he was
throwing his dice, and he told me that they said he
was to stop with me. I asked him if he did not mean
you, and he said no; he had asked the question for
me."
"All right, my boy, it doesn't matter which ; I don't
think we shall part this trip. Hallo! what's up on the
other side ?"

THERE was evidently some trouble on the other side,
as we could see firebrands moving about; and Mr.
Penton and I hurried back, leaving, Harry to look out.
When we got across, we found that Jan had broken
loose from the Griquas and tried to get more rum; and
when they prevented him, had sworn he would shoot
them for touching a free-born Dutchman. Luckily
the arms had been stowed away, and he could not
find any.

among which was a large quantity of powder.
The Griquas and Hottentots, who had been attempt-
ing to prevent him, were now afraid to approach him,
and he in his drunken insanity was making a pile of
dry grass against the powder-barrels. He was just
about to apply the fire to it when Mr. Penton and I

A SINGLE-HANDED FIGHT.
rushed up. As he heard us he dropped his firebrand,
which fell on the grass, and rushed at Mr. Penton.
I tore off my skin coat and threw it on the firebrand,
and jumped on it, and was able to tear away the grass
before it had become ignited, and could then catch hold
of the brand and hurl it away to a safe distance.
I could now turn my attention to Mr. Penton and
Jan, who had gripped each other and were struggling
hard. I was rushing to Mr. Penton's assistance, when
he sung out to me to leave them alone, for he could
manage Jan by himself.
I obeyed, for Mr. Penton had a knack of making
himself obeyed; but I could not look on without appre-
hension for the result, for Jan was a much bigger and
heavier man than his master.
I did not know, however, that Mr. Penton was a
skilled boxer and wrestler, and could even, if Jan were
sober, have overmatched him in a single-handed fight.
After some time, which seemed to me interminable,
Jan was thrown crashing to the ground; and Mr.
Penton drew back a little to regain his breath.
I ran up to ask if he were hurt, but he said no; only
he had found Jan a tougher customer than he had
anticipated.
Whilst we were speaking Jan regained his feet and
again came rushing on. This time he was not allowed
to come to close quarters, but was stopped with a right
and left full in the face, which sent him reeling back a
couple of paces. He seemed as if he could not under-

229
stand it, and again came on, to be stopped in a similar
manner.
He now lowered his head and came charging in like
an infuriated bull. Mr. Penton stepped lightly on one
side, and getting Jan's head under his arm, got him
into chancery, and gave him a punching which was
worthy of being described by Homer, so completely
scientific and effectual was the manner in which it was
administered.
Jan could not stand the rain of blows for long, and
after vain attempts to kick and bite, threw himself on
the ground, and remained there. The Griquas, now
under the orders of Mr. Penton, tied him, hand and foot,
with rheims or hide thongs.
I expressed to Mr. Penton my astonishment that he
should have mastered such a powerful man as Jan with
so much apparent ease.
"Well, it has not been so easy, for the fellow is as
strong as a bull, and his head is so hard I have broken
my knuckles. But when I was at Eton, I was sup-
posed to be rather quarrelsome, and often had a set-
to behind the five courts. And when I was at Oxford
I went in for athletics more than reading, and was
counted a very good light-weight boxer and wrestler,
and these accomplishments have stood me in good
stead to-night. Now go to sleep; here's a blanket by
this fire. Good-night." And in five minutes he was
sleeping like a child.
In the morning the ferrying was again commenced,

LAWS OF TRAVELLING-PARTIES.
and as the men were now getting expert in the
management of the raft, we left Harry in charge, and
Mr. Penton came with me to speak to Jan, whom he
had heard yelling and shouting and telling the men to
let him loose.
When we arrived he began abusing Mr. Penton, who
told him he had better be quiet or else he would not
be released. On hearing this, he promised if he was
let go to be quiet.
When the rheims were untied, he got on his feet and
stood up. He did not look prepossessing, as his hair was
all dishevelled, both his eyes were blackened, and his
mouth cut and swollen, while his nose was twice its
ordinary size.
Mr. Penton spoke to him very quietly, and said that
according to all laws of travelling - parties in wild
countries he had forfeited all his pay, and deserved to
be turned out into the wild without arms, horse, or
provisions, but that no such severe measures would be
taken with him. He would be allowed to remain with
the party until we arrived at a Griqua village, which
would now be soon, where he would be discharged, and
receive an order, on Mr. Penton's agent at Cape Town,
for his pay up to date, and be given his gun and two
horses, with a certain amount of ammunition, and stores
sufficient to pay his way down to the settled districts,
and that, as he had evidently rendered some of the
Hottentots discontented, those who wished to leave
with him would be allowed to do so.


## p. 231 (#233) ############################################

NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF.
231
"And now," said Mr. Penton, "what is the reason
that you have behaved in the manner you have? You
have been well treated, have had the same food as my-
self, and Jack, and Harry, and have had no hard work
to do, whilst your pay has been much higher than is
ordinarily given to men employed as guides and
hunters."
"I have nothing to complain of in pay or food, but
you have put those two English boys before me in
everything, and have let Jack there have charge of all
the stores instead of giving charge to me, who am an
older man and know the country; and you have trusted
your Griqua cook more than me—a white man."
"I have done exactly as I thought fit; and as you
can neither read nor write, I do not think you to be a
fit man to take charge of stores, and certainly your con-
duct lately has proved you to be totally unfitted to be
placed in charge of anything or anybody. Now I will
do as I have said, if you promise to be quiet and behave
yourself properly; but if you don't, I will send you out
of the camp then and there."
"Well, I suppose I must; but some day I shall have
my turn, though it is yours now."
"Now I don't mind your threatening me for myself,
but I will have discipline in my camp, and will not
allow you to do so, so if you are not quiet I shall act
up to what I have said."
We left him to himself, and went to see how the
ferry was getting on, and found Harry had got on well,

SCARCITY OF WATER.
-nearly all the animals being across, and all the
stores.
The remaining animals were soon got over, and then
we only had to haul the other waggons over and dis-
mantle our float.
The restowing the waggons, putting on wheels, and
fitting up the tilts, took us all the remainder of the
day; and it was not until the next morning that we
were able to resume our march towards Sokolo, where
we heard there was a Griqua village, and a trading-
station to which merchants and hunters used to resort.
Before we reached this place we had to cross a piece
of country where water was very scarce; and for three
days our animals had to quench their thirst by eating
water-melons, of which enormous quantities grew in
patches every here and there. These even Nero and
the dogs ate with avidity. But it was queer to see how
they avoided some which were of a reddish colour, and
had a strong bitter taste, and, according to Horoye,
were poisonous. It was very curious to see that these
bitter melons often grew on the same plants as the
sweet ones.
The stock of water in our waggons was ample for
our own wants ; but the men had to be rationed, and
they eked out their allowance by eating melons.
Though the colour was usually a guide as to which
were sweet and which bitter, sometimes it was not,
and the men before picking a melon made a gash in
it, and applied their tongue to the wound.

SUCKING-HOLES.
235
On the fourth day Horoye told us that melons would
be scarce, and we had, therefore, better take a supply
for the march, as we should have to camp that night
without any, and the next day we should have to go
on till after the sun had passed overhead before we
should come to water again, and that that would be
only a sucking-hole.
We were much puzzled at first at this term sucking-
hole, but found out that many of the water-holes were
covered up to prevent loss by evaporation, and that a
reed was pushed down through the earth covering them
through which all the water was sucked up
We followed his advice, and filled up all the spare
space we had with melons, and delayed our start till
late, so that the animals should be as short time with-
out means to slake their thirst as possible. And then
we pressed on as far and fast as we could that night,
and did not out-span until the setting of the moon at
eleven o'clock made it too dark for us to proceed.
As soon as the day dawned we in-spanned again ; but
the oxen, though liberally supplied with melons, were
not very lively in their movements, and looked fagged
and weary.
About nine o'clock we judged from what we had
heard from others—though Horoye still persisted in
pointing to a place to the west of the meridian as where
the sun would reach before we arrived at water—that
the sucking-hole should be near; and Mr. Penton told
Harry and me to ride on and see if we could find the spot.

IMPORTANT NEWS.
We had not ridden more than a couple of miles in
advance of the waggons when we came upon a party
of Bushmen, and the Bakwain branch of the Bechuanas,
who were all evidently in great difficulty and tribula-
tion. The Bakwain were driving with them a few
cattle, and their women were carrying some earthen
pots and other articles of hut furniture, and several of
the men had gun-shot wounds.
Green Boy, who was with me, managed to make
them understand our questions, and from their replies
we learned that a Boer commando was out harrying
the country and carrying desolation far and wide.
The plea on which they were acting was that the
Griquas and Bechuanas had been guilty of cattle-steal-
ing, which was entirely false; and the Boers had taken
large numbers of cattle, and, not content with that, had
made numbers of the children of the natives slaves.
The water-place, they said, was away to the north of
the route they had followed, as they were attempting
to retreat towards the west into the wilds of the
Kalahari Desert, where the Boers would be afraid to
follow them.
When they understood that we belonged to a strong
party commanded by an Englishman, they said they
would wait for the arrival of our chief and lay their
case before him.
I thought this information far more important than
the question of arriving at the water half an hour
earlier or later, and galloped back to tell Mr. Penton.

· 237
the news. He would at once have ridden on, but
thinking that perhaps Jan might, on hearing the news
of his countrymen's proceedings, commence to give
more trouble, thought it unwise to leave him alone
with the waggons.
He asked me what I considered was best to be done
about Jan, as now he would no doubt wish to join the
commando, and in his present temper would be likely
to instigate them to come after us in the hopes of
plunder, whilst if he remained with us he would
always be a source of danger and weakness in case of
any trouble.
"I don't know, sir, what to say; he certainly is
dangerous in the camp, and there are some three or
four of the Hottentots who are foolish enough to
believe in him, and whose souls he has won by sharing
the stolen rum with them. If he goes to the Boers we
shall know that he will do all he can against us; and
if he remains, we shall never know what communica-
tions he has with them, and, as you say, it would be a
great danger if he were in our laager if we were
attacked, though we are well enough armed to beat off
any number of Boers, as, to judge from Jan and from
what we have heard, they don't much like risking
their skins, though they are not averse to shooting
down unarmed natives.
"Stay, sir; I have it. We have all those muskets for
trade; why not arm all the Bechuanas and Griquas
we can, and help them to protect themselves against

the Boers, and when we have made our preparations,
send Jan away and let him say what he likes ?"
"That is not a bad suggestion, though I don't like the
idea of arming black men against whites; still it will
be to save them from slavery, and I will do it. Those
Boers who have crossed the Vaal, and who, I suppose,
have sent out this commando, are mostly a set of
ruffians, and very different from our friends the Stein-
drups. Besides the real Boers, too, there are a number
of adventurers of all kinds, escaped criminals and
what not, so I don't mind having an encounter with
them."

As we were talking we arrived where the fugitives
were. They were all squatting on the ground around
Harry, and were, through Green Boy, entreating him
to get the head-man of the caravan to assist them.
When we arrived they rushed round Mr. Penton, and
some knelt and some wept, some caught hold of his
stirrups, men and women showed their wounds, and
mothers in expressive pantomime explained how their
children had been torn from them.
Since I had left to go back to Mr. Penton several
more had arrived.
Our Griquas, David, Moses, and Elias, were now
called upon to act as interpreters, in which capacity
they were much more useful than Green Boy, whose
powers in that line were not equal to his good inten-
tions. We each took one, and then dividing the

connected and intelligible narrative of what had hap-
pened, and how many guns there were in the commando,
how far it was away, and in what direction it was
marching
After some little trouble we found that there was no
immediate danger of meeting the Boers, as the villages
from which the fugitives had come were three days
distant from where we were then; and when they had
been last seen, they were marching rather to the east-
ward of north towards where Waterboer, the chief of
the Griquas, with a large number of his people and
many waggons and cattle, had retreated.
This being so, we determined on pushing on to the
water before making any arrangements as to our future
course of action; and all the Bakwain among the fugi-
tives said they would come with us, as did a few of
the Bushmen, who were persuaded by the eloquence of
Horoye and Mokantse to throw in their lot with the
Englishmen. And I have reason to believe that an
Homeric account of the thrashing Mr. Penton had
given to Jan, and of which the marks were sufficiently
apparent on his countenance, had much to do with
this determination.
The appearance of Nero, who up to this had been
calmly sleeping in a waggon, and who now came to
rub himself against me, also had much weight in
influencing their decision, for they said that people
who could tame lions would surely be able to beat the
Boers.

A NOVEL WATER-VESSEL.
241
When we got to the sucking-hole we found there
another party of refugees, which now brought the total
up to over a hundred of all ages and both sexes, and
out of these there were seventeen men unwounded
who could carry guns. These we armed, and then
having formed our camp so as to be as defensible as
possible, and also so as to command the water, we set
some men to work to clear the springs out.
Whilst this was being done, the thirsty people drew
water in the primitive manner which was in vogue
among them, and of which I will attempt to give
some description. The women had reeds about eighteen
inches or two feet long which they poked down through
the sand overlying the water-bearing strata, and then
they sucked the water up, and squirted it out of their
mouths into ostrich eggs and water-skins, which, when
they were filled, they sent to some of their number,
who from wounds or fatigue had been unable to
reach the place.
One fellow who was in great anxiety about his
father, who was wounded, and whom I had noticed
from his being the possessor of a pair of skin-breeches,
took them off, and tying them up at the knees, put
them round his neck, and got a woman to fill them
with water, and then marched off with this novel
water-vessel to his father's relief.
We, as soon as things were somewhat settled again,
commenced our inquiries, and found that the commando
which was out was part of a larger one which had

been sent out by Mr. Prætorius against the Griquas and
Bechuanas some three months before, to punish them
for cattle-stealing, as he alleged, but in reality for the
purpose of robbing them of their cattle and kidnapping
their children for slaves.
At first there had been three hundred Boers engaged
in the raid, but from time to time, as plunder had been
amassed, some had gone home, and there did not now
remain more than thirty or forty. These, however,
were all armed with guns, and had plenty of ammuni-
tion; whilst the unfortunate people they were now
attacking had scarcely any guns, and even if they had,
through the mistaken policy of the English they could
obtain no ammunition for them.
The Boers had destroyed many villages, and now
being free from what little restraint had been placed ,
on them in the commencement by the presence of
some of their older men, were engaged in indiscriminate
plunder and slaughter. As matters stood, they were
now between those of the Bechuanas and Bushmen who
had retreated towards the Kalahari Desert, and the
Griquas under Waterboer.
Hearing this, Mr. Penton thought that he would be
quite justified in making a stand against them, and
assisting the natives to recover from them any slaves
and cattle which they might not have sent back to
their farms.
After much discussion it was decided, as we were
sure of water where we were — the digging party

having made a big hole into which it flowed plentifully
—that a strong laager should be made where we then
were, and all the people who were fleeing in that direc-
tion should be collected; and that, when a sufficient
number were together, some should be left in charge
of the women and cattle, and the rest be marched
against the Boers, whilst a message should be sent to
Waterboer to ask him to bring what fighting-men he
could and come against the other flank of the Boers.
This being settled, the question of Jan again arose,
and many of the fugitives, seeing that he was of the
same race as their enemies and oppressors, and hearing
also that he had been robbing his master, advised that
he should at once be shot or hung.
Mr. Penton would not listen to their blood-thirsty
counsel, and said he would give Jan and the Boers a
chance before he commenced active hostilities; so he
sent for Jan and said to him, "I have sent for you to
tell you that I hear some of your countrymen are
about, and have been robbing and ill-treating the
natives. I find that they are not a very strong party,
and that by arming some of those they have been
oppressing I can easily turn the tables on them.
"As for you, for mutiny and theft I should be quite
justified in having you shot or hanged, and my conduct
in so doing would be applauded by all those present.
However, I will not condemn you to death, but will
let you go to your own people. You can take your
horse and gun and provisions for a week, and if any of

the Hottentot boys wish to go with you, and I believe
some are foolish enough to do so, they can. .
"In return you can take this message to the Boer
commando. If in ten days' time from this they shall
have returned all the slaves and cattle they have with
them, and have commenced their march towards their
own farms, they can go in peace; but if not, I shall
attack them and force them to do what I say.
"What say you? do you agree to these terms? When
you go away now, you must never come into my camp
again. And if the chief of the commando wishes to
communicate with me, he must send a man with a
white flag."
" I'll take your message, and shall get my friends to
come back and punish you for your treatment of me,
and for befriending the niggers."
So saying, Jan van Neeldt went off for his horse
and gun, and in half an hour's time was riding out of
camp, followed by only one Hottentot, a poor wretch
who would sell his soul for a tot of grog, and was
allured by the promises of Jan that in the Dutch camp
he would be able, if he wished, to swim in " Cape smoke."
"That, I hope, is the last of him," said Mr. Penton,
as he turned away from seeing Jan leave, and was
about to go to his waggon with me, to superintend the
serving out of arms and ammunition to our new allies.
The words were hardly out of his mouth when a
bullet passed between him and me, and buried itself in
the woodwork of a waggon, and we heard the heavy

report of a roer. Looking round again, we saw Jan
remount and gallop off, having tried a shot at us as a
parting token of good-will.
"Treacherous and ungrateful blackguard," said Mr.
Penton. "Now I won't let him off again. And I can
quite understand the temper he is in: he will try to
bring that commando down on us as soon as he can.-
No; no one shall go after him," as I proposed to ride and
capture him.
The men capable of bearing arms were given them, and
we instructed them as best we could in the mysteries of
handling a gun. The loading and priming were ex-
plained, and also the principle of taking an aim; and
though we could not afford much ammunition for
practice, the few rounds we let them fire showed that
their aiming was not likely to be bad if they should
be unhappily forced to fight against the Boers.
The waggons were drawn up at the four corners of
a large square which we formed round the wells we
had dug, and then connected by a fence made of scrubby
thorns piled up as thick and high as we could, and all
along the fence and outside it were dug a number of
holes which would serve the double purpose of rifle-
pits and pitfalls.
The tents were pitched in the middle, and surrounded
by an earthen embankment, and were intended to an-
swer for magazine and hospital, as unfortunately we
had already a good many wounded to look after.
Other places, which were protected as well as we

could, were arranged for the women and children; and
watering-places were made for the cattle, so that they
should not damage the wells.
All these preparations took a long time, and it was
late in the evening before we could think of sleep; and
then, as Mr. Penton, Harry, and I were having our
supper, it suddenly occurred to us that we had not
arranged for sending any message to Waterboer.
"How we are to do it is a puzzle to me," said Mr.
Penton. "The Boers were three days away for people
on foot, and Jan can easily reach them to-morrow. If
they are as wise in their generation as I take them to
be, they will send out scouts to prevent our getting a
message past them; and even if we did send a Bush-
man or a Bakwain, he would have to go on foot, and
when he arrived it would be too late for Waterboer to
arrange to act with us."
"Why can I not go, sir ?" I asked. "Let me go with
Horoye and Mokantse; they can both ride."
"It is a very risky business, my boy. I don't like
your attempting it at all."
"Why not, sir? Pelican is very fast, and I am sure
that any two horses you give Horoye and Mokantse
are sure to be better than any the Boers are likely to
have, if they look after theirs like Jan does after his."
Harry said, "Why can't I go with Jack, sir? I am
sure he and I, with the two Bushmen, could make a
running fight of it for hours."
"I don't like it at all," said Mr. Penton. "I don't

247
want either of you to go, and I don't like sending the
Bushmen with horses alone, and on foot they will be
too late in arriving to do any good."
"You see, sir, one of us must go," said I, "and you
will want one here to help you in the camp. You
have all the wounded to look after, which took you
quite two hours and a half this afternoon, and if any-
thing occurred in the shape of an attack you cannot
attend to the whole camp at once. The Griquas may
each take one waggon, and perhaps Green Boy might
take another; but the pits and fence must be watched,
and one man cannot do it."
- "I won't answer now; I'll sleep on it. Good-night,
Jack; good-night, Harry."
"Good-night, sir," both of us answered, and went off
to our sleeping places, where Harry tried to persuade
me to let him come with me if I went, or else to let him
go instead of me.
· I would not listen to either of these propositions, and
at last made him agree with me that it would be wrong
to leave Mr. Penton alone; but even when we went to
sleep I had not convinced him that it was I who ought
to go.
In the morning, before it was light, Mr. Penton sent
for us again, and said he had not been able to sleep
all night for thinking of what ought to be done. He
thought that many would consider that the wisest
course that he could pursue would be to remain entirely
neutral; but that he regarded as being impossible. He

THE MESSAGE TO WATERBOER.
would therefore act according to his inclination, and do
his best to get some of the captives of the Boers freed,
and to prevent their making any more.
During the night he had sat up in turns with David,
Moses, and Elias, and from them he had got a good
deal of information about Waterboer, and everything
that they had told him had confirmed him in his
opinion that he was a man to be trusted and assisted.
He had therefore come to the conclusion that he
would send me with Horoye and Mokantse to Water-
boer, with the message that if the Boers advanced
against him (Waterboer) he would follow them up with
what men he could muster, leaving enough to defend
our laager, and harass their rear; whilst if they came
against him, he expected Waterboer to follow them up,
so that they should be placed between two fires.
He also gave us orders to tell any fugitives we might
meet on the way that they would be welcome at his
camp, and that he had guns and ammunition to give
them, so that they could fight on an equality with the
Boers.
"It is very fortunate," he said, " that I never let Jan
know what those boxes of muskets contained, or he
would have taken the news with him, and the leader
of the commando would have sent for reinforcements
before attacking us; now he will think we have only
the guns he has seen, and they will come on without
much caution, though I doubt if they will attack us
openly, but rather resort to surprises. Now, Jack, my

lad, get your breakfast, and see to your arms and
saddles."
" All right, sir. I shall take pistols and a gun, and
I suppose Horoye and Mokantse can have guns too if
they like them ?"
"Certainly they may. You had better get away as
soon as you can."
I went off with Harry and carefully examined my
arms, and loaded them, and saw that those of my two
companions were also in good order, and that all straps
and buckles of our horses' equipment were sound.

ALL my preparations being made, I went to Mr. Penton
and said I was ready, when he told me to be care-
ful, and always keep one of the Bushmen with me,
while the other was to ride within sight on my right
flank, as that was the side on which the Boers might
be expected to be seen, and that I was to be very
cautious in approaching any body of men.
With warm farewells and wishes for good luck from
Harry and Mr. Penton I took my leave, specially ask-
ing Harry to be sure and look after Nero.
As soon as we were mounted I and my two companions
set off at a canter towards the north-north-east, Horoye
riding with me, and Mokantse keeping away to the
east of us as look-out.
After riding for about two hours, and having brought
our steeds into a fast walk, I began to try to make out
from Horoye's conversation what he thought of the
ul.

TALK ABOUT BOERS.
251
Boer commando, and whether he thought they would
attack our camp.
"Well, Horoye," I said, "what do you think of these
Boers ?"
"Oh! Boer be plenty bad man."
"Yes, I know that; but will they fight with Mr.
Penton?"
"S'pose boss Boer tink he plenty trong, he make
fight; s'pose he no tink so, he make run away. He
all be big tief."
"Yes; but do you think they are strong ?"
"No, sabey; long time he tief cow, tief picanniny, tief
woman; plenty Boer go home. One time catch um
farm, he make say to tief plenty cow, plenty men to
catch; many Boer come back. All Boer plenty bad."
"Well, how long do you think it will be before more
men come ?"
"How can say ? S'pose farm long way, no come yet;
s'pose farm no long, soon men come."
"Do you think any can have come yet ?"
"Praps ; Boer alway come quick to make tief."
"How many would there be ?"
"How can tell ? Praps four ten, p?raps five ten."
This reasoning seemed sound, and I thought that
therefore it behoved us to be extra cautious..
Soon after noon I thought it best to off saddle and
give our horses a rest whilst we ate our mid-day meal;
and wishing to stop in a place where we could see
without being seen, I selected a small mound, up which

A CAREFUL OUTLOOK.
we rode, and behind the brow of which we picketed
our horses, while we ourselves crept on to the summit
and took a careful look all round the horizon.
Away to the north-east we could see smoke rising
as if from a big fire; and between us and it, through a
capital telescope which Mr. Penton had lent me, I could
make out the tilts of about forty waggons.
Horoye, when he counted them, said there must be
with forty waggons at least two hundred Boers, and
that their slaves and servants would number as many
more, and would be spread out to a great distance as
scouts; and that it would be necessary for us, to ride in
safety, to alter our course about four points more to the
left—which was very unfortunate, as on the line we
should now have to take there was no water for a very
long distance.
As soon as we had rested we remounted and again
set off in the new direction, Mokantse and Horoye
occasionally changing their rôle, and one sometimes
scouting and sometimes the other; but every mound
which promised a vantage-point for watching the move-
ment of the enemy was climbed, and the direction in
which he was going was carefully noted.
For some time every report made out that they were
marching in the direction we wished to take ourselves,
in order to arrive at Waterboer's camp; but about four
in the afternoon Horoye, who had been watching them
carefully, came galloping to me to report that they had
halted, and that some of the men had begun to ride in

SERIOUS NEWS.
255
the direction of Mr. Penton's camp. He said the rein-
forcements, as he had expected, having arrived, they
most probably considered themselves strong enough to
attack our comrades when they heard from Jan of their
encampment at the watering-place, and that the change
in their movements had been very likely caused by the
arrival of Jan amongst them.
This was indeed serious news, and when I considered
how large an area our camp covered I did not see how
Mr. Penton and Harry could defend it against so many
men as were likely to attack it now. I therefore asked
Mokantse to go back with all possible speed to warn
Mr. Penton, in order that he might concentrate his
forces as much as possible, whilst Horoye and I should
run the risk of riding across, behind the Boers, direct
to where we hoped to find Waterboer.
This decision was acted on immediately, and we put
our horses to their best speed, and Horoye and myself
soon found that we were rapidly closing in on the rear-
guard of the Boers. At last we did not think it safe
or prudent to get any nearer them in daylight, and
dismounted to wait for sunset, when we might again
resume our route.
I had some water in my bottle for drinking, but my
horse was sorely in want of some, and so was Horoye's,
and both were much exhausted by the pace and
distance we had ridden; and I was afraid that unless
we found some means of slaking their thirst, we
should not be able to travel as fast as we wished.


## p. 256 (#258) ############################################

256
NEITHER WATER NOR MELONS.
I made Horoye understand this, and he laughed as
he said he was not thirsty and had not thought about
the horses, but that he would soon put it all right.
As there were no signs of water and no melons, I
thought he was cracked; but he began looking round
and round, and suddenly catching sight of a withered-
looking stem, ran towards it, and going on his hands
and knees, commenced thumping the ground with his
fist at a distance of about four feet from it. If I had
doubts of his sanity before, they were confirmed now;
and when he came running for his spear, which he had
left by me, I had some thoughts of snatching it up
before he could lay hold of it.
As soon as he had got the spear, he went back to
the place where he had been tapping the ground, and
commenced digging, and in about ten minutes had
unearthed a tuber as large as a child's head, which was
cool and juicy, and which the horses ate with avidity.
With my assistance we secured about a dozen of
these, of which the horses ate four each, and the others
we slung on to our saddles for a further supply.
By this time the sun had set, and we were enabled to
proceed on our way again without danger of being
seen by the Boers. Our anxiety for our friends pre-
vented us feeling fatigue, and it was not until the
stumbling and weariness of our horses forced us to do
so that we again halted.
We both were hungry, and were not sorry to see at
a short distance from us a herd of springbok, one of

NEARING THE GOAL.
257
which Horoye managed to spear. We made a small
fire in a hole which I dug with my knife, and grilled a
steak; and then seeing that we had still a long ride
before us, and our horses were tired, I bethought me of
the expedient of Dick Turpin, the highwayman of
fame, who rode from London to York on his mare
Black Bess; and cutting long strips of lean meat from
the body of the buck, wound them round the bits of
Pelican and his companion when we rebridled them.
After we had had a short sleep, we found that the
highwayman's receipt was an admirable one, for our
horses went on with renewed vigour; and towards the
evening of the same day I was delighted to hear from
Horoye that he could see the tracks of men who would
be either Bakwain or followers of Waterboer, and in
either case that chief could not be far distant. Follow-
ing up the footsteps, we came upon the marks of
waggon wheels and the spoor of cattle; and Horoye
declared they had only passed about four hours before,
and that if we pressed on sharply we might reach their
camp before sunset, and avoid the necessity of passing
another night in the open. Our horses evidently knew
we were drawing near our goal, for they responded
bravely to our urging them on, and neighed and
whinnied with pleasure.
After riding on for half an hour, and it being only
an hour to sunset, Horoye jumped off his horse again
and examined the spoor with great attention, and
apparently was much dissatisfied with the result. I

was afraid at first that he might have found that we
had come upon the track of a part of the commando, in-
stead of on that of Waterboer and his people; but his
dissatisfaction was not caused by such a serious catas-
trophe as that, but simply by the fact that evidently
all were travelling as fast as they could, and that
there was no chance of our getting into camp before
dark.
"Never mind, Horoye," I said; "we will sleep where
we can reach, and get into camp the first thing in the
morning. Let us march till we see their fires."
Horoye said that there would be no fires, and that
we could not march after sunset, as evidently all were
hurrying, supposing the commando to be close on their
heels, and that it was more than likely that they
would take advantage of the darkness to change their
route.
"Very well, let us go on till we can see their spoor
no longer, and then we can off saddle for the night and
go on in the morning."
We had not ridden another couple of miles when we
came upon some dead cattle which had evidently been
wounded by the Boers, and now, having been over-
driven in the flight of their owners, had succumbed to
fatigue and injury.
"They cannot be far off," I thought, as, on jumping
down to examine the carcasses, I found them still quite
warm, and evidently not dead above an hour.
A short way further on, we came to the body of a

WOUNDED AND FORSAKEN.
259
man lying across the track, who had his head bound
up in a bloody cloth, and a bandage also stained with
blood round his body. Horoye, on getting down to
examine him, recognized him as one of his tribesmen
called Mesantu, who had for a long time followed
Waterboer wherever he went. He began to lament,
and said that as we could not get into camp that night,
he might as well bury his friend as leave him to be
eaten by jackals and hyenas.
I also dismounted to assist him in his pious intention;
but on touching the supposed corpse, I found it was so
warm that I doubted if life were really extinct, and on
feeling over his heart, I found that there was a slight
movement. I instantly went to my saddle-bags for a
stimulant which Mr. Penton had insisted on me taking
with me, and poured a few drops down the throat of
Mesantu, who began to revive almost immediately. I,
after he had swallowed a gulp or two of the raw spirit,
mixed a little with water, and had the pleasure of
seeing him drink it off and then open his eyes.
On seeing a white man bending over him he nearly
lost his senses from fright, for he fancied that he had
fallen into the hands of the Boers, and that his death
was certain, as he was too badly wounded to be worth
the trouble of curing to make a slave of him. At least
this is what he afterwards told us he thought.
Horoye, however, spoke to him by name, and he
recognized the voice at once, and was soon convinced
that he had fallen into friendly hands. As though his

wounds were severe they were not dangerous, and he
had only fainted from loss of blood, he soon revived
sufficiently under the influence of the stimulant to tell
us something of the occurrences of the last few days.
When the commando first came and attacked the
Griqua villages, Waterboer was some distance away,
and the Boers had it all their own way; but Waterboer,
hearing of the raid, had hurried to the assistance of
those of his people who were attacked, and had enabled
some to get their wives and families away, with part
of their cattle and waggons, and placing himself in the
rear of the fugitives, had kept the Boers who remained
after their first success at bay, and had been for some
days retreating gradually northward; but that the day
before they had again been attacked by the Boers,
and had lost many cattle, and had many men killed,
and were forced to retreat precipitately. They were,
he said, in momentary expectation of another attack
from the Boers; and as we saw in his own case, had
become so demoralized by fear, that they did not mind
abandoning their dead and wounded sooner than let
them prove impediments to their flight.
By the time we had revived Mesantu the sun had
set, and there luckily being an abundant supply of
melons about, we decided on bivouacking where we
were for the night, and resuming our chase after
Waterboer in the morning.

OUR rest was somewhat disturbed by jackals and
hyenas, and we were not sorry when the first glimmer
of dawn allowed us to proceed on our journey. Mesantu
we placed on Horoye's hofse, and he ran alongside it
himself, keeping both the horses at a fast trot.
In a very short time we came upon stragglers who
had been too tired to keep up with the main body
until it halted, who were delighted to hear from us
that their enemies and persecutors were no longer in
close pursuit of them. On our inquiring where we
should find Waterboer, we were told that the last
waggon was his, and that as he had been in the saddle
almost without interruption for the previous three
days, it was more than probable that we should find
him in it.
We intrusted Mesantu to the care of some of these
people, and hurried on to execute our mission with
Waterboer. We found, when we caught up the

waggon, that he was just waking up, and was going to
mount his horse to reconnoitre in rear of his people.
When he saw us, and found out that I was English,
before he would enter into conversation with me he
fell on his knees and returned thanks to God for
having heard his prayers, and sent him and his people
aid and assistance in their sore distress.
When he had finished, he asked me what news I
had to give him, and offered me refreshments. I told.
him what Mr. Penton intended doing, and also what
we had seen of the Boers, and that there was no ne-
cessity for his hurrying his retreat.
He said that when there were only supposed to be
thirty Boers, the plans we had made were excellent;
but now, as he knew there were over a hundred and
fifty, he feared our party would have great difficulty
in holding their own; and that it would be almost im-
possible for him to send us any assistance, as his ammu-
nition was nearly expended. The only hope would be
that Mokantse might get in to our camp in time to
warn Mr. Penton, and enable him to concentrate his
forces; but that any way the cattle must be looked
upon as lost, as it would be impossible for the number
of men at Mr. Penton's disposal to defend a laager large
enough to contain them all.
I was sorry to see, though Waterboer showed in
words much anxiety as to Mr. Penton's fate, he did not
seem at all inclined to render him any assistance, but
rather to take advantage of the Boers being engaged in

263
attacking him, to pursue his flight northwards without
fear of molestation.
I urged him, by all the means I knew of, to let as
many of his men as had guns, who could possibly be
spared, be sent to attack the Boers in rear when they
were engaged with our camp, whilst the main body
would be able to go north in safety; arguing that if the
Boers were successful against Mr. Penton, they would
be sure to come after him, and would be strengthened
by the guns and ammunition which they would find in
our stores. No; he would do nothing. He had only
a few men who were armed, and he could not spare
them.
I told him that three men from Samuel's party-
David, Moses, and Elias-were in the camp, and if it
were taken would be certain to lose their lives.
No; he admired his friend Samuel, and would be
sorry that any of his men should lose their lives, but
his first duty was to those who remained with him, and
looked up to him for leading and guidance.
I was almost in despair, and could not think of what
fresh argument I should use, when Horoye came to me
and said there were a number of Bechuanas in the
camp, and they would, if I would promise to pay them
in guns and ammunition, at once attack the rear of the
Boers.
I said I was sure that Mr. Penton would do that, and
asked what was the number of men who were willing
to come, and what they would require. He said he had

- AN EXPLANATION.
found sixty Bakwain (a sub-tribe of the Bechuanas)
and fifteen Bakalahari; and that the sixty Bakwain
wanted to be paid a gun and ammunition for each ten
men, and the fifteen Bakalahari, who are Bushmen,
would come for one gun.
This offer I thought was a good one, as, although I
did not think that they would stand up against the
Boers and their firearms, they might harass them and
prevent their obtaining game for food, and kill their
oxen when feeding, and so draw off a number from the
investment of our camp.
When Waterboer heard that I was going to pay in
guns and ammunition for any assistance I might re-
ceive, he at once altered his tone, and said that the real
reason that he had not consented to join in opposing
the Boers was, that he was afraid of using his scanty
stock of ammunition, which he had the greatest diffi-
culty in replenishing, and that he thought that his
people would, when without powder, be an easy prey
to the raiders; and therefore he intended to husband
all he possessed, to be used only in case they were ac-
tually attacked.
I said that so far from being worse off in that respect,
he would get a quantity both of guns and ammunition;
and I had no doubt but that Mr. Penton, who was
rich and generous, would, besides giving guns, powder,
flints, and lead, make, if he were successful against the
Boers and beat them off, handsome presents to all who
assisted him.

A GOOD BARGAIN.
267
I urged on him to make up his mind as soon as pos-
sible, as I wished to rejoin my companions and give
them the news of what had been agreed upon. At last
he said he could send fifty men, but only on the under-
standing that if the Boers followed up his retreat these
people were to rejoin him at once, and we on our part
should assist him in defending their families and prop-
erty.
I could see that he had made by far the best of the
bargain; but still the assistance of fifty mounted men
with guns would be so important that I agreed to his
terms, and said I would on the part of Mr. Penton
agree to his terms if he would send the men away at
once.
He said they should march that night, and then made
me sign an agreement setting out the terms on which
they were to come.
The Bakwain and Bakalahari did not wish for any
writing, but started off at once, and, as Horoye said,
though they would not fight against men armed with
guns, still they could cause a great deal of annoyance
to the Boers.
As soon as I had signed the paper, I asked if he could
supply me with horses for Horoye and myself, as ours
were tired, and I wanted to get back as soon as possible
to the camp.
After some bargaining, I got two good horses, for
which Mr. Penton was to pay in trading stores; and
after a hasty meal, we mounted and set off on our way

back. I now found the advantage of having trained
Pelican to come to my call, as he ran alongside me now
without giving me any trouble to lead him, and the
other horse which Horoye had ridden from camp kept
close to him.
We pressed on as fast as we could, and, being able to
take the line on which we had seen the Boers marching,
we found water on the road, and before nightfall had
arrived at the place where we had seen them on our
march after Waterboer. We now changed horses, and
had to lead the ones I had got from the Griquas; but
as in the bad light we had to proceed at a foot-pace,
this did not give us so much trouble as it would have
done had we been going fast. At midnight we halted
in a small clump of bush, and picketed the horses and
lay down to sleep, feeling sure that the Boers would
never dream of our being bold enough to follow up on
their track.
Next morning we were again on the move with the
first rays of light, and again rode the new horses, in-
tending to keep Pelican and his comrade for the dash
we expected to make past the Boers to get into camp. -
As we proceeded on our way, we saw signs of the
Boers having surprised some small parties of fugitives,
for we counted no less than ten dead bodies of Bakwain
in one place alone, and evident signs of a struggle,
whilst five miles further on we saw five more.
Horoye all the way kept on inveighing against the
cruelty of the Boers, and asserting that if it were not

269
for the superiority their firearms gave them, they
would never venture on making raids against unoffend-
ing people.
As we got nearer to our destination we had to pro-
ceed more cautiously, and on coming to the top of a
small eminence saw the waggons of the Boers laagered
about three miles in front of us. I carefully examined
the laager through my glass, and could make out about
forty men about them, whilst, some distance on in front,
I fancied I could discern a body of horsemen, who could
not be very far distant from our camp.
We now made a detour to the westward, and put-
ting our horses to their speed, endeavoured to ride past
the flank of these horsemen, and if possible get into
camp before the attack took place. Unfortunately for
us, they were moving pretty fast, and we soon found
that we should not be able to do this, and at four
o'clock were chagrined by seeing them spread out and
evidently prepare for fighting.
In another half-hour we came in sight of the camp,
and could see that a heavy fire was being kept up be-
tween it and the Boers, who by this time had com-
pletely encircled it.
We still rode on, and tried to make out where the
cordon was the weakest, and if there was any point
where we would have a chance of getting through in
the dark.
After careful examination, we came to the conclu-
sion that we should have the best chance of getting in

A GALLOP AND A DASH.
to our friends if we made our attempt from the west,
and therefore made a circle round the attacking party
in order to try and dash in on that side when it should
be completely dark.
As the sun set, the firing stopped, and the Boers
lighted fires by which to pass the night. These fires
we determined to use for our guides, and halted oppo-
site the widest gap in them that we could see.
We drew as near as we could, and could distinctly
hear the voices and laughter of the men keeping watch,
and then waited till a partial cessation of noise told us
that a portion had gone to rest.
We now mounted our horses, and Pelican, as I patted
his back, seemed to be conscious that I was going to
put my trust in him, and, by turning his intelligent
head round towards me, tried to make me understand
that my trust was not misplaced.
We went up towards the place which we had selected
for our attempt, and where there was a distance of over
a hundred yards between two fires, and were just going
to put our horses to a gallop and dash through, when
one of the horses in the Boers' lines commenced to
neigh. We dashed on; but the Boers' attention had
been attracted, and we soon heard some bullets flying
close to us, and heard the sentries calling out to their
companions to turn out.
We saw that we were discovered, but at the same
time knowing that flight with our tired horses was im-
possible, dashed forward at full speed, hoping in the

271
darkness and confusion we might possibly be able to
get through.
As we came abreast of the fires, the Boers ceased
firing at us, for fear of hitting their own men; and I
said to Horoye, "In five minutes we shall be in camp."
Hardly were the words out of my mouth when Peli-
can, putting his foot in a hole, came down, and I was
pitched forward on my head and stunned.

A PRISONER WITH THE BOERS-JAN DELIGHTS AT MY SUFFERINGS-TREACHERY
MEDITATED-RECOGNIZED BY MY FRIENDS-EVERY HOUR'S DELAY OF USE-
FAIRLY WELL TREATED—MORE TREACHERY-GIVE WARNING AT ALL RISKS
-HOROYE KILLS JAN-DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RISK-SENTENCED TO DEATH.
WHEN I recovered my consciousness the sun was high
in the heavens, and I found myself lying bound hand
and foot with hide thongs close to the expiring embers
of a watch-fire, and sitting near me, with a malicious
grin on his battered countenance, was Jan van Neeldt.
My head was aching as if it would split, the thongs
with which I was tied were cutting into my flesh, and
I felt an agonizing pain in my right arm, while to add
to my torments I suffered from most excruciating
thirst.
I called to Jan as well as I was able, and begged
him to give me a draught of water and to ease my
bonds, as they were causing me great pain; but the
brute only grinned, and getting up, came to where I
was lying and kicked me two or three times—one of
these kicks alighting on the arm that was hurting me,
and making me feel that the bone was broken.
I implored him to give me some water, if even it

273
were only a mouthful; but he only laughed at me, and
taunted me with being made a prisoner. I begged
again and again for water, which was the only thing
for which I felt any craving; but not a sip would he
give me, and told me I had helped to keep the rum
from him, and that now he would pay me out by
keeping water away from me.
As I rolled about in my agony I saw that the Boers
had been making pits and shelters, from which they
were keeping up a fire on the camp, whence a pretty
sharp return was made. Some of the bullets passed
close by us, and I, lying without any protection, was in
momentary expectation of being struck by one. Jan
had sheltered himself behind a small bank, and seemed
to delight in my sufferings and the manner in which
I wriggled about and tried to move out of the space
where the bullets were falling.
Not a thing would Jan do to render me more com-
fortable, or, to speak correctly, less miserable; and my
thirst increasing from moment to moment, as I lay
on my back perfectly helpless, I thought that unless
some one would give me a drink of water I should go
mad.
I tried to look round to see if Horoye was near me;
but as I could see him nowhere I indulged in a faint
hope that he might possibly have got into the camp,
though from stories I had heard I thought it not im-
probable that he might be dead, as the Boers would
think little of shooting a " nigger."

TREACHERY MEDITATED.
After lying in this manner for a time which seemed
interminable, the fire from our camp suddenly ceased,
and I heard shouts to the Boers that our people desired
a parley.
Jan, when there was no danger, came out from his
shelter and spoke to two or three of the Boers who
seemed to be leaders, and who now came near where I
was lying; and I could hear him advising them to con-
sent, and invite Mr. Penton to come out to them, and
when he arrived to have men ready to rush out and
seize him, as once he was in their power there would
only be one boy left of the English, and he could not
alone be expected to make the natives hold out against
such heavy odds.
From what I could make out of their conversation
the Boers had had three men killed and several wounded;
and if they had not been extremely chary of exposing
themselves they would have suffered much more, as the
fire from the camp had been very accurate.
I could only understand them with difficulty, as they
spoke in Africander Dutch, of which all I knew was
what I had picked up from Groot Bock and from Jan
before he had developed his bad qualities, and I could
therefore only surmise much of what they said.
When they had finished talking, Jan came to where
I was lying, and cut my bonds and gave me some water
to drink, which seemed to me like nectar, and told me
that the Boers were willing to make terms with Mr.
Penton; and that if he would give up all his waggons

RECOGNIZED BY MY FRIENDS.
275
but one, and his guns and stores, he would be allowed
to turn back to the Cape; and said I was to write him
a letter to that effect.
I told him that my right arm was broken, and that
I could not write; but that if he would let me go to
Mr. Penton I would tell him what their terms were
and ask him if he would consent to them.
He left me again, and went and consulted with his
friends; and one came, and after examining my arm,
made splints of a piece of bark and bound it up, and
then made a sling in which I could carry it.
As this man seemed kind in his actions, I tried to
make him understand that Mr. Penton would be sure
to agree to any good terms, and that if I was sent to
him I would tell him their wishes. But he said no;
they would only treat with him direct, and that he
must come out into their lines to speak with them.
After my arm was put into the sling I was brought
where I could be seen by our people in camp, and I
was delighted to be recognized by both Mr. Penton and
Harry, who I afterwards found had given me up as
lost, as Horoye, who had managed to get into camp,
had told them that he had seen me fall, and felt sure
I had been killed in the mêlée that took place when
my horse fell.
I waved my cap to them, and they answered me;
and I was glad to hear a cheer from our natives when
they saw me. I longed to be able to speak to Mr.
Penton, to warn him that I thought treachery was

A STORMY INTERVIEW.
intended; but when I proposed that I should be allowed
to go within speaking distance of him to make known
the Boers' proposals, Jan said he could talk to him, and
there was no need to employ me.
I felt more and more anxious as to what would
occur when I saw Jan go and hold another consultation
with the leaders, and evidently gradually bring them
round to consent to some proposal which he made, and
from which at first they appeared to dissent.
After some time Jan left the group, and I saw him
approach our camp, which I was glad to see was much
smaller than when I had left it, and was very well
protected, whilst, although many of the oxen had had
to be abandoned, I could see that about forty of them
and all the horses were inside.
Jan went close to one of the waggons which formed
the side of a sort of bastion, which had been made so as
to give a flanking fire along one of the sides, and in
which Mr. Penton and Harry were standing.
From where I was I had a full view of the proceed-
ings, and could see that the discussion was prolonged
and stormy, and could distinguish that both Mr. Penton
and Harry pointed repeatedly to me; and I was de-
lighted after some time to see Horoye come and stand
by them, as then I knew that he was safe inside, and
would have reported the arrangements I had made
about the Bakwain, Bakalahari, and Griquas, and that
Mr. Penton would understand that every hour's delay
he could obtain would be of use.


## p. 277 (#279) ############################################

A TRUCE AGREED UPON.
277
At last Jan came back, and said he had tried to
make Mr. Penton come out to discuss the terms on
which hostilities should cease with the Boer leaders;
but that he had refused to do anything until I was
liberated, and he had now come to see what they could
arrange.
At last they hit upon a plan which they thought
would put all three of us into their power. It was
proposed that Jan should go back to Mr. Penton and
say that the Boers would withdraw for some distance
on the condition of being supplied with water, as they
had now to bring all theirs from the place where their
waggons were laagered, and that on the following
morning Mr. Penton and Harry could come and speak
to the Boer leaders midway between the two parties,
and that if any terms were agreed to I should be de-
livered up.
Jan went back again with this proposal, and it was
agreed that the fighting should cease, and water be
given at once for the Boers and their horses, and that
the first thing in the morning they should retire to
their waggons, and that then Mr. Penton and Harry
should come out a mile from camp to have a discussion
with the leaders.
I was now fairly well treated and given food and
drink, and had a bed made for me of karosses, on
which I was able to rest comfortably, though the pain
I was suffering and the anxiety I felt prevented me
from sleeping much.

FURTHER BOER TREACHERY.
The night passed away slowly and wearily, but at
last the sun did rise and the Boers commenced to with-
draw. I could see that all in the camp were on the
move; and was glad to remark that as soon as the Boers
had got to a safe distance our horses and oxen were
sent out to graze under charge of our native allies, and
that scouts were thrown out to report any movement
towards them on the part of the Boers, so that they
would not be cut off by any sudden advance.
I was allowed to mount my horse Pelican. But there
was evidently a fear that I would endeavour to escape,
for he was knee-haltered, so that it was impossible for
him to move fast; and indeed he moved in such a jolty
manner that every step he took gave me exquisite pain
in my broken arm.
I moved along close by the Boer leaders, and was
disappointed, though not astonished, to find as we
neared the place where the conference was to take
place that treachery was intended, for we passed about
forty men hidden behind bushes and scrub before we
halted to await the arrival of Mr. Penton and Harry.
The Boers now dismounted, and I was also forced to
do the same; but under the pretext of stroking Pelican
with my sound arm I managed to loosen the knot that
fastened his halter round his knee, so that it would
easily slip off with a slight pull, and I might possibly
have a chance to ride for my life if I could remount
him and get a chance to attempt to escape in the mêlée
which I saw was inevitable.


## p. 279 (#281) ############################################

MISTAKEN SIGNS.
279
Mr. Penton and Harry were accompanied by the
three Griquas—David, Moses, and Elias—and Horoye.
And I was glad to see that all were armed, which gave
me some hope that they might be able to fight their
way out of the trap which was set for them and into
which they were unconsciously advancing.
But the Boers were quite equal to the occasion, and
before they came within six hundred yards of where we
were halted, Jan rode out unarmed, and said that
there were only three of the Boers besides himself
present, and that they were unarmed, and that there-
fore Mr. Penton must send back his arms and the
Griquas, as then he, Harry, Horoye, and myself would
be equal in number to the Boer leaders and himself.
David, who had some knowledge of Boer treachery,
begged of Mr. Penton not to be so rash as to consent to
this; but, unfortunately, signs which I made to try to
convey the information that treachery was intended
were construed by Harry into signs of welcome. The
Griquas rode slowly back with the arms, and the other
three came on with Jan to their fate.
I, at all risks, intended to warn them, and as soon as
they came within hailing distance I shouted to them to
ride for their lives. But it was almost too late. I was
instantly knocked down and bound, and the men who
had been in hiding sprang to their feet and opened fire
on my three friends.
Horoye, who was strong and active and had kept a
knife concealed about him, flung himself from his horse

on to Jan and stabbed him three or four times, the last
one, which penetrated inside the collar-bone, proving
immediately fatal.
Whilst he was doing this Mr. Penton and Harry had
stopped, and were for a moment undecided as to whether
to attempt my rescue or to return to camp. This
moment of indecision cost them dear, for Mr. Penton
was hit by a bullet and fell from his horse.
Harry was instantly beside him, and attempted to
raise him and get him across his saddle, but alone was
not strong enough to do so. Horoye, when he had
finished his struggle with Jan, saw how matters stood,
and before any of the Boers could reach them Mr.
Penton was hoisted up on his horse, and Horoye, jump-
ing on behind, held him in his arms, and all three
galloped for the camp followed by the bullets of the
Boers.
Fortunately, only the three leaders had kept their
horses, the others having been sent some distance in
rear, as there was no cover for them; and they did not
care about running the risk by themselves of pursuing
an unarmed wounded man, a boy, and a Bushman.
I could see this going on, as I had got on my feet
after being knocked down; and though I feared that
Mr. Penton must have been badly wounded, I was glad
to see that they arrived in camp, and that all our cattle,
which had been sent out in the morning to graze, were
driven into the laager before the Boers had time to cut
any of them off.


## p. 281 (#283) ############################################

SENTENCED TO DEATH.
281
As soon as the Boers saw their ambush had failed in
its main object, they closed in round the laager and
commenced again to fire at it; but not being over well
supplied with ammunition, they fired only when they
thought they had a good chance of their shots being
effective, and I was glad to see that on our side similar
tactics were pursued.
When the siege was again perfectly established, I was
brought before the Boer leaders; and one of them, who
spoke English fairly well, told me that as their friend
Jan was dead they intended to shoot me, but that out
of mercy they would give me till the next morning to
prepare myself. This was said to me as calmly as if he
were telling me they were going to kill a bullock.
I urged that I had not killed Jan, and that he had
met his death whilst engaged in an act of treachery;
but I might as well have spared my breath, for I was
told that any one who took the part of blacks against
white men deserved to be treated like them, and that in
dealing with the natives white men had the privilege
to use any means they chose.
· I was again bound, and placed under the guard of
four men, who were told that they were never to lose
sight of me for one moment; and thus I had to contem-
plate the fact that in less than twenty-four hours, unless
something almost miraculous occurred, my life would
be ended.

ALTHOUGH the time fixed for my death was so close,
the hours which I expected would be my last on earth
did not pass quickly away, but, on the contrary, seemed
to drag themselves out. I tried to think of what I had
done wrong during my short life, and to prepare myself
for appearing before the throne of my Maker.
Notwithstanding all my efforts to fix my mind on
religious subjects, I could not help other thoughts in-
truding, and wondering where Tom Batten was, and
whether he and his sister ever thought of their old
playfellow Jack Hooper, and what Job Motram would
say and think if ever he heard of the manner of my
death.
From them my thoughts turned to Mr. Polgarth, and
I thought of what he had told me when my mother
died, and tried hard to remember the prayers he had
read the night of her death, and I felt how glad I should
have been if I had taken my Bible and prayer-book

with me instead of leaving them in my waggon when
I started on my ride to Waterboer.
Curiously enough, although I thought my death was
as certain as anything could be, I found myself con-
stantly in my mind making plans for the future, and
thinking what I should do if certain things should
happen. All this did not prevent my watching to see
if the countenance of my guards gave the slightest hope
of my being spared, and to look for the smallest hope
of escaping
I about midnight fell asleep, and at four o'clock was
awoke by a scuffle between the men watching me and
a man who I heard was English by the language he
used, which was coarse and rough, but who evidently
was friendly to me.
I was astonished to find an Englishman among the
Boers, and was quite at a loss to know where he had
dropped from.
After some little time the struggle ceased, and the
man who had been interfering in my behalf came and
sat down by my side and said, "Take courage, my lad.
If it lies in my power you shall not be shot, and I think
I have been useful enough to these cowardly Dutchmen
to have some voice with the leaders."
"Why, who are you, and what are you, an English-
man, doing out here with them slaving and robbing ?".
"That's a long story to tell you now, but never mind
who or what I am, or why I am here, but be satisfied to
know that if I lose my own life I'll save yours. It

may make some amends for what I have done, and which
has brought me here. Now you go to sleep again;"
and softly,"only pretend. The men on guard are com-
ing nearer, and will hear what I am saying if I don't
take care."
I did as he told me, and soon I heard the guards
talking and laughing and, as far as I could understand,
making remarks about what fun it would be to see me
killed in the morning. My new-found friend evidently
had lain down near me, and I could hear him snoring
and breathing heavily as if he were asleep.
After a time I heard him whispering very low, but
at the same time slowly and clearly, to say that he
would do what he could to save me by begging my
life of the leaders, but that if he did not do it in that
way he still had a plan by which I might possibly
be saved.
He said he had sent a slave whom he could trust into
our camp to tell Mr. Penton that it was the intention
of the Boers to shoot me in the morning at seven o'clock,
and that out of bravado they intended to do it on a
piece of rising ground full in view of our camp. He
had sent in to say that he had hopes of getting me
spared, and that if the leader, Hans Zwartbooi, would
consent, he would by some means manage to arrange
for me to escape and rejoin my friends.
He had great hopes that he would prevail on Hans
(who was the man who set my arm) to let me be
spared, as he personally was averse to my being shot,

287
and had only consented to it to pacify some friends of
Jan van Neeldt's who were clamorous for revenge.
If I was to be let off, he had arranged that he should
wave a white cloth, where it could be seen by my friends
in camp. If, however, Hans was overruled by those
who wished for my death, he would wave a red cloth,
and they were to be ready to make a dash out and
assist him in getting me away.
He would have my horse ready for me, and when I
was brought up he would cut my bonds, and attack
alone the men who would be told off to shoot me, and
I was to get on my horse and ride as hard as I could
towards my friends, who, the moment I had joined
them, were to turn back with me and make the best of
their way into camp.
"Now," he said, "I must not speak any more, or I
shall be raising suspicions more than I have already;
for when at first I came up to speak to you, the men
on watch tried to prevent my speaking to you at all,
and that was what we were having a tussle about when
you awoke."
Shortly after this I heard him get up and go away,
saying, as he left, something in Dutch, which caused the
other men to laugh very much.
In another half-hour it was daylight, and I was made
to get up, and the thongs which were on my legs were
cut, and I was seized on either side by my arms and
led away to the place selected for my execution.
As we got near the place I saw the men whom I judged

to be leaders standing together, and with them a fourth
man, who was arguing most vigorously with them.
The man who had set my arm, and whom I now knew
to be Hans Zwartbooi, seemed to be inclining to listen to
what he had to say, but the other two evidently were
opposed to him.
This fourth man I supposed to be my new-found
friend, and was assured of it when I noticed that round
his waist he had a red scarf, whilst knotted loosely
round his neck was a white one. Near these four were
some horses, and among them I was delighted to see my
trusty Pelican, with saddle and bridle on him.
I watched the speakers with intense interest, and
especially the hands of the Englishman, to see whether
he would first touch the red or the white cloth. Sud-
denly I saw him knock down the man standing next to
Hans, and tear off the red scarf, wave it over his head,
and come running towards me.
I called to Pelican, and the faithful and intelligent
beast came at once galloping to me, and attacked the
man who was holding me on the left. The man on my
right, in his astonishment, let me go, and my country-
man almost threw me into the saddle, saying, "Ride
for your life!" and then ran towards the other horses.
In an instant all was in wild confusion: some men
ran to their horses, others got their guns ready; but
fortunately, we were so mixed up with the Boers that
they did not dare to fire.
My rescuer got on to his horse after a short struggle,

RIDING FOR LIFE.

and came galloping after me, shouting to me to ride for
my life. Some of the Boers who were between us and
the camp tried to snatch at our bridles, but fortunately
failed; and owing to the surprise, we got at least fifty
yards start of any men who were mounted.
As we cleared the Boers I saw about a dozen horse-
men coming out of the camp to meet us, and among
them I could see my dear old Harry, and by his side
was running the faithful Nero.
As soon as their front was clear of their own people
the Boers opened fire on us, and the mounted men who
were pursuing us rode on either side so as not to mask
their guns. It seemed marvellous to me that none of
the bullets which were flying past us should strike either
myself or my companion, and for some time we seemed
to bear a charmed life. But when we were about four
hundred yards from Harry and the men accompanying,
I felt Pelican reel, and then became aware that he had
been struck by a bullet just behind the saddle, and
immediately after another brought him to the ground.
My mysterious Englishman instantly pulled up his
horse, and jumping to the ground dragged me clear of
my unfortunate steed, and placing me on his own saddle
told me to push on again, whilst he would run by my
side hanging on to the stirrup leather. The mounted
Boers closed in at once, and were within a dozen yards
of us, when Harry and his men rode right into them,
and in a moment there was a furious conflict with
clubbed muskets.

SAVED.
I could see Horoye using his spear with effect, but
soon had to pay attention to myself, for the Boers
seemed to be more intent on re-capturing me than on
anything else. My rescuer did his best to defend me,
but he was soon felled to the ground by a blow on the
head from the butt of a musket, which his opponent fol-
lowed up by discharging a pistol into his prostrate body.
Two Boers had by this time seized me, and one draw-
ing a knife was about to stab me, when with a
desperate bound Nero sprang on him and dragged him
to the ground. My other opponent was at the same
moment stabbed with a spear by Mokantse, who seemed
to be emulating his fellow-tribesman.
Notwithstanding the almost superhuman exertions
of those whom Harry had led to our relief, it seemed as
if we should be beaten, and that the Boers would score
a decisive triumph; when suddenly we heard the noise
of firing and a wild yell, and the fifty men promised by
Waterboer dashed in to our rescue. This welcome rein-
forcement enabled us to collect our wounded and make
good our return into camp; though much to my grief poor
Pelican had to be left dead on the scene of the conflict.
The Englishman who had stood my friend we found
to be insensible and bleeding badly from a bullet
wound through the body; but we managed to stanch
the bleeding and carry him in with us.
Harry's delight at seeing me again was unbounded ;
and Nero tried hard in a leonine manner to express his
joy at having been of use.

SORELY ANXIOUS-NEITHER DANGEROUS—"IS THE BOY SAFE?"_"CURIOUS IT IS,
LAD" --SAVED FROM DROWNING-HARRY'S NARRATIVE-AN UNEXPECTED
LETTER-SPLENDID NEWS-OUR PLANS-MY ARM RESET-THOMAS COMBE-
HIS HISTORY.
On getting into camp, as may be imagined, we had
much to speak about as to what had occurred during
our separation, and I was most anxious to know if
Mr. Penton's wound was serious.
I found him lying on a bed under one of the wag-
gon tilts, which had been placed on the ground and
surrounded by an earthen bank. He looked very
pale and wan, and was only able to speak with dif-
ficulty.
"Welcome, Jack," he said ; "I'm glad to see you
here again, for I've been sorely anxious about you, and
hardly expected that Harry would be able to save you.
You must have had a rough time of it. What is the
matter with your arm ?".
"Broken, sir. Can they bring the man who saved
me in here? He is wounded."
" Certainly; this is only one of the wards in our
hospital. Who and what is he?"

IN THE CAMP HOSPITAL.
"I can't make out, sir, except that he is an English-
man."
" All right, have him here; and Harry must act as
surgeon, as he has for me."
"Where are you wounded, sir? I hope it is not
dangerous."
"Why, no, neither is dangerous in this climate;
but one bullet has gone through my thigh, and I lost
a lot of blood before the bleeding was stopped; and
the other went through my shoulder, and the bullet
lodged just under the skin, so that Harry could cut it
out without any trouble. There, now, we must both
be quiet. You want sleep; and you may thank God
for his mercy in having preserved you from the immi-
nent danger in which you have been, and pray to be
delivered out of the many perils by which we are
surrounded."
"Very good, sir;" and seeing Green Boy bringing in
my bed, I lay down, by no means unthankful to be
again able to stretch my limbs on it.
As I lay down the Englishman was brought and
placed in another corner, and Harry examined his
wounds and reported them to Mr. Penton, who said
he was afraid that the wound through the body would
prove fatal.
"Give him some brandy, Jack, and try to revive
him."
As the brandy was poured down his throat, he
opened his eyes, and looking round said, "Where am

MY DELIVERER.
293
I? What has happened ?" and put his hand up to
his head, where he had a severe scalp wound from the
blow which had felled him to the ground.
After a minute or two more he said, "Is the boy
safe ?"
I got up and went over, and kneeling down beside
him said that he had saved my life, but that I feared
he had sacrificed his own in doing it.
"My life is worth nothing; I am not sorry to lose
it. I cannot return to live among Englishmen, and I
hate those brutal, cowardly Boers. I shall be glad to
die, and perhaps your life being saved by me may
count on the credit side of the ledger up above. What
is your name, boy? I seem to know your face."
"My name ? why, Jack Hooper.".
" Jack Hooper! How strange it is! Was your
father a sailor ?"
" Yes; he was a warrant-officer in the navy."
"Curious it is, lad; he saved my life many years
ago. Where is he now ?"
"Why, he died almost directly after I was born.
He was killed in an action with a slaver."
"Well, it must be him. He was boatswain of the
Euphrosyne, was he not ?"
" Yes, he was boatswain in her, and it was when
away in one of her boats he was killed."
: "I wish almost he had never saved me, except that
by doing you a good turn I have now in some measure
repaid the debt."

NOT AN UNCOMMON HISTORY.
I began to think that the man must be wandering,
and to wonder how he could possibly know that my
father had been boatswain of the Euphrosyne.
He, however, said, " There is no need to be astonished.
My history, I am sorry to say, is not an uncommon
one, and it may be some use to you to know it.
"I was a young fellow in a Somersetshire town in
good employment, but owing to getting into trouble
over a poaching row I left home and enlisted; and my
regiment being sent to the Cape, I accompanied it.
When we were being landed, the boat in which I was
capsized close under the bows of the Euphrosyne, and
your father jumping overboard caught hold of me and
held me up till boats arrived. Five of my comrades
were drowned, as we were all in heavy marching order.
I found out your father's name, and at that time hav-
ing some hope of getting on, made a resolution that
some day I would repay him. The temptations of
Cape Town, however, proved too much for me, and I
was constantly in trouble, and the adjutant and ser-
geant-major had me in their bad books."
Here Mr. Penton interfered and said, " You both had
better go to sleep. Harry, when he comes in, shall
make you a sleeping draught; you will both be the
better for a sound sleep.
" David, where is Harry Tregear ?"
David replied that Harry was talking to the chief
of the party of Waterboer's men, and arranging the
turns in which the guard was to be kept.


## p. 295 (#297) ############################################

HARRY'S NARRATIVE.
295
" All right, David, you can manage. Get that small
box and bring it here."
David brought the box, which was a medicine-chest,
and Mr. Penton compounded a draught, which he
divided into three parts, and making the stranger and
myself each drink one, swallowed the other himself.
In a few minutes I was plunged into a deep slumber,
and did not wake again until past nine in the evening.
I found Harry sitting by my bedside bathing my fore-
head, and when he saw I was awake he got up and
said, " Now I must feed you;" and calling for David,
told him to bring him soup, which as I swallowed it
seemed to give me fresh life.
I inquired after Mr. Penton and my friend, and was
told 'they were both still asleep, and the best thing
that could be done by me would be to follow their
example.
I did not feel sleepy, and my head being nearly free
of pain, while my arm was feeling much better, I asked
Harry to tell me what had happened between the time
of my leaving the camp and my return to it.
He said that when Horoye and I started off, Mr.
Penton and himself set to work with all hands to
strengthen the camp; but as they did not anticipate
being attacked by such a large body, had gone to work
leisurely, and planned the laager so as to contain all the
cattle, and to give protection to any more fugitives
who might come in.
Whilst they were employed on this Mokantse came in

296
AN UNEXPECTED LETTER.
with the news of the big commando that we had seen ;
and they immediately set to work as quickly as possible
to alter the plan of the camp, and sent all the cattle
they could possibly spare away back towards the Orange
River, and had also sent messages to any bodies of
English hunters or traders that might be about of
what was going on, so that if they were few in number
they might seek safety in flight, or if they were strong
enough to do so with any chance of success they might
come to our assistance.
He also said that he was glad to think that the
Boers had not suspected that any cattle or men had
been sent away, for some of the natives constantly got
through their lines and brought in news; and all the
waggons that I had seen were in the Boers' laager,
and there were no tracks leading in the direction of
the Orange River.
While he was speaking David came in and said that
two Bechuanas had come in and had important news.
One I recognized instantly as one of the leaders of the
sixty Bakwain I had engaged at Waterboer's camp, and
he came to say that if we could draw the Boers away
from their waggons he and his men would rush in and
set them on fire, and that the Boers would then soon be
reduced to offering terms, or to withdraw without any.
The other was a stranger to me and also to Harry;
but he brought the best news of all, for from out of
his woolly locks he drew a big quill, inside of which
was rolled up a letter, which read as follows:-


## p. 297 (#299) ############################################

SPLENDID NEWS.
297
"GRAHAM'S CAMP, ORANGE RIVER.
"SIR AND COUNTRYMAN,—I hear that you have got
into a mess with the Boers. We have twelve English
here and fifty natives well armed. Have sent to
Duncan, who is two days' waggon from here, with
seven men and thirty niggers, to come and join me.
On arrival will march to help you. When you see
two rockets south-east from you send out all men to
attack Boers, we doing same. Answer rockets. Our
men have sign and countersign-Scotland and Montrose.
" Trusting we shall give the Boers a tidy hiding,
"Yours to command,
"DONALD GRAHAM."
"Hurrah! Jack, we are all right now, and these
Boers will catch it hot."
"Yes; only we must be careful they do not hear of
this, as they would bolt if they thought we had any-
thing like the number of Englishmen coming to assist
us. We must write to them; I suppose we must wake
Mr. Penton."
"Yes, I suppose we must. Ah, there he is moving;"
and immediately we heard Mr. Penton asking for a
drink of water.
" All right, sir," said Harry. "We have splendid
news. Jack's natives are close to the Boers' laager;
and here is a letter from one Donald Graham saying
he will come to help us."
" That is good news indeed! Bring me the letter."


## p. 298 (#300) ############################################

OUR PLAN OF ATTACK.
After reading the letter he said, " Well, I hope Mr.
Graham and Mr. Duncan will come up soon. Where
is the messenger ?".
"Here he is, sir; he is waiting for an answer."
"Find out from him when the traders will be up,
for we must have all ready; and Mr. Graham's letter
is not dated."
Through David he told us that he had been longer
on the march than he ought, as he did not know which
water we were at; but that he had sent men to direct
them, and he expected that they would arrive the
next night.
" All right. Now, Harry, you are the only one who
can write; get my desk, and write :-
"CAMP OF REFUGE, Tuesday Night.
"SIR, I have received your generous offer, and thank
you for it. I can now turn out about a hundred guns,
and there are sixty or seventy natives outside waiting
for a chance to attack Boers' laager. Will answer your
rockets with two others, and when we sally out send
up another. Make first signal when you are very close,
as my men shall sleep by their horses, and can start
within five minutes. Excuse my letter; but out of
four English in camp three are wounded, myself among
the number.—Yours faithfully,
"RICHARD PENTON."
When Mr. Penton had signed the letter with his left

hand, he gave it to the messenger, who put it in the
same hiding-place that had served for the one he had
brought in, and started off again at once.
"Now, let us see Jack's Bechuana."
"David, you tell him to keep hid, and wait quite
quiet till he sees two fires go up, up, up into the sky
out there beyond those stars" (pointing to the Southern
Cross), "and then make plenty stars; he then must look
here, and he will see two more; then wait a little bit,
and he see one more here, then he will know plenty of
men fight the Boers, and he and his men run in and
make big fire under the waggons, and drive all the
oxen and horses away. Does he understand ?"
"Yes, sir; he understands, and says he must get
away at once, as the day will soon break, and he must
get through the Boers before it is light."
"All right; tell him to be careful.
"How are you, Jack, this morning ?"
"Pretty well, sir, thank you; but my arm is painful."
"Ah! that must be seen to; for though your friend
Hans Zwartebooi may be a very good surgeon, the
knocking about you have had since has very likely
displaced the bone again."
Harry and David, under Mr. Penton's direction, took
the bandages and splints off my arm and reset the bone,
which was out of place, and my arm had contracted
very much. Stretching my arm and getting the two
ends of the bone together was most painful, and I
could not help giving vent to a groan or two, which

"IS THE BOY SAFE?"
woke up the Englishman, who had hitherto been sleep-
ing quietly.
He gave a start, and said, " Where am I? They
have not made me a prisoner, have they ?"
"No," said Mr. Penton ; "you are safe, and among
friends."
"Safe, and among friends who speak English. No,
it can't be. Where am I ?"
"In our camp, which is surrounded by Boers."
"Yes, I remember; and the boy—is the boy safe ?
They wanted to shoot him; but bad as Thomas Combe
has been he would not see a brave boy murdered,
especially when he had the eyes of the sailor who
saved my life."
"I am here all safe. How is your wound ?"
"Am I wounded ?-I feel no pain; but I am deadly
cold. Promise you won't give me up."
"Give you up! why, and to whom ?"
"To the provost-marshal."
"Why, there is no provost-marshal here north of the
Orange River."
Thomas Combe, as we must now call him, fell back
fainting, and Harry had much trouble to bring him to
again; but after some time he succeeded, and gave him
some hot coffee and brandy, which seemed to give him
some strength.
He, as soon as he was able to speak, said, "I wish to
tell my history, and let the old regiment know I was
not so bad as they thought me. It was the Forty-third

COMBE'S STORY.
301
I belonged to; and as I told you last night, I got into
bad ways at Cape Town, and was constantly up before
the colonel and the adjutant. I sometimes tried to
pull up, but always thought the sergeant-major had a
grudge against me, and I never seemed to be able to
keep out of the orderly-room.
"One day when I was in my barrack - room the
sergeant-major came in and told me I was under arrest
for breaking into a spirit-store in the town the night
before. Now, bad as I was, I was never a thief, and I
answered him. I was tried by court-martial for theft
and insubordination, and found guilty of both, though
of the theft I was as innocent as a child, and was sen-
tenced to be flogged and imprisoned.
"When the regiment was paraded to witness my
flogging, I felt as if I were mad, and considering the
sergeant-major as the cause of my disgrace, I broke
from my escort and rushed at him and knocked him
down."
Here Combe became too exhausted to speak, and
Mr. Penton said he had better try to sleep again, and
made Harry give him another sleeping draught.

PREPARE A TRAP FOR THE BOERS-COMBE CONTINUES HIS HISTORY-HOW HE
JOINED THE BOERS—"LORD BE MERCIFUL TO ME A SINNER"-COMBE'S
BURIAL-ANXIOUS WATCHING-REMAIN IN CAMP-HOW UNWISE WE HAD
BEEN-A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER-RESOLVE TO DIE FIGHTING.
THE Boers all day long kept worrying us, and firing
when they could see any one, and several of our natives
were wounded, and we had serious losses among our
cattle—so much so that Harry, coming in from looking
round the camp about noon, said he did not think we
had more unwounded oxen than would furnish teams
for two waggons; and so many horses had been hit
that not more than half of our men could be mounted.
After some little consideration, Mr. Penton said we
might try to prepare a trap for the Boers, and make
them cease from their constant annoyance, and told
Harry what he was to do.
There was a portion of the fence of the first and
larger camp (which had been abandoned) still standing,
and behind it was a rifle-pit. Into this pit Harry was
told to put a couple of kegs of powder ; these were then
covered over with earth, and a piece of quick match
led from them to the muzzle of a pistol, which, by


## p. 303 (#305) ############################################

SENTENCED TO BE SHOT.
303
having its trigger tied up and the hammer kept back
by a slip-knot, was converted into a sort of spring-gun.
The fence was then pulled down, and opposite it we
made as if we were going to make a sally. The Boers,
coming down to resist us, came over this impromptu
mine, and the pistol being fired, no less than five were
blown up and several more burned and injured.
After this lesson, which we supplemented by a sharp
fire of musketry, they withdrew out of range and left
us in quietness.
We all felt some curiosity as to the termination of
Thomas Combe's story, and when in the afternoon he
again woke up he continued his narrative.
"You remember," he said, "I told you I had knocked
the sergeant-major down before the whole regiment
when it was drawn up to witness my being flogged.
I, of course, was instantly seized, and put in irons as a
mutineer. I was again tried by court-martial, and this
time I was sentenced to be shot.
"The governor, intending to be merciful, let me off
the sentence of death, and I was instead to be sent to
Botany Bay in the first convict-ship that called at the
Cape to water. Stories of the life at Botany Bay were
common among us, and I begged and prayed that I
might be shot at once, and not sentenced to a punish-
ment which I considered ten times worse than death.
"I was confined in the old jail, and I often tried to
think of some way by which I might escape; but I
was considered a dangerous character, and whenever I

was taken out of my cell I was heavily ironed, and
watched by sentries with loaded muskets.
"One night the jail caught fire. I was brought out
and handcuffed and delivered over to a guard. There
was a certain amount of confusion, and I took advan-
tage of it and the darkness. My handcuffs formed a
ready weapon, and dashing them in the face of one of
the escort, I bolted down a narrow street and ran as
if I had wings to my feet.
"I had, when free, known some of the back slums of
the town, and there I now bent my steps, feeling
certain that once in some of the dens that I had heard
of, a fugitive from justice would have nothing to fear.
I was taken in, and welcomed. No questions were
asked me when my prison garb and handcuffs were
seen, and I was hidden away for some days.
"At last the landlord of the house where I was
hiding came and told me of a chance to get away to
join the Boers; and I was sent out of Cape Town
hidden in an empty wine-barrel, passing right by my
old regiment drawn up for another punishment parade.
"Since then (which is now between seven and eight
years ago) I have been trekking with the Boers, and
being a good shot, and having no care for my life, I
have been useful to them in their commandos, and I
have been as bad as any of them in their treatment of
the natives.
"When I first heard they were going to attack
English travellers I was delighted, for I have always

nourished a hatred against my country for what I
considered her evil treatment of me; but when I heard
you were to be shot, I said I would not be any party
to such a cold-blooded murder. And when I saw your
brave bearing, and your likeness to the man who had
saved my life so many years ago, I determined at all
risks and hazards to save your life.
"There, that is the story of my life, and I am not
sorry it is finished. I could not go back to the Boers,
and to return to any town would mean that I was to
be transported.
" Could one of you read me a prayer? I wish the
boy whose life I saved to pray for me."
Harry got me my prayer - book, and I read such
prayers as I thought suitable, and also the parable of
the Pharisee and the Publican. Combe seemed so free
from pain that I said after a time I hoped he would
recover, and surely he would not be known after all
these years, and could begin afresh.
"No, my lad; I feel what it is. I shall die soon,
and die suddenly—the blood will choke me. I feel as if
something in my chest would burst. Read that again,
will you."
I read the parable again, and also the words of our
Saviour to the penitent thief.
Combe said, "I was never a thief, but I've been a
sinner-Lord be merciful to me a sin—." The last
syllable was never uttered, for a rush of blood came
which, as he had foretold, ended his life.
(29)

WATCHING ANXIOUSLY.
We arranged to bury him at once. And I know I
prayed most heartily that his last prayer might be
heard and answered.
Mr. Penton said he had no doubt that God would
regard him mercifully, as he had given up his life in a
good action, and his misdeeds had been more the faults
of circumstance and temperament than actual crime.
The burial was soon performed, and a cross was put
at his head to mark the spot, and on it we marked
T. C., and the date of his death, and wrote the words
which had been on his lips when dying.
By the time the grave was filled up it was sunset;
and we prepared all the men for the sally we were to
make when the rockets were seen, only fifteen men with
guns being kept in camp to defend it and the wounded.
Harry was to lead our men; and although I was
counted among the wounded I determined that I
should ride out too, and arranged with Horoye that
he would give up his horse to me and run alongside,
holding on to my stirrup-leather. I was obliged to
keep this arrangement secret, as I was sure Mr. Penton
would not hear of my going out to join in the fray
with a broken arm.
As the sun went down the Boers closed in again,
and commenced a dropping fire, which annoyed us
greatly without doing us any injury except that it com-
pletely prevented any one from sleeping. We watched
anxiously for the rockets. Eight o'clock passed-nine,
ten, eleven, midnight, one o'clock.


## p. 307 (#309) ############################################

" TURN OUT THE MEN!"
307
"Surely they won't come to-night, Harry," said I, as
we looked at the watch.
"I am afraid not, and we shall have another day here.
I want to move for Mr. Penton's sake; the ground is
getting foul, and his wounds do not look too healthy."
"There—there—there are the rockets !" said I, as
two shot up about east-south-east from us.
"They have got further round the Boers than we
thought. So much the better. Now I will let off ours."
"David—Moses, turn out the men."
"Now, remember, all you meet who say to you 'Scot-
land, you answer · Montrose,' and they are friends."
"How can our men know that, sir ? they will know
the Boers, and that will be enough."
"Good-bye, Jack; you look after the camp," said
Harry. "You must attend well to Mr. Penton, as he
is getting feverish, and perhaps the anxiety as to how
we are getting on will make him worse." And he sprang
into his saddle.
I said, "Good-bye and good luck, Harry," and we
exchanged hand-grips. I saw at once how selfish and
wrong I had been in proposing to go out with the
sortie, and when Horoye came with the horse I told
him I was not going.
He seemed very much astonished, and said he would
stop in himself, and that perhaps it would be a good
thing to keep one horse in camp, so as to send any
messages out to the scene of the fight that might be
necessary.


## p. 308 (#310) ############################################

308
AN OMINOUS SILENCE.
As soon as our party had started I had the other
rocket sent up, and then having stationed a guard
across the gap by which they had sallied out, went
back to Mr. Penton, who, as Harry had said, was very
feverish.
"Well, Jack, are they out?"
." Yes, sir; all gone but Horoye, who won't leave me.
He has kept his horse in too."
"That's quite right. I think we should have kept
three or four; but Harry seemed so anxious that I let
him take all. It seems very quiet, I can't understand
it. Our men must be in the Boers' lines now."
"Yes, they must be past them. I wonder whether
they have found out about our sortie. I will go round
and see all the men at their posts, and will tie up the
dogs at intervals all round. Nero will go with me, and
I can trust him to give an alarm if any stranger comes
near the camp."
"Very well: let all the wounded come here; and tell
the men if, as I am afraid may be the case, and from
hearing no firing it is probable that the Boers have
caught the messenger—tell all the men in camp to rally
here, to make a stand if they make a counter attack."
" All right, sir."
I went out with Horoye and Nero and went all
round, and could see how easily we could be rushed
by the Boers, and how unwise we had been in sending
so many men out.
Two or three times I went round the camp, and all

A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER.

seemed quiet; but I could not understand not hearing
any sounds of a struggle between the Boers and our
people or the new-comers.
At last the dogs began to bark on the west of the
camp, and I could hear the sound of a number of men
advancing from that side; and Nero, giving a roar,
dashed out, but came back immediately on my calling
him, as I knew he could have no chance, being still
only a cub, if he went out alone against the Boers.
I told the men on that side of the camp to fire at
the people who were advancing, who, from the shouts
and orders given in Dutch which I could now hear, I
knew must be our enemies, and then to retreat on the
central part, where Mr. Penton and the other wounded
were.
Horoye I told to ride after Harry and tell him to
hurry back; and rushing into the centre myself, with
the aid of Green Boy, who had remained in camp, com-
menced sending up rockets as fast as I could, to show
that we were in danger.
In a few minutes the Boers were pouring into our
camp, and we had a desperate encounter. I seized an
axe, and with my left hand hacked at any of our
opponents that came within my reach; and all the men,
wounded and unwounded, seconded me loyally.
Fortunately the Boers were much puzzled by not
knowing their way about the camp, and we were able
to make a good stand.
Nero was of the greatest possible use, and four or

five times, by springing on men who were attacking
me, foiled them, and I believe saved my life; for, crip-
pled as I was by my broken arm, I could by no pos-
sibility have warded off many of the blows that were
aimed at me.
Notwithstanding all our efforts the Boers were surely
overpowering us, and I found myself at last with only
seven men trying to defend the waggon tilt under
which Mr. Penton and some of our wounded who were
unable to move without assistance were lying.
I made up my mind that all was over with us, and
resolved to die fighting, and not to surrender myself
again into the hands of the Boers, as they were invit-
ing us to do. What I had already experienced when
I was in their power was quite enough to deter me
from ever trusting them.
Just as I was entirely hopeless, and could hear that
they were forcing their way under the tilt behind, the
sound of horses' feet fell upon my ears, and Harry and
his men came dashing back into camp, and I knew we
were saved.

OF IT-TOO UGLY.
The aspect of affairs was now entirely changed, and
the Boers, instead of acting on the offensive and asking
us to surrender, commenced to retreat; and many threw
down their arms and begged for quarter, which was
readily granted; and in about ten minutes we found
ourselves again in undisputed possession of our camp,
and with twenty-three prisoners in our hands.
The time from the Boers being first made out attempt-
ing to storm till the fighting was over was only twenty-
five minutes ; but out of the fifteen unwounded men
who had been with me in camp when it commenced,
only four escaped scot free. Mr. Penton, when we
went in to see him, was very anxious to know what
had happened, and said he had been very much to
blame in allowing so few to be left in camp.
From our prisoners we learned, as we had supposed,
that our messenger had been surprised; and although

A MYSTERY EXPLAINED.
for some time he denied all knowledge of us, and said
he was only trying to get past the place to the Kalahari
Desert, after having been tortured by a raw-hide thong
being twisted round his head, and splinters forced in
under his finger nails, had confessed all, and given up
Mr. Penton's letter; after which he was shot without
any ceremony.
One of our prisoners confessed that he had assisted
in the torture, and seemed much astonished that we
should be disgusted and indignant at such things being
done to a black. If it had not been for Mr. Penton's
strict orders that, as he was a prisoner, he was to be
treated kindly until he had had a trial, the temper of
our natives was such, when they heard what he had
done, that he ran a very good chance of having similar
tortures inflicted on himself.
We were very much puzzled all this time to know
what could have become of Graham and Duncan and
their men, when in the south-west two rockets were
seen to go up, and we saw that we had been deceived;
but how the Boers could have obtained rockets was at
first to us a mystery.
The mystery, however, was soon explained when our
prisoners, who seemed inclined to purchase their safety
by revealing all the counsels of their leaders, told us
that Jan had taken a dozen away with him in his
baggage.
As the attack of the Boers had been frustrated, we
thought we could send out some men to meet those

A GREAT FIRE.

coming to our relief; but this time, taught by ex-
perience, we kept forty men and some horses in camp.
The answering rockets were at once sent up, and as
our men started, the single one.
Horoye, who again stopped behind, came to me a
few minutes after with the news that there was a
great fire in the direction of the Boers' laager, so that
evidently the Bakwain and Bakalahari were successful
in their attempt. I took this good news to Mr. Penton,
and he seemed to be much benefited by it, and the
feverishness from which he had been suffering seemed
to leave him as if by magic.
"All right, my boy, we are safe now, and the Boers
must retreat: and I am glad to say Waterboer and his
people will benefit as much as we; for though he was
grasping in the terms he extorted from you for sending
us assistance, we must remember the condition in which
he found himself. You had better have a couple of big
fires lighted, to show the position of our camp."
I left at once to see this done, and could hear when
I got outside the tilt the sound of musketry in the
direction in which Graham was advancing.
I had scarcely kept count of time from the time of
the commencement of the Boers' attempt to rush us,
and could have saved myself the trouble about the fires,
for by the time they were blazing up day broke.
As soon as we could see clearly, the signs of the mid-
night conflict were clearly evident in the way in which
our camp was disordered, and the dead bodies which

314
DEFEATED WITH HEAVY LOSS.
were lying about, no fewer than seven Boers having
been killed, and four of our men; and, curiously enough,
all these four were men who should have gone out with
Harry the night before, but who through fear had re-
mained behind. They had been unwilling to let me see
them, and had been hiding right in the line the Boers
chose for their attack.
We set to work to bury the dead bodies and clear up
the camp; and whilst we were busy about this, Graham
and Duncan rode into camp with Harry and some of
their party, with the news that the Boers were com-
pletely defeated with heavy loss, and that some of
them were prisoners, and the remainder of the sur-
vivors were in full flight and being pursued by about
seventy men. Their waggons had some been burned,
and the others were prize of war, whilst a number of
the natives were driving their cattle in.
Graham and Duncan were two hard Scots who had
for many years been hunting and trading from the
Cape, and were now bound for Damara and Namaqua
land.
Mr. Penton welcomed them warmly, and thanked
them for their kindly assistance. But they said it was
the other way, for the Boers had required a lesson, as
they were becoming very overbearing, and had done
much to render it impossible to hunt or to trade except
in such large parties as to render the profits to be made
very small.
"Thank God," said Graham, " they've even got siccan

a drubbing that I consider that they will not be com-
ing this way again in a hurry. We canna get our
governors and their councils to put faith in the word
of a canny trader, and they believe all these loons of
Hollanders say, and enact laws which enable them to
reive and lift cattle and slaves wherever they choose.
But, master, you are sair wounded. There is a medical
man here, who has come up for scientific purposes, and
collects a wheen plants and other matters; but he is an
unco clever man, and will soon cooper you up in a
business-like fashion."
In a few minutes more Dr. Maclean, who was the
medical man referred to, and who, as Graham had said,
was with him for the purpose of studying the botany
of the country, rode up, and immediately attended to
Mr. Penton's wounds. The one in the thigh he pro-
nounced to be going on well, and requiring nothing
but careful dressing; but the one in the shoulder did
not look at all well, and after careful examination he
pronounced that there was some foreign substance in
it, and that it would be necessary to probe the wound
to find out what this was.
After about an hour's search, he found a piece of
cloth, and extracted it; after which he dressed the
wound, and told Mr. Penton that he would now do well.
He next wanted to look at my arm and head; but I
begged of him to look after the other wounded first.
And he soon had his hands full; and it was not till
late in the afternoon that he was able to come to me.

316
GATHERING THE CATTLE.
And when he did, he, on careful measurement, found
that my arm required setting again; and for the third
time I had to undergo that painful operation.
We were able to move out of our camp and form a
more commodious one, and pitch our tents, now that
the danger from the Boers was over; and comfortable
huts were built for all the serious cases among the
wounded.
The cattle that had been turned out into the veldt,
when Mokantse had come in with the news of the
approach of the Boers, had mostly strayed in the direc-
tion of the Orange River, and men were sent to collect
them and drive them into camp.
The cattle of the Boers, too, were collected; and as
they had many which they had robbed from the
Griquas and Bechuanas, these were turned over to the
men who had come to our assistance, and who now
were begging for their pay.
From the Griquas we learned that a great quantity
of ivory had been buried before the Boers arrived, and
that Waterboer would be very glad to trade. So a
message was sent to him to say that the Boers had
been driven back, and that there were two parties of
English traders who would be glad to buy any ivory
that he might have.
Having to wait for some time, the whole of the
waggons of Graham's and Duncan's parties were
brought up into our camp, and with ours and those
which had been captured from the Boers we formed

quite an imposing encampment, over which flew the
ancient flag of Scotland—blue, with a white St. An-
drew's cross—as Graham said he always used his own
flag, and did not care for any modern compromises like
the Union Jack
We found the whole of the two parties to be good,
genial fellows, though rather rough in their manners.
They all seemed to have led adventurous lives from
their earliest days; and if their stories were all to be
credited, the scenes which some of them had seen, and
the difficulties through which some of them had passed,
were more marvellous than anything which is related
in the veracious stories of Baron Munchausen.
One story in particular was told which is worth
repeating :-One man, an Irishman called Conolly, said
that once when he was on a hunting expedition he had
round that his companions, who were " Africanders,"
were not (to use his own term) congenial-or, as he
pronounced it, "conjaynial"-souls; and therefore, after
much considering, he determined on quitting the party
and going on his own hook, with his Hottentot boy Joe
as sole companion. He had a couple of horses, and all
his belongings (which were not much) were packed on
two oxen.
On quitting his companions he wandered on some
days, not caring much in which direction he went, but
mainly intent on putting as much distance between
himself and his late companions as possible. Game was
not plentiful, and he had to live on flour and pork,

CARRIED OFF BY MONKEYS.
which he carried in the packs on his oxen. This soon
began to diminish, and he saw that if he did not find
some means of replenishing his larder he would be
compelled to kill one of his oxen.
On one evening he was talking to Joe, and asked
him what could possibly be done to prevent the neces-
sity, and he saw that the oxen were listening attentively.
After this conversation he went to sleep; and when he
woke in the morning both the oxen were missing. He
and his boy started out to look for them, and followed
their spoor for some distance, when the tracks sepa-
rated; so he went after one, and his Hottentot after
the other.
After some time, he found himself entering a pass
between some small rocky hills, and he had not gone
far into it before he was suddenly attacked by some
enormous monkeys, who sprang on him before he had
time to get his gun out of its bucket, and dragged him
off his horse. He was in mortal terror lest they
should tear him in pieces, but they handled him as
gently as was compatible with preventing his escape,
and tied his hands and feet, and four of them took
him up and carried him. One, who seemed to be
the leader, got on his horse, and being able to use his
tail as a whip, had a decided advantage over a human
rider; but notwithstanding this, the horse seemed to
be very restive, and so the monkey who was on the
horse told two others to lead him.
Here one of Conolly's companions broke in with,


## p. 319 (#321) ############################################

THE MONKEYS VILLAGE.
319
"Come, Pat, you don't mean to say the monkey
spoke ?"
"Sure, and he did now; and it was a jintleman that
he was, for he discoorsed in the most lovely Irish."
"Oh! I never knew the Irish are related to monkeys."
"Sure, and being related to monkeys, as you call it,
is better than being descended from a frog; but it is
nothing of the sort at all, you black-avised loon." .
Conolly seemed now to be getting excited, and we,
being afraid that his story would be lost, begged him
to go on.
He continued ; and said that of course the monkey
did not speak in any language that he could under-
stand, but he made gestures and sounds which evidently
were understood by the others.
After proceeding in this manner for some distance,
they came to a place where the hills spread out and
encircled a level grassy plain, in the middle of which
there was a small lake. The hills were quite precipi-
tous towards this plain; and the only entrance into it
was by the way which they had come, and the last
seventy or eighty yards of this was through a tunnel,
which, when they had passed it, was closed by a huge
rock being rolled against its mouth.
On the shores of the lake was a village, and to this
Conolly's captors took him. He was placed on the
ground and unbound, but four huge monkeys with enor-
mous clubs stood by him as guards, to prevent his mak-
ing any attempt at escape.


## p. 320 (#322) ############################################

320
KIND TREATMENT.
A number of monkeys of various kinds collected to
look at him, and several of them examined him very
closely, and when they found his clothes came off
chattered with delight and stripped him.
Scarcely had this been finished when a very old
monkey, whose hair was nearly white with age, and
the top of whose head was quite bald, was carried out
of one of the huts in a sort of chair and placed in
front of Conolly.
After much discussion among the monkeys, Conolly
was taken to a hut, where fruits and water were given
him; and a portion of the thatch, which formed one
side, was removed, and replaced by bars, so that he
found himself in a sort of cage, and all the monkeys
filed past to look at him.
When he tried to get into a corner and cover him-
self, they got a long pole and stirred him up.
At last night came, and on his making signs for his
clothes they were given him, and he dressed himself,
much to the delight of the spectators.
He was kept in this cage for four days, during which
time he was stared at from morning to evening.
On the fifth morning he was taken out, and his horse
brought to him, and he was led out through the tunnel
and the gorge to the country outside, and eight large
tusks of ivory were brought by the monkeys and laid
down by him. He buried the tusks, and rode off to
look for his man and the oxen; and had not gone a
mile before he met them.


## p. 321 (#323) ############################################

"IS THAT TRUE?"
321
His man had found the oxen, and had also shot a
couple of antelopes; so they had plenty of food. They
returned and dug up the tusks, and loaded them on the
oxen; and some days after, meeting with some traders,
he sold the ivory and returned to Cape Town.
"Now, Pat, is that true?" said the same man who
had interrupted him before.
"Every word of it. Don't ye remimber meeting me
at Cape Town, and getting a treat at my expense ?
Where should I have been after having money enough
to treat you if I hadn't had the ivory ?"
"Well, you certainly never shot an elephant in your
life; and I remember your having some money once at
Cape Town, which you said you had got by selling
ivory, and I wondered how you had got it. Now the
mystery is explained."
"It's all true. And some day I intend to go and
take a collection of men to show for ivory—you are
too ugly, or I'd take you."
"All right, Pat; you never made up a story in your
life."

WHILST We were all laughing at Pat's story, Nero came
to where we were sitting near the fire, and lay down
between Harry and myself; and Pat pointed out how
he understood what we said, and that it was a proof
how animals were as intelligent as men.
I don't know what discussion might not have arisen
if Mr. Penton had not sent for me and Harry to come
to him at once.
On getting into Mr. Penton's tent he told us that he
had sent for us to tell us that his plans were entirely
altered. His wounds, Dr. Maclean said, were healing
rapidly; but he would not now be able to follow up
his intention of going up further north, and had made
up his mind, as soon as he could move, to return to
Cape Town, and he wanted Harry and me to superin-
tend the fitting up of a swinging cot in one of the
waggons, so that he could travel without jolting.
He said that when he got to Cape Town he would

323
take a passage to England, and that we should accom-
pany him; and after his health was completely re-
stored, he would come back to Africa and attempt the
journey, which now he had only undertaken in search
of sport, as a proper scientific one.
Dr. Maclean had told him how much there was to be
done in that line, and he had engaged him to come
with him; and in the meantime the doctor was to
travel with us and look after our health.
The doctor, coming in at this time, said, "Yes, my
lads; and I will not only look after your bodies, but
after your minds too. You are a pair of decent lads,
and gifted with intelligence, and I have no doubt but
that I might develop you into a couple of decent
naturalists in time."
The fitting up of the waggon occupied some days,
but the air was so healthy that all the wounded re-
covered as if by magic, and by the time the cot was
ready Mr. Penton had scarcely any need for it.
Waterboer and a number of his people had arrived
by this time with the ivory which had been spoken of,
and Graham and Duncan were able to fill their waggons
with ivory and skins; and Mr. Penton also let all
his stores go for ivory, so that when the dealing was
over the whole party was able to start in one body for
Port Elizabeth, the road to which place, according to
Graham, was better than that to Cape Town.
Acting on Mr. Penton's advice, Waterboer sent a
deputation of his principal men down to ask the

governor of the Cape to take steps to keep the Boers
under control, as, although they had now received a
heavy check, it was by no means unlikely that they
would in a few years render the country perfectly un-
inhabitable; and above all, he prayed that the restric-
tion on the sale of powder and guns to the natives by
Englishmen might be withdrawn, for it prevented
Griquas, Bechuanas, and all from being able to resist
the Boer raids, the Boers being able to get arms with-
out let or hindrance.
All the men who had come to our assistance were
not only paid what I had promised them, but Mr.
Penton gave them liberal rewards in addition ; and all
said that if ever he came to the country again they
would be his most devoted followers.
I wished the faithful Horoye to come with us, but
he said he did not want to go into any towns; and so
he and Mokantse were made happy with blankets,
tobacco, and beads, more than ever before had even
entered into the ideas of a Bushman; and in addition
they were each given a horse and a good rifle.
They, after much entreaty on my part, promised to
travel with us across the Karroo plains, but further
than that neither argument, entreaty, nor gifts could
persuade them to move.
As we were such a large party, it was determined
that we should move in three divisions, and we were
given the right of leading—the only difference in our
party, besides that caused by casualties in action,

AN UNLOOKED-FOR MEETING.
325
being that Jan's waggon was now given up to Dr.
Maclean.
Our journey was uneventful; neither Mr. Penton
nor myself being able to hunt, and Harry being much
taken up with the management of our teams and their
drivers. The doctor, indeed, often went out, but he
usually got so engrossed by some new plant or insect
that he quite forgot that the camp-kettle was empty,
and we soon gave up trusting to him as a caterer, and
depended for our supplies on the men among our
followers who were hunters.
Some distance from Port Elizabeth we were aston-
ished one day to see the white tents of an encampment
of soldiers; and laagering close by, we found that a
detachment of troops had been sent up under command
of Major Brownlow, on account of some disturbances,
and that Captain Smithson and his company formed
part of it.
As soon as they heard whom the waggons belonged
to, they came to see us, accompanied by Bates and
Stevens; and it took many an hour to tell to our
friends all that had occurred to us since we parted.
Major Brownlow, when he heard about our fighting
with the Boers, said, "I wish we would give those fel-
lows a jolly good thrashing; they want it, and unless
they have their combs cut, they will cause any amount
of trouble in South Africa."
"Yes," said Captain Smithson, "we are always
punishing Kafirs and natives, when in reality all the

trouble is caused by those cowardly Boers. There are
some decent Dutch Africans, like the Steindrups and
others of that class, but they are few and far between,
and the remainder are rapidly going back in civiliza-
tion, and becoming more brutalized from day to day."
"Now don't moralize, Smithson. I propose that
Penton, the doctor, and the two boys all come to mess
with us to-night. We are going to march to-morrow
morning for Port Elizabeth, and then I daresay the
skipper of the Dedalus, which is to take us to Cape
Town, will give you all a passage; and she will be more
comfortable than a coasting brig or schooner, which is ·
all you will find there."
"Certainly we will come. I hope the Dedalus will
take us. Is there room on board ?".
"Room! ay, room for ten times as many. She is a
fine frigate-built East Indiaman, and could carry a
whole regiment."
"Jack," said Captain Smithson, "one important
person has been left out of the invitation, so I will
include him, and that is Nero. He must come and
dine too. What shall I tell the mess-steward to get
ready for him ?"
"Oh! he will be contented with a sheep or two."
"Very well; now we have to go back to evening
parade. In an hour's time we shall expect you."
Harry and I were very much excited by the idea of
dining at the officers' mess, and consulted Mr. Penton
as to what we should do.


## p. 327 (#329) ############################################

A PLEASANT EVENING.
327
"Do ? why, though you were picked up by me, and
became boys in the Idalia, still we have been through
so much together, and you have both proved yourselves
so loyal and true, that I consider you in the light of
friends and not of servants, and will always treat you
as such in future."
"How shall we dress ? we have no clothes but these
skin suits."
"Never mind here; when we get to Port Elizabeth
I will get you some, and at Cape Town we can all
have a regular rig out."
At mess in the evening there was much interest
shown in our adventures; and I believe, if the officers
could have had their way, instead of returning to
Cape Town, they would all have at once started on an
expedition against the Boers.
Next morning we all marched together, but we
went further than the troops, and continuing to march
faster, arrived in Port Elizabeth three days before
they did.
Mr. Penton called on Captain Malcolmson of the
Dedalus, and asked if he could give us a passage to
Cape Town. The reply was, that he would have no objec-
tion, but that the ship being taken up by government,
he could not give permission, which would have to be
obtained from the officer commanding the troops.
On Mr. Penton saying that it was Major Brownlow's
own proposal that we should go in the Dedalus, the
worthy skipper at once said that that made it all

right, and that he would send his boats for all our
traps.
We had some difficulty in selecting what we were to
take with us, in the way of tusks, horns, and ivory,
with which Mr. Penton intended to decorate his house
in the Midlands. Harry and I also took a few things
as special curiosities, though where we were to stow
them in England we had not the remotest idea. What
we did not take was turned over to Graham and
Duncan, as well as our waggons and bullocks; and
they gave orders on their agents at Cape Town for
the amount.
They had done so well in trading ivory with Water-
boer, that they intended to go back again and work
up north to the country whence the Griquas said all
this ivory came, and were already enlisting men for
the expedition.
Our horses we took on board, as Mr. Penton said he
could not sell them after having served us so long and
faithfully, and intended giving them to his friends in
the Ninety-second to be taken care of, except two
which he gave to Duncan and Graham.
We now made arrangements to give a parting enter-
tainment to the English of the two trading parties, and
another to all our native followers and those of Duncan
and Graham.
We hired a large warehouse for the occasion, and
laid all Port Elizabeth under contribution. And the
affair passed off in a most satisfactory manner; and

loud cheering took place when Mr. Penton, in a speech
that he made after it was over, announced that he
would give each man a gun worth ten pounds, which
he hoped would be useful to them in the future, and
that they would all keep as a memento of their engage-
ment with the Boers. The natives, too, all received
presents, and Mr. Penton was that day the most
popular man in Port Elizabeth.
Graham proposed Mr. Penton's health, and said he
wished him all luck and prosperity, and trusted that
he would be restored to health, and that if ever he were
in South Africa again with his two lads, and required
assistance, that he might be at hand to render it.
· Conolly evoked much amusement by loudly declaring
that it was a burning shame that we were not all
Irishmen, and advising us, as we could not change our
nationality, to kiss the Blarney Stone and marry Irish
girls.
The day after this, the troops marched into Port
Elizabeth, and we rode out to meet them coming in.
Nero, who accompanied us, seemed much excited when
he saw the soldiers marching, and when the drums and
fifes struck up, gravely walked to the head of the band
and marched on in front.
Nero had been the only difficulty with Captain Mal-
colmson, as he said he did not care about the responsi-
bility of having such a dangerous animal on board; and
we had been trying to get a cage for him, but had not
hitherto succeeded. When we mentioned this to Major

Brownlow, he asked why we had not put him in a
horse-box; and poor Nero for the first time for months
was confined.
As soon as we had found that he was thoroughly
tamed, he had been allowed full liberty. He did not
seem to at all relish his confinement, but Harry and
myself managed to console him by constantly coming
and talking to him.
The troops were soon embarked on board the Dedalus,
and we went off in the last boat with the officers, being
loudly cheered as we left by Graham and Duncan and
their men.
The passage to Cape Town was short and without
incident, and when we arrived there we were made
lions of by all the residents of English extraction, on
account of our successful engagement with the Boers.
But many of the Dutch families did not fail to show
that they considered it would have been much better
if we all had been killed, and the Boers successful.
Waterboer's emissaries were secured an audience
of the governor by Mr. Penton's influence; but I have
never heard of anything being done in consequence of
their representations.
Our great anxiety was to get a passage home to
England as soon as possible, as Mr. Penton had received
letters which told him that his presence was urgently
required; and the first ship that was going to sail
being a fast-sailing French barque called the Corinne,
we took our passages on board her.

MR. PENTON, the doctor, Harry, and myself, together
with Nero, all embarked amid the hearty farewells of
Major Brownlow and his brother officers, and the
Corinne made sail with a fair wind.
For some time the voyage was both rapid and pros-
perous; the only passenger who did not seem thoroughly
to enjoy himself being poor Nero, who did not seem to
care about being cooped up in a cage, and who suffered
greatly from sea-sickness, and required much attention
from Harry and myself.
The sea-voyage did wonders for us, and before we
crossed the line Mr. Penton's wounds were healed, and
I was able to take my arm out of the splints.
We soon ran across the north-east trades, and got
into the westerly winds after only two or three days'
calms, and ran on to past the latitude of Madeira with-
out anything occurring, and were counting on an early
arrival at Bordeaux, to which port we were bound.


## p. 334 (#336) ############################################

334
THE FOREMAST SPRUNG.
Soon after passing Madeira, we got into bad weather
and sprung our fore-mast; and this necessitated our
carrying such easy sail that Mr. Penton was afraid that
he would not arrive in England until the business for
which he was required had been settled, and was not
at all sorry when one day we saw a column of black
smoke rising out of the sea astern of us, and rapidly
drawing nearer. The smoke was caused by H.M.S.
Hecate, homeward-bound from the West Indies, and he
induced our skipper to signal to her to communicate
with us.
A party of men were sent on board, who fished our
fore-mast in a seaman-like manner; and the captain
said that if Mr. Penton liked he would give him and
the doctor a passage to England; which was gladly ac-
cepted.
Mr. Penton, before leaving, gave Harry and me full
instructions as to what we were to do, and how to
make our way from Bordeaux to England; and gave us
letters of credit and drafts on his bankers, to enable
us to defray our passages and those of Nero.
Left alone on board the Corinne, we found the man-
ner of the French captain and his crew undergo a con-
siderable alteration, and we were treated as if we were
loblolly-boys instead of passengers; and if it had not
been for a threat we made that we would let Nero loose,
we would have been treated even worse than we were.
About a week after the Hecate had parted company,
the carpenter came and reported to the captain that


## p. 335 (#337) ############################################

MENACED BY FIRE AND WATER.
335
the ship had sprung a considerable leak, and that it
was necessary to man the pumps in order to keep her
afloat.
The pumps were rigged, and for three days we
laboured incessantly in watches at them, and just suc-
ceeded in keeping the water under.
On the third day the carpenter, going down with a
naked light, happened to set fire to a cask of spirits,
and in a few minutes the fire attained alarming pro-
portions. Menaced both by fire and water, the crew
threw off all semblance of discipline, and refused to
labour to try and save the ship, but turned all their
energies to getting out the boats and leaving her.
Through bad management and want of order, one of
the three boats was stove in, in getting her over the side,
and the other two would barely hold the crew. Harry
and I begged hard that Nero might accompany us, but
were refused; and with aching hearts we determined
to shoot our pet rather than leave him to be burned to
death.
We went to our cabin to fetch firearms for this pur-
pose, and whilst there heard a crash caused by the fall-
ing of some heavy spars. Rushing out, we found the
boats had shoved off, and that the cowardly French-
men had left us to our fate.
Nero's cage was right aft on the poop, and there we
went to see what could possibly be done.
Between us and the forecastle was now a mass of
flame, and the ship having the wind on her bow, the

flames were rapidly travelling aft; and the ship was also
fast settling in the water, so that it seemed a doubtful
matter as to whether we should be burned or drowned.
I saw the position, and rushing to the wheel put the
helm hard up, so that we should bring the wind right
aft, and called to Harry to open Nero's cage.
Having lashed the helm, I looked round with Harry
to see if we could find anything which would do for a
raft, and quickly cast adrift some hen-coops and Nero's
cage, which we lashed together and supplemented with
some small casks and spars. This we launched over
the stern, and threw on to it the gaff top-sail ; and get-
ting into the captain's cabin, we found some claret and
biscuits, which, with a few blankets and some water,
we passed on to the raft.
Just as we were leaving, we saw three oars lying on
one side; and these and a coil of signal halyard stuff
we also put on the raft.
By this time the whole fore part of the ship was in
flames, and she had sunk very low in the water; so we,
after going up to the mizzen-mast head to get a look
round and see if there were any chance of the boats
looking for us, got on the raft.
The boats had evidently no intention to wait for or
save us, as they had made sail and were standing away
east, in the direction of the nearest land.
Nero did not care about coming on the raft, and we
had to haul him over the taffrail by main force before
we could get him away from the ship.

PRAYER AND EFFORT.

.
We were none too soon in leaving, for scarcely had
we left the ship when the after part blew up, from the
imprisoned air under the decks; and in a few minutes
more she went down by the head, leaving only a few
pieces of floating wreckage behind.
"Well, Harry, old man," I said, " here we are in
another fix. I wonder whether we shall get out of it
as we did out of our trouble with the Boers."
"Surely you are not downhearted. We have a good
raft under us; there is not much sea or wind; and
though we have seen no ships for the last few days,
we are right in their track, and are sure to be seen
before long. First thing, let us pray for safety. You
know you told me you prayed when the Boers were
going to shoot you. Your prayers then were an-
swered, and no doubt God in his mercy will answer
ours now."
After we had offered up a short prayer, we set to
work and rigged up a mast, with the yard of the
gaff top-sail; and cut a portion of the sail itself into a
lug, which we made fast to an oar for a yard. The
other two oars we lashed one on each quarter to steer
by, and then setting our sail, Harry steered while I
busied myself with improving the lashings of our raft
and rigging up a place where one of us could sleep,
raised a little above the rest so that we might pass the
night as dry as possible.
When the sun went down we made our evening meal
of biscuits and claret, and gave Nero some water and

biscuits for his share. I then took the steering oar and
Harry went to sleep.
About midnight we changed places, and I was so
tired that I slept as soundly as ever I had done in my
life.
Soon after daylight I was awaked by Harry calling
to me that there was a ship in sight. Jumping up, I
looked in the direction he was pointing, and there saw
the sails of a large ship which was about courses down,
and which was evidently standing so that she would
pass not very far from us. I told Harry to steer so
that we should close her, and watched most anxiously
to see if we should be seen by those on board.
Soon we saw the top-sails settled and then hoisted
again, and I saw that she was a man-of-war shaking
out her reefs.
She closed rapidly upon us, and we could soon see
her hull; and then we were evidently sighted, for she
altered her course so as to close us, and in about half
an hour she came close by, and we saw that she was a
fifty-gun frigate. Her courses were run up and the
main-top-sail backed, and in a few minutes one of her
cutters was pulling towards us.
We watched her with intense interest, and what was
my surprise and delight, when the bowmen laid in their
oars and stood up with their boat-hooks, to see that one
of them was my dear old chum, Tom Batten!
In another instant the boat was alongside, and Tom
springing on our raft, I called him by name. His

341
astonishment at meeting me thus adrift on a raft in the
middle of the Atlantic, with a lion for one of my com-
panions, may be more easily imagined than described.
There was then no time for any explanation, as the
midshipman of the boat hurried us in, and after a little
hesitation allowed us to get Nero on board also, and in
five minutes more we were standing on the deck of the
Amphitrite (forty-four), commanded by Captain Blener-
hasset.
We soon told our story, and the ship's course was
shaped so as to overtake the boats, as the captain said
that though they had deserted us, still it was his duty
to pick them up if possible.
A comfortable place was made for Nero between two
of the main-deck guns, and Tom Batten was told to
look after me and Harry, as he was an old friend of
mine.
We had very soon a large audience on the forecastle
whilst we related all our various adventures, and many
an expression of applause and sympathy was drawn
from the sailors during my brief narration. And after
a time we were sent for to tell the officers our story
also; and very much interest was displayed in Nero,
who soon ran a risk of being spoiled by the petting
and coaxing which he received, and which he took in
very good part.
When the curiosity of officers and men had been
appeased, I was able to ask Tom for news of himself
and all my friends. He had just been rated A.B., and

was a fore-top-gallant-yard-man; and as he proudly
told me, had never had his name in the black list since
he had joined the service.
He had heard from his mother at Gibraltar, which
place they had just left; and Job Motram was still to
the fore on board the Swiftsure; and Mr. Polgarth
and Dr. Jones were also well and hearty, whilst little
Annie was growing up into a pretty girl. She had
wondered what had become of me, and said that news
had come from Falmouth that my aunt was dead, and
that my Uncle Jonas was aging and breaking fast.
My mother's cottage, which had been let soon after her
death, had become vacant, and she had some thoughts
of moving into it, if she could come to terms about the
rent with Mr. Snaresby.
Joey and Willie had gone to sea with their fathers.
"And there," said Tom,"is all my news, except that my
'father is now boatswain of the Vanguard."
We found much else to talk about, poor Harry feel-
ing himself rather in the cold, though Tom told him
he, as a chum of mine, should be his also, and did all
he could to prevent his feeling strange.

SURVIVORS OF THE "CORINNE"-ARRIVE AT PLYMOUTH-WARMEST OF WELCOMES
-AT THE ADMIRAL'S OFFICE-MY UNCLE--PENTON HALL-OLD AFRICAN
DAYS.
Just before sunset the mast-head men reported some-
thing floating in the water a couple of miles away on
the lee bow. We stood down towards it, and found it
was one of the Corinne's boats floating bottom up, with
three men clinging to the keel.
They were soon rescued; and when brought on board
said that after they had left the ship there had been
nothing but confusion in the boats, and some brandy
which had been taken away was broached, and all
hands had got drunk except themselves, and that fight-
ing and struggling had taken place in which both boats
had been capsized and one had sunk. All the other
men had been drowned, and they themselves were
almost in despair when picked up by the Amphitrite's
boat.
Captain Blenerhasset said that as they had been
shipwrecked, he was obliged to treat them kindly, and
would give them food, but that he felt very much in-

ARRIVAL AT PLYMOUTH.
clined to give them four dozen each for having been
parties to our cowardly desertion.
The Amphitrite now again resumed her course for
Plymouth, where she was bound, and where we arrived
a few days afterwards without any adventure.
I scarcely knew what to do with Nero, as he
would hardly prove a welcome guest at Mrs. Batten's,
where I intended to go at first; but Captain Blener-
hasset solved the difficulty by saying he would keep
him on board the Amphitrite until I could hear from
Mr. Penton how he was to be disposed of.
I asked if I could go on shore at once, and was told
I was at liberty; only I would have to attend the next
morning at the port admiral's office, to give an account
of the loss of the Corinne.
Harry and I therefore got into the first shore-boat
we could get, and with a fair wind and flood-tide
crossed the Devil's Bridge, and running up Hamoaze,
soon stood on the hard at Torpoint. How many things
had happened since I last stood there! and their mem-
ory came surging up into my brain till I felt confused
and stood like one dazed.
I was roused from my reverie by some one saying,
"Why, bless my soul, that's Jack Hooper ;-where did
you spring from, my boy?"
Looking up I saw Dr. Jones, looking not a day older
than when I last saw him.
We exchanged greetings, and I said I was going to
Mrs. Batten's with my friend Harry Tregear.


## p. 345 (#347) ############################################

WARMEST OF WELCOMES.
345
"All right, my trap is here. Jump in both, and I will
drive you there. She has just moved in to your mother's
old cottage, which I believe is yours. How glad Pol-.
garth will be to see you. You've grown a bigger fellow
than I ever thought you would be."
We were soon at the cottage; and from Mrs. Batten,
Annie, and the neighbours, received the warmest of
welcomes.
We had again to tell our story, and Mr. Polgarth
came and formed one of the audience. When we had
finished he told us all to kneel down, and in an impres-
sive manner returned thanks for the preservation of
Harry and myself from so many and so great dangers.
· When the cottage was empty, Mrs. Batten said she
was specially glad I had come home, as she had been
to Falmouth to see Jonas Snaresby. He was much
changed. He had owned that the cottage was really
my mother's, and that he had also money of hers.
Since his wife's death he had altered very much, and
she did not think he would live long; and from what
he had said when she saw him, she thought he was
ready to make restitution to me.
Annie Batten had listened eagerly to all; and when
I showed her her pin-cushion safe after all my adven-
tures, she fairly cried with delight.
Old Job came on shore to see me as soon as he heard
of my arrival, and it was not the least of my many
pleasures to find the old man still hale and hearty.
As soon as I could get quiet I wrote to Mr. Penton,

VISIT TO UNCLE JONAS.
telling him of our arrival, and asking him what should
be done with Nero; and that duty accomplished, I was
glad to go to rest in the little room I had occupied as
a child.
Next day I was at the admiral's office at ten o'clock,
and there met the French consul, who took down my
narrative of the loss of the Corinne, and who took
charge of the three survivors of her crew, whom he
called several peculiar French epithets for their cow-
ardice in consenting to the abandonment of Harry and
myself.
I waited for a few days to receive an answer from
Mr. Penton, who sent down a special cart for Nero,
who was accompanied by Harry to his seat, Penton
Hall.
Having seen them off I took the coach to Falmouth,
and went to see my uncle. The first person I saw was
Noah Clubbins. When I said I wished to see my uncle
he said he would not allow it as he was ill, and he could
not have him disturbed by needy beggars like me.
I pushed past him and went into the parlour behind
the shop, and there found my uncle moping over the
fire. He was altered very much, and one could plainly
see that he was not long for this world. He was almost
as thin as a skeleton, and what remained of his hair
was as white as snow.
When I spoke to him and called him uncle, he started
and said, "I can't be your uncle; I had only one nephew,
and he's dead."


## p. 347 (#349) ############################################

OFF TO PENTON HALL
347
"Nonsense, uncle; I'm alive, and come to look after
you."
"Yes, it is Jack. No, it can't be; he says he's dead."
Noah Clubbins now came in, and said he was master,
and that I must leave the shop and house or he would
have me put out.
I at once went to an inn and asked for a lawyer to
be sent for, and had the satisfaction, in twenty-four
hours, of seeing Mr. Noah turned out of the house, and
knowing that if he gave me any more trouble he would
be put in prison for theft and embezzlement.
Relieved from his presence my uncle became much
better, and confessed how he had kept me out of the
cottage and money which was mine on my mother's
death. In order to make amends, he told me he gave
me everything that he had, and only asked me to give
him food and shelter till his death.
: I did not like to tell him that this was little more
than my due, for Noah Clubbins had systematically
robbed him ever since he had wormed himself into a
position of confidence.
My first act as proprietor of the cottage was to write
to Mrs. Batten to tell her that she could live there rent-
free; and then I arranged for the sale of my uncle's
business, and his being cared for. These matters being
arranged I went back to Torpoint, and after passing a
night with Mrs. Batten went to Penton Hall.
When I got there, Mr. Penton told me that he found
things had gone on so badly during his absence that

CONCLUSION.
he thought it was his duty to stop at home and look
after them; and that he would have Harry and myself
thoroughly instructed in navigation, so as to fit us for
officers in the merchant service.
I joyfully accepted his offer, and so did Harry.
Harry and I soon went to sea as apprentices, and
now are mates of fine ships; while Tom Batten has
arrived at the summit of his desires, and is boatswain
of one of the smartest frigates in Her Majesty's navy.
Up at the Hall there is another Mrs. Penton, and her
children constantly come to me to listen to stories of
what their father did in Africa. Job Motram also
spins them yarns, for he now has a berth as lodge-
keeper, which was given him by Mr. Penton when he
got too old to any longer serve as ship-keeper on board
the Swiftsure.
The only one of our party who is gone is poor Nero,
who died of lung-disease in his second English winter;
and he is now stuffed and stands at the foot of the
staircase in Penton Hall, where only a few days ago I
saw General Brownlow and Colonel Smithson standing
and talking over old African days with Dr. Maclean,
who, instead of returning to Africa, has settled down
in our neighbourhood, and is medical adviser to the
family at the Hall.
