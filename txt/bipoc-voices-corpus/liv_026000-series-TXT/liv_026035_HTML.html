<h5 style="text-align: center">Preaching on a Tricycle.</h5>
<p>The Rev. F. J. de Rozario, of Agurpura, Bengal, writes:—</p><p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">
Baboo Guruchurn Bose, who has been with me since his conversion in 
1842, as head master of the English school, and has always assisted me in 
preaching the Gospel to the heathen, is now, notwithstanding his laborious 
duties in the school, out every morning and evening, combining exercise 
with preaching. He starts on his tricycle about four or five in the morning, and goes a great distance towards either end of the Barrackpore road. 
On his way he invariably finds groups of men and women, either as travellers from great distances, or as vendors of vegetables going to the 
different markets. When they are proceeding in the same direction with 
him, he joins them and enters into religious conversations, and points out 
to them Jesus Christ as the only Saviour of sinners. Should he meet 
such groups going in the opposite direction, he turns and accompanies 
them, speaking all the while about the salvation of their souls. Very 
frequently the traveling groups rest themselves for a while on the roadside. He also stops and preaches. Presently other groups come up, one 
after another, and form a large body of hearers of the Gospel. Thus distant people from cities and villages hear of Christ and His salvation.</p>
