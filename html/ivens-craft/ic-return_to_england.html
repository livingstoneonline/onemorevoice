						<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>William Ivens was young and resilient, and his story was just beginning. A Black, British-born, educated, twenty-five-year-old man, he turned his gaze to freer shores – just as his parents had thirty years earlier. Though raised in British society, William Ivens still stood apart from it, relying for a spell on the reform networks his parents had cultivated while in England. His struggles upon returning to England exemplified the challenges faced by the working class in Victorian London. Yet, the adversity he faced was compounded by the continual threat of anti-Blackness that curtailed his chances for upward mobility. For a time, he teetered on the line between poverty and self-sufficiency.</p>

						<h3 id="spirit">The Spirit of Slavery Not Yet Wiped Out</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>In the midst of the dynamic and dangerous world of Reconstruction in Georgia, the Craft family faced seemingly relentless political and economic racism. As William Ivens wrote to an acquaintance in England, “my reasons for leaving the Western Continent were these, there is still an undercurrent of feeling pervading throughout the U.S. against a ‘man of colour’ on a/c of the spirit engendered by slavery not being yet wiped out, and being born here I thought I could do better” (Craft 1881c). Though he was listed in the 1881 Savannah Directory as a clerk for the railway and still living on that corner of Lincoln and Broughton with Charles, William Ivens must have seen enough of  southern US racism by that spring, when he decided to leave (“Savannah City Directory” 1881, 202).</p>

On the right-hand side is a London omnibus, similar to the kind that William Ivens would have been familiar with in his first job as a messenger for the Railways & Metropolitan Omnibus company.</p>

						<p>William Ivens arrived back in his birthplace and hometown of London in May of 1881. By late summer, he had gained employment as a messenger for the Railways & Metropolitan Omnibus Company (Craft 1881a; 1881b; 1881c). Perhaps his experience working on the Railway Mail Service helped procure him the position of messenger, but without family in England, he at first relied on the network of benevolent patrons his parents had cultivated. This network included former white British abolitionists Elizabeth Pease Nichol, Frederick William Chesson, and Robert Nicholas Fowler, who had recently turned their reform focus to causes such as woman suffrage and the Aborigines’ Protection Society.</p>

Public domain. Robert Nicholas Fowler was a former British abolitionist, member of parliament, and later Lord Mayor of London; he was a highly connected and wealthy men. Knowing that Fowler had aided his parents in their time of need, William Ivens wrote to Fowler upon his return home in London.</p>

						<p>Forced to turn to former abolitionists to keep his head above water, he wrote to the white British journalist and activist Frederick Chesson that he was “sure I could get a promotion as clerk if I could only get a decent suit of clothes,” asking for even a “‘cast off’ from any of your friends” (Craft 1881a). He boarded at the time with a “Mr. Crosher” at 12 Blue Cross Street in Leicester Square. Working as a messenger, William Ivens made twelve shillings a week. In his own words, it did “not admit of my buying anything whatever for myself,” and it was “not enough with which to buy food” (Craft 1881b).</p>

						<h3 id="former-abolitionists">William Ivens and the Former Abolitionists</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>William Ivens initially relied on the reform networks his parents had cultivated during their decades-long residency in England. William Ivens’ exchange with one former abolitionist, the white British suffragist Elizabeth Pease Nichol, reveals the limits and paternalism that pervaded Victorian reform and benevolence in the Victorian era. It also demonstrates William Ivens’ determination to persevere in London.</p>

This image captured the likeness of Elizabeth Pease Nichol late in her life, offering a sense of what she might have looked like when she sat down to write her letters to and about William Ivens. That her portrait appeared in a book about famous suffragist Susan B. Anthony indicates that, by the last decades of her life, her suffrage work had overshadowed her legacy as an abolitionist.</p>

						<p>Elizabeth Pease Nichol demonstrated considerably less benevolence towards William Ivens than she had for enslaved and formerly enslaved people such as William and Ellen. In the mid-nineteenth century, she had been at the fore of British abolitionism, appearing as one of only about six women depicted in the famous Benjamin Robert Haydon painting of the 1840 Anti-Slavery Society Convention (Stoddart 1899, 123-124).</p>

						<p class="caption-text">Benjamin Robert Haydon, “<a aria-label="External Link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Anti-Slavery_Society_Convention,_1840_by_Benjamin_Robert_Haydon.jpg">The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840</a>” (Illustration, London, [1841]), <em>Wikimedia Commons</em>. Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic. Benjamin Robert Haydon's painting of the 1840 Anti-Slavery Society Convention offers a snapshot of England's most prominent abolitionists, including Elizabeth Pease Nichol (and Wendell Phillips). By the time William Ivens sought to utilize to the same networks that had so eagerly supported his parents, these former abolitionists had turned their benevolent attentions elsewhere.</p>

						<p>Before emancipation in the US, Nichol expressed her support of Black men and women in a letter to the New England Anti-Slavery Society:</p>
						
						<p class="leftmargin">We would encourage you to persevere with unremitting energy in the use of all Christian efforts, until the meridian splendour of that glorious day which shall witness the last link to be broken which binds the slave – until all the odious distinctions founded on colour shall be buried in oblivion, and the injured sons of Africa in your land restored to the full enjoyments of all the rights and privileges of humanity. (Stoddart 1899, 52)</p>

						<p>Nichol deemed the abolition of slavery sufficient to restore to Black Americans “the full enjoyments of all the rights and privileges of humanity,” regardless of the turbulent violence of Reconstruction. The problem of slavery “solved,” Nichol’s interests drifted elsewhere. She had been secretary of the Edinburgh chapter of the National Society of Women’s Suffrage, took on the anti-vivisection cause, and by the end of the 1870s was putting her charity towards “the erection of public <em>abattoirs</em> for a more humane method of killing animals for food.” In 1883, the “chief incident” in her life “was the choice of a design for another fountain, finally erected in Holyrood Park” (Stoddart 1899, 284, 288-2290, 292).</p>

						<h3 id="limits">The Limits of White Benevolence</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>As such, Nichol and William Ivens remained divided by experiences, geographic space, race, and class. Nichol, who resided in Scotland and was firmly established among white middle class reformers, reflected the myopia of former abolitionists who felt that their aims had been achieved with the emancipation proclamation. As she wrote to a friend, “His father was my guest many years ago & I fear the poor lad maybe finding <u>he</u> too can walk in & stay till he finds occupation!!” (Nichol, n.d.)</p>

						<p>Despite William Ivens’ supplication and gratitude, which he poured forth liberally in letters, Nichol refused to help him further. After two loans of two pounds each, Nichol insisted she had “done all I can for him” (Nichol, n.d.). He explained that although he had since found employment, a short stint without work upon arrival in London had wound him “considerably into debt for board & lodging which I have not since been able to pay off insomuch that it has worried me greatly on my creditors persistently ‘dunning’ me for the money” (Craft 1881c).</p>

							<p class="caption-text">William Ivens Craft, “Letter to F. W. Chesson from William Ivens Craft” (Manuscript, London, 6 September 1881), MSS. Brit. Emp. S. 18, C129/134ii, Bodleian Library, Oxford, United Kingdom. Noncommercial use. This letter from William Ivens to Frederick William Chesson reveals much about not only the dynamics between the two men, but it also displays William Ivens' advanced penmanship and grateful comportment, even while his requests for aid from here on out received no fulfillment.</p>

						<p>Ellen Craft, too, wrote to Nichol from Georgia, thanking her for her generosity and confirming the dire situation racism caused in the American south. “My son William,” Ellen stated, “writes to tell me of your extreme kindness towards him in England, and I am sure I am at a loss to know exactly how to thank you.” She assured Nichol that although William Ivens struggled in London, things were worse across the pond. It was “so very much easier for a man of color to succeed in the race of life,” in England, “particularly if he has in any way had much to do with politics,” wrote Ellen, hinting at the fact that William Ivens was also likely involved in the Republican party while in Georgia. “[T]he Southrons [sic] being still very much envenomed towards men of that class,” Ellen concluded (Craft 1882). William Ivens’ brother also wrote to Nichol explaining the “circumstances over which [William Ivens] had no control” (Craft 1882a).</p>

The view, as of 2024, of the street where William Ivens boarded upon his return to London. Previously known as Blue Cross Street, today’s Orange street is just south of famed Leicester Square.</p>

						<p>Yet Nichol dismissed the obstacles that William Ivens faced and instead chalked his difficulties up to personal shortcomings. She wrote to Chesson that she was “a little afraid he,” meaning William Ivens, “does not like work.” “Between you &amp; me,” she penned Chesson, “Should it seem best to send him back to his father I wd [sic] help you in doing so” (Nichol, n.d.).</p>

						<p>Nichol was not the first former white abolitionist to stereotype William Ivens as lazy, as Wendell Phillips had also done. Yet, in contrast to Nichol’s formulation that William Ivens was labor averse, his letters reveal a feisty determination, despite the obstacles he faced, to carve out a sense of place and belonging in London.</p>

						<p><strong>Lead image commentary:</strong> This slip of paper is a receipt drawn up by William Ivens Craft for two pounds that he borrowed from one of his reluctant British benefactors, F. W. Chesson in September of 1881. Despite the myriad challenges that William Ivens faced upon his return to his home country of England, he found the abolitionists who had been eager to help his parents reticent to lend him similar pecuniary aid – and these two pounds represent the most they could lend him, or so they insisted. </p><!-- Change -->
