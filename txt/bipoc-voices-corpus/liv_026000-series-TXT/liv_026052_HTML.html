<p>From any recent journal of the Rev. D. Williams, a Native Pastor, 
we take the following, which may convey a significant hint to 
some of our own readers:�</p><p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">
<em>June</em> 29<em>th</em>, 1874.�Had our missionary meeting for collection towards 
the Native Pastorate. It was opened with singing, reading a portion of 
Scritpure from Hebrews vi., and prayer. After having given a short 
preliminary speech, I called upon a few gentlemen to give speeches, which 
they performed with avidity, and the few people were moved, after 
having given once their subscriptions, to promise more. No hope of 
realising such an amount up to that of last year on account of the hardness of the present time, consequent upon the fall of trade, which has 
thrown many merchants into a great distress. I received only a few 
amounts and promises. <em>Being not satisfied with the collection of the day, 
I gave notice of another to be held in a fortnight.</em></p>
