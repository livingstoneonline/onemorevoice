VI PREFACE. 

I beg to offer my hearty thanks to my friend Sir Roderick 
Murchison, and also to Dr. Norton Shaw, the secretary of the 
Royal Geographical Society, for aiding my researches by every 
means in their power. 

His Faithful Majesty Don Pedro V., having kindly sent out 
orders to support my late companions until my return, relieved 
my mind of anxiety on their account. But for this act of 
liberality, I should certainly have been compelled to leave 
England in May last; and it has afforded me the pleasure of 
travelling over, in imagination, every scene again, and recalling 
the feelings which actuated me at the time. I have much 
pleasure in acknowledging my deep obligations to the hospi- 
tality and kindness of the Portuguese on many occasions. 

I have not entered into the early labours, trials, and successes 
of the missionaries who preceded me in the Bechuana country, 
because that has been done by the much abler pen of my father- 
in-law, Rev. Robert Moffat, of Kuruman, who has been an 
energetic and devoted actor in the scene for upwards of forty 
years. A slight sketch only is given of my own attempts, and 
the chief part of the book is taken up with a detail of the efforts 
made to open up a new field north of the Bechuana country to 
the sympathies of Christendom. The prospects there disclosed 
are fairer than I anticipated, and the capabilities of the new 
region lead me to hope, that, by the production of the raw mate- 
rials of our manufactures, African and English interests will 
become more closely linked than heretofore — that both countries 
will be eventually benefited — and that the cause of freedom 
throughout the world will in some measure be promoted. 

Dr. Hooker, of Kew, has had the kindness to name and classify 
lor me, as far as possible, some of the new botanical specimens 
which I brought over; Dr. Andrew Smith (himself an African 
traveller) has aided me in the zoology ; and Captain Need lias 
laid open for my use lus portfolio of African sketches : for all 
which acts of liberality my thanks are deservedly due ; as well 
as to my brother, who has rendered me willing aid as an 
umamiensis. 

Although I cannot profess to be a draughtsman, I brought 
homo with me a few rough diagram-sketches, from one of 
which tho view of the Falls of the Zambesi has been prepared 
by a more experienced artist.

My own inclination would lead me to say as little as possible 
about myself; but several friends, in whose judgment I have 
confidence, have suggested that, as the reader likes to know 
something about the author, a short account of his origin and 
early life would lend additional interest to this book. Such is 
my excuse for the following egotism ; and, if an apology be 
necessary for giving a genealogy, I find it in the fact that it is 
not very long, and contains only one incident of which I have 
reason to be proud. 

Our great-grandfather fell at the battle of Culloden, fighting 
for the old line of kings ; and our grandfather was a small 
farmer in Ulva, where my father was born. It is one of that 
cluster of the Hebrides thus alluded to by Walter Scott : — 

" And Ulva dark, and Colonsay, 
And all the group of islets gay 
That guard famed Staffa round." * 

Our grandfather was intimately acquainted with all the tra- 
ditionary legends which that great writer has since made use of 

* Lord of the Isles, canto iv.

in the * Tales of a Grandfather ' and other works. As a boy I 
remember listening to him with delight, for his memory was 
stored with a never-ending stock of stories, many of which were 
wonderfully like those I have since heard while sitting by the 
African evening fires. Our grandmother, too, used to sing Gaelic 
songs, some of which, as she believed, had been composed by 
captive islanders languishing hopelessly among the Turks. 

Grandfather could give particulars of the lives of his an- 
cestors for six generations of the family before him ; and the 
only point of the tradition I feel proud of is tins. One of these 
poor hardy islanders was renowned in the district for great 
wisdom and prudence ; and it is related that, when he was on his 
deathbed, he called all his children around him and said, " Now, 
in my lifetime, I have, searched most carefully through all the 
traditions I could find of our family, and I never could discover 
that there was a dishonest man among our forefathers. If there- 
fore any of you or any of your children should take to dishonest 
ways, it will not be because it runs in our blood ; it does not 
belong to you. I leave this precept with you : Be honest." If 
therefore in the following pages I fall into any errors, I hope they 
will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that 
I have forgotten our ancient motto. This event took place at a 
time when the Highlanders, according to Macaulay, were much 
like the Cape Caffres, and any one, it was said, could escape 
punishment for cattle-stealing by presenting a share of the plunder 
to his chieftain. Our ancestors were Eoman Catholics ; they were 
made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having 
a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention 
than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterwards, 
perhaps it does so still, by the name of " the religion of the 
yellow stick/' 

Finding Ins farm in Ulva insufficient to support a numerous 
family, my grandfather removed to Blantyre Works, a large 
cotton manufactory on the beautiful Clyde, above Glasgow ; and 
his sons, having had the best education the Hebrides afforded, 
were gladly received as clerks by the proprietors, Monteith and 
Co. He himself, lnghly esteemed for his unflinching honesty, 
was employed in the conveyance of large sums of money 
from Glasgow to the works, and in old age was, according to the

custom of that company, pensioned off, so as to spend his de- 
clining years in ease and comfort. 

Our uncles all entered His Majesty's service during the last 
French war, either as soldiers or sailors ; but my father remained 
at home, and, though too conscientious ever to become rich as a 
small tea-dealer, by his kindliness of manner and winning ways 
he made the heartstrings of his children twine around him as 
firmly as if he had possessed, and could have bestowed upon 
them, every worldly advantage. He reared his children in con- 
nection with the Kirk of Scotland — a religious establishment 
which has been an incalculable blessing to that country — but he 
afterwards left it, and during the last twenty years of Iris life 
held the office of deacon of an independent church in Hamilton, 
and deserved my lasting gratitude and homage for presenting 
me from infancy with a continuously consistent pious example, 
such as that the ideal of which is so beautifully and truthfully 
portrayed in Burns' ' Cottar's Saturday Night.' He died in 
February, 1856, in peaceful hope of that mercy which we all 
expect through the death of our Lord and Saviour : I was at 
the time on my way below Zumbo, expecting no greater pleasure 
in this country than sitting by our cottage fire and telling him 
my travels. I revere his memory. 

The earliest recollection of my mother recalls a picture so often 
seen among the Scottish poor — that of the anxious housewife 
striving to make both ends meet. At the age of ten I was put 
into the factory as a " piecer," to aid by my earnings in lessening 
her anxiety. With a part of my first week's wages I purchased 
Ruddiman's ' Rudiments of Latin,' and pursued the study of that 
language for many years afterwards, with unabated ardour, at an 
evening school, which met between the hours of eight and ten. 
The dictionary part of my labours was followed up till twelve 
o'clock, or later, if my mother did not interfere by jumping up 
and snatching the books out of my hands. I had to be back 
in the factory by six in the morning, and continue my work, with 
intervals for breakfast and dinner, till eight o'clock at night. I 
read in this way many of the classical authors, and knew Virgil 
and Horace better at sixteen than I do now. Our schoolmaster 
— happily still alive — was supported in part by the company ; 
he was attentive and kind, and so moderate in his charges that

all who wished for education might have obtained it. Many 
availed themselves of the privilege ; and some of my school- 
fellows now rank in positions far above what they appeared ever 
likely to come to when in the village school. If such a system 
were established in England, it would prove a never-ending 
blessing to the poor. 

In reading, everything that I could lay my hands on was de- 
voured except novels. Scientific works and books of travels were 
my especial delight ; though my father, believing, with many of 
his time who ought to have known better, that the former were 
inimical to religion, would have preferred to have seen me poring 
over the ' Cloud of Witnesses,' or Boston's ' Fourfold State.' Our 
difference of opinion reached the point of open rebellion on my 
part, and his last application of the rod was on my refusal to 
peruse Wilberforce's ' Practical Christianity.' Tins dislike to 
dry doctrinal reading, and to religious reading of every sort, 
continued for years afterwards ; but having lighted on those 
admirable works of Dr. Thomas Dick, ' The Philosophy of Re- 
ligion,' and ' The Philosophy of a Future State,' it was gratifying 
to find my own ideas, that religion and science are not hostile, 
but friendly to each other, fully proved and enforced. 

Great pains had been taken by my parents to instil the 
doctrines of Christianity into my mind, and I had no difficulty in 
understanding the theory of our free salvation by the atonement 
of our Saviour, but it was only about this time that I really 
began to feel the necessity and value of a personal application of 
the provisions of that atonement to my own case. The change 
was like what may be supposed would take place were it possible 
to cure a case of " colour blindness." The perfect freeness with 
which the pardon of all our guilt is offered in God's book drew 
forth feelings of affectionate love to Him who bought us with his 
blood, and a sense of deep obligation to Him for his mercy has 
influenced, in some small measure, my conduct ever since. But 
I shall not again refer to the inner spiritual life winch I believe 
then began, nor do I intend to specify with any prominence the 
evangelistic labours to which the love of Christ has since impelled 
me : this book will speak not so much of what has been done, as 
of what still remains to be performed before the gospel can be 
said to be preached to all nations. 



Introd. YOUTHFUL EXCURSIONS. O 

In the glow of love which Christianity inspires, I soon resolved 
to devote my life to the alleviation of human misery. Turning 
this idea over in my mind, I felt that to be a pioneer of Chris- 
tianity in China might lead to the material benefit of some 
portions of that immense empire ; and therefore set myself to 
obtain a medical education, in order to be qualified for that 
enterprise. 

In recognising the plants pointed out in my first medical book, 
that extraordinary old work on astrological medicine, Culpeper's 
' Herbal,' I had the guidance of a book on the plants of Lanark- 
shire, by Patrick. Limited as my time was, I found opportunities 
to scour the whole country-side, "collecting simples." ' Deep and 
anxious were my studies on the still deeper and more perplexing 
profundities of astrology, and I believe I got as far into that 
abyss of fantasies as my author said he dared to lead me. It 
seemed perilous ground to tread on farther, for the dark hint 
seemed to my youthful mind to loom towards " selling soul and 
body to the devil," as the price of the unfathomable know- 
ledge of the stars. These excursions, often in company with 
brothers, one now in Canada, and the other a clergyman in the 
United States, gratified my intense love of nature ; and though 
we generally returned so unmercifully hungry and fatigued that 
the embryo parson shed tears, yet we discovered so many to us 
new and interesting tilings, that he was always as eager to join 
us next time as he was the last. 

On one of these exploring tours we entered a limestone quarry 
— long before geology was so popular as it is now. It is 
impossible to describe the delight and wonder with which I began 
to collect the shells found in the carboniferous limestone winch 
crops out in High Blantyre and Cambuslang. A quarryman, 
seeing a little boy so engaged, looked with that pitying eye 
which the benevolent assume when viewing the insane. Ad- 
dressing him with, " How ever did these shells come into these 
rocks ? " " When God made the rocks, he made the shells in 
them," was the damping reply. What a deal of trouble geolo- 
gists might have saved themselves by adopting the Turk-like 
philosophy of this Scotchman ! 

My reading while at work was carried on by placing the book 
on a portion of the spinning jenny, so that I could catch sentence

after sentence as I passed at my work ; I thus kept up a pretty 
constant study undisturbed by the roar of the machinery. To 
this part of my education I owe my present power of completely 
abstracting the mind from surrounding noises, so as to read and 
write with perfect comfort amidst the play of children or near the 
dancing and songs of savages. The toil of cotton-spinning, to 
which I was promoted in my nineteenth year, was excessively 
severe on a slim loose-jointed lad, but it was well paid for ; and 
it enabled me to support myself while attending medical and 
Greek classes in Glasgow in winter, as also the divinity lectures 
of Dr. Wardlaw, by working with my hands in summer. I never 
received a farthing of aid from any one, and should have accom- 
plished my project of going to China as a medical missionary in 
the course of time by my own efforts, had not some friends 
advised my joining the London Missionary Society on account of 
its perfectly unsectarian character. It " sends neither episcopacy, 
nor presbyterianism, nor independency, but the gospel of Christ 
to the heathen." This exactly agreed with my ideas of what a 
Missionary Society ought to do ; but it was not without a pang 
that I offered myself, for it was not quite agreeable to one accus- 
tomed to work his own way to become in a measure dependent 
on others. And I would not have been much put about, though 
my offer had been rejected. 

Looking back now on that life of toil, I cannot but feel thank- 
ful that it formed such a material part of my early education ; 
and, were it possible, I should like to begin life over again in the 
same lowly style, and to pass through the same hardy training. 

Time and travel have not effaced the feelings of respect I 
imbibed for the humble inhabitants of my native village. For 
morality, honesty, and intelligence, they were in general good 
specimens of the Scottish poor. In a population of more than 
two thousand souls we had, of course, a variety of character. In 
addition to the common run of men, there were some characters 
of sterling worth and ability, who exerted a most beneficial 
influence on the children and youth of the place by imparting 
gratuitous religious instruction.* Much intelligent interest was

worthy men— David Hogg, who addressed me on his death-bed with the words,

felt by the villagers in all public questions, and they furnished a 
proof that the possession of the means of education did not render 
them an unsafe portion of the population. They felt kindly 
towards each other, and much respected those of the neighbouring 
gentry who, like the late Lord Douglas, placed some confidence 
in their sense of honour. Through the kindness of that nobleman, 
the poorest among us could stroll at pleasure over the ancient 
domains of Bothwell, and other spots hallowed by the venerable 
associations of which our school-books and local traditions made 
us well aware ; and few of us could view the dear memorials of 
the past without feeling that these carefully kept monuments were 
our own. The masses of the working people of Scotland have 
read history, and are no revolutionary levellers. They rejoice in 
the memories of " Wallace and Bruce and a' the lave," who are 
still much revered as the former champions of freedom. And 
while foreigners imagine that we want the spirit only to overturn 
capitalists and aristocracy, we are content to respect our laws till 
we can change them, and hate those stupid revolutions which 
might sweep away time-honoured institutions, dear alike to rich 
and poor. 

Having finished the medical curriculum and presented a thesis 
on a subject which required the use of the stethescope for its 
diagnosis, I unwittingly procured for myself an examination 
rather more severe and prolonged than usual among examining 
bodies. The reason was, that between me and the examiners a 
slight difference of opinion existed as to whether this instrument 
could do what was asserted. The wiser plan would have been to 
have had no opinion of my own. However, I was admitted a 
Licentiate of Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons. It was with 
unfeigned delight I became a member of a profession which is 
pre-eminently devoted to practical benevolence, and which with 
unwearied energy pursues from age to age its endeavours to lessen 
human woe. 

But though now qualified for my original plan, the opium war

was then raging, and it was deemed inexpedient for me to proceed 
to China. I had fondly hoped to have gained access to that then 
closed empire by means of the healing art ; bnt there being no 
prospect of an early peace with the Chinese, and as another 
inviting field was opening out through the labours of Mr. Moffat, 
I was induced to turn my thoughts to Africa ; and after a more 
extended course of theological training in England than I had 
enjoyed in Glasgow, I embarked for Africa in 1840, and, after a 
voyage of three months, reached Cape Town. Spending but a 
short time there, I started for the interior by going round to 
Algoa Bay, and soon proceeded inland, and have spent the fol- 
lowing sixteen years of my life, namely, from 1840 to 1856, in 
medical and missionary labours there without cost to the inha- 
bitants. 

As to those literary qualifications which are acquired by habits 
of writing, and which are so important to an author, my African 
life has not only not been favourable to the growth of such accom- 
plishments, but quite the reverse : it has made composition irk- 
some and laborious. I think I would rather cross the African 
continent again than undertake to write another book. It is far 
easier to travel than to write about it. I intended on going to 
Africa to continue my studies ; but as I could not brook the idea 
of simply entering into other men's labours made ready to my 
hands, I entailed on myself, in addition to teaching, manual 
labour in building and other handicraft work, which made me 
generally as much exhausted and unfit for study in the evenings 
as ever I had been when a cotton-spinner. The want of time for 
self-improvement was the only source of regret that I experienced 
during my African career. The reader remembering this will 
make allowances for the mere gropings for light of a student who 
has the vanity to think himself " not yet too old to learn." More 
precise information on several subjects has necessarily been omitted 
in a popular work like the present ; but I hope to give such details 
to the scientific reader through some other channel

The general instructions I received from the Directors of the 
London Missionary Society led me, as soon as I reached Kuraman 
or Lattakoo, then, as it is now, their farthest inland station from 
the Cape, to turn my attention to the north. Without waiting 
longer at Kuruman than was necessary to recruit the oxen, which 
were pretty well tired by the long journey from Algoa Bay, I 
proceeded, in company with another missionary, to the Bakuena 
or Bakwain country, and found Sechele, with his tribe, located 
at Shokuane. We shortly after retraced our steps to Kuruman ; 
but as the objects in view were by no means to be attained by a 
temporary excursion of tins sort, I determined to make a fresh 
start into the interior as soon as possible. Accordingly, after 
resting three months at Kuruman, which is a kind of head station 
in the country, I returned to a spot about fifteen miles south of 
Shokuane, called Lepelole (now Litubaruba). Here, in order to 
obtain an accurate knowledge of the language, I cut myself off 
from all European society for about six months, and gained by 
this ordeal an insight into the habits, ways of thinking, laws, and 
language of that section of the Bechuanas, called Bakwains, which 
has proved of incalculable advantage in my intercourse with them 
ever since. 

In this second journey to Lepelole — so called from a cavern of 
that name — I began preparations for a settlement, by making a 
canal to irrigate gardens, from a stream then flowing copiously, 



10 IDEAS REGARDING COMETS. Chap. I. 

but now quite dry. When these preparations were well advanced, 
I went northwards to visit the Bakaa and Bamangwato, and the 
Makalaka, living between 22° and 23° south lat. The Bakaa 
mountains had beeu visited before by a trader, who, with his 
people, all perished from fever. In going round the northern 
part of these basaltic lulls near Letloche I was only ten days 
distant from the lower part of the Zouga, which passed by the 
sanie name as Lake Ngami ;* and I might then (in 1842) have 
discovered that lake, had discovery alone been my object. Most 
part of this journey beyond Shokuane was performed on foot, in 
consequence of the draught oxen having become sick. Some of 
my companions who had recently joined us, and did not know 
that I understood a little of their speech, were overheard by me 
discussing my appearance and powers : " He is not strong, he is 
quite slim, and only appears stout because he puts himself into 
those bags (trousers) ; he will soon knock up." Tins caused my 
Highland blood to rise, and made me despise the fatigue of 
keeping them all at the top of their speed for days together, 
and until I heard them expressing proper opinions of my pedes- 
trian powers. 

Keturning to Kuruman, in order to bring my luggage to our 
proposed settlement, I was followed by the news that the tribe of 
Bakwains, who had shown themselves so friendly towards me, had 
been driven from Lepelole by the Barolongs, so that my prospects 
for the time of forming a settlement there were at an end. One of 
those periodical outbreaks of war, which *eem to have occurred 
from time immemorial, for the possession of cattle, had burst forth 
in the land, and had so changed the relations of the tribes to each 
other, that I was obliged to set out anew to look for a suitable 
locality for a mission station. 

In going north again, a comet blazed on our sight, exciting 
the wonder of every tribe we visited. That of 1816 had been 
followed by an irruption of the Matebele, the most cruel enemies 

* Several words in the African languages begin with the ringing sound 
heard in the end of the word " comm^." If the reader puts an i to the 
beginning of the name of the lake, as Ingami, and then sounds the i as little 
as possible, he will have the correct pronunciation. The Spanish n is em- 
ployed to denote this sound, and Ngami is spelt nami — naka means a tusk, 
iiaka a doctor. Every vowel is sounded in all native words, and the em- 
phasis in pronunciation is put upon the penultimate. 



Chap. I. RAVAGES OF LIONS. 11 

the Bechuanas ever knew, and this they thought might portend 
something as bad, or it might only foreshadow the death of 
some great chief. On the subject of comets I knew little more 
than they did themselves, but I had that confidence in a kind 
over-ruling Providence winch makes such a difference between 
Christians and both the ancient and modern heathen. 

As some of the Bamangwato people had accompanied me to 
Kuruman, I was obliged to restore them and their goods to their 
chief Sekomi. This made a journey to the residence of that 
chief again necessary, and, for the first time, I performed a dis- 
tance of some hundred miles on ox-back. 

Returning towards Kuruman, I selected the beautiful valley 
of Mabotsa (lat. 25° 14' south, long. 26° 30' ?) as the site of a 
missionary station ; and thither I removed in 1843. Here an 
occurrence took place concerning which I have frequently been 
questioned in England, and which, but for the importunities of 
friends, I meant to have kept in store to tell my children when 
in my dotage. The Bakatla of the village Mabotsa were much 
troubled by lions, which leaped into the cattle-pens by night, 
and destroyed their cows. They even attacked the herds in open 
day. Tins was so unusual an occurrence that the people believed 
that they were bewitched — "given," as they said, "into the 
power of the lions by a neighbouring tribe." They went once to 
attack the animals, but, being rather a cowardly people compared 
to Bechuanas in general on such occasions, they returned without 
killing any. 

It is well known that if one in a troop of lions is killed the 
others take the hint and leave that part of the country. So the 
next time the herds were attacked, I went with the people, in 
order to encourage them to rid themselves of the annoyance by 
destroying one of the marauders. We found the lions on a small 
hill about a quarter of a mile in length, and covered with trees. 
A circle of men was formed round it, and they gradually closed 
up, ascending pretty near to each other. Being down below 
on the plain with a native schoolmaster, named Mebalwe, a most 
excellent man, I saw one of the lions sitting on a piece of rock 
within the now closed circle of men. Mebalwe fired at him before 
I could, and the ball struck the rock on which the animal was 
sitting. He bit at the spot struck, as a dog does at a stick or stone 



12 A LION ENCOUNTER. Chap. I. 

thrown at him; then leaping away, broke through the opening 
circle and escaped unhurt. The men were afraid to attack him, 
perhaps on account of their belief in witchcraft. When the circle 
was re-formed, we saw two other lions in it ; but we were afraid 
to fire lest we should strike the men, and they allowed the beasts 
to burst through also. If the Bakatla had acted according to 
the custom of the country, they would have speared the lions in 
their attempt to get out. Seeing we could not get them to kill 
one of the lions, we bent our footsteps towards the village ; in 
going round the end of the hill, however, I saw one of the beasts 
sitting on a piece of rock as before, but this time he had a little 
bush in front. Being about thirty yards off, I took a good aim 
at his body through the bush, and fired both barrels into it. The 
men then called out, " He is shot, he is shot ! " Others cried, 
" He has been shot by another man too ; let us go to him ! " I 
did not see any one else shoot at him, but I saw the lion's tail 
erected in anger behind the bush, and, turning to the people, 
said, " Stop a little till I load again." When in the act of 
ramming down the bullets I heard a shout. Starting, and 
looking half round, I saw the lion just in the act of springing 
upon me. I was upon a little height ; he caught my shoulder as 
he sprang, and we both came to the ground below together. 
Growling horribly close to my ear, he shook me as a terrier dog 
does a rat. The shock produced a stupor similar to that which 
seems to be felt by a mouse after the first shake of the cat. 
It caused a sort of dreaminess, in which there was no sense 
of pain nor feeling of terror, though quite conscious of all that 
was happening. It was like what patients partially under the 
influence of chloroform describe, who see all the operation, but 
feel not the knife. This singular condition was not the result 
of any mental process. The shake annihilated fear, and allowed 
no sense of horror in looking round at the beast. This pecu- 
liar state is probably produced in all animals killed by the 
carnivora; and if so, is a merciful provision by our bene- 
volent Creator for lessening the pain of death. Turning round 
to relieve myself of the weight, as he had one paw on the back 
of my head, I saw his eyes directed to Mebalwe, who was trying 
to shoot him at a distance of ten or fifteen yards. His gun, a 
flint one, missed fire in both barrels ; the lion immediately left 



Chap. I. NAMES OF BECHUANA TRIBES. 13 

me, and, attacking Mebalwe, bit his thigh. Another man, whose 
life I had saved before, after he had been tossed by a buffalo, 
attempted to spear the lion while he was biting Mebalwe. He 
left Mebalwe and caught this man by the shoulder, but at that 
moment the bullets he had received took effect, and he fell down 
dead. The whole was the work of a few moments, and must have 
been Ins paroxysm of dying rage. In order to take out the charm 
from him, the Bakatla on the following day made a huge bonfire 
over the carcase, which was declared to be that of the largest 
lion they had ever seen. Besides crunching the bone into splinters, 
he left eleven teeth wounds on the upper part of my arm. 

A wound from this animal's tooth resembles a gun-shot wound ; 
it is generally followed by a great deal of sloughing and dis- 
charge, and pains are felt in the part periodically ever afterwards. 
I had on a tartan jacket on the occasion, and I believe that it 
wiped off all the virus from the teeth that pierced the flesh, for my 
two companions in this affray have both suffered from the pecu- 
liar pains, while I have escaped with only the inconvenience of a 
false joint in my limb. The man whose shoulder was wounded 
showed me his wound actually burst forth afresh on the same 
month of the following year. This curious point deserves the 
attention of inquirers. 

The different Bechuana tribes are named after certain animals, 
showing probably that in former times they were addicted to 
animal-worship like the ancient Egyptians. The term Bakatla 
means " they of the monkey ;" Bakuena, " they of the alligator ;" 
Batlapi, " they of the fish ;" each tribe having a superstitious 
dread of the animal after which it is called. They also use the 
word " bina," to dance, in reference to the custom of thus naming 
themselves, so that, when you wish to ascertain what tribe they 
belong to, you say, " What do you dance ? " It would seem as 
if that had been a part of the worship of old. A tribe never eats 
the animal which is its namesake, using the term " ila," hate or 
dread, in reference to killing it. We find traces of many ancient 
tribes in the country in individual members of those now extinct, 
as the Batau, " they of the lion ;" the Banoga, " they of the 
serpent ;" though no such tribes now exist. The use of the per- 
sonal pronoun they, Ba-Ma, Wa, Ya, or Ova, Am-Ki, &c, pre- 
vails very extensively in the names of tribes in Africa. A single 



14 SECHELE. Chap. I. 

individual is indicated by the terms Mo or Le. Thus Mokwain 
is a single person of the Bakwain tribe, and Lekoa is a single 
white man or Englishman — Makoa being Englishmen. 

I attached myself to the tribe called Bakuena, or Bakwains, 
the chief of which, named Sechele, was then living with his 
people at a place called Shokuane. I was from the first struck 
by his intelligence, and by the marked manner in which we both 
felt drawn to each other. As this remarkable man has not only 
embraced Christianity, but expounds its doctrines to his people, 
I will here give a brief sketch of his career. 

His great-grandfather Mochoasele was a great traveller, and 
the first that ever told the Bakwains of the existence of white 
men. In his father's lifetime two white travellers, whom I sup- 
pose to have been Dr. Cowan and Captain Donovan, passed 
through the country (in 1808), and descending the river Limpopo, 
were, with their party, all cut off by fever. The rain-makers 
there, fearing lest their waggons might drive away the rain, 
ordered them to be thrown into the river. This is the true 
account of the end of that expedition, as related to me by the 
son of the chief at whose village they perished. He remembered, 
when a boy, eating part of one of the horses, and said it tasted 
like zebra's flesh. Thus, they were not killed by the Bangwaketse, 
as reported, for they passed the Bakwains all well. The Bakwains 
were then rich in cattle ; and as one of the many evidences of the 
desiccation of the country, streams are pointed out where thou- 
sands and thousands of cattle formerly drank, but in which 
water now never flows, and where a single herd could not find 
fluid for its support. 

When Sechele was still a boy, his father, also called Mochoasele, 
was murdered by his own people for taking to himself the wives 
of his rich underchiefs. The children being spared, their friends 
invited Sebitu&ne, the chief of the Makololo, who was then in 
those parts, to reinstate them in the chieftainship. Sebituane 
surrounded the town of the Bakwains by night ; and just as it 
began to dawn Ins herald proclaimed in a loud voice that he had 
come to revenge the death of Mochoasele. This was followed by 
Sebituane's people beating loudly on their shields all round the 
town. The panic was tremendous, and the rush like that from a 
theatre on fire, while the Makololo used their javelins on the 



Chap. I. HIS CHIEFTAINSHIP. 15 

terrified Bakwains with a dexterity which they alone can employ. 
Sebituane had given orders to his men to spare the sons of the 
chief; and one of them, meeting Sechele, put him in ward by 
giving him such a blow on the head with a club as to render him 
insensible. The usurper was put to death ; and Sechele, reinstated 
in his chieftainship, felt much attached to Sebituane. The cir- 
cumstances here noticed ultimately led me, as will be seen by 
and by, into the new well-watered country to which this same 
Sebituane had preceded me by many years. 

Sechele married the daughters of three of his underchiefs, who 
had, on account of their blood relationship, stood by him in his 
adversity. This is one of the modes adopted for cementing the 
allegiance of a tribe. The government is patriarchal, each man 
being, by virtue of paternity, chief of his own children. They 
build their huts around his, and the greater the number of 
children the more his importance increases. Hence children are 
esteemed one of the greatest blessings, and are always treated 
kindly. Near the centre of each circle of huts there is a spot 
called a " kotla," with a fireplace ; here they work, eat, or sit 
and gossip over theiiews of the day. A poor man attaches him- 
self to the kotla of a rich one, and is considered a child of the 
latter. An underchief has a number of these circles around his ; 
and the collection of kotlas around the great one in the middle 
of the whole, that of the principal chief, constitutes the toAvn. 
The circle of huts immediately around the kotla of the chief is 
composed of the huts of Ins wives, and those of his blood relations. 
He attaches the underchiefs to himself and his government by 
marrying, as Sechele did, their daughters, or inducing his brothers 
to do so. They are fond of the relationship to great families. 
If you meet a party of strangers, and the head man's relationship 
to some uncle of a certain chief is not at once proclaimed by his 
attendants, you may hear him whispering, " Tell him who I 
am." This usually involves a counting on the fingers of a part 
of his genealogical tree ; and ends in the important announce- 
ment that the head of the party is half-cousin to some well- 
known ruler. 

Sechele was thus seated in his chieftainship when I made his 
acquaintance. On the first occasion in winch I ever attempted 
to hold a public religious service, he remarked that it was the 



16 SECHELE LEARNS TO READ. Chap. I. 

custom of his nation, when any new subject was brought before 
them, to put questions on it ; and he begged me to allow him to 
do the same in this case. On expressing my entire willingness 
to answer his questions, he inquired if my forefathers knew of 
a future judgment. I replied in the affirmative, and began to 
describe the scene of the " great white throne, and Him who shall 
sit on it, from whose face the heaven and earth shall flee away," 
&c. He said, " You startle me — these words make all my bones 
to shake — I have no more strength in me : but my forefathers were 
living at the same time yours were, and how is it that they did 
not send them word about these terrible things sooner ? They all 
passed away into darkness without knowing whither they were 
going." I got out of the difficulty by explaining the geographical 
barriers in the North, and the gradual spread of knowledge from 
the South, to which we first had access by means of ships ; and I 
expressed my belief that, as Christ had said, the whole world 
Avould yet be enlightened by the Gospel. Pointing to the great 
Kalahari desert, he said, " You never can cross that country to 
the tribes beyond ; it is utterly impossible even for us black men, 
except in certain seasons, when more than the usual supply of 
rain falls, and an extraordinary growth of water-melons follows. 
Even we who know the country would certainly perish without 
them." Ke-asserting my belief in the words of Christ, we parted ; 
and it will be seen further on that Sechele himself assisted me 
in crossing that desert which had previously proved an insur- 
mountable barrier to so many adventurers. 

As soon as he had an opportunity of learning, he set himself 
to read with such close application that, from being compara- 
tively thin, the effect of having been fond of the chase, he 
became quite corpulent from want of exercise. Mr. Oswell gave 
him his first lesson in figures, and he acquired the alphabet on 
the first day of my residence at Chonuane. He was by no 
means an ordinary specimen of the people, for I never went into 
the town but I was pressed to hear him read some chapters of 
the Bible. Isaiah was a great favourite with him ; and he was 
wont to use the same phrase nearly which the professor of 
Greek at Glasgow, Sir D. K. Sandford, once used respecting the 
Apostle Paul, when reading his speeches in the Acts : "He was 
a fine fellow, that Paul !" " He was a fine man, that Isaiah ; 



Chap. I. HIS DESIRE TO CONVERT HIS TRIBE. 17 

he knew how to speak." Sechele invariably offered me some- 
thing to eat on every occasion of my visiting him. 

Seeing me anxious that Ms people should believe the words 
of Christ, he once said, " Do you imagine these people will ever 
believe by your merely talking to them ? I can make them do 
nothing except by thrashing them ; and if you like, I shall call 
my head men, and with our litupa (whips of rhinoceros-hide) we 
will soon make them all believe together." The idea of using 
entreaty and persuasion to subjects to become Christians — 
whose opinion on no other matter would he condescend to ask — 
was especially surprising to him. He considered that they ought 
only to be too happy to embrace Christianity at his command. 
During the space of two years and a half he continued to profess 
to his people his full conviction of the truth of Christianity ; and 
in all discussions on the subject he took that side, acting at the 
same time in an upright manner in all the relations of life. He 
felt the difficulties of his situation long before I did, and often 
said, " 0, I wish you had come to this country before I became 
entangled in the meshes of our customs !" In fact, he could not 
get rid of Ins superfluous wives, without appearing to be ungrateful 
to their parents, who had done so much for him in Ins adversity. 

In the hope that others would be induced to join him in Ins 
attachment to Christianity, he asked me to begin family worship 
with him in his house. I did so ; and by-and-by was surprised 
to hear how well he conducted the prayer in his own simple and 
beautiful style, for he was quite a master of Ins own language. 
At tins time we were suffering from the effects of a drought, 
winch will be described further on, and none except his family, 
whom he ordered to attend, came near his meeting. " In former 
times," said he, "when a chief was fond of hunting, all Ins 
people got dogs and became fond of hunting too. If he was 
fond of dancing or music, all showed a liking to these amuse- 
ments too. If the chief loved beer, they all rejoiced in strong 
drink. But in tins case it is different. I love the Word of God, 
and not one of my brethren will join me." One reason why we 
had no volunteer hypocrites was the hunger from drought, which 
was associated in their minds with the presence of Christian in- 
struction ; and hypocrisy is not prone to profess a creed which 
seems to ensure an empty stomach. 

c 



18 BAPTISM OF SECHELE. Chap. I. 

Sechele continued to make a consistent profession for about 
three years ; and perceiving at last some of the difficulties of his 
case, and also feeling compassion for the poor women, who were 
by far the best of our scholars, I had no desire that he should 
be in any hurry to make a full profession by baptism, and 
putting away all his wives but one. His principal wife, too, 
was about the most unlikely subject in the tribe ever to become 
anything else than an out-and-out greasy disciple of the old 
school. She has since become greatly altered, I hear, for the 
better ; but again and again have I seen Sechele send her out 
of church to put her gown on, and away she would go with her 
lips shot out, the very picture of unutterable disgust at his new- 
fangled notions. 

When he at last applied for baptism, I simply asked him how 
he, having the Bible in his hand, and able to read it, thought he 
ought to act. He went home, gave each of his superfluous wives 
new clothing, and all his own goods, which they had been ac- 
customed to keep in their huts for him, and sent them to their 
parents with an intimation that he had no fault to find with them, 
but that in parting with them he wished to follow the will of God. 
On the day on which he and his children were baptized, great 
numbers came to see the ceremony. Some thought, from a 
stupid calumny circulated by enemies to Christianity in the 
south, that the converts would be made to drink an infusion of 
" dead men's brains," and were astonished to find that water only 
was used at baptism. Seeing several of the old men actually in 
tears during the service, I asked them afterwards the cause of 
their weeping ; they were crying to see their father, as the Scotch 
remark over a case of suicide, "so far left to himself." They 
seemed to think that I had thrown the glamour over him and 
that he had become mine. Here commenced an opposition which 
we had not previously experienced. All the friends of the 
divorced wives became the opponents of our religion. The at- 
tendance at school and church diminished to very few besides 
the chief 's own family. They all treated us still with respectful 
kindness, but to Sechele himself they said things which, as he 
often remarked, had they ventured on in former times, would 
have cost them their lives. It was trying, after all we had done, 
to see our labours so little appreciated; but we had sown the 



Chap. I. RELATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE. 19 

good seed, and have no doubt but it will yet spring up, though 
we may not live to see the fruits. 

Leaving this sketch of the chief, I proceed to give an equally 
rapid one of our dealing with Ins people, the Bakuena, or Bak- 
wains. A small piece of land, sufficient for a garden, was pur- 
chased when we first went to live with them, though that was 
scarcely necessary in a country where the idea of buying land 
was quite new. It was expected that a request for a suitable 
spot would have been made, and that we should have proceeded 
to occupy it, as any other member of the tribe would. But we 
explained to them that we wished to avoid any cause of future 
dispute when land had become more valuable ; or when a foolish 
chief began to reign, and we had erected large or expensive 
buildings, he might wish to claim the whole. These reasons 
were considered satisfactory. About 51. worth of goods were 
given for a piece of land, and an arrangement was come to 
that a similar piece should be allotted to any other mis- 
sionary, at any other place to which the tribe might remove. 
The particulars of the sale sounded strangely in the ears of the 
tribe, but were nevertheless readily agreed to. 

In our relations with this people we were simply strangers 
exercising no authority or control whatever. Our influence de- 
pended entirely on persuasion ; and, having taught them by kind 
conversation as well as by public instruction, I expected them to 
do what their own sense of right and wrong dictated. We never 
wished them to do right merely because it would be pleasing to 
us, nor thought ourselves to blame when they did wrong, although 
we were quite aware of the absurd idea to that effect. We saw 
that our teaching did good to the general mind of the people by 
bringing new and better motives into play. Five instances are 
positively known to me in winch by our influence on public 
opinion war was prevented ; and where, in individual cases, we 
failed, the people did no worse than they did before we came 
into the country. In general they were slow, like all the African 
people hereafter to be described, in coming to a decision on re- 
ligious subjects ; but in questions affecting their worldly affairs 
they were keenly alive to their own interests. They might be 
called stupid in matters which had not come within the sphere 
of their observation, but in other tilings they showed more

intelligence than is to be met with in our own uneducated pea- 
santry. They are remarkably accurate in their knowledge of 
cattle, sheep, and goats, knowing exactly the kind of pasturage 
suited to each ; and they select with great judgment the varieties 
of soil best suited to different kinds of grain. They are also 
familiar with the habits of wild animals, and in general are well 
up in the maxims which embody their ideas of political wisdom. 

The place where we first settled with the Bakwains is called 
Chonuane, and it happened to be visited, during the first year of 
our residence there, by one of those droughts which occur from 
time to time in even the most favoured districts of Africa. 

The belief in the gift or power of rain-making is one of the 
most deeply-rooted articles of faith in this country. The chief 
Sechele was himself a noted rain-doctor, and believed in it im- 
plicitly. He has often assured me that he found it more difficult 
to give up his faith in that than in anything else which Chris- 
tianity required him to abjure. I pointed out to him that the 
only feasible way of watering the gardens was to select some 
good never-failing river, make a canal, and irrigate the adjacent 
lands. Tins suggestion was immediately adopted, and soon the 
whole tribe was on the move to the Kolobeng, a stream about 
forty miles distant. The experiment succeeded admirably during 
the first year. The Bakwains made the canal and dam in ex- 
change for my labour in assisting to build a square house for 
their chief. They also built their own school under my superin- 
tendence. Our house at the river Kolobeng, winch gave a name 
to the settlement, was the third which I had reared with my own 
hands. A native smith taught me to weld iron ; and having im- 
proved by scraps of information in that line from Mr. Moffat, and 
also in carpentering and gardening, I was becoming handy at 
almost any trade, besides doctoring and preaching ; and as my 
wife could make candles, soap, and clothes, we came nearly up 
to what may be considered as indispensable in the accomplish- 
ments of a missionary family in Central Africa, namely, the 
husband to be a jack-of-all-trades without doors, and the wife a 
maid-of-all-work witliin. But in our second year again no rain 
fell. In the third the same extraordinary drought followed. 
Indeed, not ten inches of water fell during these two years, and 
the Kolobeng ran dry ; so many fish were killed that the hyaenas 



Chap. I. ACTIVITY OF THE ANT. 21 

from the whole country round collected to the feast, and were 
unable to finish the putrid masses. A large old alligator, winch 
had never been known to commit any depredations, was found 
left high and dry in the mud among the victims. The fourth 
year was equally unpropitious, the fall of rain being insufficient 
to bring the grain to maturity. Nothing could be more trying. 
We dug down in the bed of the river deeper and deeper as the 
water receded, striving to get a little to keep the fruit-trees alive 
for better times, but in vain. Needles lying out of doors for 
months did not rust ; and a mixture of sulphuric acid and water, 
used in a galvanic battery, parted with all its water to the air, 
instead of imbibing more from it, as it would have done in Eng- 
land. The leaves of indigenous trees were all drooping, soft, and 
slirivelled, though not dead; and those of the mimosae were 
closed at midday, the same as they are at night. In the midst 
of this dreary drought, it was wonderful to see those tiny crea- 
tures the ants running about with their accustomed vivacity. I 
put the bulb of a thermometer three niches under the soil in the 
sun at midday, and found the mercury to stand at 132° to 134° ; 
and if certain kinds of beetles were placed on the surface, they 
ran about a few seconds and expired. But this broiling heat only 
augmented the activity of the long-legged black ants : they never 
tire ; their organs of motion seem endowed with the same power 
as is ascribed by physiologists to the muscles of the human heart, 
by which that part of the frame never becomes fatigued, and 
winch may be imparted to all our bodily organs in that higher 
sphere to which we fondly hope to rise. Where do these ants get 
their moisture ? Our house was built on a hard ferruginous con- 
glomerate, in order to be out of the way of the white ant, but 
they came in despite the precaution ; and not only were they in 
this sultry weather able individually to moisten soil to the con- 
sistency of mortar for the formation of galleries, which in their 
way of working is done by night (so that they are screened from 
the observation of birds by day in passing and repassing towards 
any vegetable matter they may wish to devour), but, when their 
inner chambers were laid open, these were also surprisingly hu- 
mid ; yet there was no dew, and, the house being placed on a 
rock, they could have no subterranean passage to the bed of the 
river, which ran about three hundred yards below the hill. Can 



22 RAIN-MEDICINE. Chap. I. 

it be that they have the power of combining the oxygen and 
hydrogen of their vegetable food by vital force so as to form 
water ? * 

Kain, however, would not fall ; the Bakwains believed that I 
had bound Sechele with some magic spell, and I received depu- 
tations in the evenings, of the old counsellors, entreating me to 
allow him to make only a few showers : " The corn will die if you 
refuse, and we shall become scattered. Only let him make rain 
this once, and we shall all, men, women, and children, come to 
the school and sing and pray as long as you please." It was in 
vain to protest that I wished Sechele to act just according to his 
own ideas of what was right, as he found the law laid down in the 
Bible ; and it was distressing to appear hard-hearted to them. 
The clouds often collected promisingly over us, and rolling 
thunder seemed to portend refreshing showers, but next morning 
the sun would rise in a clear cloudless sky ; indeed, even these 
lowering appearances were less frequent by far than days of sun- 
shine are in London. 

The natives, finding it irksome to sit and wait helplessly until 
God gives them rain from heaven, entertain the more comfort- 
able idea that they can help themselves by a variety of prepara- 
tions, such as charcoal made of burned bats, inspissated renal 
deposit of the mountain coney (Hyrax capensis) (which by the 
way is used in the form of pills as a good anti-spasmodic, 
under the name of " stone-sweat " t ), the internal parts of 
different animals — as jackals' livers, baboons' and lions' hearts, 
and hairy calculi from the bowels of old cows — serpents' skins and 
vertebras, and every kind of tuber, bulb, root, and plant to be 
found in the country. Although you disbelieve their efficacy in 
charming the clouds to pour out their refreshing treasures, yet, 
conscious that civility is useful everywhere, you kindly state that 
you think they are mistaken as to their power ; the rain-doctor 
selects a particular bulbous root, pounds it, and administers a 
cold infusion to a sheep, which in five minutes afterwards expires

in convulsions. Part of the same bulb is converted into smoke, 
and ascends towards the sky ; rain follows in a day or two. The 
inference is obvious. Were we as much harassed by droughts, 
the logic would be irresistible in England in 1857. 

As the Bakwains believed that there must be some connection 
between the presence of " God's Word " in their town and these 
successive and distressing droughts, they looked with no good will 
at the church-bell, but still they invariably treated us with kind- 
ness and respect. I am not aware of ever having had an enemy 
in the tribe. The only avowed cause of dislike was expressed by 
a very influential and sensible man, the uncle of Sechele. " We 
like you as well as if you had been born among us ; you are the 
only white man we can become familiar with (thoaela) ; but we 
wish you to give up that everlasting preaching and praying ; we 
cannot become familiar with that at all. You see we never get 
rain, while those tribes who never pray as we do obtain abund- 
ance." Tins was a fact ; and we often saw it raining on the hills, 
ten miles off, while it would not look at us " even with one eye." 
If the Prince of the power of the air had no hand in scorching us 
up, I fear I often gave him the credit of doing so. 

As for the rain-makers, they carried the sympathies of the 
people along with them, and not without reason. With the 
following arguments they were all acquainted, and in order to 
understand their force we must place ourselves in their position, 
and believe, as they do, that all medicines act by a mysterious 
charm. The term for cure may be translated " charm " {alalia). 
Medical Doctor. — Hail, friend! How very many medicines 
you have about you tins morning ! Why, you have every medi- 
cine in the country here. 

Main Doctor. — Very true, my friend ; and I ought ; for the 
whole country needs the rain which I am making. 

M. D. — So you really believe that you can command the 
clouds ? I think that can be done by God alone. 

R. D. — We both believe the very same thing. It is God that 
makes the rain, but I pray to him by means of these medicines, 
and, the rain coming, of course it is then mine. It was I who 
made it for the Bakwains for many years, when they were at 
Shokuane ; through my wisdom, too, their women became fat 
and shining. Ask them ; they will tell you the same as I do. 



24 CONVERSATION ON RAIN-MAKING. Chap. I. 

]yj m j) m — But we are distinctly told in the parting words of our 
Saviour that we can pray to God acceptably in His name alone, 
and not by means of medicines. 

R, D. — Truly ! but God told us differently. He made black 
men first, and did not love us, as he did the white men. He 
made you beautiful, and gave you clothing, and guns, and gun- 
powder, and horses, and waggons, and many other things about 
which we know nothing. But toward us he had no heart. 
He gave us nothing, except the assegai, and cattle, and rain- 
making ; and he did not give us hearts like yours. We never 
love each other. Other tribes place medicines about our country 
to prevent the rain, so that we may be dispersed by hunger, and 
go to them, and augment their power. We must dissolve their 
charms by our medicines. God has given us one little tiling, 
which you know nothing of. He has given us the knowledge 
of certain medicines by which we can make rain. We do not 
despise those things which you possess, though we are ignorant 
of them. We don't understand your book, yet we don't despise 
it. You ought not to despise our little knowledge, though you 
are ignorant of it. 

M. D. — I don't despise what I am ignorant of ; I only think 
you are mistaken in saying that you have medicines which can 
influence the rain at all. 

R. D. — That's just the way people speak when they talk on a 
subject of which they have no knowledge. When we first opened 
our eyes, we found our forefathers making rain, and we follow in 
their footsteps. You, who send to Kuruman for corn, and irrigate 
your garden, may do without rain ; we cannot manage in that 
way. If we had no rain, the cattle would have no pasture, the 
cows give no milk, our children become lean and die, our wives 
run away to other tribes who do make rain and have corn, and the 
whole tribe become dispersed and lost ; our fire would go out. 

M. D. — I quite agree with you as to the value of the rain ; 
but you cannot charm the clouds by medicines. You wait till 
you see the clouds come, then you use your medicines, and take 
the credit which belongs to God only. 

R. D. — I use my medicines, and you employ yours ; we are 
both doctors, and doctors are not deceivers. You give a patient 
medicine. Sometimes God is pleased to heal him by means of 



Chap. I. CONVERSATION ON RAIN-MAKING. 25 

your medicine : sometimes not — he dies. When he is cured, you 
take the credit of what God does. I do the same. Sometimes 
God grants us rain, sometimes not. When he does, we take the 
credit of the charm. When a patient dies, you don't give up trust 
in your medicine, neither do I when rain fails. If you wish me to 
leave off my medicines, why continue your own ? 

M. D. — I give medicine to living creatures within my reach, 
and can see the effects though no cure follows ; you pretend to 
charm the clouds, which are so far above us that your medicines 
never reach them. The clouds usually lie in one direction, and 
your smoke goes in another. God alone can command the clouds. 
Only try and wait patiently ; God will give us rain without your 
medicines. 

R. D. — Mahala-ma-kapa-a-a ! ! Well, I always thought white 
men were wise till this morning. Who ever thought of making 
trial of starvation ! Is death pleasant then ? 

M. D. — Could you make it rain on one spot and not on 
another ? 

R. D. — I wouldn't think of trying. I like to see the whole 
country green, and all the people glad ; the women clapping 
their hands and giving me their ornaments for thankfulness, and 
lullilooing for joy. 

M. D. — I think you deceive both them and yourself. 

R. D. — Well, then, there is a pair of us (meaning both are 
rogues). 

The above is only a specimen of their way of reasoning, in 
which, when the language is well understood, they are perceived 
to be remarkably acute. These arguments are generally known, 
and I never succeeded in convincing a single individual of their 
fallacy, though I tried to do so in every way I could think of. 
Their faith in medicines as charms is unbounded. The general 
effect of argument is to produce the impression that you are not 
anxious for rain at all ; and it is very undesirable to allow the 
idea to spread that you do not take a generous interest in their 
welfare. An angry opponent of rain-making in a tribe would be 
looked upon as were some Greek merchants in England during 
the Eussian war. 

The conduct of the people during this long-continued drought 
was remarkably good. The women parted with most of then- 



26 THE HOPO. Chap. I. 

ornaments to purchase corn from more fortunate tribes. The 
children scoured the country in search of the numerous bulbs 
and roots which can sustain life, and the men engaged in hunting. 
Very great numbers of the large game, buffaloes, zebras, giraffes, 
tsessebes, kamas or hartebeests, kokongs or gnus, pallas, rhinoce- 
roses, &c, congregated at some fountains near Kolobeng, and the 
trap called "Aopo" was constructed in the lands adjacent for 
their destruction. The hopo consists of two hedges in the form 
of the letter V, which are very high and thick near the angle. 
Instead of the hedges being joined there, they are made to form 
a lane of about fifty yards in length, at the extremity of which a 
pit is formed, six or eight feet deep, and about twelve or fifteen in 
breadth and length. Trunks of trees are laid across the margins 
of the pit, and more especially over that nearest the lane where 
the animals are expected to leap in, and over that farthest from, 
the lane where it is supposed they will attempt to escape after 
they are in. The trees form an overlapping border, and render 
escape almost impossible. The whole is carefully decked with 
short green rushes, making the pit like a concealed pitfall. As 
the hedges are frequently about a mile long, and about as much 
apart at their extremities, a tribe making a circle three or four 
miles round the country adjacent to the opening, and gradually 
closing up, are almost sure to enclose a large body of game. 
Driving it up with shouts to the narrow part of the hopo, men 
secreted there throw their javelins into the affrighted herds, and 
on the animals rush to the opening presented at the converging 
hedges, and into the pit till that is full of a living mass. Some 
escape by running over the others, as a Smithfield market dog- 
does over the sheep's backs. It is a frightful scene. The men, 
wild with excitement, spear the lovely animals with mad delight : 
others of the poor creatures, borne down by the weight of their 
dead and dying companions, every now and then make the whole 
mass heave in their smothering agonies. 

The Bakwains often killed between sixty and seventy head of 
large game at the different hopos in a single week ; and as 
every one, both rich and poor, partook of the prey, the meat 
counteracted the bad effects of an exclusively vegetable diet. 
When the poor, who had no salt, were forced to live entirely on 
roots, they were often troubled with indigestion. Such cases we 




mlntm ' . 



Chap. I. SALT A CUKE FOR INDIGESTION. 27 

had frequent opportunities of seeing at other times, for, the dis- 
trict being destitute of salt, the rich alone could afford to buy it. 
The native doctors, aware of the cause of the malady, usually 
prescribed some of that ingredient with their medicines. The 
doctors themselves had none, so the poor resorted to us for aid. 
We took the hint, and henceforth cured the disease by giving a 
teaspoonful of salt, minus the other remedies. Either milk or 
meat had the same effect, though not so rapidly as salt. Long 
afterwards, when I was myself deprived of salt for four months, 
at two distinct periods, I felt no desire for that condiment, but I 
was plagued by very great longing for the above articles of food. 
This continued as long as I was confined to an exclusively ve- 
getable diet, and when I procured a meal of flesh, though boiled 
in perfectly fresh rain-water, it tasted as pleasantly saltish as if 
slightly impregnated with the condiment. Milk or meat, obtained 
in however small quantities, removed entirely the excessive 
longing and dreaming about roasted ribs of fat oxen, and 
bowls of cool thick milk gurgling forth from the big-bellied 
calabashes ; and I could then understand the thankfulness to 
Mrs. L. often expressed by poor Bakwain women, in the in- 
teresting condition, for a very little of either. 

In addition to other adverse influences, the general uncer- 
tainty, though not absolute want, of food, and the necessity of 
frequent absence for the purpose of either hunting game or 
collecting roots and fruits, proved a serious barrier to the 
progress of the people in knowledge. Our own education in 
England is carried on at the comfortable breakfast and dinner 
table and by the cosy fire, as well as in the church and 
school. Few English people with stomachs painfully empty 
would be decorous at church any more than they are when 
these organs are overcharged. Kagged schools would have 
been a failure had not the teachers wisely provided food for 
the body as well as food for the mind; and not only must 
we show a friendly interest in the bodily comfort of the objects 
of our sympathy as a Christian duty, but we can no more 
hope for healthy feelings among the poor, either at home or 
abroad, without feeding them into them, than we can hope to 
see an ordinary working-bee reared into a queen-mother by 
the ordinary food of the hive. 



28 MEANS TO PROMOTE CIVILIZATION. Chap. I. 

Sending the Gospel to the heathen must, if this view be correct, 
include much more than is implied in the usual picture of a 
missionary, namely, a man going about with a Bible under his 
arm. The promotion of commerce ought to be specially attended 
to, as tins, more speedily than anything else, demolishes that 
sense of isolation which heathenism engenders, and makes the 
tribes feel themselves mutually dependent on, and mutually bene- 
ficial to, each other. With a view to this the missionaries at 
Kuruman got permission from the Government for a trader to 
reside at the station, and a considerable trade has been the result ; 
the trader liimself has become rich enough to retire with a com- 
petence. Those laws which still prevent free commercial inter- 
course among the civilized nations seem to be nothing else but the 
remains of our own heathenism. My observations on this subject 
make me extremely desirous to promote the preparation of the 
raw materials of European manufactures in Africa, for by that 
means we may not only put a stop to the slave-trade, but intro- 
duce the negro family into the body corporate of nations, no one 
member of which can suffer without the others suffering with it. 
Success in tins, in both Eastern and Western Africa, would lead, 
in the course of time, to a much larger diffusion of the blessings 
of civilization than efforts exclusively spiritual and educational 
confined to any one small tribe. These, however, it would of 
course be extremely desirable to carry on at the same time at 
large central and healthy stations, for neither civilization nor 
Christianity can be promoted alone. In fact, they are in- 
separable.

Another adverse influence with which the mission had to contend 
was the vicinity of the Boers of the Cashan Mountains, otherwise 
named " Magaliesberg." These are not to be confounded with 
the Cape colonists, who sometimes pass by the name. The word 
Boer simply means " farmer," and is not synonymous with our 
word boor. Indeed, to the Boers generally the latter term would 
be quite inappropriate, for they are a sober, industrious, and most 
hospitable body of peasantry. Those, however, who have fled 
from English law on various pretexts, and have been joined by 
English deserters and every other variety of bad character in 
then distant localities, are unfortunately of a very different stamp. 
The great objection many of the Boers had, and still have, to 
English law is that it makes no distinction between black 
men and white. They felt aggrieved by their supposed losses in 
the emancipation of their Hottentot slaves, and determined to 
erect themselves into a republic, in which they might pursue 
without molestation the " proper treatment of the blacks." It is 
almost needless to add that the " proper treatment " has always 
contained in it the essential element of slavery, namely, compul- 
sory unpaid labour. 

One section of tins body, under the late Mr. Hendrick Potgeiter, 
penetrated the interior as far as the Cashan Mountains, whence a 



30 TREATMENT OF NATIVES BY BOERS. Chap. II. 

Zulu or Caffre chief, named Mosilikatze, had been expelled by 
the well-known Caffre Dingaan ; and a glad welcome was given 
them by the Bechuana tribes, who had just escaped the hard 
sway of that cruel chieftain. They came with the prestige of 
white men and deliverers; but the Bechuanas soon found, as 
they expressed it, " that Mosilikatze was cruel to his enemies, and 
kind to those he conquered ; but that the Boers destroyed their 
enemies, and made slaves of their friends." The tribes who still 
retain the semblance of independence are forced to perform all 
the labour of the fields, such as manuring the land, weeding, 
reaping, building, making dams and canals, and at the same 
time to support themselves. I have myself been an eye-witness 
of Boers coming to a village, and, according to their usual custom, 
demanding twenty or thirty women to weed their gardens, and 
have seen these women proceed to the scene of unrequited toil, 
carrying their own food on their heads, their children on their 
backs, and instruments of labour on their shoulders. Nor have 
the Boers any wish to conceal the meanness of thus employing 
unpaid labour ; on the contrary, every one of them, from Mr. 
Potgeiter and Mr. Gert Krieger, the commandants, downwards, 
lauded his own humanity and justice in making such an equitable 
regulation. " We make the people work for us, in consideration 
of allowing them to live in our country." 

I can appeal to the Commandant Krieger if the foregoing is 
not a fan and impartial statement of the views of himself and his 
people. I am sensible of no mental bias towards or against these 
Boers ; and during the several journeys I made to the poor 
enslaved tribes, I never avoided the whites, but tried to cure and 
did administer remedies to their sick, without money and without 
price. It is due to them to state that I was invariably treated 
with respect ; but it is most unfortunate that they should have 
been left by their own Church for so many years to deteriorate 
and become as degraded as the blacks, whom the stupid prejudice 
against colour leads them to detest. 

This new species of slavery winch they have adopted serves to 
supply the lack of field-labour only. The demand for domestic 
servants must be met by forays on tribes which have good 
supplies of cattle. The Portuguese can quote instances in which 
blacks become so degraded by the love of strong drink as 



Chap. II. TREATMENT OF NATIVES BY BOERS. 31 

actually to sell themselves ; but never in any one case, within 
the memory of man, has a Bechuana chief sold any of his 
people, or a Bechuana man his child. Hence the necessity for 
a foray to seize children. And those individual Boers who 
would not engage in it for the sake of slaves can seldom resist 
the two-fold plea of a well-told story of an intended uprising 
of the devoted tribe, and the prospect of handsome pay in the 
division of the captured cattle besides. 

It is difficult for a person in a civilised country to conceive 
that any body of men possessing the common attributes of 
humanity (and these Boers are by no means destitute of the 
better feelings of our nature) should with one accord set out, 
after loading their own wives and children with caresses, and 
proceed to shoot down in cold blood men and women, of a 
different colour, it is true, but possessed of domestic feelings and 
affections equal to their own. I saw and conversed with children 
in the houses of Boers who had by their own and their masters' 
account been captured, and in several instances I traced the 
parents of these unfortunates, though the plan approved by the 
long-headed among the burghers is to take children so young 
that they soon forget their parents and their native language 
also. It was long before I could give credit to the tales of 
bloodshed told by native witnesses, and had I received no other 
testimony but theirs I should probably have continued sceptical 
to this day as to the truth of the accounts ; but when I found 
the Boers themselves, some bewailing and denouncing, others 
glorying in the bloody scenes in which they had been themselves 
the actors, I was compelled to admit the validity of the testi- 
mony, and try to account for the cruel anomaly. They are all 
traditionally religious, tracing their descent from some of the 
best men (Huguenots and Dutch) the world ever saw. Hence 
they claim to themselves the title of " Christians," and all the 
coloured race are " black property " or " creatures." They being 
the chosen people of God, the heathen are given to them for 
an inheritance, and they are the rod of divine vengeance on the 
heathen, as were the Jews of old. Living in the midst of a native 
population much larger than themselves, and at fountains removed 
many miles from each other, they feel somewhat in the same 
insecure position as do the Americans in the Southern States. 



32 BOERS AFRAID OF THE CAFFRES. Chap. II. 

The first question put by them to strangers is respecting peace ; 
and when they receive reports from disaffected or envious natives 
against any tribe, the case assumes all the appearance and pro- 
portions of a regular insurrection. Severe measures then appear 
to the most mildly disposed among them as imperatively called 
for, and, however bloody the massacre that follows, no qualms 
of conscience ensue : it is a dire necessity for the sake of peace. 
Indeed the late Mr. Hendrick Potgeiter most devoutly believed 
himself to be the great peacemaker of the country. 

But how is it that the natives, being so vastly superior in 
numbers to the Boers, do not rise and annihilate them? The 
people among whom they live are Bechuanas, not Caffres, though 
no one would ever learn that distinction from a Boer ; and 
history does not contain one single instance in which the Bechu- 
anas, even those of them who possess fire-arms, have attacked 
either the Boers or the English. If there is such an instance, 
I am certain it is not generally known, either beyond or in the 
Cape Colony. They have defended themselves when attacked, 
as in the case of Sechele, but have never engaged in offensive 
war with Europeans. We have a very different tale to tell of 
the Caffres, and the difference has always been so evident to 
these border Boers, that, ever since " those magnificent savages "* 
obtained possession of fire-arms, not one Boer has ever attempted 
to settle in Caffreland, or even face them as an enemy in the 
field. The Boers have generally manifested a marked antipathy 
to anything but " long-shot " warfare, and, sidling away in their 
emigrations towards the more effeminate Bechuanas, have left 
then quarrels with the Caffres to be settled by the English, and 
then* wars to be paid for by English gold. 

The Bakwains at Kolobeng had the spectacle of various tribes 
enslaved before their eyes — the Bakatla, the Batlokua, the Bahu- 
keng, the Bamosetla, and two other tribes of Bakwains were all 
groaning under the oppression of unrequited labour. This would 
not have been felt as so great an evil, but that the young men 
of those tribes, anxious to obtain cattle, the only means of rising 
to respectability and importance among their own people, were 
in the habit of sallying forth, like our Irish and Highland 
reapers, to procure work in the Cape Colony. After labouring 
* The ' United Service Journal ' so styles them. 



Chap. II. EFFECTS OF SLAVE-SYSTEM. 33 

there three or four years, in building stone dykes and dams 
for the Dutch farmers, they were well content if at the end of 
that time they could return with as many cows. On presenting 
one to their cliief they ranked as respectable men in the tribe 
ever afterwards. These volunteers were highly esteemed among 
the Dutch, under the name of Mantatees. They were paid at 
the rate of one shilling a day and a large loaf of bread between 
six of them. Numbers of them, who had formerly seen me about 
twelve hundred miles inland from the Cape, recognised me with 
the loud laughter of joy when I was passing them at their work 
in the Koggefelt and Bokkefelt, within a few days of Cape Town. 
I conversed with them and with elders of the Dutch Church, 
for whom they were working, and found that the system was 
thoroughly satisfactory to both parties. I do not believe that 
there is one Boer, in the Cashan or Magaliesberg country, who 
would deny that a law was made, in consequence of this labour 
passing to the colony, to deprive these labourers of their hardly- 
earned cattle, for the very cogent reason, that, " if they want to 
work, let them work for us their masters," though boasting that 
in then case it would not be paid for. I can never cease to be 
most unfeignedly thankful that I was not born in a land of slaves. 
No one can understand the effect of the unutterable meanness of 
the slave-system on the minds of those who, but for the strange 
obliquity which prevents them from feeling the degradation of not 
being gentlemen enough to pay for services rendered, would be 
equal in virtue to ourselves. Fraud becomes as natural to them 
as " paying one's way " is to the rest of mankind. 

Wherever a missionary lives, traders are sure to come ; they 
are mutually dependent, and each aids in the work of the other ; 
but experience shows that the two employments cannot very well 
be combined in the same person. Such a combination would not 
be morally wrong, for nothing would be more fair, and apostolical 
too, than that the man who devotes his time to the spiritual wel- 
fare of a people should derive temporal advantage from upright 
commerce, which traders, who aim exclusively at their own en- 
richment, modestly imagine ought to be left to them. But 
though it is right for missionaries to trade, the present system of 
missions renders it inexpedient to spend time in so doing. No 
missionary with whom I ever came in contact, traded ; and while 

D 



34 JESUIT AND PKOTESTANT MISSIONAKIES. Chap. II. 

the traders, whom we introduced and rendered secure in the 
country, waxed rich, the missionaries have invariably remained 
poor, and have died so. The Jesuits, in Africa at least, were 
wiser in their generation than we ; theirs were large influential 
communities, proceeding on the system of turning the abilities of 
every brother into that channel in which he was most likely to excel ; 
one, fond of natural history, was allowed to follow his bent; another, 
fond of literature, found leisure to pursue his studies ; and he who 
was great in barter was sent in search of ivory and gold-dust ; 
so that while in the course of performing the religious acts of his 
mission to distant tribes he found the means of aiding effectually 
the brethren whom he had left at the central settlement.* We 
Protestants, with the comfortable conviction of superiority, have 
sent out missionaries with a bare subsistence only, and are unsparing 
in our laudations of some for not being worldly-minded whom our 
niggardliness made to live as did the prodigal son. I do not speak 
for myself, nor need I to do so, but for that very reason I feel at 
liberty to interpose a word in behalf of others. I have before 
my mind at this moment facts and instances which warrant my 
putting the case in this way : — The command to " go into all 
the world and preach the gospel to every creature " must be 
obeyed by Christians either personally or by substitute. Now 
it is quite possible to find men whose love for the heathen and 
devotion to the work will make them ready to go forth on the 
terms " bare subsistence," but what can be thought of the justice, 
to say nothing of the generosity, of Christians and churches 
who not only work their substitutes at the lowest terms, but 
regard what they give as charity! The matter is the more 
grave in respect to the Protestant missionary, who may have a 
wife and family. The fact is, there are many cases in which it 
is right, virtuous, and praiseworthy for a man to sacrifice every- 
tliing for a great object, but in which it would be very wrong for 

* The Dutch clergy, too, are not wanting in worldly wisdom. A fountain 
is bought, and the lands which it can irrigate parcelled out and let to villagers. 
As they increase in numbers the rents rise and the church becomes rich. With 
2001. per annum in addition from government, the salary amounts to 4007. or 
500Z. a-year. The clergymen then preach abstinence from politics as a Chris- 
tian duty. It is quite clear that, with 400Z. a-year, but little else except pure 
spirituality is required. 



Chap. II. KAKE'S REBELLION. 35 

others, interested in the object as much as he, to suffer or accept 
the sacrifice, if they can prevent it. 

English traders sold those articles which the Boers most dread, 
namely, arms and ammunition ; and when the number of guns 
amounted to five, so much alarm was excited among our neigh- 
bours that an expedition of several hundred Boers was seriously 
planned to deprive the Bakwains of their guns. Knowing that 
the latter would rather have fled to the Kalahari Desert than 
deliver up then* weapons and become slaves, I proceeded to the 
commandant, Mr. Gert Krieger, and, representing the evils of 
any such expedition, prevailed upon him to defer it ; but that 
point being granted, the Boer wished to gain another, which was, 
that I should act as a spy over the Bakwains. 

I explained the impossibility of my complying with his wish, 
even though my principles as an Englishman had not stood in the 
way, by referring to an instance in which Sechele had gone with 
his whole force to punish an under-chief without my knowledge. 
This man, whose name was Kake, rebelled, and was led on in 
his rebellion by his father-in-law, who had been regicide in the 
case of Sechele's father. Several of those who remained faithful 
to that chief were maltreated by Kake while passing to the 
Desert in search of skins. We had just come to live with the 
Bakwains when tins happened, and Sechele consulted me. I 
advised mild measures, but the messengers he sent to Kake were 
taunted with the words, " He only pretends to wish to follow the 
advice of the teacher: Sechele is a coward; let. him come and 
fight if he dare." The next time the offence was repeated, 
Sechele told me he was going to hunt elephants ; and as I knew 
the system of espionage which prevails among all the tribes, I 
never made any inquiries that would convey the opinion that I 
distrusted them. I gave credit to Ins statement. He asked 
the loan of a black-metal pot to cook with, as theirs of pottery 
are brittle. I gave it and a handful of salt, and desired him to 
send back two tit-bits, the proboscis and fore-foot of the elephant. 
He set off, and I heard nothing more until we saw the Bakwains 
carrying home their wounded, and heard some of the women 
uttering the loud wail of sorrow for the dead, and others pealing 
forth the clear scream of victory. It was then clear that Sechele 
had attacked and driven away the rebel.

30 ESPIONAGE — TALE OF THE CANNON. Chap. II. 

Mentioning this to the commandant in proof of the impossi- 
bility of granting his request, I had soon an example how quickly 
a story can grow among idle people. The five guns were, within 
one month, multiplied into a tale of five hundred, and the 
cooking-pot, now in a museum at Cape Town, was magnified 
into a cannon ; " I had myself confessed to the loan." Where 
the five hundred guns came from, it was easy to divine ; for, 
knowing that I used a sextant, my connection with Government 
was a thing of course ; and, as I must know all Her Majesty's 
counsels, I was questioned on the subject of the indistinct rumours 
which had reached them of Lord Kosse's telescope. "What 
right has your government to set up that large glass at the 
Cape to look after us behind the Cashan Mountains ? " 

Many of the Boers visited us afterwards at Kolobeng, some for 
medical advice, and others to trade in those very articles which 
their own laws and policy forbid. When I happened to stumble 
upon any of them in the town, with his muskets and powder dis- 
played, he would begin an apology, on the ground that he was a 
poor man, &c, which I always cut short by frankly saying that I 
had nothing to do with either the Boers or their laws. Many 
attempts were made during these visits to elicit the truth about 
the guns and cannon ; and, ignorant of the system of espionage 
winch prevails, eager inquiries were made by them among those 
who could jabber a little Dutch. It is noticeable that the system 
of espionage is as well developed among the savage tribes as in 
Austria or Kussia. It is a proof of barbarism. Every man in a 
tribe feels himself bound to tell the cliief everything that comes 
to his knowledge, and, when questioned by a stranger, either gives 
answers which exhibit the utmost stupidity, or such as he knows 
will be agreeable to Ins cliief. I believe that in this way have 
arisen tales of their inability to count more than ten, as was 
asserted of the Bechuanas about the very time when Sechele's 
father counted out one thousand head of cattle as a beginning of 
the stock of Ins young* son. 

In the present case Sechele, knowing every question put to his 
people, asked me how they ought to answer. My reply was, 
"Tell the truth." Every one then declared that no cannon 
existed there ; and our friends, judging the answer by what they 
themselves would in the circumstances have said, were confirmed 



Chap. II. HOSTILITY OF THE BOERS. 37 

in the opinion that the Bakwains actually possessed artillery. 
This was in some degree beneficial to us, inasmuch as fear pre- 
vented any foray in our direction for eight years. During that 
time no winter passed without one or two tribes in the East 
country being plundered of both cattle and children by the Boers. 
The plan pursued is the following : one or two friendly tribes are 
forced to accompany a party of mounted Boers, and these expe- 
ditions can be got up only in the winter, when horses may be used 
without danger of behig lost by disease. When they reach the 
tribe to be attacked, the friendly natives are ranged in front, to 
form, as they say, " a shield ; " the Boers then coolly fire over 
their heads till the devoted people flee and leave cattle, wives, 
and children to the captors. This was done in nine cases during 
my residence in the interior, and on no occasion was a drop of 
Boer's blood shed. News of these deeds spread quickly among 
the Bakwains, and letters were repeatedly sent by the Boers to 
Sechele ordering him to come and surrender himself as their 
vassal, and stop English traders from proceeding into the country 
with firearms for sale. But the discovery of Lake Ngami, here- 
after to be described, made the traders come in fivefold greater 
numbers, and Sechele replied, " I was made an independent chief 
and placed here by God, and not by you. I was never conquered 
by Mosilikatze, as those tribes whom you rule over; and the 
English are my friends. I get everything I wish from them. I 
cannot hinder them from going where they like." Those who are 
old enough to remember the threatened invasion of our own island 
may understand the effect which the constant danger of a Boerish 
invasion had on the minds of the Bakwains ; but no others can 
conceive how worrying were the messages and threats from the 
endless self-constituted authorities of the Magaliesberg Boers ; and 
when to all this harassing annoyance was added the scarcity pro- 
duced by the drought, we could not wonder at, though we felt 
sorry for, their indisposition to receive instruction. 

The myth of the black pot assumed serious proportions. I 
attempted to benefit the tribes among the Boers of Magaliesberg 
by placing native teachers at different points. " You must teach 
the blacks," said Mr. Hendrick Potgeiter, the commandant in 
chief, " that they are not equal to us." Other Boers told me, " I 
might as well teach the baboons on the rocks as the Africans," 



38 BOERS COMPARED TO BUSHMEN. Chap. II. 

but declined the test which I proposed, namely, to examine whether 
they or my native attendants could read best. Two of their clergy- 
men came to baptize the children of the Boers ; so, supposing 
these good men would assist me in overcoming the repugnance of 
their flock to the education of the blacks, I called on them ; but 
my visit ended in a ruse practised by the Boerish commandant, 
whereby I was led, by professions of the greatest friendship, to 
retire to Kolobeng, while a letter passed me by another way to 
the other missionaries in the south, demanding my instant recall 
" for lending a cannon to their enemies." The colonial govern- 
ment was also gravely informed that the story was true; and I came 
to be looked upon as a most suspicious character in consequence. 
These notices of the Boers are not intended to produce a sneer 
at their ignorance, but to excite the compassion of their friends. 
They are perpetually talking about their laws; but practically 
theirs is only the law of the strongest. The Bechuanas could 
never understand the changes winch took place in their com- 
mandants. " Why, one can never know who is the chief among 
these Boers. Like the Bushmen, they have no king — they must 
be the Bushmen of the English." The idea that any tribe of men 
could be so senseless as not to have an hereditary chief was so 
absurd to these people, that, in order not to appear equally stupid, 
I was obliged to tell them that we English were so anxious to 
preserve the royal blood, that we had made a young lady our 
chief. This seemed to them a most convincing proof of our sound 
sense. We shall see farther on the confidence my account of our 
Queen inspired. 

The Boers, encouraged by the accession of Mr. Pretorius, deter- 
mined at last to put a stop to English traders going past Kolobeng, 
by dispersing the tribe of Bakwains, and expelling all the mis- 
sionaries. Sir George Cathcart proclaimed the independence of 
the Boers, the best thing that could have been done had they 
been between us and the Caffres. A treaty was entered into 
with these Boers ; an article for the free passage of Englishmen 
to the country beyond, and also another, that no slavery should 
be allowed in the independent territory, were duly inserted, as 
expressive of the views of Her Majesty's government at home. 
" But what about the missionaries ?" inquired the Boers. " You 
may do as you please with them,' is said to have been the answer 



Chap. II. THEY MAKE WAR ON THE BAKWAINS. 39 

of the "Commissioner." This remark, if uttered at all, was 
probably made in joke : designing men, however, circulated it, 
and caused the general belief in its accuracy winch now prevails 
all over the country, and doubtless led to the destruction of three 
mission stations immediately after. The Boers, four hundred in 
number, were sent by the late Mr. Pretorius to attack the Bak- 
wains in 1852. , Boasting that the English had given up all the 
blacks into their power, and had agreed to aid them in their sub- 
jugation by preventing all supplies of ammunition from coming 
into the Bechuana country, they assaulted the Bakwains, and, 
besides killing a considerable number of adults, carried off two 
hundred of our school children into slavery. The natives under 
Sechele defended themselves till the approach of night enabled 
them to flee to the mountains ; and having in that defence killed 
a number of the enemy, the very first ever slain in this country 
by Bechuanas, I received the credit of having taught the tribe 
to kill Boers ! My house, which had stood perfectly secure for 
years under the protection of the natives, was plundered in re- 
venge. English gentlemen, who had come in the footsteps of 
Mr. Cumming to hunt in the country beyond, and had deposited 
large quantities of stores in the same keeping, and upwards of 
eighty head of cattle as relays for the return journeys, were 
robbed of all ; and when they came back to Kolobeng found the 
skeletons of the guardians strewed all over the place. The books 
of a good library — my solace in our solitude — were not taken 
away, but handfuls of the leaves were torn out and scattered 
over the place. My stock of medicines was smashed ; and all 
our furniture and clothing carried off and sold at public auction 
to pay the expenses of the foray. 

I do not mention these things by way of making a pitiful wail 
over my losses, nor in order to excite commiseration ; for though 
I do feel sorry for the loss of lexicons, dictionaries, &c., which had 
been the companions of my boyhood, yet, after all, the plundering 
only set me entirely free for my expedition to the north, and I 
have never since had a moment's concern for anything I left 
behind. The Boers resolved to shut up the interior, and I deter- 
mined to open the country ; and we shall see who have been most 
successful in resolution — they or I. 

A short sketch of African housekeeping may not prove unin- 



40 HOUSEBUILDING AND HOUSEKEEPING. Chap. II. 

teresting to the reader. The entire absence of shops led us to 
make everything we needed from the raw materials. You want 
bricks to build a house, and must forthwith proceed to the field, 
cut down a tree, and saw it into planks to make the brick-moulds ; 
the materials for doors and windows, too, are standing in the forest ; 
and, if you want to be respected by the natives, a house of decent 
dimensions, costing an immense amount of manual labour, must 
be built. The people cannot assist you much ; for, though most 
willing to labour for wages, the Bakwains have a curious inability 
to make or put things square : like all Bechuanas, their dwellings 
are made round. In the case of three large houses, erected by 
myself at different times, every brick and stick had to be put 
square by my own right hand. 

Having got the meal ground, the wife proceeds to make it 
into bread ; an extempore oven is often constructed by scooping 
out a large hole in an anthill, and using a slab of stone for 
a door. Another plan, winch might be adopted by the Australians 
to produce something better than their " dampers," is to make a 
good fire on a level piece of ground, and, when the ground is 
thoroughly heated, place the dough in a small short-handled 
frying-pan, or simply on the hot ashes ; invert any sort of metal 
pot over it, draw the ashes around, and then make a small fire on 
the top. Dough mixed with a little leaven from a former baking, 
and allowed to stand an hour or two in the sun, will by this 
process become excellent bread. 

We made our own butter, a jar serving as a churn ; and our 
own candles by means of moulds ; and soap was procured from 
the ashes of the plant salsola, or from wood-ashes, winch in 
Africa contain so little alkaline matter that the boiling of succes- 
sive leys has to be continued for a month or six weeks before the 
fat is saponified. There is not much hardship hi being almost 
entirely dependent on ourselves ; there is something of the 
feeling: which must have animated Alexander Selkirk on seeing 
conveniences springing up before him from his own ingenuity ; 
and married life is all the sweeter when so many comforts 
emanate directly from the thrifty striving housewife's hands. 

To some it may appear quite a romantic mode of life ; it is one 
of active benevolence, such as the good may enjoy at home. 
Take a single day as a sample of the whole. We rose early, 



Chap. II. MODE OF SPENDING THE DAY. 41 

because, however hot the day may have been, the evening, night, 
and morning at Kolobeng were deliciously refreshing ; cool is not 
the word, where you have neither an increase of cold nor heat to 
desire, and where you can sit out till midnight with no fear of 
coughs or rheumatism. After family worship and breakfast 
between six and seven, we went to keep school for all who would 
attend; men, women, and children being all invited. School 
over at eleven o'clock, while the missionary's wife was occupied 
in domestic matters, the missionary himself had some manual 
labour, as a smith, carpenter, or gardener, according to whatever 
was needed for ourselves or for the people ; if for the latter, they 
worked for us in the garden, or at some other employment ; 
skilled labour was thus exchanged for the unskilled. After 
dinner and an hour's rest the wife attended her infant-school, 
which the young, who were left by their parents entirely to their 
own caprice, liked amazingly, and generally mustered a hundred 
strong ; or she varied that with a sewing school, having classes of 
girls to learn the art ; this, too, was equally well relished. During 
the day every operation must be superintended, and both husband 
and wife must labour till the sun declines. After sunset the 
husband went into the town to converse with any one willing to 
do so ; sometimes on general subjects, at other times on religion. 
On three nights of the week, as soon as the milking of the cows 
was over and it had become dark, we had a public religious 
service, and one of instruction on secular subjects, aided by 
pictures and specimens. These services were diversified by 
attending upon the sick and prescribing for them, giving food 
and otherwise assisting the poor and wretched. We tried to gain 
their affections by attending to the wants of the body. The 
smallest acts of friendship, an obliging word and civil look, are, as 
St. Xavier thought, no despicable part of the missionary armour. 
Nor ought the good opinion of the most abject to be uncared for, 
when politeness may secure it. Their good word in the aggre- 
gate forms a reputation which may be well employed in pro- 
curing favour for the Gospel. Show kind attention to the reckless 
opponents of Clrristianity on the bed of sickness and pain, and 
they never can become your personal enemies. Here, if any- 
where, love begets love. 

When at Kolobeng, during the droughts we were entirely 



42 LOCUSTS, FROGS, ETC., USED AS FOOD. Chap. II. 

dependent on Kuruman for supplies of corn. Once we were 
reduced to living on bran, to convert which into fine meal we had 
to grind it three times over. We were much in want of animal 
food, which seems to be a greater necessary of life there than 
vegetarians would imagine. Being alone, we could not divide the 
butcher-meat of a slaughtered animal with a prospect of getting 
a return with regularity. Sechele had by right of chieftainship 
the breast of every animal slaughtered either at home or abroad, 
and he most obligingly sent us a liberal share during the whole 
period of our sojourn. But these supplies were necessarily so 
irregular, that we were sometimes fain to accept a dish of locusts. 
These are quite a blessing in the country ; so much so, that the 
rain-doctors sometimes promised to bring them by their incanta- 
tions. The locusts are strongly vegetable in taste, the flavour 
varying with the plants on which they feed. There is a physiolo- 
gical reason why locusts and honey should be eaten together. 
Some are roasted and pounded into meal, which eaten with a 
little salt is palatable. It will keep thus for months. Boiled 
they are disagreeable ; but when they are roasted, I should much 
prefer locusts to shrimps, though I would avoid both if possible. 

In travelling we sometimes suffered considerably from scarcity 
of meat, though not from absolute want of food. This was felt 
more especially by my children ; and the natives, to show their 
sympathy, often gave them a large kind of caterpillar, which 
they seemed to relish ; these insects could not be unwholesome, 
for the natives devoured them in large quantities themselves. 

Another article of which our children partook with eagerness 
was a very large frog, called " Matlametlo." * 

These enormous frogs, which, when cooked, look like chickens, 
are supposed by the natives to fall down from thunder-clouds, 
because after a heavy thunder-shower the pools, which are filled 
and retain water a few days, become instantly alive with this 
loud-croaking pugnacious game. This phenomenon takes place 
in the driest parts of the desert, and in places where to an ordi- 
nary observer there is not a sign of life. Having been once 
benighted in a district of the Kalahari where there was no

Chap. II. THE ELAND — THE SCAVENGER BEETLE. 43 

prospect of getting water for our cattle for a day or two, I was 
surprised to hear in the fine still evening the croaking of frogs. 
Walking out until I was certain that the musicians were between 
me and our fire, I found that they could be merry on nothing 
else but a prospect of rain. From the Bushmen I afterwards 
learned that the matlametlo makes a hole at the root of certain 
bushes, and there ensconces himself during the months of drought. 
As he seldom emerges, a large variety of spider takes advantage 
of the hole, and makes its web across the orifice. He is thus 
furnished with a window and screen gratis ; and no one but a 
Bushman would think of searching beneath a spider's web for a 
frog. They completely eluded my search on the occasion re- 
ferred to ; and as they rush forth into the hollows filled by the 
thunder-shower when the rain is actually falling, and the 
Bechuanas are cowering under their skin garments, the sudden 
chorus struck up simultaneously from all sides seems to indicate a 
descent from the clouds. 

The presence of these matlametlo in the desert in a time of 
drought was rather a disappointment, for I had been accustomed 
to suppose that the note was always emitted by them when they 
were chin-deep in water. Their music was always regarded in 
other spots as the most pleasant sound that met the ear after 
crossing portions of the thirsty desert ; and I could fully appre- 
ciate the sympathy for these animals shown by iEsop, himself an 
African, in his fable of the ' Boys and the Frogs.' 

It is remarkable that attempts have not been made to any 
extent to domesticate some of the noble and useful creatures of 
Africa in England. The eland, which is the most magnificent of 
all antelopes, would grace the parks of our nobility more than 
deer. This animal, from the excellence of its flesh, would be 
appropriate to our own country ; and as there is also a splendid 
esculent frog nearly as large as a chicken, it would no doubt 
tend to perpetuate the present alliance, if we made a gift of that 
to France. 

The scavenger beetle is one of the most useful of all insects, as 
it effectually answers the object indicated by the name. Where 
they abound, as at Kuruman, the villages are sweet and clean, 
for no sooner are animal excretions dropped than, attracted by 
the scent, the scavengers are heard coming booming up the wind. 



44 HOSTILITY OF THE BOERS. Chap. II. 

They roll away the droppings of cattle at once, in round pieces 
often as large as billiard-balls; and when they reach a place 
proper by its softness for the deposit of their eggs, and the safety 
of their young, they dig the soil out from beneath the ball, till 
they have quite let it down and covered it : they then lay their 
eggs within the mass. While the larvae are growing, they devour 
the inside of the ball before coming above ground to begin the 
world for themselves. The beetles with their gigantic balls look 
like Atlas with the world on his back; only they go back- 
wards, and, with their heads down, push with the hind legs, as 
if a boy should roll a snow-ball with Ins legs, while standing 
on his head. As we recommend the eland to John Bull, and 
the gigantic frog to France, we can confidently recommend 
this beetle to the dirty Italian towns, and our own Sanitary 
Commissioners. 

In trying to benefit the tribes living under the Boers of the 
Cashan mountains, I twice performed a journey of about three 
hundred miles to the eastward of Kolobeng. Sechele had become 
so obnoxious to the Boers, that, though anxious to accompany me 
in my journey, he dared not trust himself among them. Tins 
did not arise from the crime of cattle-stealing ; for that crime, so 
common among the CarTres, was never charged againt Ins tribe, 
nor, indeed, against any Bechuana tribe. It is, in fact, unknown 
in the country, except during actual warfare. His independence 
and love of the English were his only faults. In my last journey 
there, of about two hundred miles, on parting at the river 
Marikwe he gave me two servants, " to be," as he said, " his 
arms to serve me," and expressed regret that he could not come 
himself. " Suppose we went north," I said, " would you come ?" 
He then told me the story of Sebituane having saved his life, and 
expatiated on the far-famed generosity of that really great man. 
This was the first time I had thought of crossing the Desert to 
Lake Ngami. 

The conduct of the Boers, who, as will be remembered, had 
sent a letter designed to procure my removal out of the country, 
and then well-known settled policy winch I have already de- 
scribed, became more fully developed on this than on any former 
occasion. When I spoke to Mr. Hendrick Potgeiter of the 
danger of hindering the Gospel of Christ among these poor 



Chap. II. SECHELE'S POSITION AS CHIEF. 45 

savages, lie became greatly excited, and called one of his followers 
to answer me. He threatened to attack any tribe that might 
receive a native teacher, yet he promised to use his influence to 
prevent those under him from throwing obstacles in our way. I 
could perceive plainly that nothing more could be done in that 
direction, so I commenced collecting all the information I could 
about the desert, with the intention of crossing it if possible. 
Sekomi, the chief of the Bamangwato, was acquainted with a 
route which he kept carefully to himself, because the Lake 
country abounded in ivory, and he drew large quantities thence 
periodically at but small cost to himself. 

Sechele, who valued highly everything European, and was 
always fully alive to his own interest, was naturally anxious to 
get a share of that inviting field. He was most anxious to visit 
Sebituane too, partly, perhaps, from a wish to show off Ins new 
acquirements, but chiefly, I believe, from having very exalted 
ideas of the benefits he would derive from the liberality of that 
renowned chieftain. In age and family Sechele is the elder and 
superior of Sekomi ; for when the original tribe broke up into 
Bamangwato, Bangwaketse, and Bakwains, the Bakwains retained 
the hereditary chieftainship ; so their chief, Sechele, possesses 
certain advantages over Sekomi, the chief of the Bamangwato. 
If the two were travelling or hunting together, Sechele would 
take, by right, the heads of the game shot by Sekomi. 

There are several vestiges besides of very ancient partitions 
and lordships of tribes. The elder brother of Sechele's father, 
becoming blind, gave over the cliieftainship to Sechele's father. 
The descendants of tins man pay no tribute to Sechele, though 
he is the actual ruler, and superior to the head of that family ; 
and Sechele, while in every other respect supreme, calls him 
Kosi or Chief. The other tribes will not begin to eat the early 
pumpkins of a new crop until they hear that the Bahurutse have 
" bitten it," and there is a public ceremony on the occasion — the 
son of the chief being the first to taste of the new harvest. 

Sechele, by my advice, sent men to Sekomi, asking leave for 
me to pass along his path, accompanying the request with the 
present of an ox. Sekomi's mother, who possesses great influence 
over him, refused permission, because she had not been propi- 
tiated. Tins produced a fresh message ; and the most honourable 



46 PREPARING TO CROSS THE DESERT. Chap. II. 

man in the Bakwain tribe, next to Sechele, was sent with an ox 
for both Sekomi and his mother. Tin's, too, was met by refusal. 
It was said, " The Matebele, the mortal enemies of the Becku- 
anas, are in the direction of the lake, and, should they kill 
the white man, we shall incur great blame from all his nation." 

The exact position of the Lake Ngami had, for half a century 
at least, been correctly pointed out by the natives, who had 
visited it when rains were more copious in the Desert than in 
more recent times, and many attempts had been made to reach 
it by passing through the Desert in the direction indicated ; but 
it was found impossible, even for Griquas, who, having some 
Bushman blood in them, may be supposed more capable of 
enduring thirst than Europeans. It was clear, then, that our 
only chance of success was by going round, instead of through, 
the Desert. The best time for the attempt would have been 
about the end of the rainy season, in March or April, for then 
we should have been likely to meet with pools of rain-water, 
which always dry up during the rainless winter. I communicated 
my intention to an African traveller, Colonel Steele, then aide- 
de-camp to the Marquis of Tweedale, at Madras, and he made it 
known to two other gentlemen, whose friendship we had gained 
during their African travel, namely, Major Vardon and Mr. 
Oswell. All of these gentlemen were so enamoured with African 
hunting and African discovery, that the two former must have 
envied the latter his good fortune in being able to leave India to 
undertake afresh the pleasures and pains of desert life. I believe 
Mr. Oswell came from his high position, at a very considerable 
pecuniary sacrifice, and with no other end in view but to extend 
the boundaries of geographical knowledge. Before I knew of his 
coming I had arranged that the payment for the guides furnished 
by Sechele should be the loan of my waggon, to bring back what- 
ever ivory he might obtain from the chief at the lake. When 
at last Mr. Oswell came, bringing Mr. Murray with him, he 
undertook to defray the entire expenses of the guides, and fully 
executed his generous intention. 

Sechele himself would have come with us, but, fearing that 
the much-talked-of assault of the Boers might take place dur- 
ing our absence, and blame be attached to me for taking him 
away, I dissuaded him against it by saying that he knew 



Chap. IT. THE KALAHARI DESERT. 47 

Mr. Oswell " would be as determined as himself to get through 
the Desert." 

Before narrating the incidents of this journey, I may give 
some account of the great Kalahari Desert, in order that the 
reader may understand in some degree the nature of the diffi- 
culties we had to encounter. 

The space from the Orange River in the. south, lat. 29°, to 
Lake Ngami in the north, and from about 24° east long, to near 
the west coast, has been called a desert simply because it con- 
tains no running water, and very little water in wells. It is by 
no means destitute of vegetation and inhabitants, for it is covered 
with grass and a great variety of creeping plants ; besides which 
there are large patches of bushes and even trees. It is remark- 
ably flat, but intersected in different parts by the beds of ancient 
rivers ; and prodigious herds of certain antelopes, which require 
little or no water, roam over the trackless plains. The inha- 
bitants, Bushmen and Bakalahari, prey on the game and on the 
countless rodentia and smaU species of the feline race which sub- 
sist on these. In general the soil is light-coloured soft sand, 
nearly pure silica. The beds of the ancient rivers contain much 
alluvial soil ; and as that is baked hard by the burning sun, rain- 
water stands in pools in some of them for several months in the 
year. 

The quantity of grass which grows on this remarkable region 
is astonishing, even to those who are familiar with India. It 
usually rises in tufts with bare spaces between, or the intervals 
are occupied by creeping plants, which, having their roots buried 
far beneath the soil, feel little the effects of the scorching sun. 
The number of these which have tuberous roots is very great ; 
and their structure is intended to supply nutriment and moisture 
when during the long droughts they can be obtained nowhere 
else. Here we have an example of a plant, not generally tuber- 
bearing, becoming so under circumstances where that appendage 
is necessary to act as a reservoir for preserving its life ; and the 
same thing occurs in Angola to a species of grape-bearing vine, 
which is so furnished for the same purpose. The plant to which 
I at present refer is one of the cucurbitaceae which bears a 
small scarlet-coloured eatable cucumber. Another plant, named 
Leroshua, is a blessing to the inhabitants of the Desert. We 



48 THE WATER-MELON. Chap. II. 

see a small plant with linear leaves, and a stalk not thicker than 
a crow's quill ; on digging down a foot or eighteen inches beneath, 
we come to a tuber, often as large as the head of a young child ; 
when the rind is removed, we find it to be a mass of cellular 
tissue, filled with fluid much like that in a young turnip. Owing 
to the depth beneath the soil at which it is found, it is generally 
cleliciously cool and refreshing. Another kind, named Mokuri, 
is seen in other parts of the country, where long-continued heat 
parches the soil. This plant is a herbaceous creeper, and deposits 
underground a number of tubers, some as large as a man's head, 
at spots in a circle a yard or more, horizontally, from the stem. 
The natives strike the ground on the circumference of the circle 
with stones, till, by hearing a difference of sound they know the 
water-bearing tuber to be beneath. They then dig down a foot 
or so, and find it. 

But the most surprising plant of the Desert is the " Kengwe or 
Kerne " (Cueumis caffer), the water-melon. In years when more 
than the usual quantity of rain falls, vast tracts of the country are 
literally covered with these melons ; tliis was the case annually 
when the fall of rain was greater than it is now, and the Bakwains 
sent trading parties every year to the lake. It happens commonly 
once every ten or eleven years, and for the last three times its 
occurrence has coincided with an extraordinarily wet season. Then 
animals of every sort and name, including man, rejoice in the 
rich supply. The elephant, true lord of the forest, revels in this 
fruit, and so do the different species of rhinoceros, although natu- 
rally so diverse in their choice of pasture. The various kinds of 
antelopes feed on them with equal avidity, and lions, hyaenas, 
jackals, and mice, all seem to know and appreciate the common 
blessing. These melons are not, however, all of them eatable ; 
some are sweet, and others so bitter that the whole are named by 
the Boers the " bitter water-melon." The natives select them by 
striking one melon after another with a hatchet, and applying the 
tongue to the gashes. They thus readily distinguish between the 
bitter and sweet. The bitter are deleterious, but the sweet are 
quite wholesome. Tins peculiarity of one species of plants bearing 
both sweet and bitter fruits occurs also in a red eatable cucumber 
often met with in the country. It is about four inches long, and 
about an inch and a half in diameter. It is of a bright scarlet 



Chap. II. BUSHMEN— BAKALAHARI. 49 

colour when ripe. Many are bitter, others quite sweet. Even 
melons in a garden may be made bitter by a few bitter kengwe 
in the vicinity. The bees convey the pollen from one to the 
other. 

The human inhabitants of tins tract of country consist of Bush- 
men and Bakalahari. The former are probably the aborigines 
of the southern portion of the continent, the latter the remnants 
of the first emigration of Bechuanas. The Bushmen live in the 
Desert from choice, the Bakalahari from compulsion, and both 
possess an intense love of liberty. The Bushmen are exceptions 
in language, race, habits, and appearance. They are the only 
real nomades in the country ; they never cultivate the soil nor 
rear any domestic animal, save wretched dogs. They are so 
intimately acquainted with the habits of the game, that they 
follow them in their migrations, and prey upon them from place 
to place, and thus prove as complete a check upon their inor- 
dinate increase as the other carnivora. The chief subsistence of 
the Bushmen is the flesh of game, but that is eked out by what 
the women collect of roots and beans, and fruits of the Desert. 
Those who inhabit the hot sandy plains of the Desert possess 
generally thin wiry forms capable of great exertion and of severe 
privations. Many are of low stature, though not dwarfish ; the 
specimens brought to Europe have been selected, like coster- 
mongers' dogs, on account of their extreme ugliness ; conse- 
quently English ideas of the whole tribe are formed in the same 
way as if the ugliest specimens of the English were exhibited in 
Africa as characteristic of the entire British nation. That they 
are like baboons is in some degree true, just as these and other 
simiae are in some points frightfully human. 

The Bakalahari are traditionally reported to be the oldest of 
the Bechuana tribes, and they are said to have possessed enor- 
mous herds of the large horned cattle mentioned by Bruce, until 
they were despoiled of them and driven into the Desert by a fresh 
migration of their own nation. Living ever since on the same 
plains with the Bushmen, subjected to the same influences of 
climate, enduring the same thirst, and subsisting on similar food 
for centuries, they seem to supply a standing proof that locality 
is not always sufficient of itself to account for difference in races. 
The Bakalahari retain in undying vigour the Bechuana love for 

E 



50 THE BAKALAHARI. Chap. II. 

agriculture and domestic animals. They hoe their gardens annu- 
ally, though often all they can hope for is a supply of melons and 
pumpkins. And they carefully rear small herds of goats,' though 
I have seen them Lift water for them out of small wells with a bit 
of ostrich egg-shell, or by spoonfuls. They generally attach 
themselves to influential men in the different Bechuana tribes 
living adjacent to their desert home, in order to obtain supplies 
of spears, knives, tobacco, and dogs, in exchange for the skins of 
the animals they may kill. These are small carmvora of the 
feline species ; including two species of jackal, the dark and the 
golden ; the former, " motlose " (Megalotis capensis or Cape 
fennec), has the warmest fur the country yields ; the latter, 
" pukut/e" (Cams mesomelas and C. aureus), is very handsome 
when made into the skin mantle called kaross. Next in value 
follow the " tsipa " or small ocelot (Felis nigripes), the " tuane " 
or lynx, the wild cat, the spotted cat, and other small animals. 
Great numbers of puti (duiker) and puruhuru (steinbucJc) 
skins are got, too, besides those of lions, leopards, panthers, and 
hyosnas. During the time I was in the Bechuana country between 
twenty and thirty thousand skins were made up into karosses ; 
part of them were worn by the inhabitants, and part sold to 
traders : many, I believe, find their way to China. The Bak- 
wains bought tobacco from the eastern tribes, then purchased 
skins with it from the Bakalahari, tanned them, and sewed them 
into karosses, then went south to purchase heifer-calves with them, 
cows being the highest form of riches known, as I have often 
noticed from their asking " if Queen Victoria had many cows." 
The compact they enter into is mutually beneficial, but injustice 
and wrong are often perpetrated by one tribe of Bechuanas going 
among the Bakalahari of another tribe, and compelling them to 
deliver up the skins which, they may be keeping for their friends. 
They are a timid race, and in bodily development often resemble 
the aborigines of Australia. They have thin legs and arms, and 
large protruding abdomens caused by the coarse indigestible food 
they eat. Their children's eyes lack lustre. I never saw them 
at play. A few Bechuanas may go into a village of Bakalahari, 
and domineer over the whole with impunity ; but when these 
same adventurers meet the Bushmen, they are fain to change 
their manners to fawning sycophancy ; they know that, if the 




to 

O

a 



Chap. II. FEMALE WATER-SUCKERS. 51 

request for tobacco is refused, these free sons of the Desert may 
settle the point as to its possession by a poisoned arrow. 

The dread of visits from Bechuanas of strange tribes causes the 
Bakalahari to choose their residences far from water ; and they 
not unfrequently hide their supplies by filling the pits with sand 
and making a fire over the spot. When they wish to draw water 
for use, the women come with twenty or thirty of their water- 
vessels in a bag or net on their backs. These water- vessels consist 
of ostrich egg-shells, with a hole in the end of each, such as would 
admit one's finger. The women tie a bunch of grass to one end 
of a reed about two feet long, and insert it in a hole dug as deep 
as the arm will reach ; then ram down the wet sand firmly round 
it. Applying the mouth to the free end of the reed, they form a 
vacuum in the grass beneath, in which the water collects, and in 
a short time rises into the mouth. An egg-shell is placed on the 
ground alongside the reed, some inches below the mouth of the 
sucker. A straw guides the water into the hole of the vessel, as 
she draws mouthful after mouthful from below. The water is 
made to pass along the outside, not through the straw. If any 
one will attempt to squirt water into a bottle placed some distance 
below his mouth, he will soon perceive the wisdom of the Bush- 
woman's contrivance for giving the stream direction by means of 
a straw. The whole stock of water is thus passed through the 
woman's mouth as a pump, and when taken home is carefully 
buried. I have come into villages where, had we acted a domi- 
neering part, and rummaged every hut, we should have found 
nothing ; but by sitting down quietly and waiting with patience 
until the villagers were led to form a favourable opinion of us, 
a woman would bring out a shellful of the precious fluid from 
I know not where. 

The so-called Desert, it may be observed, is by no means a 
useless tract of country. Besides supporting multitudes of both 
small and large animals, it sends something to the market of the 
world, and has proved a refuge to many a fugitive tribe — to the 
Bakalahari first, and to the other Bechuanas in turn — as then- 
lands were overrun by the tribe of true Caffres, called Matebele. 
The Bakwains, the Bangwaketze, and the Bamangwato all fled 
thither ; and the Matebele marauders, who came from the well- 
watered east, perished by hundreds in their attempts to follow them. 

e 2 



52 WATER HIDDEN. Chap. II. 

One of the Bangwaketze chiefs, more wily than the rest, sent false 
guides to lead them on a track where, for hundreds of miles, not 
a drop of water could be found, and they perished in consequence. 
Many Bakwains perished too. Then old men who could have 
told us ancient stories perished in these nights. An intelligent 
Mokwain related to me how the Bushmen effectually baulked a 
party of his tribe winch lighted on their village in a state of 
burning thirst. Believing, as he said, that nothing human could 
subsist without water, they demanded some, but were coolly told 
by these Bushmen that they had none, and never drank any. 
Expecting to find them out, they resolved to watch them night 
and day. They persevered for some days, thinking that at last 
the water must come forth ; but notwithstanding their watchful- 
ness, kept alive by most tormenting thirst, the Bakwains were 
compelled to exclaim, " Yak ! yak ! these are not men ; let us 
go." Probably the Bushmen had been subsisting on a store 
hidden under ground, which had eluded the vigilance of their 
visitors.

Such was the Desert which we were now preparing to cross, — a 
region formerly of terror to the Bechuanas from the numbers of 
serpents which infested it and fed on the different kinds of mice, 
and from the intense thirst which these people often endured 
when then water-vessels were insufficient for the distances to be 
travelled over before reaching the wells. 

Just before the arrival of my companions, a party of the people 
of the lake came to Kolobeng, stating that they were sent by 
Lechulatebe, the chief, to ask me to visit that country. They 
brought such flaming accounts of the quantities of ivory to be 
found there (cattle-pens made of elephants' tusks of enormous 
size, &c), that the guides of the Bakwains were quite as eager to 
succeed in reaching the lake as any one of us could desire. This 
was fortunate, as we knew the way the strangers had come was 
impassable for waggons. 

Messrs. Oswell and Murray came at the end of May, and we 
all made a fair start for the unknown region on the 1st of June, 
1849. Proceeding northwards, and passing through a range of 
tree-covered hills to Shokuane, formerly the residence of the 
Bakwains, we soon after entered on the high road to the Bamang- 
wato, which lies generally in the bed of an ancient river or wady 
that must formerly have flowed N. to S. The adjacent country 



54 SEROTLI. Chap. III. 

is perfectly flat, but covered with open forest and bush, with 
abundance of grass; the trees generally are a kind of acacia 
called " Monato," winch appears a little to the south of this region, 
and is common as far as Angola. A large caterpillar, called 
" Nato," feeds by night on the leaves of these trees, and comes 
down by day to bury itself at the root in the sand, in order to 
escape the piercing rays of the sun. The people dig for it there, 
and are fond of it when roasted, on account of its pleasant vege- 
table taste. When about to pass into the chrysalis state it buries 
itself in the soil, and is sometimes sought for as food even then. 
If left undisturbed, it comes forth as a beautiful butterfly : the 
transmutation was sometimes employed by me with good effect, 
when speaking with the natives, as an illustration of our own 
great change and resurrection. 

The soil is sandy, and there are here and there indications 
that at spots which now afford no water whatever there were 
formerly wells and cattle stations. 

Boatlanama, our next station, is a lovely spot in the otherwise 
dry region. The wells from which we had to lift out the water 
for our cattle are deep, but they were well filled. A few villages 
of Bakalahari were found near them, and great numbers of 
pallahs, springbucks, guinea-fowl, and small monkeys. 

Lopepe came next. This place afforded another proof of the 
desiccation of the country. The first time I passed it, Lopepe 
was a large pool with a stream flowing out of it to the south ; 
now it was with difficulty we could get our cattle watered, by 
digging down in the bottom of a welL 

At Mashiie — where we found a never-failing supply of pure 
water in a sandstone rocky hollow — we left the road to the 
Bamangwato hills, and struck away to the north into the Desert. 
Having watered the cattle at a well called Lobotani, about N.W. 
of Bamangwato, we next proceeded to a real Kalahari fountain, 
called Serotli. The country around is covered with bushes and 
trees of a kind of leguminosce, with lilac flowers. The soil is 
soft white sand, very trying to the strength of the oxen, as the 
wheels sink into it over the felloes and drag heavily. At Serotli 
we found only a few hollows like those made by the buffalo and 
rhinoceros when they roll themselves in the mud. In a corner 
of one of these there appeared water, which would have been 



Chap. III. MODE OF DIGGING WELLS. 55 

quickly lapped up by our dogs, had we not driven them away. 
And yet tins was all the apparent supply for some eighty oxen, 
twenty horses, and about a score of men. Our guide, Kamotobi, 
who had spent his youth in the Desert, declared that, though 
appearances were against us, there was plenty of water at hand. 
We had our misgivings, for the spades were soon produced ; but 
our guides, despising such new-fangled aid, began in good earnest 
to scrape out the sand with their hands. The only water we had 
any promise of for the next seventy miles — that is, for a journey 
of three days with the waggons — was to be got here. By the 
aid of both spades and fingers two of the holes were cleared out, 
so as to form pits six feet deep and about as many broad. Our 
guides were especially earnest in their injunctions to us not to 
break through the hard stratum of sand at the bottom, because 
they knew, if it were broken through, "the water would go 
away." They are quite correct, for the water seems to lie on tins 
flooring of incipient sandstone. The value of the advice was 
proved in the case of an Englishman whose wits were none of 
the brightest, who, disregarding it, dug through the sandy stratum 
in the wells at Mohotluani : — the water immediately flowed away 
downwards, and the well became useless. When we came to the 
stratum, we found that the water flowed in on all sides close to 
the line where the soft sand came into contact with it. Allowing; 
it to collect, we had enough for the horses that evening ; but as 
there was not sufficient for the oxen, we sent them back to 
Lobotani, where, after tliirsting four full days (ninety-six hours), 
they got a good supply. The horses were kept by us as neces- 
sary to procure game for the sustenance of our numerous party. 
Next morning we found the water had flowed in faster than at 
first, as it invariably does in these reservoirs, owing to the pas- 
sages widening by the flow. Large quantities of the sand come 
into the well with the water, and in the course of a few days the 
supply, which may be equal to the wants of a few men only, 
becomes sufficient for oxen as well. In these sucking-places the 
Bakalahari get their supplies ; and as they are generally in the 
hollows of ancient river-beds, they are probably the deposits from 
rains gravitating tlnther ; in some cases they may be the actual 
fountains, winch, though formerly supplying the river's flow, now 
no longer rise to the surface. 



50 ANIMALS OF THE DESERT. Chap. III. 

Here, though the water was perfectly inaccessible to elands, 
large numbers of these fine animals fed around us ; and, when 
killed, they were not only in good condition, but their stomachs 
actually contained considerable quantities of water. 

I examined carefully the whole alimentary canal in order to 
see if there were any peculiarity winch might account for the fact 
that tins animal can subsist for months together without drinking, 
but found nothing. Other animals, such as the duiker ( Cephalopus 
mergens) or puti (of the Bechuanas), the steinbuck {Tragulus 
rupestris) or puruhuru, the gemsbuck ( Oryx capensis) or kukama, 
and the porcupine (Hystrix cristata), are all able to subsist without 
water for many months at a time by living on bulbs and tubers 
containing moisture. They have sharp-pointed hoofs well adapted 
for digging, and there is little difficulty in comprehending their 
mode of subsistence. Some animals, on the other hand, are 
never seen but in the vicinity of water. The presence of the 
rhinoceros, of the buffalo and gnu (Catoblepas gnu), of the giraffe, 
the zebra, and pallah {Antilope melampus), is always a certain 
indication of water being within a distance of seven or eight 
miles ; but one may see hundreds of elands (Boselaphiis oreas), 
gemsbuck, the tolo or koodoo (Strepsiceros capensis), also spring- 
bucks (G-azella euchore) and ostriches, without being warranted 
thereby in inferring the presence of water within thirty or forty 
miles. Indeed, the sleek fat condition of the eland in such 
circumstances would not remove the apprehension of perishing 
by thirst from the mind of even a native. I believe, however, 
that these animals can subsist only when there is some moisture 
in the vegetation on which they feed ; for in one year of unusual 
drought we saw herds of elands and flocks of ostriches crowding 
to the Zouga from the Desert, and very many of the latter were 
killed in pitfalls on the banks. As long as there is any sap in 
the pasturage they seldom need water. But should a traveller 
see the " spoor " of a rhinoceros or buffalo or zebra, he would at 
once follow it up, well assured that before he had gone many 
miles he would certainly reach water. 

In the evening of our second day at Serotli, a hyaena, appear- 
ing suddenly among the grass, succeeded in raising a panic 
among our cattle. This false mode of attack is the plan which 
this cowardly animal always adopts. His courage resembles

closely that of a turkey-cock. He will bite, if an animal is 
running away ; but if the animal stand still, so does he. Seven- 
teen of our draught oxen ran away, and in their flight went right 
into the hands of Sekomi, whom, from his being unfriendly to 
our success, we had no particular wish to see. Cattle-stealing, 
such as in the circumstances might have occurred in Caffraria, is 
here unknown ; so Sekomi sent back our oxen, and a message 
strongly dissuading us against attempting the Desert. " Where 
are you going ? You will be killed by the sun and thirst, and 
then all the white men will blame me for not saving you." This 
was backed by a private message from his mother. " Why do 
you pass me ? I always made the people collect to hear the word 
that you have got. What guilt have I, that you pass without 
looking at me ? " We replied by assuring the messengers that 
the white men would attribute our deaths to our own stupidity 
and " hard-headedness " (tlogo, e thata), " as we did not intend 
to allow our companions and guides to return till they had put 
us into our graves." We sent a handsome present to Sekomi, 
and a promise that, if he allowed the Bakalahari to keep the 
wells open for us, we would repeat the gift on our return. 

After exhausting all his eloquence in fruitless attempts to per- 
suade us to return, the under-chief, who headed the party of 
Sekomi's messengers, inquired " Who is taking them ? " Looking 
round, he exclaimed, with a face expressive of the most un- 
feigned disgust, " It is Hamotobi ! " Our guide belonged to 
Sekomi's tribe, but had fled to Sechele ; as fugitives in this 
country are always well received, and may even afterwards visit 
the tribe from winch they have escaped, Ramotobi was in no 
danger, though doing that which he knew to be directly opposed 
to the interests of his own chief and tribe. 

All around Serotli the country is perfectly flat, and composed 
of soft white sand. There is a peculiar glare of bright sunlight 
from a cloudless sky over the whole scene ; and one clump of 
trees and bushes, with open spaces between, looks so exactly like 
another, that if you leave the wells, and walk a quarter of a mile 
in any direction, it is difficult to return. Oswell and Murray 
went out on one occasion to get an eland, and were accompanied 
by one of the Bakalahari. The perfect sameness of the country 
caused even this son of the Desert to lose his way; a most 



58 CROSS PURPOSES. Chap. III. 

puzzling conversation forthwith ensued between them and their 
guide. One of the most common phrases of the people is " Kia 
itumela," I thank you, or I am pleased ; and the gentlemen were 
both quite familiar with it, and with the word " metse," water. 
But there is a word very similar in sound, " Kia timela," I am 
wandering ; its perfect is " Ki timetse," I have wandered. The 
party had been roaming about, perfectly lost, till the sun went 
down ; and, through their mistaking the verb " wander," for " to 
be pleased," and "water," the colloquy went on at intervals 
during the whole bitterly cold night in somewhat the following 
style : — 

" Where are the waggons ? " 

Real ansiver. — " I don't know. I have wandered. I never 
wandered before. I am quite lost." 

Supposed answer. — " I don't know. I want water. I am glad, 
I am quite pleased. I am thankful to you." 

" Take us to the waggons, and you will get plenty of water." 

Ileal ansiver (looking vacantly around). — " How did I wander ? 
Perhaps the well is there, perhaps not. I don't know. I have 
wandered." 

Supposed answer. — " Something about thanks ; he says he is 
pleased, and mentions water again." The guide's vacant stare, 
while trying to remember, is thought to indicate mental imbe- 
cility, and the repeated thanks were supposed to indicate a wish 
to deprecate their wrath. 

" Well, Livingstone has played us a pretty trick, giving us in 
charge of an idiot. Catch us trusting him again. What can 
this fellow mean by Ins thanks and talk about water ? 0, you 
born fool ! take us to the waggons, and you will get both meat 
and water. Wouldn't a thrashing bring him to Ins senses again ?" 
" No, no, for then he will run away, and we shall be worse off 
than we are now." 

The hunters regained the waggons next day by their own 
sagacity, which becomes wonderfully quickened by a sojourn in 
the Desert ; and we enjoyed a hearty laugh on the explanation of 
their midnight colloquies. Frequent mistakes of this kind occur. 
A man may tell his interpreter to say that he is a member of the 
family of the chief of the wlnte men ; " Yes, you speak like a chief" 
is the reply ; meaning, as they explain it, that a chief may talk 



Chap. III. SLOW PROGRESS. 59 

nonsense without any one daring to contradict him. They probably 
have ascertained, from that same interpreter, that tins relative of 
the white chief is very poor, having scarcely any tiring in his waggon. 

I sometimes felt annoyed at the low estimation in which some 
of my hunting friends were held ; for, believing that the chace is 
eminently conducive to the formation of a brave and noble cha- 
racter, and that the contest with wild beasts is well adapted for 
fostering that coolness in emergencies, and active presence of 
mind, which we all admire, I was naturally anxious that a higher 
estimate of my countrymen should be formed in the native mind. 
"Have these hunters, who come so far and work so hard, no 
meat at home ? " — " Why, these men are rich, and could slaughter 
oxen every day of their lives." — " And yet they come here, and 
endure so much thirst for the sake of this dry meat, none of 
which is equal to beef?" — "Yes, it is for the sake of play be- 
sides " (the idea of sport not being in the language). This pro- 
duces a laugh, as much as to say, " Ah, you know better ;" or, 
" Your friends are fools." When they can get a man to kill large 
quantities of game for them, whatever he may think of himself 
or of his achievements, they pride themselves in having adroitly 
turned to good account the folly of an itinerant butcher. 

The water having at last flowed into the wells we had dug, 
in sufficient quantity to allow a good drink to all our cattle, we 
departed from Serotli in the afternoon ; but as the sun even in 
winter, which it now was, is always very powerful by day, the 
waggons were dragged but slowly through the deep heavy sand, 
and we advanced only six miles before sunset. We could only 
travel in the mornings and evenings, as a single day in the hot 
sun and heavy sand would have knocked up the oxen. Next day 
we passed Pepacheu (white tufa), a hollow lined with tufa, in 
winch water sometimes stands, but it was now dry ; and at night 
our trocheamer * showed that we had made but twenty-five miles 
from Serotli. 

Ramotobi was angry at the slowness of our progress, and told 
us that, as the next water was three days in front, if we travelled 

* This is an instrument which, when fastened on the waggon-wheel, re- 
cords the number of revolutions made. By multiplying this number by the 
circumference of the wheel the actual distance travelled over is at once 
ascertained. 



GO WANT OF WATER. Chap. III. 

so slowly we should never get there at all. The utmost endea- 
vours of the servants, cracking their whips, screaming and beating, 
got only nineteen miles out of the poor beasts. We had thus 
proceeded forty-four miles from Serotli ; and the oxen were more 
exhausted by the soft nature of the country, and the thirst, 
than if they had travelled double the distance over a hard road 
containing supplies of water : we had, as far as we could judge, 
still thirty miles more of the same dry work before us. At this 
season the grass becomes so dry as to crumble to powder in the 
hands ; so the poor beasts stood wearily chewing, without taking 
a single fresh mouthful, and lowing painfully at the smell of 
water in our vessels in the waggons. We were all determined to 
succeed ; so we endeavoured to save the horses by sending them 
forward with the guide, as a means of making a desperate effort 
in case the oxen should fail. Murray went forward with them, 
while Oswell and I remained to bring the waggons on their trail 
as far as the cattle could drag them, intending then to send the 
oxen forward too. 

The horses walked quickly away from us ; but on the morning 
of the third day, when we imagined the steeds must be near the 
water, we discovered them just alongside the waggons. The guide, 
having come across the fresh footprints of some Bushmen who had 
gone in an opposite direction to that which we wished to go, 
turned aside to follow them. An antelope had been ensnared in 
one of the Bushmen's pitfalls. Murray followed Eamotobi most 
trustingly along the Bushmen's spoor, though that led them away 
from the water we were in search of; witnessed the operation of 
slaughtering, skinning, and cutting up the antelope ; and then, 
after a hard day's toil, found himself close upon the waggons ! 
The knowledge still retained by Eamotobi of the trackless waste 
of scrub, through winch we were now passing, seemed admirable. 
For sixty or seventy miles beyond Serotli, one clump of bushes 
and trees seemed exactly like another ; but, as we walked together 
this morning, he remarked, " When we come to that hollow we 
shall light upon the highway of Sekomi ; and beyond that again 
lies the river Mokoko ;" winch, though we passed along it, I could 
not perceive to be a river-bed at all. 

After breakfast some of the men, who had gone forward on a 
little path with some footprints of water-loving animals upon it, 



Chap. III. CAPTUEE OF A BUSIIWOMAN. 61 

returned with the joyful tidings of " metse" water, exhibiting the 
mud on their knees in confirmation of the news being true. It 
does one's heart good to see the thirsty oxen rush into a pool of 
delicious rain-water, as tins was. In they dash until the water is 
deep enough to be nearly level with their throat, and then they 
stand drawing slowly in the long refreshing mouthfuls, until their 
formerly collapsed sides distend as if they would burst. So much 
do they imbibe, that a sudden jerk, when they come out on the 
bank, makes some of the water run out again from then mouths ; 
but as they have been days without food too, they very soon 
commence to graze, and of grass there is always abundance every- 
where. This pool was called Mathuluani ; and thankful we were 
to have obtained so welcome a supply of water. 

After giving the cattle a rest at this spot, we proceeded down 
the dry bed of the river Mokoko. The name refers to the water- 
bearing stratum before alluded to ; and in this ancient bed it bears 
enough of water to admit of permanent wells in several parts of it. 
We had now the assurance from Ramotobi that we should suffer 
no more from thirst. Twice we found rain-water in the Mokoko 
before we reached Mokokonyani, where the water, generally below 
ground elsewhere, comes to the surface in a bed of tufa. The 
adjacent country is all covered with low thorny scrub, with grass, 
and here and there clumps of the " wait-a-bit thorn," or Acacia 
detinens. At Lotlakani (a little reed), another sjxring three miles 
further down, we met with the first Palmyra trees which we had 
seen in South Africa ; they were twenty-six in number. 

The ancient Mokoko must have been joined by other rivers 
below tins, for it becomes very broad, and spreads out into a large 
lake, of which the lake we were now in search of formed but a 
very small part. We observed that, wherever an ant-eater had 
made his hole, shells were tin-own out with the earth, identical 
with those now alive in the lake. 

When we left the Mokoko, Ramotobi seemed, for the first time, 
to be at a loss as to which direction to take. He had passed only 
once away to the west of the Mokoko, the scenes of his boyhood. 
Mr. Oswell, while riding in front of the waggons, happened to spy 
a Bushwoman running away in a bent position, in order to escape 
observation. Thinking it to be a Hon, he galloped up to her. 
She thought herself captured, and began to deliver up her poor 



62 SALT-PAN — MIRAGE. Chap. III. 

little property, consisting of a few traps made of cords ; but, when 
I explained that we only wanted water, and would pay her if she 
led us to it, she consented to conduct us to a spring. It was then 
late in the afternoon, but she walked briskly before our horses for 
eight miles, and showed us the water of Nchokotsa. After lead- 
ing us to the water, she wished to go away home, if indeed she 
had any — she had fled from a party of her countrymen, and was 
now living far from all others with her husband — but as it was 
now dark, we wished her to remain. As she believed herself still 
a captive, we thought she might slip away by night, so, in order 
that she should not go away with the impression that we were 
dishonest, we gave her a piece of meat and a good large bunch 
of beads ; at the sight of the latter she burst into a merry laugh, 
and remained without suspicion. 

At Nchokotsa we came upon the first of a great number of salt- 
pans, covered with an efflorescence of lime, probably the nitrate. 
A thick belt of mopane-trees (a Bauliinia) hides this salt-pan, 
which is twenty miles in circumference, entirely from the view 
of a person coming from the south-east ; and, at the time the pan 
burst upon our view, the setting sun was casting a beautiful blue 
haze over the white incrustations, making the whole look exactly 
like a lake. Oswell threw his hat up in the air at the sight, and 
shouted out a huzza which made the poor Bushwoman and the 
Bakwains think him mad. I was a little behind him, and was as 
completely deceived by it as he ; but as we had agreed to allow 
each other to behold the lake at the same instant, I felt a little 
chagrined that he had, unintentionally, got the first glance. We 
had no idea that the long-looked-for lake was still more than three 
hundred miles distant. One reason of our mistake was, that the 
river Zouga was often spoken of by the same name as the lake, 
viz. Noka ea Batletli (" river of the Batletli "). 

The mirage on these salinas was marvellous. It is never, I 
believe, seen in perfection, except over such saline incrustations. 
Here not a particle of imagination was necessary for realizing the 
exact picture of large collections of water ; the waves danced along 
above, and the shadows of the trees were vividly reflected beneath 
the surface in such an admirable manner, that the loose cattle, 
whose thirst had not been slaked sufficiently by the very brackish 
water of Nchokotsa, with the horses, dogs, and even the Hotten- 



Chap. III. THE ZOUGA. 63 

tots, ran off towards the deceitful pools. A herd of zebras in the 
mirage looked so exactly like elephants, that Oswell began to 
saddle a horse in order to hunt them ; but a sort of break in the 
haze dispelled the illusion. Looking to the west and north-west 
from Nchokotsa, we could see columns of black smoke, exactly 
like those from a steam-engine, rising to the clouds, and were 
assured that these arose from the burning reeds of the Noka ea 
Batletli. 

On the 4th of July we went forward on horseback towards what 
we supposed to be the lake, and again and again did we seem to 
see it ; but at last we came to the veritable water of the Zouga, 
and found it to be a river running to the N.E. A village of 
Bakurutse lay on the opposite bank ; these live among Batletli, 
a tribe having a click in then language, and who were found by 
Sebituane to possess large herds of the great horned cattle. They 
seem allied to the Hottentot family. Mr. Oswell, in trying to 
cross the river, got his horse bogged in the swampy bank. Two 
Bakwains and I managed to get over by wading beside a fishing- 
weir. The people were friendly, and informed us that this water 
came out of the Ngami. This news gladdened all our hearts, for 
we now felt certain of reaching our goal. We might, they said, 
be a moon on the way ; but we had the river Zouga at our feet, 
and by following it we should at last reach the broad water. 

Next day, when we were quite disposed to be friendly with 
every one, two of the Bamangwato, who had been sent on before 
us by Sekomi to drive away all the Bushmen and Bakalahari from 
our path, so that they should not assist or guide us, came and sat 
down by our fire. We had seen their footsteps fresh in the way, 
and they had watched our slow movements forward, and wondered 
to see how we, without any Bushmen, found our way to the waters. 
This was the first time they had seen Bamotobi. " You have 
reached the river now," said they ; and we, quite disposed to 
laugh at having won the game, felt no ill-will to any one. They 
seemed to feel no enmity to us either ; but after an apparently 
friendly conversation proceeded to fulfil to the last the instructions 
of their chief. Ascending the Zouga in our front, they circulated 
the report that our object was to plunder all the tribes living on 
the river and lake ; but when they had got half way up the river, 
the principal man sickened of fever, turned back some distance, 



64 THE QUAKERS OF AFRICA. Chap. III. 

and died. His death had a good effect, for the villagers connected 
it with the injury he was attempting to do to us. They all saw 
through Sekomi's reasons for wishing us to fail in our attempt ; 
and though they came to us at first armed, kind and fair treat- 
ment soon produced perfect confidence. 

When we had gone up the hank of this beautiful river about 
ninety-six miles from the point where we first struck it, and 
understood that we were still a considerable distance from the 
Ngami, we left all the oxen and waggons, except Mr. Oswell's, 
winch was the smallest, and one team, at Ngabisane, in the 
hope that they would be recruited for the home journey, while 
we made a push for the lake. The Bechuana chief of the Lake 
region, who had sent men to Sechele, now sent orders to all 
the people on the river to assist us, and we were received by 
the Bakoba, whose language clearly shows that they bear an 
affinity to the tribes in the north. They call themselves Bayeiye, 
i. e. men ; but the Bechuanas call them Bakoba, which contains 
somewhat of the idea of slaves. They have never been known to 
fight, and, indeed, have a tradition that their forefathers, in their 
first essays at war, made their bows of the Palma-Christi ; and, 
when these broke, they gave up fighting altogether. They have 
invariably submitted to the rule of every horde which has overrun 
the countries adjacent to the rivers on which they specially love 
to dwell. They are thus the Quakers of the body politic hi 
Africa. 

A long time after the period of our visit, the chief of the Lake, 
thinking to make soldiers of them, took the trouble to furnish 
them with shields. " Ah ! we never had these before ; that is 
the reason we have always succumbed. Now we will fight." 
But a marauding party came from the Makololo, and our 
"Friends" at once paddled quickly, night and day, down the 
Zouga, never daring to look behind them till they reached the 
end of the river, at the point where we first saw it. 

The canoes of these inland sailors . are truly primitive craft : 
they are hollowed out of the trunks of single trees by means of 
iron adzes ; and, if the tree has a bend, so has the canoe. I liked 
the frank and manly bearing of these men, and, instead of sitting 
in the waggon, preferred a seat in one of the canoes. I found 
they regarded their rude vessels as the Arab does his camel. 



Chap. III. DISCOVERY OF LAKE NGAMI. 65 

They have always fires in them, and prefer sleeping in them 
while on a journey to spending the night on shore. " On land 
you have lions " — say they — " serpents, hyaenas, and your ene- 
mies; but in your canoe, behind a bank of reed, nothing can 
harm you." Their submissive disposition leads to their villages 
being frequently visited by hungry strangers. We had a pot on 
the fire in the canoe by the way, and when we drew near the 
villages devoured the contents. When fully satisfied ourselves, 
I found we could all look upon any intruders with perfect com- 
placency, and show the pot in proof of having devoured the last 
morsel. 

While ascending in tins way the beautifully-wooded river, we 
came to a large stream flowing into it. This was the river 
Tamunak'le. I inquired whence it came. " Oh, from a country 
full of rivers— so many no one can tell their number— and full of 
large trees ! " This was the first confirmation of statements I 
had heard from the Bakwains who had been with Sebituane, that 
the country beyond was not "the large sandy plateau" of the 
philosophers. The prospect of a highway capable of being tra- 
versed by boats to an entirely unexplored and very populous 
region, grew from that time forward stronger and stronger in my 
mind ; so much so, that, when we actually came to the lake, tin's 
idea occupied such a large portion of my mental vision that the 
actual discovery seemed of but little importance. I find I wrote, 
when the emotions caused by the magnificent prospects of the 
new country were first awakened in my breast, that they " might 
subject me to the charge of enthusiasm, a charge which I wished 
I deserved, as nothing good or great had ever been accomplished 
in the world without it."* 

Twelve days after our departure from the waggons at Ngabi- 
sane we came to the north-east end of Lake Ngami ; and on the 
1st of August, 1849, we went down together to the broad part, 
and, for the first time, this fine-looking sheet of water was beheld 
by Europeans. The direction of the lake seemed to be N.KE. 
and S.S.W. by compass. The southern portion is said to bend 
round to the west, and to receive the Teoughe from the north at 

* Letters published by the Royal Geographical Society. Read 11th Feb 
and 8th April, 1850. 

F 



66 THE NGAMI. Chap. III. 

its north-west extremity. We could detect no horizon where we 
stood looking S.S.W. ; nor could we form any idea of the extent 
of the lake except from the reports of the inhabitants of the dis- 
trict ; and, as they professed to go round it in three days, allowing 
twenty-five miles a-day would make it seventy-five, or less than 
seventy geographical miles in circumference. Other guesses have 
been made since as to its circumference, ranging between seventy 
and one hundred miles. It is shallow, for I subsequently saw a 
native punting Ms canoe over seven or eight miles of the north- 
east end ; it can never, therefore, be of much value as a com- 
mercial highway. In fact, during the months preceding the 
annual supply of water from the north, the lake is so shallow that 
it is with difficulty cattle can approach the water through the 
boggy, reedy banks. These are low on all sides, but on the west 
there is a space devoid of trees, showing that the waters have 
retired thence at no very ancient date. This is another of the 
proofs of desiccation met with so abundantly throughout the 
whole country. A number of dead trees He on this space, some 
of them embedded in the mud, right in the water. We were 
informed by the Bayeiye, who live on the lake, that, when the 
annual inundation begins, not only trees of great size, but ante- 
lopes, as the springbuck and tsessebe (Acronotus lunata), are 
swept down by its rushing waters ; the trees are gradually 
driven by the winds to the opposite side, and become embedded 
in mud. 

The water of the lake is perfectly fresh when full, but brackish 
when low ; and that coming down the Tamunak'le we found to 
be so clear, cold, and soft, the higher we ascended, that the idea 
of melting snow was suggested to our minds. We found tins 
region, with regard to that from which we had come, to be clearly 
a hollow, the lowest point being Lake Kumadau ; the point of the 
ebullition of water, as shown by one of Newman's barometric ther- 
mometers, was only between 207J° and 206°, giving an elevation 
of not much more than two thousand feet above the level of the 
sea. We had descended above two thousand feet in coming to it 
from Kolobeng. It is the southern and lowest part of the great 
river system beyond, in winch large tracts of country are inundated 
annually by tropical rains, hereafter to be described. A little of 
that water, which in the countries farther north produces inunda-

tion, comes as far south as 20° 20', the latitude of the upper eud 
of the lake, and, instead of flooding the country, falls into the 
lake as into a reservoir. It begins to flow down the Embarrah, 
winch divides into the rivers Tz5 and Teoughe. The Tzo divides 
into the Tamunak'le and Mababe; the Tamunak'le discharges 
itself into the Zouga, and the Teoughe into the lake. The flow 
begins either in March or April, and the descending waters find 
the channels of all these rivers dried out, except in certain pools in 
their beds, which have long dry spaces between them. The lake 
itself is very low. The Zouga is but a prolongation of the 
Tamunak'le, and an arm of the lake reaches up to the point 
where the one ends and the other begins. Tins last is narrow 
and shallow, while the Zouga is broad and deep. The narrow 
arm of the lake, which on the map looks like a continuation of 
the Zouga, has never been observed to flow either way. It is as 
stagnant as the lake itself. 

The Teoughe and Tamunak'le, being essentially the same river, 
and receiving their supplies from the same source (the Embarrah 
or Yarra), can never outrun each other. If either could, or if 
the Teoughe could fill the lake — a thing which has never hap- 
pened in modern times — then this little arm would prove a con- 
venient escapement to prevent inundation. If the lake ever 
becomes lower than the bed of the Zouga, a little of the water of 
the Tamunak'le might flow into it instead of down the Zouga ; 
we should then have the phenomenon of a river flowing two ways ; 
but this has never been observed to take place here, and it is 
doubtful if it ever can occur in tins locality. The Zouga is broad 
and deep when it leaves the Tamunak'le, but becomes gradually 
narrower as you descend about two hundred miles ; there it flows 
into Kumadau, a small lake about three or four miles broad and 
twelve long. The water, which higher up begins to flow in April, 
does not make much progress in filling tins lake till the end of 
June. In September the rivers cease to flow. When the supply 
has been more than usually abundant, a little water flows beyond 
Kumadau, in the bed first seen by us on the 4th of July ; if the 
quantity were larger, it might go further in the dry rocky bed of 
the Zouga, since seen still further to the east. The water supply 
of this part of the river system, as will be more fully explained 
further on, takes place in channels prepared for a much more 

f 2 



68 THE BAMANGWATO AND THEIR CHIEF. Chap. III. 

copious flow. It resembles a deserted Eastern garden, where all 
the embankments and canals for irrigation can be traced, but 
where, the main dam and sluices having been allowed to get out 
of repair, only a small portion can be laid under water. In the 
case of the Zouga the channel is perfect, but water enough to fill 
the whole channel never comes down ; and before it finds its way 
much beyond Kumadau, the upper supply ceases to run, and 
the rest becomes evaporated. The higher parts of its bed even 
are much broader and more capacious than the lower towards 
Kumadau. The water is not absorbed so much as lost in filling 
up an empty channel, from which it is to be removed by the 
ah and sun. There is, I am convinced, no such thing in the 
country as a river running into sand and becoming lost. This 
phenomenon, so convenient for geographers, haunted my fancy 
for years ; but I have failed in discovering anything except a 
most insignificant approach to it. 

My chief object in coming to the lake was to visit Sebituane, 
the great chief of the Makololo, who was reported to live some two 
hundred miles beyond. We had now come to a half-tribe of the 
Bamangwato, called Batauana. Their chief was a young man 
named Lechulatebe. Sebituane had conquered his father Mo- 
remi, and Lechulatebe received part of his education while a 
captive among the Bayeiye. His uncle, a sensible man, ran- 
somed Mm ; and, having collected a number of families together, 
abdicated the chieftainship in favour of his nephew. As Lechu- 
latebe had just come into power, he imagined that the proper 
way of showing his abilities was to act directly contrary to every- 
thing that his uncle advised. When we came, the uncle recom- 
mended him to treat us handsomely, therefore the hopeful youth 
presented us with a goat only. It ought to have been an ox. 
So I proposed to my companions to loose the animal and let him 
go, as a hint to his master. They, however, did not wish to 
insult him. I, being more of a native, and familiar with then 
customs, knew that this shabby present was an insult to us. 
We wished to purchase some goats or oxen ; Lechulatebe offered 
us elephants' tusks. " No, we cannot eat these ; we want some- 
thing to fill our stomachs." " Neither can I ; but I hear you 
white men are all very fond of these bones, so I offer them ; 
I want to put the goats into my own stomach." A trader, who 



Chap. III. BANKS OF THE ZOUGA — PITFALLS. 69 

accompanied us, was then purchasing ivory at the rate of ten 
good large tusks for a musket worth thirteen shillings. They 
were called " bones," and I myself saw eight instances in which 
the tusks had been left to rot with the other bones where the 
elephant fell. The Batauana never had a chance of a market 
before ; but in less than two years after our discovery, not a man 
of them could be found who was not keenly alive to the great 
value of the article. 

On the day after our arrival at the lake, I applied to Lechu- 
latebe for guides to Sebituane. As he was much afraid of that 
chief, he objected, fearing lest other white men should go thither 
also, and give Sebituane guns ; whereas, if the traders came to 
him alone, the possession of firearms would give him such a supe- 
riority, that Sebituane would be afraid of lnm. It was in vain to 
explain that I would inculcate peace between them — that Sebi- 
tuane had been a father to him and Sechele, and was as anxious 
to see me as he, Lechulatebe, had been. He offered to give me 
as much ivory as I needed without going to that chief. But 
when I refused to take any, he unwillingly consented to give me 
guides. Next day, however, when Oswell and I were prepared 
to start, with the horses only, we received a senseless refusal ; 
and like Sekomi, who had thrown obstacles in our way, he sent 
men to the Bayeiye with orders to refuse us a passage across the 
river. Trying hard to form a raft at a narrow part, I worked 
many hours in the water, but the dry wood was so wormeaten it 
would not bear the weight of a single person. I was not then 
aware of the number of alligators which exist in the Zouga, and 
never think of my labour in the water without feeling thankful 
that I escaped their jaws. The season was now far advanced ; 
and as Mr. Oswell, with his wonted generous feelings, volun- 
teered on the spot to go down to the Cape and bring up a boat, 
we resolved to make our way south again. 

Coming down the Zouga we had now time to look at its banks. 
These are very beautiful, resembling closely many parts of the 
river Clyde above Glasgow. The formation is soft calcareous 
tufa, such as forms the bottom of all this basin. The banks are 
perpendicular on the side to which the water swings, and sloping 
and grassy on the other. The slopes are selected for the pitfalls 
designed by the Bayeiye to entrap the animals as they come to 



70 TREES OF THE DISTRICT. Chap. III. 

drink. These are about seven or eight feet deep, three or four 
feet wide at the mouth, and gradually decrease till they are only 
about a foot wide at the bottom. The mouth is an oblong square 
(the only square thing made by the Bechuanas, for everything 
else is round), and the long diameter at the surface is about equal 
to the depth. The decreasing width towards the bottom is in- 
tended to make the animal wedge himself more firmly in by his 
weight and struggles. The pitfalls are usually in pairs, with a 
wall a foot thick left uncut between the ends of each. So that 
if the beast, when it feels its fore legs descending, should try to save 
itself from going in altogether by striding the hind legs, he would 
spring forward and leap into the second with a force which insures 
the fall of his whole body into the trap. They are covered with 
great care ; all the excavated earth is removed to a distance, so 
as not to excite suspicion in the minds of the animals. Reeds and 
grass are laid across the top ; above this the sand is thrown, and 
watered so as to appear exactly like the rest of the spot. Some 
of our party plumped into these pitfalls more than once, even 
when in search of them, in order to open them to prevent the loss 
of our cattle. If an ox sees a hole, he carefully avoids it. And 
old elephants have been known to precede the herd and whisk 
off the coverings of the pitfalls on each side all the way down to 
the water. We have known instances in which the old among 
these sagacious animals have actually lifted the young out of the 
trap. 

The trees which adorn the banks are magnificent. Two enor- 
mous baobabs (Adansonia digitata), or mowanas, grow near its 
confluence with the lake where we took the observations for the 
latitude (20° 20' S.) We were unable to ascertain the longitude 
of the lake, as our watches were useless ; it may be between 22° 
and 23° E. The largest of the two baobabs was 76 feet in 
girth. The palmyra appears here and there among trees not 
met with in the south. The mokuchong or moshoma bears an 
edible fruit of indifferent quality, but the tree itself would be a 
fine specimen of arboreal beauty in any part of the world. The 
trunk is often converted into canoes. The motsouri, which bears 
a pink plum containing a pleasant acid juice, resembles an 
orange-tree in its dark evergreen foliage, and a cypress in its 
form. It was now winter-time, and we saw nothing of the flora. 



Chap. III. ELEPHANTS-NEW SPECIES OF ANTELOPE. 71 

The plants and bushes were dry ; but wild indigo abounded, as 
indeed it does over large tracts of Africa. It is called mohetolo, 
or the " changer," by the boys, who dye their ornaments of straw 
with the juice. There are two kinds of cotton in the country, 
and the Mashona, who convert it into cloth, dye it blue with this 
plant. 

We found the elephants in prodigious numbers on the southern 
bank. They come to drink by night, and after having slaked 
their thirst — in doing which they throw large quantities of water 
over themselves, and are heard, while enjoying the refreshment, 
screaming with delight — they evince their horror of pitfalls by 
setting off in a straight line to the desert, and never diverge till 
they are eight or ten miles off. They are smaller here than in 
the countries further south. At the Limpopo, for instance, they 
are upwards of twelve feet high ; here, only eleven : further north 
we shall find them nine feet only. The koodoo, or tolo, seemed 
smaller too than those we had been accustomed to see. We saw 
specimens of the kuabaoba, or straight-horned rhinoceros (R. 
Oswettii), which is a variety of the white (22. simus) ; and we 
found that, from the horn being projected downwards, it did not 
obstruct the line of vision; so that this species is able to be 
much more wary than its neighbours. 

We discovered an entirely new species of antelope, called leche 
or lechwi. It is a beautiful water-antelope of a light brownish- 
yellow colour. Its horns — exactly like those of the Aigoceros 
ellipsiprimnus, the water-buck, or tumoga of the Bechuanas — 
rise from the head with a slight bend backwards, then curve for- 
wards at the points. The chest, belly, and orbits are nearly 
white, the front of the legs and ankles deep brown. From the 
horns, along the nape to the withers, the male has a small mane 
of the same yellowish colour with the rest of the skin, and the 
tail has a tuft of black hair. It is never found a mile from water ; 
islets in marshes and rivers are its favourite haunts, and it is 
quite unknown except in the central humid basin of Africa. 
Having a good deal of curiosity, it presents a noble appearance 
as it stands gazing with head erect at the approaching stranger. 
When it resolves to decamp, it lowers its head, and lays its horns 
down to a level with the withers ; it then begins with a waddling

trot, which ends in its galloping and springing over bushes like the 
pallahs. It invariably runs to the water, and crosses it by a suc- 
cession of bounds, each of which appears to be from the bottom. 
We thought the flesh good at first, but soon got tired of it. 

Great shoals of excellent fish come down annually with the 
access of waters. The mullet (Mugil Africanus) is the most 
abundant. They are caught in nets. 

The Glanis siluris, a large broad-headed fish, without scales, 
and barbed — called by the natives " mosala " — attains an enor- 
mous size and fatness. They are caught so large that when a 
man carries one over his shoulder the tail reaches the ground. 
It is a vegetable feeder, and in many of its habits resembles the 
eel. Like most lophoid fishes, it has the power of retaining a 
large quantity of water in a part of its great head, so that it can 
leave the river, and even be buried in the mud of dried-up pools, 
without being destroyed. Another fish closely resembling tins, 
and named Clarias capensis by Dr. Smith, is widely diffused 
throughout the interior, and often leaves the rivers for the sake 
of feeding in pools. As these dry up, large numbers of them 
are entrapped by the people. A water-snake, yellow spotted and 
dark brown, is often seen swimming along with his head above 
the water ; it is quite harmless, and is relished as food by the 
Bayeiye. 

They mention ten kinds of fish in their river : and, in their 
songs of praise to the Zouga, say, " The messenger sent in haste 
is always forced to spend the night on the way, by the abundance 
of food you place before him." The Bayeiye live much on fish, 
which is quite an abomination to the Bechuanas in the south ; 
and they catch them in large numbers by means of nets made 
of the fine strong fibres of the hibiscus, which grows abundantly 
in all moist places. Their float-ropes are made of the ife, or, 
as it is now called, the Sanseviere Angolensis, a flag-looking 
plant, having a very strong fibre, that abounds from Kolobeng 
to Angola; and the floats themselves are pieces of a water- 
plant containing valves at each joint, which retain the air in cells 
about an inch long. The mode of knotting the nets is identical 
with our own. 

They also spear the fish with javelins having a light handle, 



Chap. III. FISHING -CANOES. 73 

which readily floats on the surface. They show great dexterity 
in harpooning the hippopotamus ; and, the barbed blade of the 
spear being attached to a rope made of the young leaves of the 
palmyra, the animal cannot rid himself of the canoe, attached to 
him. in whale fashion, except by smashing it, which he not un- 
frequently does by his teeth or by a stroke of his hind foot. 

On returning to the Bakurutse, we found that their canoes for 
fishing were simply large bundles of reeds tied together. Such a 
canoe would be a ready extemporaneous pontoon for crossing any 
river that had reedy banks.

Having returned to Kolobeng, I remained there till April, 
1850, and then left in company with Mrs. Livingstone, our three 
children, and the chief Sechele, — who had now bought a waggon 
of his own, — in order to go across the Zouga at its lower end, 
with the intention of proceeding up the northern bank till we 
gained the Tamunak'le, and of then ascending that river to visit 
Sebituane in the north. Sekomi had given orders to fill up the 
wells which we had dug with so much labour at Serotli, so we 
took the more eastern route through the Bamangwato town and 
by Letloche. That chief asked why I had avoided him in our 
former journeys ? I replied that my reason was that I knew he 
did not wish me to go to the lake, and I did not want to quarrel 
Avith him. " Well," he said, " you beat me then, and I am 
content." 

Parting with Sechele at the ford, as he was eager to visit 
Lechulatebe, we went along the northern woody bank of the 



Chap. IV. GUIDES OBTAINED FROM LECHULATEBE. 75 

Zouga with great labour, having to cut down very many trees to 
allow the waggons to pass. Our losses by oxen falling into 
pitfalls were very heavy. The Bayeiye kindly opened the pits 
when they knew of our approach ; but when that was not the 
case, we could blame no one on finding an established custom of 
the country inimical to our interests. On approaching the con- 
fluence of the Tamunak'le we were informed that the fly called 
tsetse * abounded on its banks. This was a barrier we never 
expected to meet ; and as it might have brought our waggons to 
a complete stand-still in a wilderness, where no supplies for the 
children could be obtained, we were reluctantly compelled to 
recross the Zouga. 

From the Bayeiye we learned that a party of Englishmen, who 
had come to the lake in search of ivory, were all laid low by 
fever ; so we travelled hastily down about sixty miles to render 
what aid was in our power. We were grieved to find as we came 
near that Mr. Alfred Rider, an enterprising young artist who had 
come to make sketches of this country and of the lake imme- 
diately after its discovery, had died of fever before our arrival ; 
but, by the aid of medicines and such comforts as could be made 
by the only English lady who ever visited the lake, the others 
happily recovered. The unfinished drawing of Lake Ngami was 
made by Mr. Rider just before his death, and has been kindly 
lent for this work by his bereaved mother. 

Sechele used all his powers of eloquence with Lechulatebe to 
induce him to furnish guides that I might be able to visit Sebi- 
tuane on ox-back, while Mrs. Livingstone and the children re- 
mained at Lake Ngami. He yielded at last. I had a very 
superior London-made gun, the gift of Lieutenant Arkwright, on 
which I placed the greatest value both on account of the donor 
and the impossibility of my replacing it. Lechulatebe fell 
violently in love with it, and offered whatever number of elephants' 
tusks I might ask for it. I too was enamoured with Sebituane ; 
and, as he promised in addition that he would furnish Mrs. Living- 
stone with meat all the time of my absence, his arguments made 
me part with the gun. Though he had no ivory at the time to 
pay me, I felt the piece would be well spent on those terms, and

76 MR. OSWELL'S HUNTING. Chap. IV. 

delivered it to him. All being ready for our departure, I took 
Mrs. Livingstone about six miles from the town that she might 
have a peep at the broad part of the Lake. Next morning we 
had other work to do than part, for our little boy and girl were 
seized with fever. On the day following all our servants were 
down too with the same complaint. As nothing is better in 
these cases than change of place, I was forced to give up the 
hope of seeing Sebituane that year ; so, leaving my gun as part 
payment for guides next year, we started for the pure air of the 
Desert. 

Some mistake had happened in the arrangement with Mr. 
Oswell, for we met him on the Zouga on our return, and he 
devoted the rest of tins season to elephant-hunting, at which the 
natives universally declare he is the greatest adept that ever 
came into the country. He hunted without dogs. It is remark- 
able that this lordly animal is so completely harassed by the 
presence of a few yelping curs as to be quite incapable of attend- 
ing to man. He makes awkward attempts to crush them by 
falling on his knees ; and sometimes places his forehead against a 
tree ten inches in diameter ; glancing on one side of the tree and 
then on the other, he pushes it down before him, as if he thought 
thereby to catch Ins enemies. The only danger the huntsman has 
to apprehend is the dogs running towards him, and thereby leading 
the elephant to their master. Mr. Oswell has been known to kill 
four large old male elephants a day. The value of the ivory in 
these cases would be one hundred guineas. We had reason to 
be proud of Ins success, for the inhabitants conceived from it a 
very high idea of English courage, and when they wished to 
natter me would say, " If you were not a missionary you would 
just be like Oswell ; you would not hunt with dogs either." When 
in 1852 we came to the Cape, my black coat eleven years out of 
fashion, and without a penny of salary to draw, we found that 
Mr. Oswell had most generously ordered an outfit for the half- 
naked children, which cost about 2007., and presented it to us, 
saying he thought Mrs. Livingstone had a right to the game of 
her own preserves. 

Foiled in this second attempt to reach Sebituane, we returned 
again to Kolobeng, whither we were soon followed by a number 
of messengers from that chief himself. When he heard of our 



Chap. IV. NCHOKOTSA — SALT-PANS. 77 

attempts to visit hhn, lie despatched three detachments of his 
men with thirteen brown cows to Lechulatebe, thirteen white 
cows to Sekomi, and thirteen black cows to Sechele, with a 
request to each to assist the white men to reach him. Their 
policy, however, was to keep him out of view, and act as his 
agents in purchasing with his ivory the goods he wanted. This 
is thoroughly African; and that continent being without friths 
and arms of the sea, the tribes in the centre have always been 
debarred from European intercourse, by its universal prevalence 
among all the people around the coasts. 

Before setting out on our third journey to Sebituane, it was 
necessary to visit Kuruman ; and Sechele, eager, for the sake of 
the commission thereon, to get the ivory of that chief into his 
own hands, allowed all the messengers to leave before our return. 
Sekomi, however, was more than usually gracious, and even 
furnished us with a guide, but no one knew the path beyond 
Nchokotsa, which we intended to follow. When we reached that 
point, we found that the main spring of the gun of another of his 
men, who was well acquainted with the Bushmen, through whose 
country we should pass, had opportunely broken. I never under- 
took to mend a gun with greater zest than this ; for, under a 
promise of his guidance, we went to the north instead of westward. 
All the other guides were most liberally rewarded by Mr. 
OsweU. 

We passed quickly over a hard country, which is perfectly flat. 
A little soil lying on calcareous tufa, over a tract of several 
hundreds of miles, supports a vegetation of fine sweet short grass, 
and mopane and baobab trees. On several parts of tin's we found 
large salt-pans, one of which, Ntwetwe, is fifteen miles broad, and 
one hundred long. The latitude might have been taken on its 
horizon as well as upon the sea. 

Although these curious spots seem perfectly level, all those in 
this direction have a gentle slope to the north-east : thither the 
rain-water, which sometimes covers them, gently gravitates. 
This, it may be recollected, is the direction of the Zouga. The 
salt dissolved in the water has by this means all been transferred 
to one pan in that direction, named Chuantsa ; on it we see a 
cake of salt and lime an inch and a half thick. All the others 
have an efflorescence of lime and one of the nitrates only, and 



78 SPRINGS — BUSHMEN. Chap. IV- 

some are covered thickly with shells. These shells are identical 
with those of the mollusca of Lake Ngami and the Zouga. There 
are three varieties — spiral, univalve, and bivalve. 

In every salt-pan in the country there is a spring of water on 
one side. I can remember no exception to this rule. The water 
of these springs is brackish, and contains the nitrate of soda. In 
one instance there are two springs, and one more saltish than the 
other. If this supply came from beds of rock salt the water would 
not be drinkable, as it generally is, and in some instances, where 
the salt contained in the pan in which these springs appear has 
been removed by human agency, no fresh deposit occurs. It is 
therefore probable that these deposits of salt are the remains of 
the very slightly brackish lakes of antiquity, large portions of 
which must have been dried out in the general desiccation. We 
see an instance in Lake Ngami, which when low becomes brackish, 
and this view seems supported by the fact that the largest quan- 
tities of salt have been found in the deepest hollows or lowest 
valleys, which have no outlet or outgoing gorge ; and a fountain, 
about thirty miles south of the Bamangwato — the temperature of 
which is upwards of 100° — while strongly impregnated with pure 
salt, being on a flat part of the country, is accompanied by no 
deposit. 

When these deposits occur in a flat tufaceous country like the 
present, a large space is devoid of vegetation, on account of the 
nitrates dissolving the tufa, and keeping it in a state unfavourable 
to the growth of plants. 

We found a great number of wells in this tufa. A place called 
Matlomagan-yana, or the " Links," is quite a chain of these never- 
failing springs. As they occasionally become full in seasons when 
no rain falls, and resemble somewhat in this respect the rivers we 
have already mentioned, it is probable they receive some water 
by percolation from the river system in the country beyond. 
Among these links we found many families of Bushmen ; and, 
unlike those on the plains of the Kalahari, who are generally of 
short stature and light-yellow colour, these were tall strapping 
fellows, of dark complexion. Heat alone does not produce black- 
ness of skin, but heat with moisture seems to insure the deepest 
hue. 

One of these Bushmen, named Shobo, consented to be our 



Chap. IV. THE GUIDE SHOBO. 79 

guide over the waste between these springs and the country of 
Sebituane. Shobo gave us no hope of water in less than a 
month. Providentially, however, we came sooner than we 
expected to some supplies of rain-water in a chain of pools. It 
is impossible to convey an idea of the dreary scene on which we 
entered after leaving this spot : the only vegetation was a low 
scrub in deep sand ; not a bird or insect enlivened the landscape. 
It was without exception the most uninviting prospect I ever 
beheld ; and, to make matters worse, our guide Shobo wandered 
on the second day. We coaxed him on at night, but he went to 
all points of the compass on the trails of elephants which had 
been here in the rainy season ; and then would sit down in the 
path, and in his broken Sichuana say, "No water, all country 
only ; — Shobo sleeps ; — he breaks down ; — country only ; " — and 
then coolly curl himself up and go to sleep. The oxen were 
terribly fatigued and thirsty ; and on the morning of the fourth 
day Shobo, after professing ignorance of everything, vanished 
altogether. We went on in the direction in which we last saw 
him, and about eleven o'clock began to see birds; then the 
trail of a rhinoceros. At this we unyoked the oxen, and they, 
apparently knowing the sign, rushed along to find the water in 
the river Mababe, which comes from the Tamunak'le, and lay to 
the west of us. The supply of water in the waggons had been 
wasted by one of our servants, and by the afternoon only a small 
portion remained for the children. This was a bitterly anxious 
night ; and next morning the less there was of water, the more 
thirsty the little rogues became. The idea of their perishing 
before our eyes was terrible. It would almost have been a relief 
to me to have been reproached with being the entire cause of the 
catastrophe, but not one syllable of upbraiding was uttered by 
their mother, though the tearful eye told the agony within. In 
the afternoon of the fifth day, to our inexpressible relief, some of 
the men returned with a supply of that fluid of which we had 
never before felt the true value. 

The cattle in rushing along to the water in the Mababe pro- 
bably crossed a small patch of trees containing tsetse, an insect 
which was shortly to become a perfect pest to us. Shobo had 
found his way to the Bayeiye, and appeared, when we came up 
to the river, at the head of a party ; and, as he wished to show 



80 THE BANAJOA — THE TSETSE. Chap. IV. 

his importance before his friends, he walked up boldly and com- 
manded our whole cavalcade to stop, and to bring forth fire and 
tobacco, while he coolly sat down and smoked his pipe. It was 
such an inimitably natural way of showing off, that we all stopped 
to admire the acting, and, though he had left us previously in 
the lurch, we all liked Shobo, a fine specimen of that wonderful 
people, the Bushmen. 

Next day we came to a village of Banajoa, a tribe which 
extends far to the eastward. They were living on the borders 
of a marsh in winch the Mababe terminates. They had lost their 
crop of corn (holcus sorghum), and now subsisted almost entirely 
on the root called "tsitla," a kind of aroidoea, which contains 
a very large quantity of sweet-tasted starch. When dried, pounded 
into meal, and allowed to ferment, it forms a not unpleasant 
article of food. The women shave all the hair off their heads, 
and seem darker than the Bechuanas. Their huts were built 
on poles, and a fire is made beneath by night, in order that the 
smoke may drive away the mosquitoes, which abound on the 
Mababe and Tamunak'le more than in any other part of the 
country. The head man of this village, Majane, seemed a little 
wanting in ability ; but had had wit enough to promote a younger 
member of the family to the office. This person, the most like 
the ugly negro of the tobacconists' shops I ever saw, was called 
Moroa Majane, or son of Majane, and proved an active guide 
across the river Sonta, and to the banks of the Chobe, in the 
country of Sebituane. We had come through another tsetse 
district by night, and at once passed our cattle over to the northern 
bank to preserve them from its ravages. 

A few remarks on the Tsetse, or Glossina morsitans, may here 
be appropriate. It is not much larger than the common house- 
fly, and is nearly of the same brown colour as the common 
honey-bee ; the after part of the body has three or four yellow 
bars across it ; the wings project beyond this part considerably, 
and it is remarkably alert, avoiding most dexterously all attempts 
to capture it with the hand, at common temperatures ; in the 
cool of the mornings and evenings it is less agile. Its peculiar 
buzz when once heard can never be forgotten by the traveller 
whose means of locomotion are domestic animals; for it is well 
known that the bite of this poisonous insect is certain death to 



Chap. IV. OPERATION OF TSETSE POISON. 81 

the ox, horse, and dog. In this journey, though we were not 
aware of any great number having at any time lighted on our 
cattle, we lost forty-three fine oxen by its bite. We watched the 
animals carefully, and believe that not a score of flies were ever 
upon them. 

A most remarkable feature in the bite of the tsetse is its 
perfect harmlessness in man and wild animals, and even calves 
so long as they continue to suck the cows. We never experienced 
the slightest injury from them ourselves, personally, although we 
lived two months in their habitat, which was in this case as 
sharply defined as in many others, for the south bank of the 
Chobe was infested by them, and the northern bank, where our 
cattle were placed, only fifty yards distant, contained not a single 
specimen. This was the more remarkable, as we often saw 
natives carrying over raw meat to the opposite bank with many 
tsetse settled upon it. 

The poison does not seem to be injected by a sting, or by ova 
placed beneath the skin, for, when one is allowed to feed freely on 
the hand, it is seen to insert the middle prong of three portions, into 
which the proboscis divides, somewhat deeply into the true skin ; 
it then draws it out a little way, and it assumes a crimson colour 
as the mandibles come into brisk operation. The previously 
shrunken belly swells out, and, if left undisturbed, the fly 
quietly departs when it is full. A slight itching irritation follows, 
but not more than in the bite of a mosquito. In the ox this 
same bite produces no more immediate effects than in man. It 
does not startle him as the gad-fly does ; but a few days after- 
wards the following symptoms supervene : the eye and nose begin 
to run, the coat stares as if the animal were cold, a swelling 
appears under the jaw, and sometimes at the navel ; and, though 
the animal continues to graze, emaciation commences, accom- 
panied with a peculiar flaccidity of the muscles, and this proceeds 
unchecked until, perhaps months afterwards, purging comes on, 
and the animal, no longer able to graze, perishes in a state of 
extreme exhaustion. Those which are in good condition often 
perish soon after the bite is inflicted with staggering and blind- 
ness, as if the brain were affected by it. Sudden changes of 
temperature produced by falls of rain seem to hasten the progress 
of the complaint; but in general the emaciation goes on unin-

terruptedly for months, and, do what we will, the poor animals 
perish miserably. 

When opened, the cellular tissue on the surface of the body 
beneath the skin is seen to be injected with air, as if a quantity 
of soap-bubbles were scattered over it, or a dishonest awkward 
butcher had been trying to make it look fat. The fat is of a 
greenish-yellow colour and of an oily consistence. All the 
muscles are flabby, and the heart often so soft that the fingers 
may be made to meet through it. The lungs and liver partake 
of the disease. The stomach and bowels are pale and empty, 
and the gall-bladder is distended with bile. 

These symptoms seem to indicate what is probably the case, a 
poison in the blood ; the germ of which enters when the proboscis 
is inserted to draw blood. The poison-germ, contained in a bulb 
at the root of the proboscis, seems capable, although very minute 
in quantity, of reproducing itself, for the blood after death by 
tsetse is very small in quantity, and scarcely stains the hands in 
dissection. I shall have by and by to mention another insect, 
which by the same operation produces in the human subject both 
vomiting and purging. 

The mule, ass, and goat enjoy the same immunity from the 
tsetse as man and the game. Many large tribes on the Zambesi 
can keep no domestic animals except the goat, in consequence 
of the scourge existing hi their country. Our children were 
frequently bitten, yet suffered no harm ; and we saw around us 
numbers of zebras, buffaloes, pigs, pallahs and other antelopes, 
feeding quietly in the very habitat of the tsetse, yet as undis- 
turbed by its bite as oxen are when they first receive the fatal 
poison. There is not so much difference in the natures of the 
horse and zebra, the buffalo and ox, the sheep and antelope, as to 
afford any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon. Is a man 
not as much a domestic animal as a dog ? The curious feature 
in the case, that dogs perish though fed on milk, whereas 
the calves escape so long as they continue sucking, made us 
imagine that the mischief might be produced by some plant in 
the locality, and not by tsetse ; but Major Yardon, of the Madras 
Army, settled that point by riding a horse up to a small hill 
infested by the insect without allowing him time to graze, and, 
though he only remained long enough to take a view of the 



Chap. IV. MEETING WITH SEBITUANE. 83 

country and catch some specimens of tsetse on the animal, in ten 
days afterwards the horse was dead. 

The well-known disgust which the tsetse shows to animal 
excreta, as exhibited when a village is placed in its habitat, has 
been observed and turned to account by some of the doctors. 
They mix droppings of animals, human milk, and some medicines 
together, and smear the animals that are about to pass through a 
tsetse district ; but this, though it proves a preventive at the time, 
is not permanent. There is no cure yet known for the disease. 
A careless herdsman allowing a large number of cattle to wander 
into a tsetse district loses all except the calves ; and Sebituane 
once lost nearly the entire cattle of his tribe — very many thou- 
sands — by unwittingly coming under its influence. Inoculation 
does not insure immunity, as animals which have been slightly 
bitten in one year may perish by a greater number of bites in 
the next ; but it is probable that with the increase of guns the 
game will perish, as has happened in the south, and the tsetse, 
deprived of food, may become extinct simultaneously with the 
larger animals. 

The Makololo whom we met on the Chobe were delighted to see 
us ; and as their chief Sebituane was about twenty miles down the 
river, Mr. Oswell and I proceeded in canoes to his temporary 
residence. He had come from the Barotse town of Naliele down 
to Sesheke as soon as he heard of white men being in search of 
him, and now came one hundred miles more to bid us welcome 
into his country. He was upon an island with all his principal 
men around him, and engaged in singing when we arrived. It 
was more like church music than the sing-song e e e, ae ae se, of 
the Bechuanas in the south ; and they continued the tune for 
some seconds after we approached. We informed him of the diffi- 
culties we had encountered, and how glad we were that they were 
all at an end by at last reaching his presence. He signified his 
own joy, and added, " Your cattle are all bitten by the tsetse and 
will certainly die ; but never mind, I have oxen and will give you 
as many as you need." We, in our ignorance, then thought that, 
as so few tsetse had bitten them, no great mischief would follow. 
He then presented us with an ox and a jar of honey as food, and 
handed us over to the care of Mahale, who had headed the party 
to Kolobeng, and would now fain appropriate to himself the whole 

G 2 



84 CAREER OF SEBITUANE. Chap. IV. 

credit of our coming. Prepared skins of oxen as soft as cloth were 
given to cover us through the night; and as nothing could be 
returned to this chief, Mahale became the owner of them. Long 
before it was day, Sebituane came, and sitting down by the fire, 
which was lighted for our benefit behind the hedge where we lay, 
he narrated the difficulties he had himself experienced, when a 
young man, in crossing that same Desert which we had mastered 
long afterwards. As he has been most remarkable in his career, 
and was unquestionably the greatest man in all that country, a 
short sketch of his life may prove interesting to the reader. 

Sebituane' was about forty-five years of age ; of a tall and wiry 
form, an olive or coffee-and-milk colour, and slightly bald ; in 
manner cool and collected, and more frank in his answers than 
any other chief I ever met. He was the greatest warrior ever 
heard of beyond the colony, for, unlike Mosihkatse, Dingaan, and 
others, he always led his men into battle himself. When he saw 
the enemy he felt the edge of his battle-axe and said, " Aha ! it 
is sharp, and whoever turns his back on the enemy will feel its 
edge." So fleet of foot was he, that all his people knew there 
was no escape for the coward, as any such would be cut down 
without mercy. In some instances of skulking, he allowed the 
individual to return home ; then calling him, he would say, " Ah, 
you prefer dying at home to dying in the field, do you ? You 
shall have your desire." This was the signal for his immediate 
execution. 

He came from the country near the sources of the Likwa and 
Namagari rivers in the south, so we met him eight hundred or 
nine hundred miles from his birthplace. He was not the son of 
a chief, though related closely to the reigning family of the Ba- 
siitu ; and when in an attack by Sikonyele the tribe was driven 
out of one part, Sebituane was one in that immense horde of 
savages driven back by the Griquas from Kuruman in 1824.* 
He then fled to the north with an insignificant party of men and 
cattle. At Melita the Bangwaketse collected the Bakwains, 
Bakatla, and Bahurutse, to " eat them up." Placing his men in 
front, and the women behind the cattle, he routed the whole of 
his enemies at one blow. Having thus conquered Makabe, the 

* See an account of this affair in Moffat's 'Missionary Enterprise in 
Africa.' 



Chap. IV. CAREER OF SEBITUANE. 85 

chief of the Bangwaketse, he took immediate possession of his 
town and all his goods. 

Sebituane subsequently settled at the place called Litubaruba, 
where Sechele now dwells, and his people suffered severely in one 
of those unrecorded attacks by white men, in which murder is 
committed and materials laid up in the conscience for a future 
judgment. 

A great variety of fortune followed him in the northern part of 
the Bechuana country ; twice he lost all his cattle by the attacks 
of the Matebele, but always kept his people together, and retook 
more than he lost. He then crossed the Desert by nearly the 
same path that we did. He had captured a guide; and, as it 
was necessary to travel by night in order to reach water, the 
guide took advantage of this and gave him the slip. After 
marching till morning, and going as they thought right, they 
found themselves on the trail of the day before. Many of Ins 
cattle burst away from him in the frenzy of thirst, and rushed 
back to Serotli, then a large piece of water, and to Mashue and 
Lopepe, the habitations of their original owners. He stocked 
himself again among the Batletli, on Lake Kumadau, whose herds 
were of the large-horned species of cattle.* Conquering all around 
the lake, he heard of white men living at the west coast ; and 
haunted by what seems to have been the dream of his whole life, 
a desire to have intercourse with the white man, he passed away 
to the south-west, into the parts opened up lately by Messrs. Galton 
and Andersson. There, suffering intensely from thirst, he and Ins 
party came to a small well. He decided that the men, not the 
cattle, should drink it, the former being of most value, as they 
could fight for more, should these be lost. In the morning they 
found the cattle had escaped to the Damaras. 

Returning to the north poorer than he started, he ascended the 
Teoughe to the hill Sorila, and crossed over a swampy country 
to the eastwards. Pursuing his course onwards to the low-lying 
basin of the Leeambye, he saw that it presented no attraction to

will hold no less than twenty-one imperial pints of water ; and a pair, .brought

to tip eight and a half feet.

a pastoral tribe like his, so lie moved down that river among the 
Bashubia and Batoka, who were then living in all their glory. 
His narrative resembled closely the ' Commentaries of Caesar,' and 
the history of the British in India. He was always forced to 
attack the different tribes, and to this day his men justify every 
step he took, as perfectly just and right. The Batoka lived on 
large islands in the Leeambye, or Zambesi ; and, feeling perfectly 
secure in their fastnesses, often allured fugitive or wandering 
tribes on to uninhabited islets on pretence of ferrying them across, 
and there left them to perish for the sake of their goods. Sek- 
omi, the chief of the Bamangwato, was, when a child, in danger 
of meeting this fate ; but a man still living had compassion on 
him, and enabled his mother to escape with him by night. The 
river is so large, that the sharpest eye cannot tell the difference 
between an island and the bend of the opposite bank ; but Se- 
bituane, with his usual foresight, requested the island chief who 
ferried hfm across to take his seat in the canoe with him, and 
detained him by his side till all his people and cattle were safely 
landed. The whole Batoka country was then densely peopled, 
and they had a curious taste for ornamenting their villages with 
the skulls of strangers. When Sebituane appeared near the great 
falls, an immense army collected to make trophies of the Mako- 
lolo skulls ; but instead of succeeding in tins they gave him a good 
excuse for conquering them, and capturing so many cattle that 
his people were quite incapable of taking any note of the sheep 
and goats. He overran all the high lands towards the Kafue, and 
settled in what is called a pastoral country, of gently undulating 
plains, covered with short grass and but little forest. The Mako- 
lolo have never lost their love for this fine healthy region. 

But the Matebele, a Caffre or Zulu tribe, under Mosilikatse, 
crossed the Zambesi ; and, attacking Sebituane in this choice spot, 
captured his cattle and women. Rallying his men, he followed 
and recaptured the whole. A fresh attack was also repulsed, and 
Sebituane thought of going further down the Zambesi, to the 
country of the white men. He had an idea, whence imbibed I 
never could learn, that if he had a cannon he might live in peace. 
He had led a life of war, yet no one apparently desired peace 
more than he did. A prophet induced him to turn Ins face again 
to the westward. This man, by name Tlapane, was called a 



Chap. IV. A NATIVE PROPHET. 87 

"senoga" — one who holds intercourse with the gods. He pro- 
bably had a touch of insanity, for he was in the habit of retiring 
no one knew whither, but perhaps into some cave, to remain in a 
hypnotic or mesmeric state until the moon was full. Then, re- 
turning to the tribe quite emaciated, he excited himself, as others 
do who pretend to the prophetic afflatus, until he was in a state of 
ecstacy. These pretended prophets commence their operations by 
violent action of the voluntary muscles. Stamping, leaping, and 
shouting in a peculiarly violent manner, or beating the ground 
with a club, they induce a kind of fit, and while in it pretend that 
their utterances are unknown to themselves. Tlapane, pointing 
eastwards, said, " There, Sebituane, I behold a fire : shun it ; it is 
a fire which may scorch thee. The gods say, go not thither." 
Then, turning to the west, he said, " I see a city and a nation of 
black men — men of the water ; their cattle are red ; thine own 
tribe, Sebituane, is perishing, and will be all consumed ; thou wilt 
govern black men, and, when thy warriors have captured red cattle, 
let not the owners be killed ; they are thy future tribe — they are 
thy city ; let them be spared to cause thee to build. And thou, 
Ramosinii, thy village will perish utterly. If Mokari removes from 
that village he will perish first, and thou, Ramosinii, wilt be the 
last to die." Concerning himself he added, " The gods have 
caused other men to drink water, but to me they have given 
bitter water of the chukuru (rhinoceros). They call me away 
myself. I cannot stay much longer." 

This vaticination, which loses much in the translation, I have 
given rather-fully, as it shows an observant mind. The policy re- 
commended was wise, and the deaths of the " senoga " and of the 
two men he had named, added to the destruction of their village, 
having all happened soon after, it is not wonderful that Sebituane 
followed implicitly the warning voice. The fire pointed to was 
evidently the Portuguese fire-arms, of which he must have heard. 
The black men referred to were the Barotse, or, as they term them- 
selves, Baloiana ; and Sebituane spared their chiefs, even though 
they attacked him first. He had ascended the Barotse valley, but 
was pursued by the Matebele, as Mosilikatse never could forgive 
his former defeats. They came up the river in a very large body. 
Sebituane placed some goats on one of the large islands of the 
Zambesi, as a bait to the warriors, and some men in canoes to 



8$ CAEEEK OF SEBITUANE. Chap. IV. 

co-operate in the manoeuvre. When they were all ferried over to 
the island, the canoes were removed, and the Matebele found them- 
selves completely in a trap, being perfectly unable to swim. They 
subsisted for some time on the roots of grass after the goats were 
eaten, but gradually became so emaciated, that, when the Mako- 
lolo landed, they had only to perform the part of executioners on 
the adults, and to adopt the rest into their own tribe. After- 
wards Mosilikatse was goaded on by his warriors to revenge this 
loss ; so he sent an immense army, carrying canoes with them, in 
order that no such mishap might occur again. Sebituane had by 
this time hicorporated the Barotse, and taught lus young men to 
manage canoes ; so he went from island to island, and watched the 
Matebele on the mainland so closely that they could not use their 
canoes to cross the river anywhere without parting their forces. 
At last all the Makololo and their cattle were collected on the 
island of Loyelo ; and lay all around, keeping watch night and 
day over the enemy. After some time spent in this way, Sebituane 
went in a canoe towards them, and, addressing them by an in- 
terpreter, asked why they wished to kill him; he had never 
attacked them, never harmed their chief: "Au !" he continued, 
the guilt is on your side." The Matebele made no reply ; but the 
Makololo next day saw the canoes they had carried so far, lying 
smashed, and the owners gone. They returned towards their 
own country, and fever, famine, and the Batoka completed their 
destruction ; only five men returned to Mosilikatse. 

Sebituane had now not only conquered all the black tribes over 
an immense tract of country, but had made himself dreaded even 
by the terrible Mosilikatse. He never could trust this ferocious 
chief, however ; and, as the Batoka on the islands had been guilty 
of ferrying his enemies, across the Zambesi, he made a rapid 
descent upon them, and swept them all out of their island fast- 
nesses. He thus unwittingly performed a good service to the 
country, by completely breaking down the old system which pre- 
vented trade from penetrating into the great central valley. Of 
the cliiefs who escaped, he said, " They love Mosilikatse, let them 
live with him : the Zambesi is my line of defence ; " and men 
were placed all along it as sentinels. When he heard of our wish 
to visit him, he did all he could to assist our approach. Sechele, 
Sekomi, and Lechulatebe owed their lives to his clemency ; and 



Chap. IV. HIS CHARACTER. 89 

the latter might have paid dearly for his obstructiveness. Se- 
bituane knew everything that happened in the country, for he had 
the art of gaining the affections both of his own people and of 
strangers. When a party of poor men came to his town to sell their 
hoes or skins, no matter how ungainly they might be, he soon 
knew them all. A company of these indigent strangers, sitting 
far apart from the Makololo gentlemen around the chief, would 
be surprised to see him come alone to them, and, sitting down, 
inquire if they were hungry. He would order an attendant to bring 
meal, milk, and honey, and, mixing them in their sight in order to 
remove any suspicion from their minds, make them feast, perhaps 
for the first time in their lives, on a lordly dish. Delighted beyond 
measure with his affability and liberality, they felt their hearts 
warm towards him, and gave him all the information in their 
power ; and as he never allowed a party of strangers to go away 
without giving every one of them, servants and all, a present, his 
praises were sounded far and wide. " He has a heart ! he is wise ! " 
were the usual expressions we heard before we saw him. 

He was much pleased with the proof of confidence we had shown 
in bringing our children, and promised to take us to see his country, 
so that we might choose a part in which to locate ourselves. Our 
plan was, that I should remain in the pursuit of my objects as a 
missionary, while Mr. Oswell explored the Zambesi to the east. 
Poor Sebituane, however, just after realising what he had so long 
ardently desired, fell sick of inflammation of the lungs, which 
originated in and extended from an old wound, got at Melita. I 
saw his danger, but, being a stranger, I feared to treat him medi- 
cally, lest, in the event of his death, I should be blamed by his 
people. I mentioned this to one of his doctors, who said, " Your 
fear is prudent and wise ; this people would blame you." He had 
been cured of this complaint during the year before by the Barotse 
making a large number of free incisions in the chest. The Mako- 
lolo doctors, on the other hand, now scarcely cut the skin. On 
the Sunday afternoon in which he died, when our usual religious 
service was over, I visited him with my little boy Robert. " Come 
near," said Sebituane, " and see if I am any longer a man ; I am 
done." He was thus sensible of the dangerous nature of his 
disease, so I ventured to assent, and added a single sentence re- 
garding hope after death. " Why do you speak of death ? " said 



90 DEATH OF SEBITUANE. Chap. IV. 

one of a relay of fresh doctors ; " Sebituane will never die." If I 
had persisted, the impression would have been produced that by 
speaking about it I wished him to die. After sitting with him 
some time, and commending him to the mercy of God, I rose to 
depart, when the dying chieftain, raising himself up a little from 
his prone position, called a servant, and said, " Take Kobert to 
Maunku (one of his wives), and tell her to give him some milk." 
These were the last words of Sebituane. 

We were not informed of his death until the next day. The 
burial of a Bechuana chief takes place in his cattle-pen, and all 
the cattle are driven for an hour or two around and over the grave, 
so that it may be quite obliterated. We went and spoke to the 
people, advising them to keep together and support the heir. 
They took this kindly ; and in turn told us not to be alarmed, for 
they would not think of ascribing the death of their chief to us ; 
that Sebituane had just gone the way of his fathers ; and though 
the father had gone, he had left children, and they hoped that we 
would be as friendly to his children as we intended to have been 
to himself. 

He was decidedly the best specimen of a native chief I ever met. 
I never felt so much grieved by the loss of a black man before ; and 
it was impossible not to follow him in thought into the world of 
which he had just heard before he was called away, and to realise 
somewhat of the feelings of those who pray for the dead. The 
deep dark question of what is to become of such as he, must, how- 
ever, be left where we find it, believing that, assuredly, the " Judge 
of all the earth will do right." 

At Sebituane's death the chieftainship devolved, as her father 
intended, on a daughter named Ma-mochisane. He had promised 
to show us his country and to select a suitable locality for our 
residence. We had now to look to the daughter, who was living 
twelve days to the north, at Naliele. We were obliged, therefore, 
to remain until a message came from her ; and when it did she 
gave us perfect liberty to visit any part of the country we chose. 
Mr. Oswell and I then proceeded one hundred and thirty miles to 
the north-east, to Sesheke ; and in the end of June, 1851, we were 
rewarded by the discovery of the Zambesi, in the centre of the 
continent. Tins was a most important point, for that river was 
not previously known to exist there at all. The Portuguese maps 



Chap. IV. DISCOVERY OF THE ZAMBESI. 91 

all represent it as rising far to the east of where we now were ; and 
if ever anything like a chain of trading stations had existed across 
the country between the latitudes 12° and 18° south, tins magni- 
ficent portion of the river must have been known before. We saw 
it at the end of the dry season, at the time when the river is about 
at its lowest, and yet there was a breadth of from three hundred 
to six hundred yards of deep flowing water. Mr. Oswell said he 
had never seen such a fine river, even in India. At the period of 
its annual inundation it rises fully twenty feet in perpendicular 
height, and floods fifteen or twenty miles of lands adjacent to its 
banks. 

The country over which we had travelled from the Chobe was 
perfectly flat, except where there were large ant-hills, or the 
remains of former ones, which had left mounds a few feet high. 
These are generally covered with wild date-trees and palmyras, 
and in some parts there are forests of mimosa? and mopane. 
Occasionally the country between the Chobe and Zambesi is 
flooded, and there are large patches of swamps lying near the 
Chobe, or on its banks. The Makololo were living among these 
swamps for the sake of the protection the deep reedy rivers 
afforded them against their enemies. 

Now, in reference to a suitable locality for a settlement for 
myself, I could not conscientiously ask them to abandon their 
defences for my convenience alone. The healthy districts were 
defenceless, and the safe localities were so deleterious to human 
life, that the original Basutos had nearly all been cut off by the 
fever ; I therefore feared to subject my family to the scourge. 

As we were the very first white men the inhabitants had ever 
seen, we were visited by prodigious numbers. Among the first 
who came to see us was a gentleman who appeared in a gaudy 
dressing-gown of printed calico. Many of the Makololo, besides, 
had garments of blue, green, and red baize, and also of printed 
cottons ; on inquiry, we learned that these had been purchased, in 
exchange for boys, from a tribe called Mambari, which is situated 
near Bihe. This tribe began the slave-trade with Sebituane only 
in 1850, and, but for the unwillingness of Lechulatebe to allow us 
to pass, we should have been with Sebituane in time to have 
prevented it from commencing at all. The Mambari visited in 
ancient times the chief of the Barotse, whom Sebituane con- 



92 THE SLAVE-TRADE. Chap. IV. 

quered, and he refused to allow any one to sell a child. They 
never came back again till 1850 ; and as they had a number 
of old Portuguese guns, marked "Legitimo de Braga," which 
Sebituane thought would be excellent in any future invasion of 
Matebele, he offered to purchase them with cattle or ivory, but 
the Mambari refused everything except boys about fourteen years 
of age. The Makololo declare they never heard of people being 
bought and sold till then, and disliked it, but the desire to possess 
the guns prevailed, and eight old guns were exchanged for as 
many boys ; these were not their own children, but captives of 
the black races they had conquered. I have never known in 
Africa an instance of a parent selling his own offspring. The 
Makololo were afterwards incited to make a foray against some 
tribes to the eastward ; the Mambari bargaining to use their guns 
in the attack for the captives they might take, and the Makololo 
were to have all the cattle. They went off with at least two 
hundred slaves that year. During this foray the Makololo met 
some Arabs from Zanzibar, who presented them with three English 
muskets, and in return received about thirty of their captives. 

In talking with my companion over these matters, the idea 
was suggested that, if the slave-market were supplied with articles 
of European manufacture by legitimate commerce, the trade in 
slaves would become impossible. It seemed more feasible to 
give the goods, for which the people now part with their servants, 
in exchange for ivory and other products of the country, and 
thus prevent the trade at the beginning, than try to put a stop 
to it at any of the subsequent steps. Tins could only be effected 
by establishing a highway from the coast into the centre of the 
country. 

As there was no hope of the Boers allowing the peaceable 
instruction of the natives at Kolobeng, I at once resolved to save 
my family from exposure to tins unhealthy region by sending 
them to England, and to return alone, with a view to exploring 
the country in search of a healthy district that might prove a 
centre of civilization, and open up the interior by a path to either 
the east or west coast. This resolution led me down to the Cape 
in April, 1852, being the first time during eleven years that I had 
visited the scenes of civilization. Our route to Cape Town led 
us to pass through the centre of the colony during the twentieth

month of a Caffre war ; and if those who periodically pay enormous 
sums for these inglorious affairs wish to know how our little 
unprotected party could quietly travel through the heart of the 
colony to the capital, with as little sense or sign of danger as if 
we had been in England, they must engage a " Times Special 
Correspondent" for the next outbreak to explain where the 
money goes, and who have been benefited by the blood and 
treasure expended. 

Having placed my family on board a homeward-bound ship 
and promised to rejoin them in two years, we parted, for, as it 
subsequently proved, nearly Rye years. The Directors of the 
London Missionary Society signified their cordial approval of my 
project, by leaving the matter entirely to my own discretion; 
and I have much pleasure in acknowledging my obligations 
to the gentlemen composing that body for always acting in an 
enlightened spirit, and with as much liberality as their constitu- 
tion would allow. 

I have the like pleasure in confessing my thankfulness to 
the Astronomer Eoyal at the Cape, Thomas Maclear, Esq., for 
enabling me to recall the little astronomical knowledge which 
constant manual labour and the engrossing nature of missionary 
duties had effaced from my memory, and in adding much that I 
did not know before. The promise he made on parting, that he 
would examine and correct all my observations, had more effect 
in making me persevere in overcoming the difficulties of an 
unassisted solitary observer, than anything else; so whatever 
credit may be attached to the geographical positions laid down 
in my route, must be attributed to the voluntary aid of the 
excellent and laborious astronomer of the Cape observatory. 

Having given the reader as rapid a sketch as possible of events 
which attracted notice between 1840 and 1852, I now proceed 
to narrate the incidents of the last and longest journey of all, 
performed in 1852-6.

Having sent my family home to England, I started, in the 
beginning of June 1852, on my last journey from Cape Town. 
This journey extended from the southern extremity of the conti- 
nent to St. Paul de Loando, the capital of Angola, on the west 
coast, and thence across South Central Africa in an oblique 
direction to Kilimane (Quilimane) in Eastern Africa. I proceeded 
in the usual conveyance of the country, the heavy lumbering 
Cape waggon drawn by ten oxen, and was accompanied by two 
Christian Bechuanas from Kuruman, — than whom I never saw 
better servants anywhere, — by two Bakwain men, and two young 
girls, who, having come as nurses with our children to the Cape, 
were returning to their home at Kolobeng. Waggon-travelling 
in Africa has been so often described, that I need say no more 
than that it is a prolonged system of picnicking, excellent for the 
health, and agreeable to those who are not over fastidious about 
trifles, and who delight in being in the open air. 

Our route to the north lay near the centre of the cone-shaped 
mass of land which constitutes the promontory of the Cape. If we 
suppose this cone to be divided into three zones or longitudinal 
bands, we find each presenting distinct peculiarities of climate, 



Chap. V. NATURAL DIVISIONS OF AFRICA. 95 

physical appearance, and population. These are more marked 
beyond than within the colony. At some points one district 
seems to be continued in and to merge into the other, but the 
general dissimilarity warrants the division, as an aid to memory. 
The eastern zone is often furnished with mountains, well wooded 
with evergreen succulent trees, on which neither fire nor droughts 
can have the smallest effect (Strditzia, Zamia horrida, Portula- 
caria afra, Schotia speciosa, Euphorbias, and Aloes arborescens) ; 
and its seaboard gorges are clad with gigantic timber. It is also 
comj>aratively well watered with streams and flowing rivers. 
The annual supply of rain is considerable, and the inhabitants 
(Caffres or Zulus) are tall, muscular, and well made ; they are 
shrewd, energetic, and brave ; altogether they merit the cha- 
racter given them by military authorities, of being " magnificent 
savages." Their splendid physical development and form of skull 
show that, but for the black skin and woolly hair, they would 
take rank among the foremost Europeans. 

The next division, that which embraces the centre of the 
continent, can scarcely be called hilly, for what hills there are 
are very low. It consists for the most part of extensive, slightly 
undulating plains. There are no lofty mountains, but few springs, 
and still fewer flowing streams. Rain is far from abundant, and 
droughts may be expected every few years. Without artificial 
irrigation no European grain can be raised, and the inhabitants 
(Bechuanas), though evidently of the same stock, originally, with 
those already mentioned, and closely resembling them in being 
an agricultural as well as a pastoral people, are a comparatively 
timid race, and inferior to the Caffres in physical development. 

The western division is still more level than the middle one, 
being rugged only near the coast. It includes the great plain 
called the Kalahari Desert, which is remarkable for little water 
and very considerable vegetation. 

The reason probably why so little rain falls on this extensive 
plain is, that the prevailing winds of most of the interior country 
are easterly, with a little southing. The moisture taken up 
by the atmosphere from the Indian ocean is deposited on the 
eastern hilly slope ; and, when the moving mass of air reaches its 
greatest elevation, it is then on the verge of the great valley, or, 
as in the case of the Kalahari, the great heated inland plains ; 



96 ABSENCE OF RAIN — VEGETATION. Chap. V. 

there, meeting with the rarefied air of that hot dry surface, the 
ascending heat gives it greater capacity for retaining all its re- 
maining humidity, and few showers can be given to the middle 
and western lands in consequence of the increased hygrometric 
power. 

This is the same phenomenon, on a gigantic scale, as that 
which takes place on Table Mountain, at the Cape, in what is 
called the spreading of " the table-cloth." The south-east wind 
causes a mass of air, equal to the diameter of the mountain, sud- 
denly to ascend at least three thousand feet ; the dilatation pro- 
duced by altitude, with its attendant cold, causes the immediate 
formation of a cloud on the summit ; the water in the atmosphere 
becomes visible ; successive masses of gliding-up and passing-over 
air cause the continual formation of clouds, but the top of the 
vapoury mass, or " table-cloth," is level, and seemingly motion- 
less ; on the lee side, however, the thick volumes of vapour curl 
over and descend, but when they reach the point below, where 
greater density and higher temperature impart enlarged capacity 
for carrying water, they entirely disappear. 

Now if, instead of a hollow on the lee side of Table Mountain, 
we had an elevated heated plain, the clouds which curl over that 
side, and disappear as they do at present when a " south-easter " 
is blowing, might deposit some moisture on the windward ascent 
and top ; but the heat would then impart the increased capacity 
the air now receives at the lower level in its descent to leeward, 
and instead of an extended country with a flora of the Disa 
grandiflora, gladiolus, rushes, and lichens, which now appear on 
Table Mountain, we should have only the hardy vegetation of 
the Kalahari. 

Why there should be so much vegetation on the Kalahari may 
be explained by the geological formation of the country. There 
is a rim or fringe of ancient rocks round a great central valley, 
which, dipping inwards, form a basin, the bottom of which 
is composed of the oldest silurian rocks. This basin has been 
burst through and filled up in many parts by eruptive traps 
and breccias, which often bear in their substances angular frag- 
ments of the more ancient rocks, as shown in the fossils they 
contain. Now, though large areas have been so dislocated that 
but little trace of the original valley formation appears, it is 



Chap. Y. COLONIZATION OF INTERIOR DISTRICTS. 97 

highly probable that the basin shape prevails over large tracts of 
the country ; and as the strata on the slopes, where most of the 
rain falls, dip in towards the centre, they probably guide water 
beneath the plains but ill supplied with moisture from the clouds. 
The phenomenon of stagnant fountains becoming by a new and 
deeper outlet never-failing streams may be confirmatory of the 
view that water is conveyed from the sides of the country into the 
bottom of the central valley ; and it is not beyond the bounds of 
possibility that the wonderful river system in the north, which, if 
native information be correct, causes a considerable increase of 
water in the springs called Matlomagan-yana (the Links), extends 
its fertilising influence beneath the plains of the Kalahari. 

The peculiar formation of the country may explain why there 
is such a difference in the vegetation between the 20th and 30th 
parallels of latitude in South Africa and the same latitudes in 
Central Australia. The want of vegetation is as true of some parts 
too in the centre of South America as of Australia ; and the cause 
of the difference holds out a probability for the success of artesian 
wells in extensive tracts of Africa now unpeopled solely on account 
of the want of surface water. We may be allowed to speculate a 
little at least on the fact of much greater vegetation, which, from 
whatever source it comes, presents for South Africa prospects of 
future greatness which we cannot hope for in Central Australia. 
As the interior districts of the Cape colony are daily becoming of 
higher value, offering to honest industry a fan* remuneration for 
capital, and having a climate unequalled in salubrity for con- 
sumptive patients, I should unhesitatingly recommend any farmer 
at all afraid of that complaint in Ins family to try this colony. 
With the means of education already possessed, and the onward 
and upward movement of the Cape population, he need entertain 
no apprehensions of Ins family sinking into barbarism. 

The route we at tins time followed ran along the middle, or 
skirted the western zone before alluded to, until we reached the 
latitude of Lake Ngami, where a totally different country begins. 
While in the colony, we passed through districts inhabited by the 
descendants of Dutch and French refugees who had fled from 
religious persecution. Those living near the capital differ but 
little from the middle classes in English counties, and are dis- 
tinguished by public spirit and general intelligence ; while those 

H 



98 DUTCH AND FEENCH BOEES. Chap. V. 

situated far from the centres of civilization are less informed, 
but are a body of frugal, industrious, and hospitable peasantry. 
A most efficient system of public instruction was established in 
the time of Governor Sir George Napier, on a plan drawn up in 
a great measure by that accomplished philosopher, Sir John 
Herschel. The system had to contend with less sectarian rancour 
than elsewhere ; indeed, until quite recently, that spirit, except in 
a mild form, was unknown. 

The population here described ought not to be confounded with 
some Boers who fled from British rule on account of the emanci- 
pation of their Hottentot slaves, and perhaps never would have 
been so, had not every now and then some Bip Van Winkle 
started forth at the Cape to justify in the public prints the deeds 
of blood and slave-hunting in the far interior. It is therefore 
not to be wondered at if the whole race is confounded and held 
in low estimation by those who do not know the real composition 
of the Cape community. 

Population among the Boers increases rapidly; they marry 
soon, are seldom sterile, and continue to have children late. I once 
met a worthy matron, whose husband thought it right to imitate 
the conduct of Abraham while Sarah was barren ; she evidently 
agreed in the propriety of the measure, for she was pleased to 
hear the children by a mother of what has been thought an 
inferior race address her as then mother. Orphans are never 
allowed to remain long destitute ; and instances are frequent in 
which a tender-hearted farmer has adopted a fatherless child, and 
when it came of age has portioned it as his own. 

Two centuries of the South African climate have not had much 
effect upon the physical condition of the Boers. They are a 
shade darker, or rather ruddier, than Europeans, and are never 
cadaverous-looking, as descendants of Europeans are said to be 
elsewhere. There is a tendency to the development of steatopyga, 
so characteristic of Arabs and other African tribes; and it is 
probable that the interior Boers in another century will become 
in colour what the learned imagine our progenitors Adam and 
Eve to have been. 

The parts of the colony through which we passed were of 
sterile aspect ; and as the present winter had been preceded by a 
severe drought, many farmers had lost two-thirds of their stock. 



Chap. V. FAILURE OF GRASS — NEW PLANTS. 99 

The landscape was uninviting ; the hills, destitute of trees, were 
of a dark-brown colour, and the scanty vegetation on the plains 
made me feel that they deserved the name of Desert more than 
the Kalahari. When first taken possession of, these parts are 
said to have been covered with a coating of grass, but that has 
disappeared with the antelopes which fed upon it, and a crop of 
mesembryanthemums and crassulas occupies its place. It is curious 
to observe how, in nature, organizations the most dissimilar are 
mutually dependent on each other for their perpetuation. Here 
the original grasses were dependent for dissemination on the 
grass-feeding animals, which scattered the seeds. When, by the 
death of the antelopes, no fresh sowing was made, the African 
droughts proved too much for this form of vegetation. But even 
this contingency was foreseen by the Omniscient One ; for, as we 
may now observe in the Kalahari Desert, another family of plants, 
the mesembryanthemums, stood ready to neutralize the aridity 
which must otherwise have followed. This family of plants pos- 
sesses seed-vessels which remain firmly shut on their contents 
while the soil is hot and dry, and thus preserve the vegetative 
power intact during the highest heat of the torrid sun ; but when 
rain falls, the seed-vessel opens and sheds its contents just when 
there is the greatest probability of their vegetating. In other 
plants heat and drought cause the seed-vessels to burst, and shed 
then charge. 

One of this family is edible {Mesembryantliemum edule) ; another 
possesses a tuberous root, which may be eaten raw ; and all are 
furnished with thick fleshy leaves, having pores capable of im- 
bibing and retaining moisture from a very dry atmosphere and 
soil, so that, if a leaf is broken during a period of the greatest 
drought, it shows abundant circulating sap. The plants of this 
family are found much further north, but the great abundance 
of the grasses prevents them from making any show. There, 
however, they stand, ready to fill up any gap which may occur in 
the present prevailing vegetation; and should the grasses dis- 
appear, animal life would not necessarily be destroyed, because a 
reserve supply, equivalent to a fresh act of creative power, has 
been provided. \ 

One of this family, M. turbiniforme, is so coloured as to blend 
in well with the hue of the soil and stones around it ; and a 

H 2 



100 DESEKT VEGETATION. Chap. V. 

gryllus of the same colour feeds on it. In the case of the insect, 
the peculiar colour is given as compensation for the deficiency of 
the powers of motion to enable it to elude the notice of birds. The 
continuation of the species is here the end in view. In the case of 
the plant the same device is adopted for a sort of double end, viz. 
perpetuation of the plant by hiding it from animals with the view 
that ultimately its extensive appearance will sustain that race. 

As this new vegetation is better adapted for sheep and goats in 
a dry country than grass, the Boers supplant the latter by imi- 
tating the process by which gramnivorous antelopes have so 
abundantly disseminated the seed of grasses. A few waggon- 
loads of mesembryanthemum-plants, in seed, are brought to a 
farm covered with a scanty crop of coarse grass, and placed on a 
spot to which the sheep have access in the evenings. As they 
eat a little every night, the seeds are dropped over the grazing 
grounds, in this simple way, with a regularity which could not be 
matched except at the cost of an immense amount of labour. 
The place becomes in the course of a few years a sheep farm, as 
these animals thrive on such herbage. As already mentioned, 
some plants of this family are furnished with an additional con- 
trivance for withstanding droughts, viz. oblong tubers, which, 
buried deep enough beneath the soil for complete protection from 
the scorching sun, serve as reservoirs of sap and nutriment during 
those rainless periods which recur perpetually in even the most 
favoured spots of Africa. I have adverted to this peculiarity as 
often seen in the vegetation of the Desert ; and, though rather 
out of place, it may be well, — while noticing a clever imitation of 
one process in nature by the Cape farmers, — to suggest another 
for then consideration. The country beyond south lat. 18° 
abounds in three varieties of grape-bearing vines; and one of 
these is furnished with oblong tubers every three or four inches 
along the horizontal root. They resemble closely those of the 
asparagus. Tins increase of power to withstand the effects of 
climate might prove of value in the more arid parts of the Cape 
colony, grapes being well known to be an excellent restorative in 
the debility produced by heat; by engrafting, or by some of 
those curious manipulations which we read of in books on garden- 
ing, a variety might be secured better adapted to the country 
than the foreign vines at present cultivated. The Americans 



Chap. V. ANIMALS OF THE DESERT. 101 

find that some of their native vines yield wines superior to those 
made from the very best imported vines from France and Por- 
tugal. What a boon a vine of the sort contemplated would have 
been to a Rhenish missionary I met at a part in the west of the 
colony called Ebenezer, whose children had never seen flowers, 
though old enough to talk about them ! 

The slow pace at which we wound our way through the colony 
made almost any subject interesting. The attention is attracted 
to the names of different places, because they indicate the former 
existence of buffaloes, elands, and elephants, which are now to be 
found only hundreds of miles beyond. A few blesbucks (Antilope 
pygarga), gnus, bluebucks (A. cerulea), steinbucks, and the ostrich 
(jStruthio camelus), continue, like the Bushmen, to maintain a pre- 
carious existence when all the rest are gone. The elephant, the 
most sagacious, flees the sound of firearms first ; the gnu and os- 
trich, the most wary and the most stupid, last. The first emigrants 
found the Hottentots in possession of prodigious herds of fine 
cattle, but no horses, asses, or camels. The original cattle, winch 
may still be seen in some parts of the frontier, must have been 
brought south from the north-north-east, for from this point the 
natives universally ascribe their original migration. They brought 
cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs : why not the horse, the delight of 
savage hordes ? Horses thrive well in the Cape colony when im- 
ported. Naturalists point out certain mountain ranges as limiting 
the habitat of certain classes of animals ; but there is no Cordillera 
in Africa to answer that purpose, there being no visible barrier 
between the north-eastern Arabs and the Hottentot tribes to pre- 
vent the different hordes, as they felt their way southwards, from 
indulging their taste for the possession of this noble animal. 

I am here led to notice an invisible barrier, more insurmount- 
able than mountain ranges, but which is not opposed to the 
southern progress of cattle, goats, and sheep. The tsetse would 
prove a barrier only until its well-defined habitat was known, but the 
disease passing under the term of horse-sickness (peripneumonia) 
exists in such virulence over nearly seven degrees of latitude, that 
no precaution would be sufficient to save these animals. The 
horse is so liable to this disease, that only by great care in stabling 
can he be kept anywhere between 20° and 27° S. during the time 
between December and April. The winter, beginning in the 



102 HOKSE-SICKNESS. Chap. V. 

latter month, is the only period in winch Englishmen can hnnt 
on horseback, and they are in danger of losing all their stnds 
some months before December. To tins disease the horse is espe- 
cially exposed, and it is almost always fatal. One attack, however, 
seems to secure immunity from a second. Cattle, too, are subject 
to it, but only at intervals of a few, sometimes many, years ; but 
it never makes a clean sweep of the whole cattle of a village, as 
it would do of a troop of fifty horses. This barrier, then, seems to 
explain the absence of the horse among the Hottentots, though it is 
not opposed to the southern migration of cattle, sheep, and goats. 

When the flesh of animals that have died of this disease is 
eaten, it causes a malignant carbuncle ; which, when it appears 
over any important organ, proves rapidly fatal. It is more 
especially dangerous over the pit of the stomach. The effects of 
the poison have been experienced by missionaries who had eaten 
properly cooked food, the flesh of sheep really but not visibly 
affected by the disease. The virus in the flesh of the animal is de- 
stroyed neither by boiling nor roasting. Tins fact, of winch we have 
had innumerable examples, shows the superiority of experiments 
on a large scale to those of acute and able physiologists and 
chemists in the laboratory, for a well-known physician of Paris, 
after careful investigation, considered that the virus in such cases 
was completely neutralized by boiling. 

Tins disease attacks wild animals too. During our residence 
at Chonuane great numbers of tolos, or koodoos, were attracted 
to the gardens of the Bakwains, abandoned at the usual period 
of harvest because there was no prospect of the corn {Kolcus 
sorghum) bearing that year. The koodoo is remarkably fond of 
the green stalks of this kind of millet. Free feedmg produced 
that state of fatness favourable for the development of the disease, 
and no fewer than twenty-five died on the hill opposite our house. 
Great numbers of gnus and zebras perished from the same cause, 
but the mortality produced no sensible diminution in the numbers 
of the game, any more than the deaths of many of the Bakwains 
who persisted, in spite of every remonstrance, in eating the dead 
meat, caused any sensible decrease in the strength of the tribe. 

The farms of the Boers consist generally of a small patch of 
cultivated land in the midst of some miles of pasturage. They 
are thus less an agricultural than a pastoral people. Each farm 



Chap. V. THE BOEKS AS FARMERS. 103 

must have its fountain ; and where no such supply of water exists, 
the government lands are unsaleable. An acre in England is 
thus generally more valuable than a square mile in Africa. But 
the country is prosperous and capable of great improvement. 
The industry of the Boers augurs well for the future formation 
of dams and tanks, and for the greater fruitfulness that would 
certainly follow. 

As cattle and sheep farmers the colonists are very successful. 
Larger and larger quantities of wool are produced annually, and 
the value of colonial farms increases year by year. But the 
system requires that with the increase of the population there 
should be an extension of territory. Wide as the country is, and 
thinly inhabited, the farmers feel it to be too limited, and they 
are gradually spreading to the north. This movement proves 
prejudicial to the country behind, for labour, which would be 
directed to the improvement of the colony, is withdrawn and 
expended in a mode of life little adapted to the exercise of in- 
dustrial habits. That, however, does not much concern the rest of 
mankind. Nor does it seem much of an evil for men who culti- 
vate the soil to claim a right to appropriate lands for tillage which 
other men only hunt over, provided some compensation for the 
loss of sustenance be awarded. The original idea of a title seems 
to have been that " subduing " or cultivating gave that right. But 
this rather Chartist principle must be received with limitations ; 
for its recognition in England would lead to the seizure of all our 
broad ancestral acres by those who are willing to cultivate them. 
And, in the case under consideration, the encroachments lead at 
once to less land being put under the plough than is subjected to 
the native hoe, for it is a fact that the Basutos and Zulus, or 
Caffres of Natal, cultivate largely, and undersell our farmers 
wherever they have a fair field and no favour. 

Before we came to the Orange river we saw the last portion 
of a migration of springbucks {Gazetta euchore, or tsepe). They 
come from the great Kalahari Desert, and, when first seen after 
crossing the colonial boundary, are said often to exceed forty 
thousand in number. I cannot give an estimate of their 
numbers, for they appear spread over a vast expanse of country, 
and make a quivering motion as they feed and move and toss 
their graceful horns. They feed chiefly on grass ; and as they 



104 MIGRATION OF SPRINGBUCKS. Chap. V. 

come from the north about the time when the grass most abounds, 
it cannot be want of food that prompts the movement. Nor is it 
want of water, for this antelope is one of the most abstemious 
in that respect. Then nature prompts them to seek as their 
favourite haunts level plains with short grass, where they may 
be able to watch the approach of an enemy. The Bakalahari 
take advantage of this feeling, and burn off large patches of grass, 
not only to attract the game by the new crop when it comes up, 
but also to form bare spots for the springbuck to range over. 

It is not the springbuck alone that manifests this feeling. 
When oxen are taken into a country of high grass, they are 
much more ready to be startled ; their sense of danger is in- 
creased by the increased power of concealment afforded to an 
enemy by such cover, and they will often start off in terror at the 
ill-defined outlines of each other. The springbuck, possessing 
this feeling in an intense degree, and being eminently gregarious, 
becomes uneasy as the grass of the Kalahari becomes tall. The 
vegetation being more sparse in the more arid south, naturally 
induces the different herds to turn in that direction. As they 
advance and increase in numbers, the pasturage becomes more 
scarce ; it is still more so the further they go, until they are at 
last obliged, in order to obtain the means of subsistence, to cross 
the Orange river, and become the pest of the sheep-farmer in a 
country which contains scarcely any of their favourite grassy food. 
If they light on a field of wheat in their way, an army of locusts 
could not make a cleaner sweep of the whole than they will do. 
It is questionable whether they ever return, as they have never 
been seen as a returning body. Many perish from want of food, 
the country to which they have migrated being unable to support 
them ; the rest become scattered over the colony ; and in such a 
wide country there is no lack of room for all. It is probable that, 
notwithstanding the continual destruction by firearms, they will 
continue long to hold their place. 

On crossing the Orange river we come into independent ter- 
ritory inhabited by Griquas and Bechuanas. By Griquas is 
meant any mixed race sprung from natives and Europeans. 
Those in question were of Dutch extraction, through association 
with Hottentot and Bushwomen. Half-castes of the first genera- 
tion consider themselves superior to those of the second, and all 



Chap. V. THE GRIQUA CHIEF WATERBOER. 105 

possess in some degree the characteristics of both parents. They 
were governed for many years by an elected chief named Water- 
boer ; who, by treaty, received a small sum per annum from the 
Colonial Government for the support of schools in his country, 
and proved a most efficient guard of our north-west boundary. 
Cattle-stealing was totally unknown during the whole period of 
this able chief 's reign ; and he actually drove back, single-handed, 
a formidable force of marauding Mantatees that threatened to 
invade the colony.* But for that brave Christian man, Water- 
boer, there is every human probability that the north-west would 
have given the colonists as much trouble as the eastern frontier ; 
for large numbers among the original Griquas had as little scruple 
about robbing farmers of cattle as the CafTres are reputed to have. 
On the election of Waterboer to the chieftainship, he distinctly 
declared that no marauding should be allowed. As the govern- 
ment of none of these tribes is despotic, some of his principal men, 
in spite of this declaration, plundered some villages of Corannas 
riving to the south of the Orange river. He immediately seized 
six of the ringleaders, and, though the step put Ins own position 
in jeopardy, he summoned his council, tried, condemned, and 
publicly executed the whole six. This produced an insurrection, 
and the insurgents twice attacked his capital, Griqua Town, with 
the intention of deposing him ; but he bravely defeated both 
attempts, and from that day forth, during his long reign of thirty 
years, not a single plundering expedition ever left his territory. 
Having witnessed the deleterious effects of the introduction of 
ardent spirits among his people, he, with characteristic energy, 
decreed that any Boer or Griqua bringing brandy into the coun- 
try should have his property in ardent spirits confiscated and 
poured out on the ground. The Griqua chiefs living farther east 
were unable to carry this law into effect as he did, hence the 
greater f acuity with which Boers in that direction got the Griquas 
to part with their farms. 

Ten years after he was firmly established in power he entered 
into a treaty with the Colonial Government ; and, during the 
twenty years which followed, not a single charge was ever brought 
against either him or his people; on the contrary, his faithful

106 MEASURES OF COLONIAL GOVERNMENT. Chap. V. 

adherence to the stipulated provisions elicited numerous ex- 
pressions of approbation from successive governments. A late 
Governor, however, of whom it is impossible to speak without 
respect, in a paroxysm of generalship which might have been 
good, had it not been totally inappropriate to the case, set about 
conciliating a band of rebellious British subjects (Boers), who 
murdered the Hon. Captain Murray, by proclaiming their inde- 
pendence while still in open rebellion, and not only abrogated 
the treaty with the Griquas, but engaged to stop the long- 
accustomed supplies of gunpowder for the defence of the frontier, 
and even to prevent them from purchasing it for their own defence 
by lawful trade. 

If it had been necessary to prevent supplies of ammunition 
from finding their way into the country, as it probably was, one 
might imagine that the exception should not have been made in 
favour of either Boers or Canres, our openly avowed enemies ; 
but nevertheless the exception was made, and is still continued 
in favour of the Boers, while the Bechuanas and Griquas, our 
constant friends, are debarred from obtaining a single ounce for 
either defence or trade ; indeed, such was the state of ignorance as 
to the relation of the border tribes with the English, even at Cape 
Town, that the magistrates, though willing to aid my researches, 
were sorely afraid to allow me to purchase more than ten pounds 
of gunpowder, lest the Bechuanas should take it from me by force. 
As it turned out, I actually left more than that quantity for 
upwards of two years in an open box in my waggon at Linyanti. 

The lamented Sir George Cathcart, apparently unconscious of 
what he was doing, entered into a treaty with the Transvaal Boers, 
in winch articles were introduced for the free passage of English 
traders to the north, and for the entire prohibition of slavery in 
the free state. Then passed the " gunpowder ordinance," by which 
the Bechuanas, whom alone the Boers dare attempt to enslave, 
were rendered quite defenceless. The Boers never attempt to 
fight with Caffres, nor to settle in Caffreland. We still con- 
tinue to observe the treaty — the Boers never did, and never 
intended to abide by its provisions, for immediately on the 
proclamation of their independence a slave-hunt was undertaken 
against the Bechuanas of Sechele by four hundred Boers, under 
Mr. Peit Scholz, and the plan was adopted which had been die-

rished in their hearts ever since the emancipation of the Hottentots. 
Thus, from unfortunate ignorance of the country he had to govern, 
an able and sagacious governor adopted a policy proper and wise 
had it been in front of our enemies, but altogether inappropriate 
for our friends against whom it has been applied. Such an error 
could not have been committed by a man of local knowledge 
and experience, such as that noble of colonial birth, Sir Andries 
Stockenstrom ; and such instances of confounding friend and foe, 
in the innocent belief of thereby promoting colonial interests, will 
probably lead the Cape community, the chief part of which by no 
means feels its interest to He in the degradation of the native 
tribes, to assert the right of choosing their own governors. This, 
with colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament, in addi- 
tion to the local self-government already so liberally conceded, 
would undoubtedly secure the perpetual union of the colony to 
the English Crown. 

Many hundreds of both Griquas and Bechuanas have become 
Christians and partially civilized through the teaching of English 
missionaries. My first impressions of the progress made were, 
that the accounts of the effects of the Gospel among them had 
been too highly coloured. I expected a lngher degree of Christian 
simplicity and purity than exists either among them or among 
ourselves. I was not anxious for a deeper insight in detecting 
shams than others, but I expected character, such as we imagine 
the primitive disciples had — and was disappointed.* When, how- 
ever, I passed on to the true heathen in the countries beyond the 

* The popular notion, however, of the primitive church is perhaps not very 
accurate. Those societies especially which consisted of converted Gentiles — 
men who had been accustomed to the vices and immoralities of heathenism — 
were certainly anything but pure. In spite of their conversion, some of them 
carried the stains and vestiges of their former state with them when they 
passed from the temple to the church. If the instructed and civilised Greek 
did not all at once rise out of his former self, and understand and realise the 
high ideal of his new faith, we should be careful, in judging of the work of 
missionaries among savage tribes, not to apply to their converts tests and stand- 
ards of too great severity. If the scoffing Lucian's account of the impostor 
Peregrinus maybe believed, we find a church probably planted by the Apostles 
manifesting less intelligence even than modern missionary churches. Pere- 
grinus, a notoriously wicked man, was elected to the chief place among them, 
while Romish priests, backed by the power of France, could not find a place 
at all in the mission churches of Tahiti and Madagascar. 



108 DEESS OF THE NATIVES. Chap. V. 

sphere of missionary influence, and could compare the people 
there with the Christian natives, I came to the conclusion that, 
if the question were examined in the most rigidly severe or 
scientific way, the change effected by the missionary movement 
would be considered unquestionably great. 

We cannot fairly compare these poor people with ourselves, 
who have an atmosphere of Christianity and enlightened public 
opinion, the growth of centuries, around us, to influence our 
deportment ; but let any one from the natural and proper point 
of view behold the public morality of Griqua Town, Kuruman, 
Likatlong, and other villages, and remember what even London 
was a century ago, and he must confess that the Christian mode 
of treating aborigines is incomparably the best. 

The Griquas and Bechuanas were in former times clad much 
like the Caffres, if such a word may be used where there is 
scarcely any clothing at all. A bunch of leather strings about 
eighteen inches long hung from the lady's waist in front, and a 
prepared skin of a sheep or antelope covered the shoulders, 
leaving the breast and abdomen bare : the men wore a patch 
of skin, about the size of the crown of one's hat, which barely 
served for the purposes of decency, and a mantle exactly like 
that of the women. To assist in protecting the pores of the skin 
from the influence of the sun by day and of the cold by night, 
all smeared themselves with a mixture of fat and ochre ; the 
head was anointed with pounded blue mica schist mixed with fat ; 
and the fine particles of shining mica falling on the body and on 
strings of beads and brass rings were considered as highly orna- 
mental and fit for the most fastidious dandy. Now, these same 
people come to church in decent though poor clothing, and behave 
with a decorum certainly superior to what seems to have been 
the case in the time of Mr. Samuel Pepys in London. Sunday 
is well observed, and, even in localities where no missionary lives, 
religious meetings are regularly held, and children and adults 
taught to read, by the more advanced of their own fellow- 
countrymen ; and no one is allowed to make a profession of faith 
by baptism unless he knows how to read, and understands the 
nature of the Christian religion. 

The Bechuana Mission has been so far successful that, when 
coming from the interior, we always felt on reaching Kuruman 



Chap. V. AETICLES OF COMMEECE. 109 

that we had returned to civilized life. But I would not give 
any one to understand by this that they are model Christians 
— we cannot claim to be model Christians ourselves — or even in 
any degree superior to the members of our own country churches. 
They are more stingy and greedy than the poor at home ; but in 
many respects the two are exactly alike. On asking an intelligent 
chief what he thought of them, he replied, " You white men have 
no idea of how wicked we are ; we know each other better than 
you; some feign belief to ingratiate themselves with the mis- 
sionaries; some profess Christianity because they like the new 
system, which gives so much more importance to the poor, and 
desire that the old system may pass away ; and the rest — a pretty 
large number — j)rofess, because they are really true believers." 
This testimony may be considered as very nearly correct. 

There is not much prospect of this country ever producing 
much of the materials of commerce except wool. At present the 
chief articles of trade are karosses or mantles — the skins of which 
they are composed come from the Desert ; next to them ivory, 
the quantity of which cannot now be great, inasmuch as the 
means of shooting elephants is sedulously debarred entrance into 
the country. A few skins and horns, and some cattle, make up 
the remainder of the exports. English goods, sugar, tea, and 
coffee are the articles received in exchange. All the natives of 
these parts soon become remarkably fond of coffee. The acme 
of respectability among the Bechuanas is the possession of cattle 
and a waggon. It is remarkable that, though these latter require 
frequent repairs, none of the Bechuanas have ever learned to 
mend them. Forges and tools have been at their service, and 
teachers willing to aid them, but, beyond putting together a 
camp-stool, no effort has ever been made to acquire the know- 
ledge of the trades. They observe most carefully a missionary 
at work, until they understand whether a tire is well welded or 
not, and then pronounce upon its merits with great emphasis, but 
there their ambition rests satisfied. It is the same peculiarity 
among ourselves which leads us in other matters, such as book- 
making, to attain the excellence of fault-finding without the wit 
to indite a page. It was in vain I tried to indoctrinate the 
Bechuanas with the idea that criticism did not imply any supe- 
riority over the workman, or even equality with him.

The permanence of the station called Kuruman depends entirely 
on the fine ever-flowing fountain of that name. It comes from 
beneath the trap-rock, of winch I shall have to speak when de- 
scribing the geology of the entire country ; and as it usually issues 
at a temperature of 72° Fahr., it probably comes from the old 
Silurian schists, which formed the bottom of the great primaeval 
valley of the continent. I could not detect any diminution in the 
flow of this gushing fountain during my residence in the country ; 
but when Mr. Moffat first attempted a settlement here, thirty-five 
years ago, he made a dam six or seven miles below the present 
one, and led out the stream for irrigation, where not a drop of the 
fountain-water ever now flows. Other parts, fourteen miles below 
the Kuruman gardens, are pointed out as having contained, within 
the memory of people now living, hippopotami, and pools sufficient 
to drown both men and cattle. Tins failure of water must be 
chiefly ascribed to the general desiccation of the country, but 



Chap. VI. ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN WATEE. HI 

partly also to the amount of irrigation carried on along both banks 
of the stream at the mission station. Tins latter circumstance 
would have more weight, were it not coincident with the failure 
of fountains over a wide extent of country. 

Without at present entering minutely into this feature of the 
climate, it may be remarked that the Kuruman district presents 
evidence of this dry southern region having, at no very distant 
date, been as well watered as the country north of Lake Ngami is 
now. Ancient river-beds and water-courses abound, and the very 
eyes of fountains long since dried up may be seen, in which the 
flow of centuries has worn these orifices from a slit to an oval 
form, having on their sides the tufa so abundantly deposited 
from these primitive waters ; and just where the splashings, made 
when the stream fell on the rock below, may be supposed to have 
reached and become evaporated, the same phenomenon appears. 
Many of these failing fountains no longer flow, because the brink 
over which they ran is now too high, or because the elevation of 
the western side of the country lifts the land away from the water- 
supply below ; but let a cutting be made from a lower level than 
the brink, and through it to a part below the surface of the water, 
and water flows perennially. Several of these ancient fountains 
have been resuscitated by the Bechuanas near Kuruman, who 
occasionally show their feelings of self-esteem by labouring for 
months at deep cuttings, which, having once begun, they feel 
bound in honour to persevere in, though told by a missionary that 
they can never force water to run up hill. 

It is interesting to observe the industry of many Boers in this 
region, in making long and deep canals from lower levels up to 
spots destitute of the slightest indication of water existing beneath, 
except a few rushes and a peculiar kind of coarse reddish-coloured 
grass growing in a hollow, which anciently must have been the 
eye of a fountain, but is now filled up with soft tufa. In other 
instances the indication of water below consists of the rushes 
growing on a long sandy ridge a foot or two in height, instead of 
in a furrow. A deep transverse cutting made through the higher 
part of this is rewarded by a stream of running water. The reason 
why the ground covering this water is higher than the rest of the 
locality is, that the winds carry quantities of fine dust and sand 
about the country, and hedges, bushes, and trees cause its deposit. 



112 VEGETATION. Chap. VI. 

The rushes in this case perform the part of the hedges, and the 
moisture rising as dew by night fixes the sand securely among the 
roots, and a height instead of a hollow is the result. While on 
this subject it may be added, that there is no perennial fountain 
in tins part of the country, except those which come from beneath 
the quartzose trap, which constitutes the " filling up " of the 
ancient valley ; and as the water-supply seems to rest on the old 
silurian schists which form its bottom, it is highly probable that 
Artesian wells would in several places perform the part which 
these deep cuttings now do. 

The aspect of this part of the country during most of the year 
is of a light yellow colour ; for some months during the rainy 
season it is of a pleasant green mixed with yellow. Ranges of 
hills appear in the west, but east of them we find hundreds of 
miles of grass-covered plains. Large patches of these flats are 
covered with white calcareous tufa resting on perfectly horizontal 
strata of trap. There the vegetation consists of fine grass growing 
in tufts among low bushes of the " wait-a-bit " thorn (Acacia 
detinens), with its annoying fish-hook-like spines. Where these 
rocks do not appear on the surface, the soil consists of yellow sand 
and tall coarse grasses growing among berry-yielding bushes, 
named moretloa (Gfrewia jiava), and mohatla (Tarchonanthus), 
which has enough of aromatic resinous matter to burn brightly, 
though perfectly green. In more sheltered spots we come on 
clumps of the white-thorned mimosa (Acacia horrida, also A. 
atomiphylla), and great abundance of wild sage (Salvia Africana), 
and various leguminosse, ixias, and large-flowering bulbs: the 
Amaryllis toxicaria and A. Brunsvigia multiflora (the former a 
poisonous bulb) yield in the decayed lamellae a soft silky down, a 
good material for stuffing mattrasses. 

In some few parts of the country the remains of ancient forests 
of wild olive-trees ( Olea similis), and of the camel thorn (Acacia 
giraffe), are still to be met with ; but when these are levelled in 
the proximity of a Bechuana village no young trees spring up to 
take their places. This is not because the wood has a growth so 
slow as not to be appreciable in its increase during the short period 
that it can be observed by man, winch might be supposed from 
its being so excessively hard ; for having measured a young tree 
of this species growing in the corner of Mr. Moffat's garden near 



Chap. VI. VEGETABLE POISON. 113 

the water, I found that it increased at the rate of a quarter of an 
inch hi diameter annually during a number of years. Moreover 
the larger specimens, which now find few or no successors, if they 
had more rain in their youth, cannot be above two or three 
hundred years old. 

It is probable that tins is the tree of winch the Ark of the 
Covenant and the Tabernacle were constructed, as it is reported to 
be found where the Israelites were at the time these were made. 
It is an imperishable wood, while that usually pointed out as the 
" shittim " (or Acacia nilotica) soon decays and wants beauty. 

In association with it we always observe a curious plant, named 
ngotuane, which bears such a profusion of fine yellow strong- 
scented flowers as quite to perfume the air. Tins plant forms a 
remarkable exception to the general rule, that nearly all the plants 
in the dry parts of Africa are scentless or emit only a disagree- 
able odour. It, moreover, contains an active poison ; a French 
gentleman, having imbibed a mouthful or two of an infusion 
of its flowers as tea, found himself rendered nearly powerless. 
Vinegar has the peculiar property of rendering this poison per- 
fectly inert, whether in or out of the body. When mixed with 
vinegar, the poison may be drunk with safety, while, if only 
tasted by itself, it causes a burning sensation in the throat. 
This gentleman described the action of the vinegar, when he was 
nearly deprived of power by the poison imbibed, to have been as 
if electricity had run along his nerves as soon as he had taken a 
single glassful. The cure was instantaneous and complete. I 
had always to regret want of opportunity for investigating this 
remarkable and yet controllable agent on the nervous system. 
Its usual proximity to camel-thorn trees may be accounted for 
by the probability that the giraffe, which feeds on tins tree, may 
make use of the plant as a medicine. 

During the period of my visit at Kuruman, Mr. Moffat, who 
has been a missionary in Africa during upwards of forty years, 
and is well known by his interesting work, * Scenes and Labours 
in South Africa,' was busily engaged in carrying through the press, 
with winch his station is furnished, the Bible in the language of the 
Bechuanas, which is called Sichuana. This has been a work of 
immense labour ; and as he was the first to reduce their speech to a 
written form, and has had his attention directed to the study for 

I 



114 THE BECHUANA LANGUAGE. Chap. VI. 

at least thirty years, he may be supposed to be better adapted 
for the task than any man living. Some idea of the copiousness 
of the language may be formed from the fact that even he never 
spends a week at his work without discovering new words ; the 
phenomenon, therefore, of any man who, after a few months' or 
years' study of a native tongue, cackles forth a torrent of vocables 
may well be wondered at, if it is meant to convey instruction. In 
my own case, though I have had as much intercourse with the 
purest idiom as most Englishmen, and have studied the language 
carefully, yet I can never utter an important statement without 
doing so very slowly, and repeating it too, lest the foreign accent, 
which is distinctly perceptible in all Europeans, should render 
the sense unintelligible. In tins I follow the example of the 
Bechuana orators, who, on important matters, always speak 
slowly, deliberately, and with reiteration. The capabilities of 
this language may be inferred from the fact that the Pentateuch 
is fully expressed in Mr. Moffat's translation in fewer words than 
in the Greek Septuagint, and in a very considerably smaller 
number than in our own English version. The language is how- 
ever so simple in its construction, that its copiousness by no means 
requires the explanation that the people have fallen from a 
former state of civilisation and culture. Language seems to be 
an attribute of the human mind and thought ; and the inflections, 
various as they are in the most barbarous tongues, as that of the 
Bushmen, are probably only proofs of the race being human, and 
endowed with the power of thinking ; the fuller development of 
language taking place as the improvement of our other faculties 
goes on. It is fortunate that the translation of the Bible has been 
effected before the language became adulterated with half-uttered 
foreign words, and while those who have heard the eloquence of 
the native assemblies are still living; for the young, who are 
brought up in our schools, know less of the language than the 
missionaries ; and Europeans born in the country, while possessed 
of the idiom perfectly, if not otherwise educated, cannot be referred 
to for explanation of any uncommon word. A person who acted 
as interpreter to Sir George Cathcart actually told his Excel- 
lency that the language of the Basutos was not capable of ex- 
pressing the substance of a chief's diplomatic paper, while every 
one acquainted with Moshesh, the chief who sent it, well knows 



Chap. VI. TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE. 115 

that he could in his own tongue have expressed it without study 
all over again in three or four different ways. The interpreter 
could scarcely have done as much in English. 

Tins language both rich and poor speak correctly ; there is no 
vulgar style ; but children have a patois of their own, using many 
words in their play which men would scorn to repeat. The 
Bamapela have adopted a click into their dialect, and a large 
infusion of the ringing n, which seems to have been for the pur- 
pose of preventing others from understanding them. 

The fact of the complete translation of the Bible at a station 
seven hundred miles inland from the Cape naturally suggests the 
question, whether it is likely to be permanently useful, and 
whether Christianity, as planted by modern missions, is likely to 
retain its vitality without constant supplies of foreign teaching? 
It would certainly be no cause for congratulation if the Bechuana 
Bible seemed at all likely to meet the fate of Elliot's Choctaw 
version, a specimen of which may be seen in the library of one 
of the American colleges — as God's word in a language which no 
living tongue can articulate, nor living mortal understand ; but 
a better destiny seems in store for this, for the Sichuana lan- 
guage has been introduced into the new country beyond Lake 
Ngami. There it is the court language, and will take a stranger 
anywhere through a district larger than France. The Bechuanas, 
moreover, in all probability possess that imperishability winch 
forms so remarkable a feature in the entire African race. 

When converts are made from heathenism by modern mission- 
aries, it becomes an interesting question whether their faith 
possesses the elements of permanence, or is only an exotic too 
tender for self-propagation when the fostering care of the foreign 
cultivators is withdrawn. If neither habits of self-reliance are 
cultivated, nor opportunities given for the exercise of that virtue, 
the most promising converts are apt to become like spoiled 
children. In Madagascar a few Christians were left with nothing 
but the Bible in their hands ; and though exposed to persecution, 
and even death itself, as the penalty of adherence to their profes- 
sion, they increased tenfold in numbers, and are, if possible, more 
decided believers now than they were when, by an edict of the 
queen of that island, the missionaries ceased their teaching. 
In South Africa such an experiment could not be made, for 

i 2 



116 TRUE DUTY OF MISSIONARIES. Chap. VI. 

such a variety of Christian sects have followed the footsteps of the 
London Missionary Society's successful career, that converts of 
one denomination, if left to their own resources, are eagerly 
adopted by another ; and are thus more likely to become spoiled 
than trained to the manly Christian virtues. 

Another element of weakness in tins part of the missionary 
field is the fact of the Missionary Societies considering the Cape 
Colony itself as a proper sphere for their peculiar operations. In 
addition to a well-organised and efficient Dutch Reformed Estab- 
lished Church, and schools for secular instruction, maintained 
by Government, in every village of any extent in the colony, we 
have a number of other sects, as the Wesleyans, Episcopalians, 
Moravians, all piously labouring at the same good work. Now, 
it is deeply to be regretted that so much honest zeal should be so 
lavishly expended in a district wherein there is so little scope for 
success. When we hear an agent of one sect urging Ins friends 
at home to aid him quickly to occupy some unimportant nook, 
because, if it is not speedily laid hold of, he will " not have room 
for the sole of his foot," one cannot help longing that both he and 
his friends would direct their noble aspirations to the millions of 
untaught heathen in the regions beyond, and no longer continue 
to convert the extremity of the continent into, as it were, a dam 
of benevolence. 

I would earnestly recommend all young missionaries to go at 
once to the real heathen, and never to be content with what has 
been made ready to their hands by men of greater enterprise. 
The idea of making model Christians of the young need not be 
entertained by any one who is secretly convinced, as most men 
who know their own hearts are, that he is not a model Christian 
himself. The Israelitish slaves brought out of Egypt by Moses 
were not converted and elevated in one generation, though under 
the direct teaching of God himself. Notwithstanding the numbers 
of miracles he wrought, a generation had to be cut off because of 
unbelief. Our own elevation also has been the work of centuries, 
and, remembering this, we should not indulge in overwrought ex- 
pectations as to the elevation, which those who have inherited the 
degradation of ages, may attain in our day. The principle might 
even be adopted by Missionary Societies, that one ordinary mission- 
ary's lifetime of teaching should be considered an ample supply of 



Ch.VI. modern missions and peimitive monasteries. 117 

foreign teaching for any tribe in a thinly peopled country, for 
some never will receive the Gospel at all, while in other parts, 
when Christianity is once planted, the work is sure to go 
on. A missionary is soon known to be supported by his friends 
at home ; and though the salary is but a bare subsistence, to 
Africans it seems an enormous sum ; and being unable to appre- 
ciate the motives by which he is actuated, they consider them- 
selves entitled to various services at Ins hands, and defrauded 
if these are not duly rendered. Tins feeling is all the stronger 
when a young man, instead of going boldly to the real heathen, 
settles down in a comfortable house and garden prepared by those 
nto whose labours he has entered. A remedy for this evil 
might, be found in appropriating the houses and gardens raised 
by the missionaries' hands to their own families. It is ridiculous 
to call such places as Kuruman, for instance, " Missionary 
Society's property." This beautiful station was made what it is, 
not by English money, but by the sweat and toil of fathers whose 
children have, notwithstanding, no place on earth which they 
can call a home. The Society's operations may be transferred 
to the north, and then the strong-built mission premises be- 
come the home of a Boer, and the stately stone church his 
cattle-pen. This place has been what the monasteries of Europe 
are said to have been when pure. The monks did not disdain to 
hold the plough. They introduced fruit-trees, flowers, and vege- 
tables, in addition to teaching and emancipating the serfs. Their 
monasteries were mission stations, winch resembled ours in being 
dispensaries for the sick, almshouses for the poor, and nurseries of 
learning. Can we learn nothing from them in their prosperity as 
the schools of Europe, and see nought in then history but the 
pollution and laziness of their decay ? Can our wise men tell us 
why the former mission stations (primitive monasteries) were self- 
supporting, rich, and flourishing as pioneers of civilization and 
agriculture from winch we even now reap benefits, and modern 
mission stations are mere jmuper establishments without that per- 
manence or ability to be self-supporting which they possessed ? 

Protestant missionaries of every denomination in South Africa 
all agree in one point, that no mere profession of Christianity is 
sufficient to entitle the converts to the Christian name. They 
are all anxious to place the Bible in the hands of the natives, and, 



118 ATTACK OF BOERS ON BAKWAINS. Chap. VI. 

with ability to read that, there can be little doubt as to the future. 
We believe Christianity to be divine, and equal to all it has to 
perform ; then let the good seed be widely sown, and, no matter 
to what sect the converts may belong, the harvest will be glorious. 
Let nothing that I have said be interpreted as indicative of 
feelings inimical to any body of Christians, for I never as a mis- 
sionary felt myself to be either Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or 
Independent, or called upon in any way to love one denomination 
less than another. My earnest desire is, that those who really 
have the best interests of the heathen at heart should go to them ; 
and assuredly, in Africa at least, self-denying labours among real 
heathen will not fail to be appreciated. Christians have never 
yet dealt fairly by the heathen and been disappointed. 

When Sechele understood that we could no longer remain with 
him at Kolobeng, he sent his children to Mr. Moffat, at Kuruman, 
for instruction in all the knowledge of the white men. Mr. 
Moffat very liberally received at once an accession of five to his 
family, with their attendants. 

Having been detained at Kuruman about a fortnight by the 
breaking of a waggon-wheel, I was thus providentially prevented 
from being present at the attack of the Boers on the Bakwains, news 
of which was brought, about the end of that time, by Masebele, the 
wife of Sechele. She had herself been hidden in a cleft of a rock, 
over which a number of Boers were firing. Her infant began to cry, 
and, terrified lest this should attract the attention of the men, the 
muzzles of whose guns appeared at every discharge over her head, 
she took off her armlets as playthings to quiet the child. She 
brought Mr. Moffat a letter, which tells its own tale ; nearly 
literally translated it was as follows : — 

" Friend of my heart's love, and of all the confidence of my 
heart, I am Sechele ; I am undone by the Boers, who attacked 
me, though I had no guilt with them. They demanded that I 
should be in their kingdom, and I refused ; they demanded that 
I should prevent the English and Griquas from passing (north- 
wards). I replied, These are my friends, and I can prevent no 
one (of them). They came on Saturday, and I besought them 
not to fight on Sunday, and they assented. They began on 
Monday morning at twilight, and fired with all then might, and 



Chap. VI. SECHELE'S LETTER. 119 

burned the town with fire, and scattered us. They killed sixty 
of my people, and captured women, and children, and men. 
And the mother of Baleriling (a former wife of Sechele) they also 
took prisoner. They took all the cattle and all the goods of the 
Bakwains ; and the house of Livingstone they plundered, taking 
away all his goods. The number of waggons they had was eighty- 
five, and a cannon ; and after they had stolen my own waggon 
and that of Macabe, then the number of their waggons (counting 
the cannon as one) was eighty-eight. All the goods of the hunters 
(certain English gentlemen hunting and exploring in the north) 
were burned in the town ; and of the Boers were killed twenty- 
eight. Yes, my beloved friend, now my wife goes to see the 
children, and Kobus Hae will convey her to you. 

" I am, Sechele, 

" The Son of Mochoasele." 

This statement is in exact accordance with the account given 
by the native teacher Mebalwe, and also that sent by some of the 
Boers themselves to the public colonial papers. The crime of 
cattle-stealing, of which we hear so much near Caffreland, was 
never alleged against these people, and, if a single case had 
occurred when I was in the country, I must have heard of it, and 
would at once say so. But the only crime imputed in the papers 
was that " Sechele was getting too saucy." The demand made 
for his subjection and service in preventing the English traders 
passing to the north was kept out of view. 

Very soon after Pretorius had sent the marauding party 
against Kolobeng, he was called away to the tribunal of infinite 
justice. His policy is justified by the Boers generally from the 
instructions given to the Jewish warriors in Deuteronomy xx. 10-14. 
Hence, when he died, the obituary notice ended with " Blessed 
are the dead who die in the Lord." I wish he had not "for- 
bidden us to preach unto the Gentiles that they may be saved." 

The report of this outrage on the Bakwains, coupled with 
denunciations against myself for having, as it was alleged, taught 
them to kill Boers, produced such a panic in the country, that I 
could not engage a single servant to accompany me to the north. 
I have already alluded to then mode of warfare, and in all 
previous Boerish forays the killing had all been on one side ; now, 



120 A PANIC. Chap. VI. 

however, that a tribe where an Englishman had lived had begun 
to shed their blood as well, it was considered the strongest 
presumptive evidence against me. Loud vows of vengeance 
were uttered against my head, and threats of instant pursuit 
by a large party on horseback, should I dare to go into or 
beyond their country; and as these were coupled with the 
declaration that the English Government had given over the 
whole of the native tribes to their rule, and would assist in their 
entire subjection by preventing fire-arms and ammunition from 
entering the country, except for the use of the Boers, it was not 
to be wondered at that I was detained for months at Kuruman 
from sheer inability to get w T aggon-drivers. The English name, 
from being honoured and respected all over the country, had 
become somewhat more than suspected; and as the policy of 
depriving these friendly tribes of the means of defence was 
represented by the Boers as proof positive of the wish of the 
English that they should be subjugated, the conduct of a govern- 
ment which these tribes always thought the paragon of justice 
and friendship was rendered totally incomprehensible to them ; 
they could neither defend themselves against their enemies, nor 
shoot the animals in the produce of which we wished them to 
trade. 

At last I found three servants veiling to risk a journey to the 
north ; and a man of colour, named George Fleming, who had 
generously been assisted by Mr. H. E. Rutherford, a mercantile 
gentleman of Cape Town, to endeavour to establish a trade with 
the Makololo, had also managed to get a similar number ; we 
accordingly left Kuruman on the 20th November, and proceeded 
on our journey. Our servants were the worst possible specimens 
of those who imbibe the vices without the virtues of Europeans, 
but we had no choice, and were glad to get away on any terms. 

When we reached Motito, forty miles off, we met Sechele, on 
his way, as he said, " to the Queen of England." Two of his own 
children, and their mother, a former wife, were among the captives 
seized by the Boers ; and being strongly embued with the then 
very prevalent notion of England's justice and generosity, he 
thought that in consequence of the violated treaty he had a fair 
case to lay before Her Majesty. He employed all his eloquence 
and powers of persuasion to induce me to accompany him, but I 



Ch. VI. SECHELE'S INTENDED JOURNEY TO ENGLAND. 121 

excused myself on the ground that my arrangements were already 
made for exploring the north. On explaining the difficulties of 
the way, and endeavouring to dissuade him from the attempt, on 
account of the knowledge I possessed of the governor's policy, he 
put the pointed question, " Will the Queen not listen to me, sup- 
posing I should reach her ? " I replied, " I believe she would 
listen, but the difficulty is to get to her." " Well, I shall reach 
her," expressed his final determination. Others explained the 
difficulties more fully, but nothing could shake his resolution. 
When he reached Bloemfontein he found the English army just 
returning from a battle with the Basutos, in winch both parties 
claimed the victory, and both were glad that a second engage- 
ment was not tried. Our officers invited Sechele to dine with 
them, heard his story, and collected a handsome sum of money 
to enable him to pursue his journey to England. The com- 
mander refrained from noticing him, as a single word in favour 
of the restoration of the children of Sechele would have been a 
virtual confession of the failure of this own policy at the very 
outset. Sechele proceeded as far as the Cape ; but his resources 
being there expended, he was obliged to return to his own country, 
one thousand miles distant, without accomplishing the object of 
his journey. 

On his return he adopted a mode of punishment which he had 
seen in the colony, namely, making criminals work on the public 
roads. And he has since, I am informed, made himself the 
missionary to his own people. He is tall, rather corpulent, and 
has more of the negro feature than common, but has large eyes. 
He is very dark ; and his people swear by " Black Sechele." He 
has great intelligence, reads well, and is a fluent speaker. Great 
numbers of the tribes, formerly living under the Boers, have 
taken refuge under his sway, and he is now greater in power 
than he was before the attack on Kolobeng. 

Having parted with Sechele, we skirted along the Kalahari 
Desert, and sometimes within its borders, giving the Boers a wide 
berth, A larger fall of rain than usual had occurred in 1852, 
and that was the completion of a cycle of eleven or twelve years, 
at which the same phenomenon is reported to have happened 
on three occasions. An unusually large crop of melons had 
appeared in consequence. We had the pleasure of meeting with 



122 MEETING WITH MR. MACABE. Chap. VI. 

Mr. J. Macabe returning from Lake Nganii, which he had 
succeeded in reaching by going right across the Desert from a 
point a little to the south of Kolobeng. The accounts of the 
abundance of water-melons were amply confirmed by this 
energetic traveller, for having these in vast quantities his cattle 
subsisted on the fluid contained in them for a period of no less 
than twenty-one days ; and when at last they reached a supply of 
water they did not seem to care much about it. Coming to the 
lake from the south-east, he crossed the Teoughe, and went 
round the northern part of it, and is the only European traveller 
who had actually seen it all. His estimate of the extent of the 
lake is higher than that given by Mr. Oswell and myself, or 
from about ninety to one hundred miles in circumference. 
Before the lake was discovered Macabe wrote a letter in one 
of the Cape papers recommending a certain route as likely to 
lead to it. The Transvaal Boers fined him 500 dollars for writing 
about " ouze felt," our country, and imprisoned Mm too till the 
fine was paid. I now learned from his own lips that the public 
report of this is true. Mr. Macabe's companion, Mahar, was mis- 
taken by a tribe of Barolongs for a Boer, and shot as he approached 
their village. When Macabe came up and explained that he was 
an Englishman, they expressed the utmost regret, and helped to 
bury him. This was the first case in recent times of an English- 
man being slain by the Bechuanas. We afterwards heard that 
there had been some fighting between these Barolongs and the 
Boers, and that there had been capturing of cattle on both sides. 
If this was true, I can only say that it was the first time that I 
ever heard of cattle being taken by Bechuanas. This was a 
Caffre war in stage the second ; the third stage in the develop- 
ment is when both sides are equally well armed and afraid of each 
other ; the fourth, when the English take up a quarrel not then 
own, and the Boers slip out of the fray. 

Two other English gentlemen crossed and recrossed the Desert 
about the same time, and nearly in the same direction. On 
returning, one of them, Captain Shelley, while riding forward on 
horseback, lost liimself, and was obliged to find his way alone 
to Kuruman, some hundreds of miles distant. Beaching that 
station shirtless, and as brown as a Griqua, he was taken for one 
by Mrs. Moffat, and was received by her with a salutation in 



Chap. VI. HOT WIND— ELECTRICITY. 123 

Dutch, that being the language spoken by this people. His 
sufferings must have been far more severe than any we endured. 
The result of the exertions of both Shelley and Macabe is to 
prove that the general view of the Desert always given by the 
natives has been substantially correct. 

Occasionally, during the very dry seasons which succeed our 
winter and precede our rains, a hot wind blows over the Desert 
from north to south. It feels somewhat as if it came from an oven, 
and seldom blows longer at a time than three days. It resembles 
in its effects the harmattan of the north of Africa, and at the 
time the missionaries first settled in the country, thirty-five years 
ago, it came loaded with fine reddish-coloured sand. Though no 
longer accompanied by sand, it is so devoid of moisture as to 
cause the wood of the best seasoned English boxes and furniture 
to shrink so that every wooden article not made in the country 
is warped. The verls of ramrods made in England are loosened, 
and on returning to Europe fasten again. This wind is in such 
an electric state that a bunch of ostrich-feathers held a few 
seconds against it becomes as strongly charged as if attached to 
a powerful electrical machine, and clasps the advancing hand 
with a sharp crackling sound. 

When this hot- wind is blowing, and even at other times, the 
peculiarly strong electrical state of the atmosphere causes the 
movement of a native in his kaross to produce therein a stream 
of small sparks. The first time I noticed this appearance was 
while a chief was travelling with me in my waggon. Seeing part 
of the fur of his mantle, which was exposed to slight friction by 
the movement of the waggon, assume quite a luminous appear- 
ance, I rubbed it smartly with the hand, and found it readily 
gave out bright sparks, accompanied with distinct cracks. " Don't 
you see this ? " said I. " The white men did not show us this," 
he replied; we had it long before white men came into the 
country, we and our forefathers of old." Unfortunately I never 
inquired the name which they gave to this appearance, but I 
have no doubt there is one for it in the language. Otto von 
Guerrike is said, by Baron Humboldt, to have been the first that 
ever observed this effect in Europe, but the phenomenon had been 
familiar to the Bechuanas for ages. Nothing came of that how- 
ever, for they viewed the sight as if with the eyes of an ox. The 



124 FLOCKS OF SWIFTS-SACKED CAVE. Chap. VI. 

human mind has remained here as stagnant to the present day, 
in reference to the physical operations of the universe, as it once 
did in England. No science has been developed, and few ques- 
tions are ever discussed except those which have an intimate 
connexion with the wants of the stomach. 

Very large flocks of swifts ( Cypselus apis) were observed flying 
over the plains north of Kuruman. I counted a stream of them, 
which, by the time it took to pass towards the reeds of that valley, 
must have numbered upwards of four thousand. Only a few of 
these birds breed at any time in this country. I have often ob- 
served them, and noticed that there was no appearance of their 
having paired ; there was no chasing of each other, nor any play- 
ing together. There are several other birds which continue in 
flocks, and move about like wandering gipsies, even during the 
breeding season, which in this country happens in the intervals 
between the cold and hot seasons, cold acting somewhat in the 
same way here as the genial warmth of spring does in Europe. 
Are these the migratory birds of Europe, which return there to 
breed and rear their young ? 

On the 31st December, 1852, we reached the town of Sechele, 
called, from the part of the range on winch it is situated, Litu- 
baruba. Near the village there exists a cave named Lepelole ; 
it is an interesting evidence of the former existence of a gushing 
fountain. No one dared to enter the Lohaheng, or cave, for it 
was the common belief that it was the habitation of the Deity. 
As we never had a holiday from January to December, and our 
Sundays were the periods of our greatest exertions in teaching, 
I projected an excursion into the cave on a week-day to see the 
god of the Bakwains. The old men said that every one who 
went in remained there for ever, addmg, " If the teacher is so 
mad as to kill himself, let him do so alone, we shall not be to 
blame." The declaration of Sechele, that he would follow where 
I led, produced the greatest consternation. It is curious that in 
all their pretended dreams or visions of then god he has always 
a crooked leg, like the Egyptian Thau. Supposing that those 
who were reported to have perished in this cave had fallen over 
some precipice, we went well provided with lights, ladder, lines, 
&c. ; but it turned out to be only an open cave, with an entrance 
about ten feet square, which contracts into two water-worn 



Chap. VI. RETALIATION ON BOERS. 125 

branches, ending in round orifices through which the water once 
flowed. The only inhabitants it seems ever to have had were 
baboons. I left at the end of the upper branch one of Father 
Mathew's leaden teetotal tickets. 

I never saw the Bakwains looking so haggard and lean as at 
this time. Most of their cattle had been swept away by the Boers, 
together with about eighty fine draught-oxen ; and much provision 
left with them by two officers, Captains Codrington and Webb, to 
serve for their return journey south, had been carried off also. 
On their return these officers found the skeletons of the Bakwains 
where they expected to find their own goods. All the corn, 
clothing, and furniture of the people too had been consumed in 
the flames winch the Boers had forced the subject tribes to apply 
to the town during the fight, so that its inhabitants were now 
literally starving. 

Sechele had given orders to his people not to commit any act 
of revenge pending his visit to the Queen of England ; but some 
of the young men ventured to go to meet a party of Boers re- 
turning from hunting, and, as the Boers became terrified and ran 
off, they brought their waggons to Litubaruba. Tins seems to 
have given the main body of Boers an idea that the Bakwains 
meant to begin a guerilla war upon them. This " Caffre war " 
was, however, only in embryo, and not near that stage of deve- 
lopment in which the natives have found out that the hide-and- 
seek system is the most successful. 

The Boers, in alarm, sent four of their number to ask for peace ! 
I, being present, heard the condition : " Sechele's children must 
be restored to him." I never saw men so completely and uncon- 
sciously in a trap as these four Boers were. Strong parties of 
armed Bakwains occupied every pass in the hills and gorges 
around ; and had they not promised much more than they in- 
tended, or did perform, that day would have been their last. 
The commandant Scholz had appropriated the children of Sechele 
to be his own domestic slaves. I was present when one little boy, 
Khari, son of Sechele, was returned to his mother ; the child had 
been allowed to roll into the fire, and there were three large un- 
bound open sores on different parts of his body. His mother and 
the women received him with a flood of silent tears. 

Slavery is said to be mild and tender-hearted in some places. 



126 LOVE OF CHILDREN. Chap. VI. 

The Boers assert that they are the best of masters, and that, if the 
English had possessed the Hottentot slaves, they would have 
received much worse treatment than they did : what that would 
have been it is difficult to imagine. I took down the names of 
some scores of boys and girls, many of whom I knew as our 
scholars ; but I could not comfort the weeping mothers by any 
hope of their ever returning from slavery. 

The Bechuanas are universally much attached to children. A 
little child toddling near a party of men while they are eating is 
sure to get a handful of the food. This love of children may arise, 
in a great measure, from the patriarchal system under which they 
dwell. Every little stranger forms an increase of property to 
the whole community, and is duly reported to the chief — boys 
being more welcome than girls. The parents take the name of 
the child, and often address their children as Ma (mother), or Ba 
(father). Our eldest boy being named Bobert, Mrs. Livingstone 
was, after Ins birth, always addressed as Ma-Bobert, instead of 
Mary, her Christian name. 

I have examined several cases in which a grandmother has taken 
upon herself to suckle a grandchild. Masina of Kuruman had no 
children after the birth of her daughter Sina, and had no milk 
after Sina was weaned, an event which usually is deferred till the 
child is two or three years old. Sina married when she was seven- 
teen or eighteen, and had twins ; Masina, after at least fifteen 
years' interval since she last suckled a child, took possession of one 
of them, applied it to her breast, and milk flowed, so that she 
was able to nurse the child entirely. Masina was at this time at 
least forty years of age. I have witnessed several other cases 
analogous to this. A grandmother of forty, or even less, for 
they become withered at an early age, when left at home with a 
young child, applies it to her own shrivelled breast, and milk soon 
follows. In some cases, as that of Ma-bogosing, the chief wife of 
Manure, who was about thirty-five years of age, the child was not 
entirely dependent on the grandmother's breast, as the mother 
suckled it too. I had witnessed the production of milk so frequently 
by the simple application of the lips of the child, that I was not 
therefore surprised when told by the Portuguese in Eastern Africa 
of a native doctor who, by applying a poultice of the pounded 
larva) of hornets to the breast of a woman, aided by the attempts 



Cii. VI. PHENOMENON IN THE NURTUEE OF CHILDREN. 127 

of the child, could bring back the milk. Is it not possible that the 
story in the ' Cloud of Witnesses,' of a man during the time of 
persecution in Scotland putting his child to his own breast, and 
finding, to the astonishment of the whole country, that milk fol- 
lowed the act, may have been literally true? It was regarded 
and is quoted as a miracle ; but the feelings of the father towards 
the child of a murdered mother must have been as nearly as pos- 
sible analogous to the maternal feeling ; and, as anatomists declare 
the structure of both male and female breasts to be identical, there 
is nothing physically impossible in the alleged result. The illus- 
trious Baron Humboldt quotes an instance of the male breast 
yielding milk ; and though I am not conscious of being over credu- 
lous, the strange instances I have examined in the opposite sex make 
me believe that there is no error in that philosopher's statement. 

The Boers know from experience that adult captives may as 
well be left alone, for escape is so easy in a wild country that no 
fugitive slave-law can come into operation ; they therefore adopt 
the system of seizing only the youngest children, in order that these 
may forget their parents and remain in perpetual bondage. I have 
seen mere infants in their houses repeatedly : this fact was for- 
merly denied ; and the only thing which was wanting to make 
the previous denial of the practice of slavery and slave-hunting by 
the Transvaal Boers no longer necessary was the declaration of 
then* independence. 

In conversation with some of my friends here I learned that 
Maleke, a chief of the Bakwains, who formerly lived on the hill 
Litubaruba, had been killed by the bite of a mad dog. My curiosity 
was strongly excited by this statement, as rabies is so rare in this 
country. I never heard of another case, and could not satisfy 
myself that even this was real hydrophobia. While I was at 
Mabotsa some dogs became affected by a disease winch led them 
to run about in an incoherent state ; but I doubt whether it was 
anything but an affection of the brain. No individual or animal 
got the complaint by inoculation from the animals' teeth; and 
from all that I could hear, the prevailing idea of hydrophobia not 
existing within the tropics seems to be quite correct. 

The diseases known among the Bakwains are remarkably few. 
There is no consumption nor scrofula, and insanity and hydro- 
cephalus are rare. Cancer and cholera are quite unknown. 



128 DISEASES. Chap. VI. 

Small-pox and measles passed through the country about twenty 
years ago and committed great ravages ; but, though the former 
has since broken out on the coast repeatedly, neither disease has 
since travelled inland. For small-pox the natives employed in 
some parts inoculation in the forehead with some animal deposit ; 
in other parts they employed the matter of the small-pox itself ; 
and in one village they seem to have selected a virulent case for 
the matter used in the operation, for nearly all the village was 
swept off by the disease in a malignant confluent form. Where 
the idea came from I camiot conceive. It was practised by the 
Bakwains at a time when they had no intercouse, direct or indi- 
rect, with the southern missionaries. They all adopt readily the 
use of vaccine virus when it is brought within their reach. 

A certain loathsome disease winch decimates the North Ame- 
rican Indians, and threatens extirpation to the South Sea islanders, 
dies out in the interior of Africa without the aid of medicine. 
And the Bangwaketse, who brought it from the west coast, lost it 
when they came into their own land south-west of Kolobeng. It 
seems incapable of permanence in any form in persons of pure 
African blood anywhere hi the centre of the country. In persons 
of mixed blood it is otherwise ; and the virulence of the secondary 
symptoms seemed to be, in all the cases that came under my 
care, in exact proportion to the greater or less amount of Euro- 
pean blood in the patient. Among the Corannas and Griquas of 
mixed breed it produces the same ravages as in Europe ; among 
half-blood Portuguese it is equally frightful in its inroads on the 
system ; but in the pure Negro of the central parts it is quite 
incapable of permanence. Among the Barotse I found a disease 
called manassah, which closely resembles that of the foeda mulier 
of history. 

Equally unknown is stone in the bladder and gravel. I never 
met with a case, though the waters are often so strongly impreg- 
nated with sulphate of lime, that kettles quickly become incrusted 
internally with the salt ; and some of my patients, who were 
troubled with indigestion, believed that their stomachs had got 
into the same condition. This freedom from calculi would appear 
to be remarkable in the Negro race, even in the United States ; 
for seldom indeed have the most famed lithotomists there ever 
operated on a Negro. 



Chap. VI. PKEMATURE BURIALS— OPHTHALMIA. 129 

The diseases most prevalent are the following: pneumonia, 
produced by sudden changes of temperature, and other inflamma- 
tions, as of the bowels, stomach, and pleura ; rheumatism ; disease 
of the heart; but these become rare as the people adopt the 
European dress; various forms of indigestion and ophthalmia; 
hooping cough comes frequently; and every year the period 
preceding the rains is marked by some sort of epidemic. Some- 
times it is general ophthalmia, resembling closely the Egyptian. 
In another year it is a kind of diarrhoea, which nothing will cure 
until there is a fall of rain, and anything acts as a charm after 
that. One year the epidemic period was marked by a disease 
which looked like pneumonia, but had the peculiar symptom 
strongly developed of great pain in the seventh cervical process. 
Many persons died of it, after being in a comatose state for 
many hours or days before their decease. No inspection of 
the body being ever allowed by these people, and the place of 
sepulture being carefully concealed, I had to rest satisfied with 
conjecture. Frequently the Bakwains buried their dead in the 
huts where they died, for fear lest the witches (Baloi) should 
disinter their friends, and use some part of the body in their 
fiendish arts. Scarcely is the breath out of the body when 
the unfortunate patient is hurried away to be buried. An ant- 
eater's hole is often selected, in order to save the trouble of 
digging a grave. On two occasions while I was there this hasty 
burial was followed by the return home of the men, who had been 
buried alive, to their affrighted relatives. They had recovered 
while in their graves from prolonged swoons. 

In ophthalmia the doctors cup on the temples, and apply to the 
eyes the pungent smoke of certain roots, the patient at the same 
time taking strong draughts of it up Ms nostrils. We found the 
solution of nitrate of silver, two or three grains to the ounce of 
rain-water, answer the same end so much more effectually, that 
every morning numbers of patients crowded round our house for 
the collyrium. It is a good preventive of an acute attack when 
poured into the eyes as soon as the pain begins, and might prove 
valuable for travellers. Cupping is performed with the horn of 
a goat or antelope, having a little hole pierced in the small end. 
In some cases a small piece of wax is attached, and a temporary 
hole made through it to the horn. When the air is well with- 

K 



130 CUPPING— NATIVE DOCTORS. Chap. VI. 

drawn, and kept out by touching the orifice at every inspiration 
with the point of the tongue, the wax is at last pressed together 
with the teeth, and the little hole in it closed up, leaving a vacuum 
within the horn for the blood to flow from the already scarified 
parts. The edges of the horn applied to the surface are wetted, 
and cupping is well performed, though the doctor occasionally, by 
separating the fibrine from the blood in a basin of water by his 
side, and exhibiting it, pretends that he has extracted something 
more than blood. He can thus explain the rationale of the cure 
by his own art, and the ocular demonstration given is well 
appreciated. 

Those doctors who have inherited their profession as an heir- 
loom from their fathers and grandfathers generally possess some 
valuable knowledge, the result of long and close observation; 
but if a man cannot say that the medical art is in his family, he 
may be considered a quack. With the regular practitioners I 
always remained on the best terms, by refraining from appear- 
ing to doubt their skill in the presence of their patients. Any 
explanation in private was thankfully received by them, and 
wrong treatment changed into something more reasonable with 
cordial good will, if no one but the doctor and myself were present 
at the conversation. English medicines were eagerly asked for 
and accepted by all ; and we always found medical knowledge 
an important aid in convincing the people that we were really 
anxious for their welfare. We cannot accuse them of ingrati- 
tude ; in fact, we shall remember the kindness of the Bakwains 
to us as long as we live. 

The surgical knowledge of the native doctors is rather at a low 
ebb. No one ever attempted to remove a tumour except by 
external applications. Those with which the natives are clnefly 
troubled are fatty and fibrous tumours ; and as they all have the 
vis medicatrix naturae in remarkable activity, I safely removed an 
immense number. In illustration of their want of surgical know- 
ledge may be mentioned the case of a man who had a tumour 
as large as a child's head. Tins was situated on the nape of his 
neck, and prevented his walking straight. He applied to his 
chief, and he got some famous strange doctor from the east 
coast to cure him. He and Iris assistants attempted to dissolve 
it by kindling on it a little fire made of a few small pieces 






Chap. VI. LOW STATE OF SURGICAL KNOWLEDGE. 131 

of medicinal roots. I removed it for him, and he always walked 
with his head much more erect than he needed to do ever 
afterwards. Both men and women submit to an operation without 
wincing, or any of that shouting which caused young students to 
faint in the operating theatre before the introduction of chloro- 
form. The women pride themselves on their ability to bear pain. 
A mother will address her little girl, from whose foot a thorn is 
to be extracted, with " Now, Ma, you are a woman ; a woman 
does not cry." A man scorns to shed tears. When we were 
passing one of the deep wells in the Kalahari, a boy, the son of 
an aged father, had been drowned in it while playing on its 
brink. When all hope was gone, the father uttered an exceed- 
ingly great and bitter cry. It was sorrow without hope. This 
was the only instance I ever met with of a man weeping in this 
country. 

Their ideas on obstetrics are equally unscientific, and a 
medical man going near a woman at her confinement appeared 
to them more out of place than a female medical student ap- 
pears to us in a dissecting-room. A case of twins, however, hap- 
pening, and the ointments of all the doctors of the town proving 
utterly insufficient to effect the relief which a few seconds of 
English art afforded, the prejudice vanished at once. As it would 
have been out of the question for me to have entered upon this 
branch of the profession, — as indeed it would be inexpedient for 
any medical man to devote himself exclusively, in a tliinly-peopled 
country, to the practice of medicine, — I thereafter reserved myself 
for the difficult cases only ; and had the satisfaction of often con- 
ferring great benefits on poor women in their hour of sorrow. 
The poor creatures are often placed in a little hut built for the 
purpose, and are left without any assistance whatever, and the 
numbers of umbilical herniae winch are met with in consequence 
is very great. The women suffer less at their confinement than 
is the case in civilised countries ; perhaps from their treating it 
not as a disease, but as an operation of nature, requiring no 
change of diet, except a feast of meat and abundance of fresh air. 
The husband on these occasions is bound to slaughter for his lady 
an ox, or goat, or sheep, according to his means. 

My knowledge in the above line procured for me great 
fame in a department in which I could lay no claim to merit.

132 CHILD MEDICINE. Chap. VI. 

A woman came a distance of one hundred miles for relief in 
a complaint which seemed to have baffled the native doctors ; 
a complete cure was the result. Some twelve months after 
she returned to her husband, she bore a son. Her husband 
having previously reproached her for being barren, she sent me a 
handsome present, and proclaimed all over the country that I 
possessed a medicine for the cure of sterility. The consequence 
was, that I was teased with applications from husbands and 
wives from all parts of the country. Some came upwards of two 
hundred miles to purchase the great boon, and it was in vain for 
me to explain that I had only cured the disease of the other 
case. The more I denied, the higher their offers rose ; they 
would give any money for the " child medicine ;" and it was 
really heart-rending to hear the earnest entreaty, and see the 
tearful eye, which spoke the intense desire for offspring : " I am 
getting old, you see grey hairs here and there on my head, and 
I have no child ; you know how Bechuana husbands cast their 
old wives away ; what can I do ? I have no child to bring water 
to me when I am sick," &c. 

The whole of the country adjacent to the Desert, from Kuru- 
man to Kolobeng, or Litubaruba, and beyond up to the latitude 
of Lake Ngami, is remarkable for its great salubrity of climate. 
Not only the natives, but Europeans whose constitutions have 
been impaired by an Indian climate, find the tract of country 
indicated both healthy and restorative. The health and longevity 
of the missionaries have always been fair, though mission-work 
is not very conducive to either elsewhere. Cases have been 
known in which patients have come from the coast with com- 
plaints closely resembling, if they were not actually, those of con- 
sumption; and they have recovered by the influence of the 
climate alone. It must always be borne in mind that the climate 
near the coast, from which we received such very favourable 
reports of the health of the British troops, is actually inferior for 
persons suffering from pulmonary complaints to that of any part 
not subjected to the influence of sea-air. I have never seen the 
beneficial effects of the inland climate on persons of shattered 
constitutions, nor heard then high praises of the benefit they have 
derived from travelling, without wishing that its bracing effects 
should become more extensively known in England. No one 






Chap. VI. SALUBKITY OF CLIMATE. 133 

who has visited the region I have above mentioned fails to 
remember with pleasure the wild healthful gipsy life of waggon- 
travelling. 

A considerable proportion of animal diet seems requisite here. 
Independent of the want of salt, we required meat in as large 
quantity daily as we do in England, and no bad effects, in the 
way of biliousness, followed the free use of flesh, as in other hot 
climates. A vegetable diet causes acidity and heartburn. 

Mr. Oswell thought this climate much superior to that of Peru, 
as far as pleasure is concerned ; the want of instruments unfor- 
tunately prevented my obtaining accurate scientific data for the 
medical world on this subject ; and were it not for the great ex- 
pense of such a trip, I should have no hesitation in recommending 
the borders of the Kalahari Desert as admirably suited for all 
patients having pulmonary complaints. It is the complete antipodes 
to our cold damp English climate. The winter is perfectly dry ; 
and as not a drop of rain falls during that period, namely, from the 
beginning of May to the end of August, damp and cold are never 
combined. However hot the day may have been at Kolobeng, — 
and the thermometer sometimes rose, previous to a fall of rain, up 
to 96° in the coolest part of our house, — yet the atmosphere never 
has that steamy feeling nor those debilitating effects so well known 
in India and on the coast of Africa itself. In the evenings the 
air becomes deliciously cool, and a pleasant refreshing night 
follows the hottest day. The greatest heat ever felt is not so 
oppressive as it is when there is much humidity in the air ; and 
the great evaporation consequent on a fall of rain makes the 
rainy season the most agreeable for travelling. Nothing can 
exceed the balmy feeling of the evenings and mornings during 
the whole year. You wish for an increase neither of cold nor 
heat; and you can sit out of doors till midnight without ever 
thinking of colds or rheumatism ; or you may sleep out at night, 
looking up to the moon till you fall asleep, without a thought 
or sign of moon-blindness. Indeed during many months there 
is scarcely any dew.

Having remained five days with the wretched Bakwains, seeing 

the effects of war, of which only a very inadequate idea can ever 

be formed by those who have not been eye-witnesses of its miseries, 

we prepared to depart on the 15th January, 1853. Several dogs, 

in better condition by far than any of the people, had taken up 

their residence at the water. No one would own them ; there 

they had remained, and, coming on the trail of the people, long 

after their departure from the scene of conflict, it was plain they 

had 

" Held o'er the dead their carnival." 

Hence the disgust with which they were viewed. 

On our way from Khopong, along the ancient river-bed which 
forms the pathway to Boatlanama, I found a species of cactus, 
being the third I have seen in the country, — namely, one in the 
colony with a bright red flower, one at Lake Ngami, the flower of 
which was liver-coloured, and the present one, flower unknown. 
That the plant is uncommon may be inferred from the fact that 
the Bakwains find so much difficulty in recognising the plant again 
after having once seen it, that they believe it has the power of 
changing its locality. 

On the 21st January we reached the wells of Boatlanama, and 
found them for the first time empty. Lopepe, which I had for- 
merly seen a stream running from a large reedy pool, was also dry. 
The hot salt spring of Serinane, east of Lopepe, being undrinkable, 



Chap. VK. LAND TORTOISES. 135 

we pushed on to Mashiie for its delicious waters. In travelling 
through tins country, the olfactory nerves are frequently excited 
by a strong disagreeable odour. Tins is caused by a large jet- 
black ant named " Leshonya." It is nearly an inch in length, and 
emits a pungent smell when alarmed, in the same manner as the 
skunk. The scent must be as volatile as ether, for, on irritating 
the insect with a stick six feet long, the odour is instantly per- 
ceptible. 

Occasionally we lighted upon land tortoises, which, with then 
unlaid eggs, make a very agreeable dish. We saw many of their 
trails leading to the salt fountain ; they must have come great 
distances for this health-giving article. In lieu thereof they often 
devour wood-ashes. It is wonderful how this reptile holds its 
place in the country. When seen, it never escapes. The young 
are taken for the sake of then shells ; these are made into boxes, 
which, filled with sweet-smelling roots, the women hang around 
their persons. When older it is used as food, and the shell con- 
verted into a rude basin to hold food or water. It owes its con- 
tinuance neither to speed nor cunning. Its colour, yellow and 
dark-brown, is well adapted, by its similarity to the surrounding- 
grass and brushwood, to render it indistinguishable ; and, though 
it makes an awkward attempt to run on the approach of man, its 
trust is in its bony covering, from winch even the teeth of a hysena 
glance off foiled. When this long-lived creature is about to deposit 
her eggs, she lets herself into the ground by throwing the earth 
up round her shell, until only the top is visible ; then covering up 
the eggs, she leaves them until the rains begin to fall and the 
fresh herbage appears ; the young ones then come out, their shells 
still quite soft, and, unattended by their dam, begin the world for 
themselves. Their food is tender grass and a plant named thotona, 
and they frequently resort to heaps of ashes and places containing 
efflorescence of the nitrates for the salts these contain. 

Inquiries among the Bushmen and Bakalahari, who are inti- 
mately acquainted with the habits of the game, lead to the belief 
that many diseases prevail among wild animals. I have seen the 
kokong or gnu, kama or hartebeest, the tsessebe, kukama, and 
the giraffe, so mangy as to be uneatable even by the natives. 
Reference has already been made to the peripneumonia which cuts 
off horses, tolos or koodoos. Great numbers also of zebras are 



136 DISEASES OF WILD ANIMALS. Chap. VII. 

found dead with masses of foam at the nostrils, exactly as occurs 
in the common " horse-sickness." The production of the malig- 
nant carbuncle called kuatsi, or selonda, by the flesh when eaten, 
is another proof of the disease of the tame and wild being identical. 
I once found a buffalo blind from ophthalmia standing by the 
fountain Otse ; when he attempted to run he lifted up his feet in 
the manner peculiar to blind animals. The rhinoceros has often 
worms on the conjunction of his eyes ; but these are not the cause 
of the dimness of vision which will make him charge past a man 
who has wounded him, if he stands perfectly still, in the belief that 
his enemy is a tree. It probably arises from the horn being in 
the line of vision, for the variety named kuabaoba, which has a 
straight horn directed downwards away from that line, possesses 
acute eyesight, and is much more wary. 

All the wild animals are subject to intestinal worms besides. I 
have observed bunches of a tape-like thread and short worms of 
enlarged sizes in the rhinoceros. The zebras and elephants are 
seldom without them, and a thread-worm may often be seen under 
the peritoneum of these animals. Short red larvae, which convey 
a stinging sensation to the hand, are seen clustering round the 
orifice of the windpipe (trachea) of this animal at the back of the 
throat; others are seen in the frontal sinus of antelopes; and 
curious flat leech-like worms with black eyes are found in the 
stomachs of leches. The zebra, giraffe, eland, and kukama, have 
been seen mere skeletons from decay of their teeth as well as from 
disease. 

The carnivora, too, become diseased and mangy ; lions become 
lean and perish miserably by reason of the decay of the teeth. 
When a lion becomes too old to catch game, he frequently takes 
to killing goats in the villages ; a woman or child happening to go 
out at night falls a prey too ; and as this is his only source of sub- 
sistence now, he continues it. From this circumstance has arisen 
the idea that the Hon, when he has once tasted human flesh, loves 
it better than any other. A man-eater is invariably an old lion ; 
and when he overcomes his fear of man so far as to come to villages 
for goats, the people remark, " His teeth are worn, he will soon kill 
men." They at once acknowledge the necessity of instant action, 
and turn out to kill him. When living far away from population, 
or when, as is the case in some parts, he entertains a wholesome 



Chap. VII. THE LION. 137 

dread of the Bushmen and Bakalahari, as soon as either disease or 
old age overtakes him, he begins to catch mice and other small 
rodents, and even to eat grass ; the natives, observing undigested 
vegetable matter in his droppings, follow up his trail in the cer- 
tainty of finding him scarcely able to move under some tree, and 
despatch him without difficulty. The grass may have been eaten 
as medicine, as is observed in dogs. 

That the fear of man often remains excessively strong in the 
carnivora is proved from well-authenticated cases in which the 
lioness, in the vicinity of towns where the large game had been 
unexpectedly driven away by fire-arms, has been known to assuage 
the paroxysm of hunger by devouring her own young. It must 
be added, that, though the effluvium winch is left by the footsteps 
of man is in general sufficient to induce lions to avoid a village, 
there are exceptions ; so many came about our half-deserted 
houses at Chonuane while we were in the act of removing to 
Kolobeng, that the natives who remained with Mrs. Livingstone 
were terrified to stir out-of-doors in the evenings. Bitches also 
have been known to be guilty of the horridly unnatural act of 
eating their own young, probably from the great desire for animal 
food, which is experienced by the inhabitants as well. 

When a lion is met in the daytime, a circumstance by no 
means unfrequent to travellers in these parts, if preconceived 
notions do not lead them to expect something very " noble," or 
" majestic," they will see merely an animal somewhat larger than 
the biggest dog they ever saw, and partaking very strongly of the 
canine features ; the face is not much like the usual drawings of 
a Hon, the nose being prolonged like a dog's ; not exactly such as 
our painters make it, though they might learn better at the 
Zoological Gardens ; their ideas of majesty being usually shown 
by making their lions' faces like old women in nightcaps. When 
encountered in the daytime, the lion stands a second or two 
gazing, then turns slowly round, and walks as slowly away for a 
dozen paces, looking over his shoulder ; then begins to trot, and, 
when he thinks himself out of sight, bounds off like a greyhound. 
By day there is not, as a rule, the smallest danger of lions which 
are not molested attacking man, nor even on a clear moonlight 
night, except when they possess the breeding oTogyri (natural 
affection) ; this makes them brave almost any danger ; and if a 



138 HABITS OF THE LION. Chap. VII. 

man happens to cross to the windward of them, both lion and 
lioness will rnsh at lnm, in the manner of a bitch with whelps. 
This does not often happen, as I only became aware of two or 
three instances of it. In one case a man, passing where the wind 
blew from him to the animals, was bitten before he could climb a 
tree ; and occasionally a man on horseback has been caught by 
the leg under the same circumstances. So general, however, is 
the sense of security on moonlight nights that we seldom tied up 
our oxen, but let them He loose by the waggons ; while on a dark 
rainy night, if a Hon is in the neighbourhood, he is almost sure to 
venture to kill an ox. His approach is always stealthy, except 
when wounded ; and any appearance of a trap is enough to cause 
him to refrain from making the last spring. This seems charac- 
teristic of the feline species ; when a goat is picketed in India 
for the purpose of enabling the huntsman to shoot a tiger by 
night, if on a plain, he would whip off the animal so quickly by 
a stroke of the paw that no one could take aim ; to obviate this, a 
small pit is dug, and the goat is picketed to a stake in the 
bottom ; a small stone is tied in the ear of the goat, which makes 
him cry the whole night. When the tiger sees the appearance 
of a trap, he walks round and round the pit, and allows the 
himter, who is lying in wait, to have a fair shot. 

When a lion is very hungry, and lying in wait, the sight of 
an animal may make him commence stalking it. In one case a 
man, while stealthily crawling towards a rhinoceros, happened to 
glance behind him, and found to his horror a Hon stalking Mm ; 
he only escaped by springing up a tree like a cat. At Lopepe a 
lioness sprang on the after quarter of Mr. Oswell's horse, and 
when we came up to him we found the marks of the claws on 
the horse, and a scratch on Mr. O.'s hand. The horse on feeling 
the lion on him sprang away, and the rider, caught by a wait-a- 
bit thorn, was brought to the ground and rendered insensible. 
His dogs saved him. Another English gentleman (Captain Cod- 
rington) was surprised in the same way, though not hunting the 
lion at the time, but turning round he shot him dead in the 
neck. By accident a horse belonging to Codrington ran away, 
but was stopped by the bridle catching a stump; there he 
remained a prisoner two days, and when fomid the whole space 
around was marked by the footprints of lions. They had evi- 



Chap. VII. HABITS OF THE LION. 139 

dently been afraid to attack the haltered horse from fear that it 
was a trap. Two lions came up by night to within three yards 
of oxen tied to a waggon, and a sheep tied to a tree, and stood 
roaring, but afraid to make a spring. On another occasion one 
of our party was lying sound asleep and unconscious of danger 
between two natives behind a bush at Mashue; the fire was 
nearly out at their feet in consequence of all being completely 
tired out by the fatigues of the previous day ; a lion came up to 
within three yards of the fire, and there commenced roaring 
instead of making a spring ; the fact of their riding-ox being tied 
to the bush was the only reason the lion had for not following Ins 
instinct, and making a meal of flesh. He then stood on a knoll 
three hundred yards distant, and roared all night ; and continued 
his growling as the party moved off by daylight next morning. 

Nothing that I ever learned of the lion would lead me to attri- 
bute to it either the ferocious or noble character ascribed to it 
elsewhere. It possesses none of the nobility of the Newfoundland 
or St. Bernard dogs. With respect to its great strength there 
can be no doubt. The immense masses of muscle around its 
jaws, shoulders, and forearms, proclaim tremendous force. They 
would seem, however, to be inferior in power to those of the 
Indian tiger. Most of those feats of strength that I have seen 
performed by lions, such as the taking away of an ox, were not 
carrying but dragging or trailing the carcase along the ground : 
they have sprung on some occasions on to the hind-quarters of a 
horse, but no one has ever seen them on the withers of a giraffe. 
They do not mount on the hind-quarters of an eland even, but 
try to tear him down with their claws. Messrs. Oswell and 
Vardon once saw three lions endeavouring to drag down a buffalo, 
and they were unable to do so for a time, though he was then 
mortally wounded by a two-ounce ball.* 

* This singular encounter, in the words of an eye-witness, happened as 
follows : — 

" My South African Journal is now before me, and I have got hold of 
the account of the lion and buffalo affair ; here it is : — * 15th Sept. 1846. 
' Oswell and I were riding this afternoon along the banks of the Limpopo, when 
1 a water-buck started in front of us. I dismounted, and was following it 
' through the jungle, when three buffaloes got up, and, after going a little 
' distance, stood still, and the nearest bull turned round and looked at me. A 
' ball from the two-ouncer crashed into his shoulder, and they all three made 



140 HABITS OF THE LION. Chap. VII. 

In general the lion seizes the animal he is attacking by the 
flank near the hind leg, or by the throat below the jaw. It is 
questionable whether he ever attempts to seize an animal by the 
withers. The flank is the most common point of attack, and that 
is the part he begins to feast on first. The natives and lions are 
very similar in their tastes in the selection of tit-bits : an eland 
may be seen disembowelled by a lion, so completely, that he 
scarcely seems cut up at all. The bowels and fatty parts form a 
full meal for even the largest lion. The jackal comes sniffing 
about, and sometimes suffers for his temerity by a stroke from 
the lion's paw laying him dead. When gorged, the lion falls fast 
asleep and is then easily despatched. Hunting a lion with dogs 
involves very little danger as compared with hunting the Indian 
tiger ; because the dogs bring him out of cover and make him 
stand at bay, giving the hunter plenty of time for a good deli- 
berate shot. 

Where game is abundant, there you may expect lions in propor- 
tionately large numbers. They are never seen in herds, but six 
or eight, probably one family, occasionally hunt together. One 

' off. Oswell and I followed as soon as I had reloaded, and when we were in 
' sight of the buffalo, and gaining on him at every stride, three lions leapt on the 
' unfortunate brute ; he bellowed most lustily as he kept up a kind of running 
' fight ; but he was, of course, soon overpowered and pulled down. We had a 

* fine view of the struggle, and saw the lions on their hind legs tearing away 

* with teeth and claws in most ferocious style. We crept up within thirty 

* yards, and, kneeling down, blazed away at the lions. My rifle was a single 

* barrel, and I had no spare gun. One lion fell dead almost on the buffalo ; 

* he had merely time to turn towards us, seize a bush with his teeth, and drop 
1 dead with the stick in his jaws. The second made off immediately ; and 
' the third raised his head, coolly looked round for a moment, then went on 
' tearing and biting at the carcase as hard as ever. We retired a short distance 
' to load, then again advanced and fired. The lion made off, but a ball that he 
' received ought to have stopped him, as it went clean through his shoulder- 

* blade. He was followed up and killed, after having charged several times. 

* Both lions were males. It is not often that one bags a brace of lions and a 
1 bull buffalo in about ten minutes. It was an exciting adventure, and I shall 

* never forget it.' 

" Such, my dear Livingstone, is the plain, unvarnished account. The 
buffalo had, of course, gone close to where the lions were lying down for the 
day ; and they, seeing him lame and bleeding, thought the opportunity too 
good a one to be lost.

is in much more danger of being run over when walking in the 
streets of London, than he is of being devoured by lions in Africa, 
unless engaged in hunting the animal. Indeed, nothing that I 
have seen or heard about lions would constitute a barrier in the 
way of men of ordinary courage and enterprise. 

The same feeling which has induced the modern painter to 
caricature the lion, has led the sentimentalist to consider the 
lion's roar the most terrific of all earthly sounds. We hear of the 
" majestic roar of the king of beasts." It is, indeed, well cal- 
culated to inspire fear if you hear it in combination with the 
tremendously loud thunder of that country, on a night so pitchy 
dark that every flash of the intensely vivid lightning leaves you 
with the impression of stone-blindness, while the rain pours down 
so fast that your fire goes out, leaving you without the protection 
of even a tree, or the chance of your gun going off. But when 
you are in a comfortable house or waggon, the case is very dif- 
ferent, and you hear the roar of the lion without any awe or alarm. 
The silly ostrich makes a noise as loud, yet he never was feared 
by man. To talk of the majestic roar of the lion is mere 
majestic twaddle. On my mentioning this fact some years ago, 
the assertion was doubted, so I have been careful ever since to 
inquire the opinions of Europeans, who have heard both, if they 
could detect any difference between the roar of a lion and that of 
an ostrich ; the invariable answer was — that they could not when 
the animal was at any distance. The natives assert that they can 
detect a variation between the commencement of the noise of 
each. There is, it must be admitted, considerable difference 
between the singing noise of a lion when full and his deep gruff 
growl when hungry. In general the lion's voice seems to come 
deeper from the chest than that of the ostrich ; but to this day I 
can distinguish between them with certainty only by knowing 
that the ostrich roars by day and the lion by night. 

The African Hon is of a tawny colour, like that of some 
mastiffs. The mane in the male is large, and gives the idea of 
great power. In some lions the ends of the hair of the mane are 
black ; these go by the name of black-maned lions, though as a 
whole all look of the yellow tawny colour. At the time of the 
discovery of the lake, Messrs. Oswell and Wilson shot two speci- 
mens of another variety. One was an old lion, whose teeth were 



142 LIONS AND BUFFALOES. Chap. VII. 

mere stumps, and his claws worn quite blunt ; the other was full 
grown, in the prime of life, with white perfect teeth ; both were 
entirely destitute of mane. The lions, in the country near the 
lake, give tongue less than those further south. We scarcely 
ever heard them roar at all. 

The lion has other checks on inordinate increase besides man. 
He seldom attacks full-grown animals ; but frequently, when a 
buffalo calf is caught by him, the cow rushes to the rescue, and a 
toss from her often kills him. One we found was killed thus ; 
and on the Leeambye another, which died near Sesheke, had all 
the appearance of having received his death-blow from a buffalo. 
It is questionable if a single lion ever attacks a full-grown buffalo. 
The amount of roaring heard at night, on occasions when a buffalo 
is killed, seems to indicate there are always more than one Hon 
engaged in the onslaught. 

On the plain, south of Sebituane's ford, a herd of buffaloes 
kept a number of lions from their young by the males turning 
their heads to the enemy. The young and the cows were in the 
rear. One toss from a bull would kill the strongest lion that 
ever breathed. I have been informed that in one part of India 
even the tame buffaloes feel their superiority to some wild ani- 
mals, for they have been seen to chase a tiger up the hills, bel- 
lowing as if they enjoyed the sport. Lions never go near any 
elephants except the calves, which, when young, are sometimes 
torn by them ; every living thing retires before the lordly ele- 
phant, yet a full-grown one would be an easier prey than the 
rhinoceros ; the lion rushes off at the mere sight of this latter 
beast. 

In the country adjacent to Mashue great numbers of different 
kinds of mice exist. The ground is often so undermined with 
their burrows, that the foot sinks in at every step. Little hay- 
cocks, about two feet high, and rather more than that in breadth, 
are made by one variety of these little creatures. The same 
thing is done in regions annually covered with snow for obvious 
purposes, but it is difficult here to divine the reason of the hay- 
making in the climate of Africa.* 

* Euryotis unisalcatus (F. Cuvier), Mus pumelio (Spar.), and Mus leliocla 
(Smith), all possess this habit in a greater or less degree. The first-named 
may be seen escaping danger with its young hanging to the after-part of its body. 



Chap. VII. SEKPENTS. 143 

Wherever mice abound, serpents may be expected, for the one 
preys on the other. A cat in a house is, therefore, a good pre- 
ventive against the entrance of these noxious reptiles. Occa- 
sionally, however, notwithstanding every precaution, they do find 
their way in, but even the most venomous sorts bite only when 
put into bodily fear themselves, or when trodden upon, or when 
the sexes come together. I once found a coil of serpents' skins, 
made by a number of them twisting together in the manner 
described by the Druids of old. When in the country, one feels 
nothing of that alarm and loathing which we may experience 
when sitting in a comfortable English room reading about them ; 
yet they are nasty things, and we seem to have an instinctive 
feeling against them. In making the door for our Mabotsa house, 
I happened to leave a small hole at the corner below. Early one 
morning a man came to call for some article I had promised. I 
at once went to the door, and, it being dark, trod on a serpent. 
The moment I felt the cold scaly skin twine round a part of my 
leg my latent instinct was roused, and I jumped up higher than I 
ever did before, or hope to do again, shaking the reptile off in the 
leap. I probably trod on it near the head, and so prevented it 
biting me, but did not stop to examine. 

Some of the serpents are particularly venomous. One was 
killed at Kolobeng of a dark brown, nearly black colour, 8 feet 3 
inches long. This species (picakholu) is so copiously supplied 
with poison, that, when a number of dogs attack it, the first bitten 
dies almost instantaneously, the second in about five minutes, the 
third in an hour or so, while the fourth may live several hours. 
In a cattle-pen it produces great mischief in the same way. The 
one we killed at Kolobeng continued to distil clear poison from 
the fangs for hours after its head was cut off. Tins was probably 
that winch passes by the name of the " spitting serpent," which is 
believed to be able to eject its poison into the eyes when the 
wind favours its forcible expiration. They all require water, and 
come long distances to the Zouga, and other rivers and pools, in 
search of it. We have another dangerous serpent — the puff adder 
— and several vipers. One, named by the inhabitants " Noga-put- 
sane," or serpent of a kid, utters a cry by night exactly like the 
bleating of that animal. I heard one at a spot where no kid 
could possibly have been. It is supposed by the natives to lure 



144 SERPENTS — FASCINATION. Chap. VII. 

travellers to itself by this bleating. Several varieties, when 
alarmed, emit a peculiar odour, by which the people become 
aware of their presence in a house. We have also the cobra 
(Naia haje, Smith) of several colours or varieties. When an- 
noyed, they raise their heads up about a foot from the ground, 
and flatten the neck in a threatening maimer, darting out the 
tongue and retracting it with great velocity, while their fixed 
glassy eyes glare as if in anger. There are also various species of 
the genus Bendrophis, as the Bucephalus viridis, or green tree- 
climber. They climb trees in search of birds and eggs, and are 
soon discovered by all the birds in the neighbourhood collecting 
and sounding an alarm.* Their fangs are formed not so much for 

* " As this snake, Bucephalus Capensis, in our opinion, is not provided with 
a poisonous fluid to instil into wounds which these fangs may inflict, they 
must consequently be intended for a purpose different to those which exist in 
poisonous reptiles. Their use seems to be to offer obstacles to the retrogression 
of animals, such as birds, &c, while they are only partially within the mouth ; 
and from the circumstance of these fangs being directed backwards, and not 
admitting of being raised so as to form an angle with the edge of the jaw, they 
are well fitted to act as powerful holders when once they penetrate the skin and 
soft parts of the prey which their possessors may be in the act of swallowing. 
Without such fangs escapes would be common ; with such they are rare. 

" The natives of South Africa regard the Bucephalus Capensis as poisonous ; 
but in their opinion we cannot concur, as we have not been able to discover 
the existence of any glands manifestly organized for the secretion of poison. 
The fangs are enclosed in a soft, pulpy sheath, the inner surface of which is 
commonly coated with a thin glairy secretion. This secretion possibly may 
have something acrid and irritating in its qualities, which may, when it enters 
a wound, occasion pain and even swelling, but nothing of greater importance. 

" The Bucephalus Capensis is generally found upon trees, to which it resorts 
for the purpose of catching birds, upon which it delights to feed. The presence 
of a specimen in a tree is generally soon discovered by the birds of the neigh- 
bourhood, who collect around it and fly to and fro, uttering the most piercing 
cries, until some one, more terror-struck than the rest, actually scans its lips, 
and, almost without resistance, becomes a meal for its enemy. During such 
a proceeding the snake is generally observed with its head raised about ten or 
twelve inches above the branch round which its body and tail are entwined, 
with its mouth open and its neck inflated, as if anxiously endeavouring to in- 
crease the terror which it would almost appear it was aware would sooner or 
later bring within its grasp some one of the feathered group. 

" Whatever may be said in ridicule of fascination, it is nevertheless true that 
birds, and even quadrupeds, are, under certain circumstances, unable to retire 
from the presence of certain of their enemies ; and, what is even more extra- 
ordinary, unable to resist the propensity to advance from a situation of actual 



Chap. VII. SEEPENTS. 145 

injecting poison on external objects as for keeping in any animal 
or bird of which they have got hold. In the case of the Dasy- 
peltis inornatus (Smith) the teeth are small, and favourable for 
the passage of thin-shelled eggs without breaking. The egg is 
taken in unbroken till it is within the gullet or about 2 inches 
behind the head. The gular teeth placed there break the shell 
without spilling the contents, as would be the case if the front 
teeth were large. The shell is then ejected. Others appear to 
be harmless, and even edible. Of the latter sort is the large 
python, metse pallah, or tari. The largest specimens of this are 
about 15 or 20 feet in length ; they are perfectly harmless, and 
live on small animals, chiefly the rodentia ; occasionally the 
steinbuck and pallah fall victims, and are sucked into its com- 
paratively small mouth in boa-constrictor fashion. One we shot 
was 11 feet 10 inches long, and as thick as a man's leg. When 
shot through the spine, it was capable of lifting itself up about 
five feet high, and opened its mouth in a threatening manner, 
but the poor tiling was more inclined to crawl away. The flesh 
is much relished by the Bakalahari and Bushmen : they carry 
away each his portion, like logs of wood, over their shoulders. 

Some of the Bayeiye we met at Sebituane's ford pre- 
tended to be unaffected by the bite of serpents, and showed the 
feat of lacerating their arms with the teeth of such as are un- 
furnished with the poison-fangs. They also swallow the poison, by 
way of gaining notoriety ; but Dr. Andrew Smith put the sin- 
safety into one of the most imminent danger. This I have often seen exem- 
plified in the case of birds and snakes ; and I have heard of instances equally 
curious, in which antelopes and other quadrupeds have been so bewildered by 
the sudden appearance of crocodiles, and by the grimaces and contortions they 
practised, as to be unable to fly or even move from the spot towards which 
they were approaching to seize them." (Dr. Andrew Smith's ' Eeptilia.') 

In addition to these interesting statements of the most able naturalist from 
whom I have taken this note, it may be added that fire exercises a fascinating 
effect on some kinds of toads. They may be seen rushing into it in the 
evenings without ever starting back on feeling pain. Contact with the hot 
embers rather increases the energy with which they strive to gain the hottest 
parts, and they never cease their struggles for the centre even when their juices 
are coagulating and their limbs stiffening in the roasting heat. Various insects 
also are thus fascinated ; but the scorpions may be seen coming away from 
the fire in fierce disgust, and they are so irritated as to inflict at that time their 
most painful stings.

140 THE " SECHU." Chap. VII. 

cerity of such persons to the test by offering them the fangs 
of a really poisonous variety, and found they shrank from the 
experiment. 

When we reached the Bamangwato, the chief Sekomi was par- 
ticularly friendly, collected all his people to the religious services 
we held, and explained Ins reasons for compelling some English- 
men to pay liim a horse. " They would not sell him any powder, 
though they had plenty ; so he compelled them to give it and the 
horse for nothing. He would not deny the extortion to me ; that 
would be 'boherehere' (swindling)." He thus thought extortion 
better than swindling. I could not detect any difference in the 
morality of the two transactions, but Sekomi's ideas of honesty 
are the lowest I have met with in any Bechuana chief, and this 
instance is mentioned as the only approach to demanding pay- 
ment for leave to pass that I have met with in the South. In all 
other cases the difficulty has been to get a chief to give us men 
to show the way, and the payment has only been for guides. 
Englishmen have always very properly avoided giving that idea 
to the native mind winch we shall hereafter find prove trouble- 
some, that payment ought to be made for passage through a 
country. 

All the Bechuana and Caffre tribes south of the Zambesi 
practise circumcision (boguera), but the rites observed are care- 
fully concealed. The initiated alone can approach, but in this 
town I was once a spectator of the second part of the cere- 
mony of the circumcision, called " sechu." Just at the dawn of 
day, a row of boys of nearly fourteen years of age stood naked in 
the kotla, each having a pah- of sandals as a shield on Ins hands. 
Facing them stood the men of the town in a similar state of 
nudity, all armed with long thin wands, of a tough, strong, supple 
bush called moretloa (G-reivia flava), and engaged in a dance 
named " koha," in which questions are put to the boys, as " Will 
you guard the chief well ? " " Will you herd the cattle well ? " 
and wliile the latter give an affirmative response, the men rush 
forward to them, and each aims a full-weight blow at the back of 
one of the boys; shielding himself with the sandals above Ins 
head, he causes the supple wand to descend and bend into his 
back, and every stroke inflicted thus makes the blood squirt out 
of a wound a foot or eighteen inches long. At the end of the 



Chap. VII. THE " BOGUEEA." 147 

dance, the boys' backs are seamed with wounds and weals, the 
scars of which remain through life. Tins is intended to harden 
the young soldiers, and prepare them for the rank of men. After 
this ceremony, and after killing a rhinoceros, they may marry a 
wife. 

In the " koha " the same respect is shown to age as in many 
other of their customs. A younger man, rushing from the ranks 
to exercise his wand on the backs of the youths, may be him- 
self the object of chastisement by the older, and, on the occasion 
referred to, Sekomi received a severe cut on the leg from one 
of his grey-haired people. On my joking with some of the 
young men on their want of courage, notwithstanding all the 
beatings of which they bore marks, and hinting that our soldiers 
were brave without suffering so much, one rose up and said, 
" Ask him if, when he and I were compelled by a lion to stop 
and make a fire, I did not lie down and sleep as well as himself." 
In other parts a challenge to try a race would have been given, 
and you may frequently see grown men adopting that means of 
testing superiority, like so many cliildren. 

The sechu is practised by three tribes only. Boguera is ob- 
served by all the Bechuanas and CafFres, but not by the negro 
tribes beyond 20° south. The " boguera " is a civil rather than 
a religious rite. All the boys of an age between ten and four- 
teen or fifteen are selected to be the companions for life of one 
of the sons of the chief. They are taken out to some retired 
spot in the forest, and huts are erected for their accommodation ; 
the old men go out and teach them to dance, initiating them, at 
the same time, into all the mysteries of African politics and 
government. Each one is expected to compose an oration hi 
praise of himself, called a " leina " or name, and to be able to 
repeat it with sufficient fluency. A good deal of beating is 
required to bring them up to the required excellency in different 
matters, so that, when they return from the close seclusion in 
which they are kept, they have generally a number of scars 
to show on their backs. These bands or regiments, named 
mepato in the plural and mopato in the singular, receive par- 
ticular appellations ; as, the Matsatsi — the suns ; the Mabusa — 
the rulers ; equivalent to our Coldstreams or Enmskillens ; and 
though living in different parts of the town, they turn out at the 

l 2 



148 CEREMONIES OF AFRICAN TRIBES. Chap. VII. 

call, and act under the chief 's son as their commander. They 
recognise a sort of equality and partial communism ever after- 
wards, and address each other by the title of molekane or com- 
rade. In cases of offence against their rules, as eating alone 
when any of their comrades are within call, or in cases of 
cowardice or dereliction of duty, they may strike one another, 
or any member of a younger mopato, but never any one of an 
older band ; and when three or four companies have been made, 
the oldest no longer takes the field in time of war, but remains 
as a guard over the women and cliildren. When a fugitive 
comes torn tribe, he is directed to the mopato analogous to 
that to which in his own tribe he belongs, and does duty as a 
member. No one of the natives knows how old he is. If asked 
his age he answers by putting another question — " Does a man 
remember when he was born ? " Age is reckoned by the 
number of mepato they have seen pass through the formuLne 
of admission. When they see four or five mepato younger than 
themselves they are no longer obliged to bear arms. The oldest 
individual I ever met boasted he had seen eleven sets of boys 
submit to the boguera. Supposing him to have been fifteen 
when he saw his own, and fresh bands were added every six or 
seven years, he must have been about forty when he saw the 
fifth, and may have attained seventy-five or eighty years, which 
is no great age ; but it seemed so to them, for he had now 
doubled the age for superannuation among them. It is an 
ingenious plan for attaching the members of the tribe to the 
chief's family, and for imparting a discipline which renders the 
tribe easy of command. On their return to the town from attend- 
ance on the ceremonies of initiation, a prize is given to the lad 
who can run fastest, the article being placed where all may see 
the winner run up to snatch it. They are then considered men 
(banona, viri), and can sit among the elders in the kotla. For- 
merly they were only boys (basimane, pueri). The first mis- 
sionaries set their faces against the boguera, on account of its 
connection with heathenism, and the fact that the youths learned 
much evil, and became disobedient to their parents. From the 
general success of these men, it is perhaps better that younger 
missionaries should tread in their footsteps ; for so much evil 
may result from breaking down the authority on which, to those

who cannot read, the whole system of our influence appears to 
rest, that innovators ought to be made to propose their new 
measures as the Locrians did new laws — with ropes around their 
necks. 

Probably the "boguera" was only a sanitary and political 
measure ; and there being no continuous chain of tribes practising 
the rite between the Arabs and the Bechuanas, or CafTres, and as 
it is not a religious ceremony, it can scarcely be traced, as is 
often done, to a Mahometan source. 

A somewhat analogous ceremony (boyale) takes place for 
young women, and the protegees appear abroad drilled under the 
surveillance of an old lady to the carrying of water. They are 
clad during the whole time in a dress composed of ropes made of 
alternate pumpkin-seeds and bits of reed strung together, and 
wound round the body in a figure-of-eight fashion. They are 
inured in this way to bear fatigue, and carry large pots of water 
under the guidance of the stern old hag. They have often scars 
from bits of burning charcoal having been applied to the forearm, 
wliich must have been done to test then power of bearing pain. 

The Bamangwato hills are part of the range called Bakaa. 
The Bakaa tribe, however, removed to Kolobeng, and is now 
joined to that of Sechele. The range stands about 700 or 800 
feet above the plains, and is composed of great masses of black 
basalt. It is probably part of the latest series of volcanic rocks 
in South Africa. At the eastern end these hills have curious 
fungoid or cup-shaped hollows, of a size which suggests the idea 
of craters. Within these are masses of the rock crystallized in 
the columnar form of this formation. The tops of the columns 
are quite distinct, of the hexagonal form, like the bottom of the 
cells of a honeycomb, but they are not parted from each other as 
in the Cave of Fingal. In many parts the lava-streams may be 
recognised, for there the rock is rent and split in every direction, 
but no soil is yet found in the interstices. When we were sitting 
in the evening, after a hot day, it was quite common to hear 
these masses of basalt split and fall among each other with the 
peculiar ringing sound which makes people believe that this rock 
contains much iron. Several large masses, in splitting thus by 
the cold acting suddenly on parts expanded by the heat of the 
day, have slipped down the sides of the lulls, and, impinging 



150 THE UNICORN'S PASS. Chap. VII. 

against each other, have formed cavities in which the Bakaa took 
refuge against their enemies. The numerous clunks and cran- 
nies left by these huge fragments made it quite impossible for 
their enemies to smoke them out, as was done by the Boers to 
the people of Mankopane. 

This mass of basalt, about six miles long, has tilted up the 
rocks on both the east and west ; these upheaved rocks are the 
ancient silurian schists which formed the bottom of the great 
primaeval valley, and like all the recent volcanic rocks of this 
country have a hot fountain in their vicinity, namely, that of 
Serinane. 

In passing through these hills on our way north we enter a 
pass named Manakalongwe, or Unicorn's Pass. The unicorn 
here is a large edible caterpillar, with an erect horn-like tail. 
The pass was also called Porapora (or gargling of water), from a 
stream having run tlirough it. The scene must have been very 
different in former times from what it is now. Tins is part of 
the river Mahalapi, winch so-called river scarcely merits the 
name, any more than the meadows of Edinburgh deserve the 
title of North Loch. These lulls are the last we shall see for 
months. The country beyond consisted of large patches of trap- 
covered tufa, having little soil or vegetation except tufts of 
grass and wait-a-bit thorns, in the midst of extensive sandy 
grass-covered plains. These yellow-coloured grassy plains, with 
moretloa and mahatla bushes, form quite a characteristic feature 
of the country. The yellow or dun-colour prevails during a great 
part of the year. The Bakwain lulls are an exception to the 
usual flat surface, for they are covered with green trees to their 
tops, and the valleys are often of the most lovely green. The 
trees are larger too, and even the plains of the Bakwain country 
contain trees instead of bushes. If you look north from the hills 
we are now leaving, the country partakes of this latter character. 
It appears as if it were a flat covered with a forest of ordinary- 
sized trees from 20 to 30 feet high, but when you travel over it 
they are not so closely planted but that a waggon with care may 
be guided among them. The grass grows in tufts of the size of 
one's hat, with bare soft sand between. Nowhere here have we 
an approach to English lawns, or the pleasing appearance of 
English greensward. 



Chap. YU. MR, GORDON CUMMING. 151 

In no part of this country could European grain be cultivated 
without irrigation. The natives all cultivate the dourrha or 
holcus sorghum, maize, pumpkins, melons, cucumbers, and 
different kinds of beans ; and they are entirely dependent for 
the growth of these on rains. Their instrument of culture is the 
hoe, and the chief labour falls on the female portion of the com- 
munity. In this respect the Bechuanas closely resemble the 
Caffres. The men engage in hunting, milk the cows, and have 
the entire control of the cattle ; they prepare the skins, make 
the clothing, and in many respects may be considered a nation 
of tailors. 

When at Sekomi's we generally have heard his praises sounded 
by a man who rises at break of day and utters at the top of his 
voice the oration which that ruler is said to have composed at his 
boguera. This repetition of his " leina," or oration, is so pleasing 
to a chief that he generally sends a handsome present to the 
man who does it. 

January 28th. — Passing on to Letloche, about twenty miles 
beyond the Bamangwato, we found a fine supply of water. This 
is a point of so much interest in that country that the first ques- 
tion we ask of passers by is " Have you had water ? " the first 
inquiry a native puts to a fellow-countryman is " Where is the 
rain ? " and, though they are by no means an untruthful nation, 
the answer generally is, " I don't know — there is none — we are 
killed with hunger and by the sun." If news is asked for, they 
commence with " There is no news, I heard some lies only," and 
then tell all they know. 

This spot was Mr. Gordon Cumming's furthest station north. 
Our house at Kolobeng having been quite in the hunting- 
country, rhinoceros and buffaloes several times rushed past, 
and I was able to shoot the latter twice from our own door. 
We were favoured by visits from this famous hunter during each 
of the Rye years of his warfare with wild animals. Many English 
gentlemen following the same pursuits paid their guides and 
assistants so punctually that in making arrangements for them 
we had to be careful that four did not go where two only were 
wanted : they knew so well that an Englishman would pay that 
they depended hnplicity on his word of honour, and not only 
would they go and hunt for five or six months in the north, 



152 SPORTING. Chap. VII- 

enduring all the hardships of that trying mode of life, with little 
else but meat of game to subsist on, but they willingly went 
seven hundred or eight hundred miles to Graham's Town, receiv- 
ing for wages only a musket, worth fifteen shillings. 

No one ever deceived them except one man ; and as I believed 
that he was afflicted with a slight degree of the insanity of greedi- 
ness, I upheld the honour of the English name by paying Ins 
debts. As the guides of Mr. Cumming were furnished through 
my influence, and usually got some strict charges as to their 
behaviour before parting, looking upon me in the light of a 
father, they always came to give me an account of then service, 
and told most of those hunting adventures winch have since been 
given to the world, before we had the pleasure of hearing our 
Mend relate them himself by our own fireside. I had thus a 
tolerably good opportunity of testing their accuracy, and I have 
no hesitation in saying that for those who love that sort of tiring 
Mr. Cumming's book conveys a truthful idea of South African 
hunting. Some things in it require explanation, but the numbers 
of animals said to have been met with and killed are by no 
means improbable, considering the amount of large game then in 
the country. Two other gentlemen hunting in the same region 
destroyed in one season no fewer than seventy-eight rhinoceroses 
alone. Sportsmen, however, would not now find an equal 
number, for as guns are introduced among the tribes all these 
fine animals melt away like snow in spring. In the more remote 
districts where fire-arms have not yet been introduced, with the 
single exception of the rhinoceros, the game is to be found in 
numbers much greater than Mr. Cumming ever saw. The tsetse 
is, however, an insuperable barrier to hunting with horses there, 
and Europeans can do nothing on foot. The step of the elephant 
when charging the hunter, though apparently not quick, is so 
long that the pace equals the speed of a good horse at a canter. 
A young sportsman, no matter how great among pheasants, foxes, 
and hounds, would do well to pause before resolving to brave 
fever for the excitement of risking such a terrific charge ; the 
scream, or trumpeting, of this enormous brute when infuriated is 
more like what the shriek of a French steam-whistle would be to 
a man standing on the dangerous part of a railroad, than any 
other earthly sound : a horse unused to it will sometimes stand 



Chap. VII. SCARCITY OF WATER— THE OSTRICH. 153 

shivering instead of taking his rider out of danger. It has hap- 
pened often that the poor animal's legs do their duty so badly 
that he falls and exposes his rider to be trodden into a mummy ; 
or, losing his presence of mind, the rider may allow the horse to 
dash under a tree and crack his cranium against a branch. As 
one charge from an elephant has made embryo Nimroils bid a 
final adieu to the chace, incipient Gordon Cummings might try 
their nerves by standing on railways till the engines were within 
a few yards of them. Hunting elephants on foot would be not 
less dangerous,* unless the Ceylon mode of killing them by one 
shot could be followed : it has never been tried in Africa. 

Advancing to some wells beyond Letloche, at a spot named 
Kanne, we found them carefully hedged round by the people of 
a Bakalahari village situated near the spot. We had then sixty 
miles of country in front without water, and very distressing for 
the oxen, as it is generally deep soft sand. There is one sucking- 
place, around which were congregated great numbers of Bush- 
women with their egg-shells and reeds. Mathuluane now con- 
tained no water, and Motlatsa only a small supply, so we sent 
the oxen across the country to the deep well Nkauane, and half 
were lost on the way. When found at last they had been five 
whole days without water. Very large numbers of elands were 
met with as usual, though they seldom can get a sip of drink. 
Many of the plains here have large expanses of grass without 
trees, but you seldom see a treeless horizon. The ostrich is 
generally seen quietly feeding on some spot where no one can 
approach him without being detected by his wary eye. As the 
waggon moves along far to the windward he thinks it is intending 
to circumvent him, so he rushes up a mile or so from the lee- 
ward, and so near to the front oxen that one sometimes gets a 
shot at the silly bird. When he begins to run all the game hi 
sight follow his example. I have seen this folly taken advantage 
of when he was quietly feeding in a valley open at both ends. A 
number of men would commence running, as if to cut off his 
retreat from the end through which the wind came ; and although 
he had the whole country hundreds of miles before him by going 

* Since writing the above statement it has received confirmation in the 
reported death of Mr. Walhberg while hunting elephants on foot at Lake 
Ngami. 



154 THE OSTRICH. Chap. VII. 

to the other end, on he madly rushed to get past the men, and so 
was speared. He never swerves from the course he once adopts, 
but only increases his speed. 

When the ostrich is feeding his pace is from twenty to twenty- 
two inches; when walking, but not feeding, it is twenty-six 
inches ; and when terrified, as in the case noticed, it is from 
eleven and a half to thirteen and even fourteen feet in length. 
Only in one case was I at all satisfied of being able to count the 
rate of speed by a stop watch, and, if I am not mistaken, there 
were thirty in ten seconds; generally one's eye can no more 
follow the legs than it can the spokes of a carriage-wheel in rapid 
motion. If we take the above number, and twelve feet stride as 
the average pace, we have a speed of twenty-six miles an hour. 
It cannot be very much above that, and is therefore slower than 
a railway locomotive. They are sometimes shot by the horseman 
making a cross cut to their undeviating course, but few English- 
men ever succeed in killing them. 

• The ostrich begins to lay her eggs before she has fixed on a 
spot for a nest, which is only a hollow a few inches deep in the 
sand, and about a yard in diameter. Solitary eggs, named by the 
Bechuanas " lesetla," are thus found lying forsaken all over the 
country, and become a prey to the jackal. She seems averse to 
risking a spot for a nest, and often lays her eggs in that of another 
ostrich, so that as many as forty-five have been found in one nest. 
Some eggs contain small concretions of the matter which forms 
the shell, as occurs also in the egg of the common fowl ; this has 
given rise to the idea of stones in the eggs. Both male and 
female assist in the incubations ; but the numbers of females 
being always greatest, it is probable that cases occur in which 
the females have the entire charge. Several eggs lie out of the 
nest, and are thought to be intended as food for the first of the 
newly-hatched brood till the rest come out and enable the whole 
to start in quest of food. I have several times seen newly-hatched 
young in charge of the cock, who made a very good attempt 
at appearing lame in the plover fashion, in order to draw off the 
attention of pursuers. The young squat down and remain im- 
movable when too small to run far, but attain a wonderful degree 
of speed when about the size of common fowls. It cannot be 



Chap. VII. THE OSTRICH. 155 

asserted that ostriches are polygamous, though they often appear 
to be so. When caught they are easily tamed, but are of no use 
in their domesticated state. 

The egg is possessed of very great vital power. One kept in a 
room during more than three months, in a temperature about 
G0°, when broken was found to have a partially developed live 
cluck in it. The Bushmen carefully avoid touching the eggs, or 
leaving marks of human feet near them, when they find a nest. 
They go up the wind to the spot, and with a long stick remove 
some of them occasionally, and, by preventing any suspicion, 
keep the hen laying on for months* as we do with fowls. The 
eggs have a strong disagreeable flavour, which only the keen 
appetite of the Desert can reconcile one to. The Hottentots use 
their trousers to carry home the twenty or twenty-five eggs 
usually found in a nest ; and it has happened that an English- 
man, intending to imitate this knowing dodge, comes to the 
waggons with blistered legs, and, after great toil, finds all the 
eggs uneatable, from having been some time sat upon. Our 
countrymen invariably do best when they continue to think, 
speak, and act in their own proper character. 

The food of the ostrich consists of pods and seeds of different 
kinds of leguminous plants, with leaves of various plants ; and, as 
these are often hard and dry, he picks up a great quantity of 
pebbles, many of which are as large as marbles. He picks up 
also some small bulbs, and occasionally a wild melon to afford 
moisture, for one was found with a melon winch had choked him 
by sticking in Ins throat. It requires the utmost address of the 
Bushmen, crawling for miles on their stomachs, to stalk them 
successfully ; yet the quantity of feathers collected annually 
shows that the numbers slain must be considerable, as each bud 
has only a few in the wings and tail. The male bird is of a jet 
black glossy colour, with the single exception of the white 
feathers, winch are objects of trade. Nothing can be finer than 
the adaptation of these flossy feathers for the climate of the 
Kalahari, where these birds abound ; for they afford a perfect 
shade to the body, with free ventilation beneath them. The hen 
ostrich is of a dark brownish-grey colour, and so are the half- 
grown cocks. 



156 THE OSTRICH. Chap. VII. 

The organs of vision in this bird are placed so high that he can 
detect an enemy at a great distance, but the lion sometimes kills 
him. The flesh is white and coarse, though, when in good con- 
dition, it resembles in some degree that of a tough turkey. It 
seeks safety in flight ; but when pursued by dogs it may be seen 
to turn upon them and inflict a kick, which is vigorously applied, 
and sometimes breaks the dog's back.

The Bakalahari, who live at Motlatsa wells, have always been 
very friendly to us, and listen attentively to instruction conveyed 
to them in their own tongue. It is, however, difficult to give 
an idea to an European of the little effect teaching produces, 
because no one can realize the degradation to which their minds 
have been sunk by centuries of barbarism and hard struggling for 
the necessaries of life : like most others, they listen with respect 
and attention, but, when we kneel down and address an unseen 
Being, the position and the act often appear to them so ridicu- 
lous that they cannot refrain from bursting into uncontrollable 
laughter. After a few services they get over this tendency. I 
was once present when a missionary attempted to sing among a 
wild heathen tribe of Beclmanas, who had no music hi then com- 
position ; the effect on the risible faculties of the audience was 
such that the tears actually ran down then cheeks. Nearly all 
their thoughts are directed to the supply of then bodily wants, 
and this has been the case with the race for ages. If asked, then, 
what effect the preaching of the Gospel has at the commence- 
ment on such individuals, I am unable to tell, except that some 



158 RELIGIOUS IDEAS OF BAKWAINS. Chap. VIII. 

have confessed long afterwards that they then first began to pray 
in secret. Of the effects of a long-continued course of instruction 
there can be no reasonable doubt, as mere nominal belief has 
never been considered sufficient proof of conversion by any body 
of missionaries ; and, after the change winch has been brought 
about by this agency, we have good reason to hope well for the 
future : those I have myself witnessed behaving in the manner 
described, when kindly treated in sickness often utter imploring 
words to Jesus, and I believe sometimes really do pray to him 
in their afflictions. As that great Kedeemer of the guilty seeks 
to save all he can, we may hope that they find mercy through 
His blood, though little able to appreciate the sacrifice He made. 
The indirect and scarcely appreciable blessings of Christian mis- 
sionaries going about doing good are thus probably not so despi- 
cable as some might imagine ; there is no necessity for beginning 
to tell even the most degraded of these people of the existence of 
a God, or of a future state, the facts being universally admitted. 
Everything that cannot be accounted for by common causes is 
ascribed to the Deity, as creation, sudden death, &c. " How 
curiously Cod made these things !" is a common exj^ression ; as 
is also, " He was not killed by disease, he was killed by Cod." 
And, when speaking of the departed — though there is nought in 
the physical appearance of the dead to justify the expression — 
they say, " He has gone to the gods," the phrase being identical 
with " dbiit ad plures" 

On questioning intelligent men among the Bakwains as to 
their former knowledge of good and evil, of God, and the future 
state, they have scouted the idea of any of them ever having 
been without a tolerably clear conception on all these subjects. 
Respecting their sense of right and wrong, they profess that 
nothing we indicate as sin ever appeared to them as otherwise, 
except the statement that it was wrong to have more wives than 
one ; and they declare that they spoke in the same way of the 
direct influence exercised by God in giving rain in answer to 
prayers of the rain-makers, and in granting deliverance in times 
of danger, as they do now, before they ever heard of white men. 
The want, however, of any form of public worship, or of idols, or 
of formal prayers or sacrifice, make both Caffres and Bechuar.as 
appear as among the most godless races of mortals known any- 



Chap. VIII. LEAVE BAKWAIN COUNTRY. 159 

where. But, though they all possess a distinct knowledge of a 
deity and of a future state, they show so little reverence, and feel 
so little connexion with either, that it is not surprising that some 
have supposed them entirely ignorant on the subject. At Lotla- 
kani we met an" old Bushman who at first seemed to have no 
conception of morality whatever ; when his heart was warmed by 
our presents of meat, he sat by the fire relating his early adven- 
tures: among these was killing five other Bushmen. "Two," 
said he, counting on his fingers, " were females, one a male, and 
the other two calves." — "What a villain you are to boast of 
lolling women and children of your own nation ! what will Grod 
say when you appear before him ?" — " He will say," replied he, 
" that I was a very clever fellow." This man now appeared to 
me as without any conscience, and, of course, responsibility, but, 
on trying to enlighten him by further conversation, I discovered 
that, though he was employing the word winch is used among 
the Bakwains when speaking of the Deity, he had only the idea 
of a chief, and was all the while referring to Sekomi, wliile his 
victims were a party of rebel Bushmen against whom he had 
been sent. If I had known the name of God in the Bushman 
tongue the mistake could scarcely have occurred. It must, however, 
be recollected, while reflecting on the degradation of the natives 
of South Africa, that the farther north, the more distinct do the 
native ideas on religious subjects become, and I have not had any 
intercourse with either Caffres or Bushmen in their own tongues. 
Leaving Motlatsa on the 8th February, 1853, we passed 
down the Mokoko, which, in the memory of persons now living, 
was a flowing stream. We ourselves once saw a heavy thunder- 
shower make it assume its ancient appearance of running to 
the north. Between Lotlakani and Nchokotsa we passed the 
small well named Orapa ; and another called Thutsa lay a 
little to our right — its water is salt and purgative ; the salt-pan 
Chuantsa, having a cake of salt one inch and a half in thickness, 
is about ten miles to the north-east of Orapa. This dej:>osit 
contains a bitter salt in addition, probably the nitrate of lime ; 
the natives, in order to render it palatable and wholesome, mix 
the salt with the juice of a gummy plant, then place it in the 
sand and bake it by making a fire over it ; the lime then becomes 
insoluble and tasteless. 



1G0 NCHOKOTSA— BITTER WATERS. Chap. VIII. 

The Bamangwato keep large flocks of sheep and goats at 
various spots on this side of the Desert. They thrive wonder- 
fully well wherever salt and bushes are to be found. The milk 
of goats does not coagulate with facility, like that of cows, on 
account of its richness ; but the natives have discovered that the 
infusion of the fruit of a solanaceous plant, Toluane, quickly 
produces the effect. The Bechuanas put their milk into sacks 
made of untanned hide, with the hair taken off. Hung in the 
sun, it soon coagulates ; the whey is then drawn off by a ping 
at the bottom, and fresh milk added, until the whole sack is full 
of a thick sour curd, which, when one becomes used to it, is 
delicious. The rich mix tins in the porridge into which they 
convert their meal, and, as it is thus rendered nutritious and 
strength-giving, an expression of scorn is sometimes heard re- 
specting the poor or weak, to the effect that "they are mere 
water-porridge men." It occupies the place of our roast beef. 

At Nchokotsa, the rainy season having tins year been delayed 
beyond the usual time, we found during the day the thermo- 
meter stand at 96° in the coolest possible shade. This height at 
Kolobeng always portended rain at hand. At Kuruman, when 
it rises above 84°, the same phenomenon may be considered 
near ; while farther north it rises above 100° before the cooling 
influence of the evaporation from rain may be expected. Here 
the bulb of the thermometer, placed two inches beneath the 
soil, stood at 128°. All around Nchokotsa the country looked 
parched, and the glare from the white efflorescence which covers 
the extensive pans on all sides was most distressing to the eyes. 
The water of Nchokotsa was bitter, and presented indications 
not to be mistaken of having passed through animal systems 
before. All these waters contain nitrates, which stimulate the 
kidneys and increase the thirst. The fresh additions of water 
required in cooking meat, each imparting its own portion of salt, 
make one grumble at the cook for putting too much seasoning 
in, whilst in fact he has put in none at all, except that contained 
in the water. Of bitter, bad, disgusting waters I have drunk 
not a few nauseous draughts ; you may try alum, vitriol, boiling, 
&c. &c, to convince yourself that you are not more stupid than 
travellers you will meet at home, but the ammonia and other 



Chap. VIII. CRUELTY OF HUNTERS. 1G1 

salts are there still ; and the only remedy is to get away as 
quickly as possible to the north. 

We dug out several wells ; and as we had on each occasion to 
wait till the water flowed in again, and then allow our cattle to 
feed a day or two and slake their thirst thoroughly, as far as 
that could be done, before starting, our progress was but slow. 
At Koobe there was such a mass of mud in the pond, worked up 
by the wallowing rhinoceros to the consistency of mortar, that 
only by great labour could we get a space cleared at one side, 
for the water to ooze through and collect in for the oxen. Should 
the rhinoceros come back, a single roll in the great mass we had 
tin-own on one side would have rendered all our labour vain. It 
was therefore necessary for us to guard the spot by night. On 
these great flats all around we saw in the white sultry glare 
herds of zebras, gnus, and occasionally buffaloes, standing for 
days, looking wistfully towards the wells for a share of the nasty 
water. It is mere wanton cruelty to take advantage of the neces- 
sities of these poor animals, and shoot them down one after 
another, without intending to make the smallest use of either the 
flesh, skins, or horns. In shooting by night, animals are more 
frequently wounded than killed ; the flowing life-stream increases 
the thirst, so that in desperation they come slowly up to drink 
in spite of the danger, — " I must drink, though I die." The 
ostrich, even when not wounded, cannot with all his wariness 
resist the excessive desire to slake his burning thirst. It is 
Bushman-like practice to take advantage of its piteous neces- 
sities ; for most of the feathers they obtain are procured in this 
way, but they eat the flesh, and are so far justifiable. 

I could not order my men to do what I would not do myself; 
but, though I tried to justify myself on the plea of necessity, 
I could not adopt this mode of hunting. If your object is to 
secure the best specimens for a museum it may be allowable, and 
even deserving of commendation, as evincing a desire to kill only 
those really wanted ; but if, as has been practised by some 
Griquas and others who came into the country after Mr. Cum- 
ming, and fired away indiscriminately, great numbers of animals 
are wounded and allowed to perish miserably, or are killed on 
the spot and left to be preyed on by vultures and hyaenas, and 
all for the sole purpose of making a " bag," then I take it to be 

M 



162 VITALITY OF THE MOWANA-TKEE. Chap. VIII. 

evident that such sportsmen are pretty far gone in the hunting 
form of insanity. 

My men shot a black rhinoceros in this way, and I felt glad to 
get away from the only place in which I ever had any share in 
night-hunting. We passed over the immense pan Ntwetwe, on 
which the latitude could be taken as at sea. Great tracts of 
this part of the country are of calcareous tufa, with only a thin 
coating of soil ; numbers of " baobab " and " mopane " trees 
abound all over this hard smooth surface. About two miles 
beyond the northern bank of the pan we unyoked under a 
fine specimen of the baobab, here called, in the language of 
Bechuanas, Mowana ; it consisted of six branches united into one 
trunk. At tliree feet from the ground it was eighty-five feet in 
circumference. 

These mowana-trees are the most wonderful examples of vitality 
in the country ; it was therefore with surprise that we came upon 
a dead one at Tlomtla, a few miles beyond this spot. It is the 
same as those which Adanson and others believed, from specimens 
seen in Western Africa, to have been alive before the flood. 
Arguing with a peculiar mental idiosyncracy resembling colour- 
blindness, common among the French of the time, these savans 
came to the conclusion that " therefore there never was any flood 
at all." I would back a true mowana against a dozen floods, pro- 
vided you do not boil it in hot sea-water ; but I cannot believe 
that any of those now alive had a chance of being subjected to 
the experiment of even the Noachian deluge. The natives make 
a strong cord from the fibres contained in the pounded bark. 
The whole of the trunk, as high as they can reach, is consequently 
often quite denuded of its covering, winch in the case of almost 
any other tree would cause its death, but this has no effect on the 
mowana except to make it throw out a new bark, which is done 
in the way of granulation. This stripping of the bark is repeated 
frequently, so that it is common to see the lower five or six feet an 
inch or two less in diameter than the parts above ; even portions of 
the bark which have broken in the process of being taken off, but 
remain separated from the parts below, though still connected with 
the tree above, continue to grow, and resemble closely marks made 
in the necks of the cattle of the island of Mull and of CarTre oxen, 
where a piece of skin is detached and allowed to hang down. No 



Chap. VIII. VITALITY OF THE MOW ANA-TREE. 163 

external injury, not even a fire, can destroy this tree from without ; 
nor can any injury be done from within, as it is quite common 
to find it hollow ; and I have seen one in which twenty or thirty 
men could he down and sleep as in a hut. Nor does cutting 
down exterminate it, for I saw instances in Angola in which it 
continued to grow in length after it was lying on the ground. 
Those trees called exogenous grow by means of successive 
layers on the outside. The inside may be dead, or even removed 
altogether, without affecting the life of the tree. This is the 
case with most of the trees of our climate. The other class is 
called endogenous, and increases by layers applied to the irfside ; 
and when the hollow there is full, the growth is stopped — the tree 
must die. Any injury is felt most severely by the first class on 
the bark — by the second on the inside ; while the inside of the 
exogenous may be removed, and the outside of the endogenous may 
be cut, without stopping the growth in the least. The mowana 
possesses the powers of both. The reason is that each of the 
lamina? possesses its own independent vitality ; in fact, the baobab 
is rather a gigantic bulb run up to seed than a tree. Each of 
eighty-four concentric rings had, in the case mentioned, grown 
an inch after the tree had been blown over. The roots, which 
may often be observed extending along the surface of the ground 
forty or fifty yards from the trunk, also retain their vitality after 
the tree is laid low ; and the Portuguese now know that the best 
way to treat them is to let them alone, for they occupy much 
more room when cut down than when growing. 

The wood is so spongy and soft, that an axe can be struck in 
so far with a good blow that there is great difficulty in pulling it 
out again. In the dead mowana mentioned the concentric rings 
were well seen. The average for a foot at three different places 
was eighty-one and a half of these rings. Each of the lamina? 
can be seen to be composed of two, three, or four layers of ligneous 
tubes ; but supposing each ring the growth of one year, and the 
semidiameter of a mowana of one hundred feet in circumference 
about seventeen feet, if the central point were in the centre of 
the tree, then its age would lack some centimes of being as old 
as the Christian era (1400). Though it possesses amazing vitality, 
it is difficult to believe that this great baby-looking bulb or tree is 
as old as the pyramids.

THE MOPANE-TREE. 



Chap. VIII. 



The Mopane-tree (BanMnia) is remarkable for tlie little shade 
its leaves afford. They fold together and stand nearly perpen- 




Mopane or Bauhinia leaves, with the insect and its edible secretions 



dicular during the heat of the day, so that only the shadow of 
then edges comes to the ground. On these leaves the small larvae 
of a winged insect appear covered over with a sweet gummy sub- 
stance. The people collect this in great quantities, and use it 
as food ;* and the lopane — large caterpillars three inches long, 
which feed on the leaves, and are seen strung together — share 
the same fate. 

* I am favoured with Mr. Westwood's remarks on this insect as follows : — 

" Taylor Institution, Oxford, July 9, 1857. 

" The insect (and its secretion) on the leaves of the Bauhinia, and which is 
eaten by the Africans, proves to be a species of Psylla, a genus of small very 
active Homoptera, of which we have one very common species in the box ; but 
our species, P. buxi, emits its secretion in the shape of very long white cotton- 
like filaments ; but there is a species in New Holland, found on the leaves of 
the Eucalyptus, which emits a secretion very similar to that of Dr. Livingstone's 
species. This Australian secretion (and its insect originator) is known by the 
name of Wo-me-la, and, like Dr. Livingstone's, it is scraped off the leaves and 
eaten by the aborigines as a saccharine dainty. The insects found beneath the 
secretion, brought home by Dr. Livingstone, are in the pupa state, being 
flattened, with large scales at the sides of the body, enclosing the future wings 
of the insect. The body is pale yellowish coloured, with dark-brown spots. 
It will be impossible to describe the species technically until we receive the 
perfect insect. The secretion itself is flat and circular, apparently deposited 
in concentric rings, gradually increasing in size till the patches are about a 
quarter or a third of an inch in diameter. 

" Jno. 0. Westwood." 



Chap. VIII. MORAL A-TREE— BUSHMEN. 165 

In passing along we see everywhere the power of vegetation in 
breaking up the outer crust of tufa. A mopane-tree, growing in 
a small chink, as it increases in size rends and lifts up large 
fragments of the rock all around it, subjecting them to the dis- 
integrating influence of the atmosphere. The wood is hard, and 
of a fine red colour, and is named non-wood by the Portuguese. 
The inhabitants, observing that the mopane is more frequently 
struck by lightning than other trees, caution travellers never to 
seek its shade when a thunder-storm is near — " Lightning hates 
it ;" while another tree, the " Morala," which has three spines 
opposite each other on the branches, and has never been 
known to be touched by lightning, is esteemed, even as far as 
Angola, a protection against the electric fluid. Branches of it 
may be seen placed on the houses of the Portuguese for the same 
purpose. The natives, moreover, believe that a man is thoroughly 
protected from an enraged elephant, if he can get into the shade 
of this tree. There may not be much in this, but there is fre- 
quently some foundation of truth in their observations. 

At Eapesh we came among our old friends the Bushmen, 
under Horoye. Tins man, Horoye, a good spechnen of that 
tribe, and his son Mokantsa and others, were at least six feet 
high, and of a darker colour than the Bushmen of the south. 
They have always plenty of food and water ; and as they frequent 
the Zouga as often as the game in company with which they 
live, their life is very different from that of the inhabitants of the 
thirsty plains of the Kalahari. The animal they refrain from 
eating is the goat, which fact, taken in connection with the 
superstitious dread which exists in every tribe towards a parti- 
cular animal, is significant of their feelings to the only animals 
they could have domesticated in their desert home. They are a 
merry laughing set, and do not tell lies wantonly. They have in 
their superstitious rites more appearance of worship than the 
Bechuanas ; and at a Bushman's grave we once came to on the 
Zouga, the observances showed distinctly that they regarded the 
dead as still in another state of being ; for they addressed him, 
and requested him not to be offended even though they wished 
still to remain a little while longer in this world. 

Those among whom we now were kill many elephants ; and 
when the moon is full choose that time for the chace, on account 



166 CIVILIZED AND BARBAROUS SPORTSMEN. Chap. VIII. 

of its coolness. Hunting this animal is the best test of courage 
this country affords. The Bushmen choose the moment suc- 
ceeding a charge, when the elephant is out of breath, to run in 
and give him a stab with then* long-bladed spears. In this case 
the uncivilized have the advantage over us, but I believe that 
with half their training Englishmen would beat the Bushmen. 
Our present form of civilization does not necessarily produce 
effeminacy, though it unquestionably increases the beauty, cou- 
rage, and physical powers of the race. When at Kolobeng I 
took notes of the different numbers of elephants killed in the 
course of the season by the various parties which went past our 
dwelling, in order to form an idea of the probable annual de- 
struction of this noble animal. There were parties of Griquas, 
Bechuanas, Boers, and Englishmen. All were eager to distin- 
guish themselves, and success depended mainly on the courage 
which leads the huntsman to go close to the animal, and not 
waste the force of his shot on the air. It was noticeable that the 
average for the natives was under one per man, for the Griquas 
one per man, for the Boers two, and for the English officers 
twenty each. This was the more remarkable, as the Griquas, 
Boers, and Bechuanas employed both dogs and natives to assist 
them, while the English hunters generally had no assistance from 
either. They approached to witlrin thirty yards of the animal, 
while the others stood at a distance of a hundred yards, or even 
more, and of course spent all the force of their bullets on the air. 
One elephant was found by Mr. Oswell with quite a crowd of 
bullets in Ins side, all evidently fired in this style, and they had 
not gone near the vital parts. 

It would thus appear that our more barbarous neighbours do 
not possess half the courage of the civilized sportsman. And it is 
probable that in this respect, as well as in physical development, 
we are superior to our ancestors. The coats of mail and greaves 
of the Knights of Malta, and the armour from the Tower exhibited 
at the Eglinton tournament, may be considered decisive as to 
the greater size attained by modern civilized men. 

At Maila we spent a Sunday with Kaisa, the head man of a 
village of Mashona, who had fled from the iron sway of Mosilikatse, 
whose country lies east of this. I wished him to take charge 
of a packet of letters for England, to be forwarded when, as is

the custom of the Bamangwato, the Bechuanas come hither in 
search of skins and food among the Bushmen; but he could 
not be made to comprehend that there was no danger in the 
consignment. He feared the responsibility and guilt if anything 
should happen to them ; so I had to bid adieu to all hope of 
letting my family hear of my welfare till I should reach the west 
coast. 

At Unku we came into a tract of country which had been 
visited by refreshing showers long before, and every spot was 
covered with grass run up to seed, and the flowers of the forest 
were in full bloom. Instead of the dreary prospect around Koobe 
and Nchokotsa, we had here a delightful scene, all the ponds full 
of water, and the birds twittering joyfully. As the game can now 
obtain water everywhere, they become very shy, and cannot be 
found in then accustomed haunts. 

1st March. The thermometer in the shade generally stood at 
98° from 1 to 3 p.m., but it sank as low as 65° by night, so that 
the heat was by no means exhausting. At the surface of the 
ground, in the sun, the thermometer marked 125°, and three 
inches below it 138°. The hand cannot be held on the ground, 
and even the horny soles of the feet of the natives must be pro- 
tected by sandals of hide ; yet the ants were busy working on it. 
The water in the ponds was as high as 100° ; but as water does 
not conduct heat readily downwards, deliciously cool water may 
be obtained by any one walking into the middle and lifting up 
the water from the bottom to the surface with his hands. 

Proceeding to the north, from Kama-kama, we entered into 
dense Mohonono bush, which required the constant application of 
the axe by three of our party for two days. Tins bush has fine 
silvery leaves, and the bark has a sweet taste. The elephant, 
with his usual delicacy of taste, feeds much on it. On emerging 
into the plains beyond, we found a number of Bushmen, who 
afterwards proved very serviceable. The rains had been copious, 
but now great numbers of pools were drying up. Lotus-plants 
abounded in them, and a low sweet-scented plant covered their 
banks. Breezes came occasionally to us from these drying-up 
pools ; but the pleasant odour they carried caused sneezing in 
both myself and people ; and on the 10th of March (when in 
lat. 19° 16' 11" S., long. 24° 24' E.) we were brought to a stand

by four of the party being seized with fever. I had seen this 
disease before, but did not at once recognise it as the African 
fever ; I imagined it was only a bilious attack, arising from full 
feeding on flesh, for, the large game having been very abundant, 
we always had a good supply ; but instead of the first sufferers 
recovering soon, every man of our party was in a few days laid 
low, except a Bakwain lad and myself. He managed the oxen, 
while I attended to the wants of the patients, and went out occa- 
sionally with the Bushmen to get a zebra or buffalo, so as to 
induce them to remain with us. 

Here for the first time I had leisure to follow the instructions 
of my kind teacher, Mr. Maclear, and calculated several longi- 
tudes from lunar distances. The hearty manner in which that 
eminent astronomer and frank friendly man had promised to aid 
me in calculating and verifying my work, conduced more than 
anything else to inspire me with perseverance in making astrono- 
mical observations throughout the journey. 

The grass here was so tall that the oxen became uneasy, and 
one night the sight of a hygena made them rush away into the 
forest to the east of us. On rising on the morning of the 19th 
I found that my Bakwain lad had run away with them. This I 
have often seen with persons of this tribe, even when the cattle 
are startled by a lion. Away go the young men in company with 
them, and dash through bush and brake for miles, till they think 
the panic is a little subsided ; they then commence whistling to 
the cattle in the manner they do when milking the cows : having 
calmed them, they remain as a guard till the morning. The men 
generally return with their shins well peeled by the thorns. Each 
comrade of the Mopato would expect his fellow to act thus, without 
looking for any other reward than the brief praise of the chief. 
Our lad Kibopechoe had gone after the oxen, but had lost them 
in the rush through the flat trackless forest. He remained on 
their trail all the next day and all the next night. On Sunday 
morning, as I was setting off in search of him, I found him near 
the waggon. He had found the oxen late in the afternoon of 
Saturday, and had been obliged to stand by them all night. It 
was wonderful how he managed without a compass, and in such a 
country, to find Ins way home at all, bringing about forty oxen 
with lihn. 



Chap. VIII. GEAPES. 109 

The Bechuanas will keep on the sick-list as long as they feel 
any weakness ; so I at last began to be anxious that they should 
make a little exertion to get forward on our way. One of them, 
however, happening to move a hundred yards from the waggon, 
fell down ; and, being unobserved, remained the whole night in 
the pouring rain totally insensible ; another was subjected to fre- 
quent swooning : but making beds in the waggons for these our 
worst cases, with the help of *the Bakwain and the Bushmen, we 
moved slowly on. We had to nurse the sick like children ; and, 
like children recovering from illness, the better they became the 
more impudent they grew. This was seen in the peremptory 
orders they would give with their now piping voices. Nothing 
that we did pleased them ; and the laughter with winch I received 
their ebullitions, though it was only the real expression of gladness 
at their recovery, and amusement at the ridiculous part they acted, 
only increased their chagrin. The want of power in the man who 
guided the two front oxen, or, as he was called, the " leader," 
caused us to be entangled with trees, both standing and fallen, 
and the labour of cutting them down was even more severe than 
ordinary ; but notwithstanding an immense amount of toil, my 
health continued good. 

We wished to avoid the tsetse of our former path, so kept a 
course on the magnetic meridian from Lurilopepe. The necessity 
of making a new path much increased our toil. We were, however, 
rewarded in lat. 18° with a sight we had not enjoyed the year 
before, namely, large patches of grape-bearing vines. There they 
stood before my eyes ; but the sight was so entirely unexpected 
that I stood some time gazing at the clusters of grapes with which 
they were loaded, with no more thought of plucking than if I had 
been beholding them in a dream. The Bushmen know and eat 
them ; but they are not well flavoured on account of the great 
astringency of the seeds, which are in shape and size like split 
peas. The elephants are fond of the fruit, plant, and root alike. 
I here found an insect which preys on ants ; it is about an inch 
and a quarter long, as thick as a crow-quill, and covered with black 
hair. It puts its head into a little hole in the ground, and quivers 
its tail rapidly ; the ants come near to see it, and it snaps up each 
as he comes within the range of the forceps on its tail. As its 
head is beneath the ground, it becomes a question how it can 



170 AN ANTEATEB. Chap. VIU. 

guide its tail to the ants. It is probably a new species of ant- 
lion (Myrmeleon formicaleo), great numbers of which, both in the 
larvre and complete state, are met with. The ground under 
every tree is dotted over with their ingenious pitfalls, and the 
perfect insect, the form of which most persons are familiar with 
in the dragon-fly, may be seen using its tail in the same active 
manner as this insect did. Two may often be seen joined in 
their flight, the one holding on by the tail-forceps to the neck of 
the other. On first observing this imperfect insect, I imagined 
the forceps were on its head ; but when the insect moved, their 
true position was seen. 

The forest, through which we were slowly toiling, daily became 
more dense, and we were kept almost constantly at work with the 
axe ; there was much more leafiness in the trees here than farther 
south. The leaves are chiefly of the pinnate and bi-pinnate forms, 
and are exceedingly beautiful when seen against the sky ; a great 
variety of the papilionaceous family grow in this part of the country. 

Fleming had until this time always assisted to drive his own 
waggon, but about the end of March he knocked up, as well as 
his people. As I could not drive two waggons, I shared with him 
the remaining water, half a caskful, and went on, with the inten- 
tion of coming back for him as soon as we should reach the next 
pool. Heavy rain now commenced ; I was employed the whole 
day hi cutting down trees, and every stroke of the axe brought 
down a thick shower on my back, which in the hard work was 
very refreshing, as the water found its way down into my shoes. 
In the evening we met some Bushmen, who volunteered to show 
us a pool ; and having unyoked, I walked some miles in search of 
it. As it became dark they showed their politeness — a quality 
winch is by no means confined entirely to the civilized — by walk- 
ing in front, breaking the branches which hung across the path, 
and pointing out the fallen trees. On returning to the waggon, 
we found that being left alone had brought out some of Fleming's 
energy, for he had managed to come up. 

As the water in this pond dried up, we were soon obliged to 
move again. One of the Bushmen took out his dice, and, after 
throwing them, said that God told him to go home. He threw 
again in order to show me the command, but the opposite result 
followed ; so he remained and was useful, for we lost the oxen 



Chap. VIII. BUSHMEN'S POISONS. 171 

again by a lion driving them off to a very great distance. The 
lions here are not often heard. They seem to have a wholesome 
dread of the Bushmen, who, when they observe evidence of a 
lion's having made a full meal, follow up his spoor so quietly that 
Ins slumbers are not disturbed. One discharges a poisoned arrow 
from a distance of only a few feet, while his companion simul- 
taneously throws his skin cloak on the beast's head. The sudden 
surprise makes the Hon lose Ins presence of mind, and he bounds 
away in the greatest confusion and terror. Our friends here 
showed me the poison winch they use on these occasions. It is 
the entrails of a caterpillar called N'gwa, half an inch long. 
They squeeze out these, and place them all around the bottom of 
the barb, and allow the poison to dry in the sun. They are very 
careful hi cleaning then nails after working with it, as a small 
portion mtroduced into a scratch acts like morbid matter in dis- 
section wounds. The agony is so great that the person cuts him- 
self, calls for his mother's breast as if he were returned in idea to 
his childhood again, or flies from human habitations a raging 
maniac. The effects on the Hon are equally terrible. He is heard 
moaning in distress, and becomes furious, biting the trees and 
ground in rage. 

As the Bushmen have the reputation of curing the wounds of 
this poison, I asked how this was effected. They said that they 
administer the caterpillar itself in combination with fat ; they 
also rub fat into the wound, saying that "the N'gwa wants fat, 
and, when it does not find it in the body, kills the man : we give 
it what it wants, and it is content " — a reason which will com- 
mend itself to the enlightened among ourselves. 

The poison more generally employed is the milky juice of 
the tree Euphorbia (E. arborescens). This is particularly ob- 
noxious to the equine race. When a quantity is mixed Avith the 
water of a pond a whole herd of zebras will fall dead from the 
effects of the poison before they have moved away two miles. It 
does not, however, kill oxen or men. On them it acts as a drastic 
purgative only. This substance is used all over the country, 
though in some places the venom of serpents and a certain bulb, 
Amaryllis toxicaria, are added, in order to increase the virulence. 
Father Pedro, a Jesuit, who lived at Zumbo, made a balsam, 
containing a number of plants and castor oil, as a remedy for 



172 THE BUSHMEN. Chap. VIII. 

poisoned arrow-wounds. It is probable that lie derived his know- 
ledge from the natives as I did, and that the reputed efficacy of 
the balsam is owing to its fatty constituent. 

In cases of the bites of serpents a small key ought to be pressed 
down firmly on the wound, the orifice of the key being applied to 
the puncture, until a cupping-glass can be got from one of the 
natives. A watch-key pressed firmly on the point stung by a 
scorpion extracts the poison; and a mixture of fat or oil and 
ipecacuanha relieves the pain. 

The Bushmen of these districts are generally fine well-made 
men, and are nearly independent of every one. We observed 
them to be fond of a root somewhat like a kidney potato, and the 
kernel of a nut, which Fleming thought was a kind of betel ; the 
tree is a fine large spreading one, and the leaves palmate. From 
the quantities of berries and the abundance of game in these 
parts, the Bushmen can scarcely ever be badly off for food. As 
I could without much difficulty keep them well supplied with 
meat, and wished them to remain, I proposed that they should 
bring their wives to get a share, but they remarked that the 
women could always take care of themselves. 

None of the men of our party had died, but two seemed 
unlikely to recover; and Kibopechoe, my willing Mokwain, at 
last became troubled with boils, and then got all the symptoms 
of fever. As he lay down, the others began to move about, and 
complained of weakness only. Believing that frequent change of 
place was conducive to their recovery, we moved along as much 
as we could, and came to the hill N'gwa (lat. 18° 27' 20" S., long. 
24° 13' 36" E.). This being the only hill we had seen since 
leaving the Bamangwato, we felt inclined to take off our hats to it. 
It is three or four hundred feet high, and covered with trees. Its 
geographical position is pretty accurately laid down from occupa- 
tion and other observations. I may mention that the valley on its 
northern side, named Kandehy, or Kandehai, is as picturesque a 
spot as is to be seen in tins part of Africa. The open glade, sur- 
rounded by forest trees of various hues, had a little stream mean- 
dering in the centre. A herd of reddish-coloured antelopes (pallahs) 
stood on one side, near a large baobab, looking at us, and ready to 
run up the lull ; while gnus, tsessebes, and zebras gazed in asto- 
nishment at the intruders. Some fed carelessly, and others put 



Chap. VIII. BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY. 173 

on the peculiar air of displeasure which these animals sometimes 
assume before they resolve on flight. A large white rhinoceros 
came along the bottom of the valley with his slow sauntering gait 
without noticing us ; he looked as if he meant to indulge in a 
mud bath. Several buffaloes, with their dark visages, stood under 
the trees on the side opposite to the pallahs. It being Sunday, 
all was peace, and, from the circumstances in which our party 
was placed, we could not but reflect on that second stage of our 
existence which we hope will lead us into scenes of perfect beauty. 
If pardoned in that free way the Bible promises, death will be a 
glorious thing ; but to be consigned to wait for the Judgment- 
day, with nothing else to ponder on but sins we would rather 
forget, is a cheerless prospect. 

Our Bushmen wished to leave us, and, as there was no use in 
trying to thwart these independent gentlemen, I paid them, and 
allowed them to go. The payment, however, acted as a charm on 
some strangers who happened to be present, and induced them to 
volunteer their aid. 

The game hereabouts is very tame. Koodoos and giraffes stood 
gazing at me as a strange apparition when I went out with the 
Bushmen. On one occasion a Hon came at daybreak, and went 
round and round the oxen. I could only get a glimpse of him 
occasionally from the waggon-box ; but, though barely thirty 
yards off, I could not get a shot. He then began to roar at the 
top of his voice ; but the oxen continuing to stand still, he was so 
disgusted that he went off, and continued to use his voice for a 
long time in the distance. I could not see that he had a mane ; 
if he had not, then even the maneless variety can use their 
tongues. We heard others also roar ; and, when they found they 
could not frighten the oxen, they became equally angry. This 
we could observe in their tones. 

As we went north the country became very lovely ; many new 
trees appeared ; the grass was green, and often higher than the 
waggons; the vines festooned the trees, among which appeared 
the real banian (Ficus indica), with its drop-shoots, and the wild 
date and palmyra, and several other trees which were new to 
me ; the hollows contained large patches of water. Next came 
watercourses, now resembling small rivers, twenty yards broad 
and four feet deep. The further we went, the broader and deeper 



174 THE SANSHUItEH. Chap. VIII. 

these became ; their bottoms contained great numbers of deep 
holes, made by elephants wading in them; in these the oxen 
floundered desperately, so that our waggon-pole broke, compelling 
us to work up to the breast in water for three hours and a half; 
yet I suffered no harm. 

We at last came to the Sanshureh, which presented an im- 
passable barrier, so we drew up under a magnificent baobab-tree 
(lat. 18° 4' 27" S., long. 24° 6' 20" E.), and resolved to explore 
the river for a ford. The great quantity of water we had passed 
through was part of the annual inundation of the Chobe ; and 
this, which appeared a large deep river, filled in many parts 
with reeds, and having hippopotami in it, is only one of the 
branches by winch it sends its superabundant water to the south- 
east. From the hill N'gwa a ridge of higher land runs to the 
north-east, and bounds its course in that direction. We, being 
ignorant of this, were in the valley, and the only gap in the 
whole country destitute of tsetse. In company with the Bushmen 
I explored all the banks of the Sanshureh to the west, till we 
came into tsetse on that side. We waded a long way among the 
reeds in water breast deep, but always found a broad deep space 
free from vegetation, and unfordable. A peculiar kind of lichen, 
which grows on the surface of the soil, becomes detached and 
floats on the water, giving out a very disagreeable odour, like 
sulphuretted hydrogen, in some of these stagnant waters. 

We made so many attempts to get over the Sanshureh, both 
to the west and east of the waggon, in the hope of reaching some 
of the Makololo on the Chobe, that my Bushmen friends became 
quite tired of the work. By means of presents I got them to 
remain some days ; but at last they slipped away by night, and 
I was fain to take one of the strongest of my still weak com- 
panions and cross the river in a pontoon, the gift of Captains 
Codrington and Webb. We each carried some provisions and a 
blanket, and penetrated about twenty miles to the westward, in 
the hope of striking the Chobe. It was much nearer to us in a 
northerly direction, but this we did not then know. The plain, 
over which we splashed the whole of the first day, was covered 
with water ankle deep, and thick grass which reached above the 
knees. In the evening we came to an immense wall of reeds, 
six or eight feet high, without any opening admitting of a passage. 



Chap. VIII. BANKS OF THE CHOBE. 175 

When we tried to enter, the water always became so deep that 
we were fain to desist. We concluded that we had come to the 
banks of the river we were in search of, so we directed our course 
to some trees winch appeared in the south, in order to get a bed 
and a view of the adjacent locality. Having shot a leche, and 
made a glorious fire, we got a good cup of tea and had a com- 
fortable night. While collecting wood that evening, I found a 
bird's nest consisthig of live leaves sewn together with threads 
of the spider's web. Nothing could exceed the airiness of 
this pretty contrivance ; the threads had been pushed through 
small punctures and thickened to resemble a knot. I unfor- 
tunately lost it. This was the second nest I have seen resembling 
that of the tailor-bird of India. 

Next morning, by climbing the highest trees, we could see a 
fine large sheet of water, but surrounded on all sides by the same 
impenetrable belt of reeds. This is the broad part of the river 
Chobe, and is called Zabesa. Two tree-covered islands seemed 
to be much nearer to the water than the shore on which we were, 
so we made an attempt to get to them first. It was not the reeds 
alone we had to pass through ; a peculiar serrated grass, which 
at certain angles cut the hands like a razor, was mingled with 
the reed, and the climbing convolvulus, with stalks which felt as 
strong as whipcord, bound the mass together. We felt like 
pigmies in it, and often the only way we could get on was by both of 
us leaning against a part and bending it down till we could stand 
upon it. The perspiration streamed off our bodies, and as the 
sun rose high, there being no ventilation among the reeds, the 
heat was stifling, and the water, which was up to the knees, felt 
agreeably refreshing. After some hours' toil we reached one of 
the islands. Here we met an old friend, the bramble-bush. 
My strong moleskins were quite worn through at the knees, and 
the leather trousers of my companion were torn and his legs 
bleeding. Tearing my handkerchief in two, I tied the pieces 
round my knees, and then encountered another difficulty. We 
were still forty or fifty yards from the clear water, but now we 
were opposed by great masses of papyrus, which are like palms 
in miniature, eight or ten feet high, and an inch and a half in 
diameter. These were laced together by twining convolvulus, so 
strongly that the weight of both of us could not make way into 
the clear water. At last we fortunately found a passage prepared 



176 THE CHOBE. Chap. VIII. 

by a hippopotamus. Eager as soon as we reached the island to 
look along the vista to clear water, I stepped in and found it took 
me at once up to the neck. 

Returning nearly worn out, we proceeded up the bank of the 
Chobe, till we came to the point of departure of the branch 
Sanshureh ; we then went in the opposite direction, or down the 
Chobe, though from the highest trees we could see nothing but one 
vast expanse of reed, with here and there a tree on the islands. This 
was a hard day's work ; and when we came to a deserted Bayeiye 
hut on an anthill, not a bit of wood or anything else could be got 
for a fire, except the grass and sticks of the dwelling itself. I 
dreaded the " Tampans," so common in all old huts ; but outside 
of it we had thousands of mosquitoes, and cold dew began to be 
deposited, so we were fain to crawl beneath its shelter. 

We were close to the reeds, and could listen to the strange 
sounds winch are often heard there. By day I had seen water- 
snakes putting up their heads and swimming about. There were 
great numbers of otters (Lutra inunguis, F. Cuvier), which have 
made little spoors all over the plains in search of the fishes, 
among the tall grass of these flooded prairies ; curious birds, too, 
jerked and wriggled among these reedy masses, and we heard 
human-like voices and unearthly sounds, with splash, guggle, jupp, 
as if rare fun were going on in their uncouth haunts. At one time 
something came near us, making a splashing like that of a canoe 
or hippopotamus : thinking it to be the Makololo, we got up, 
listened, and shouted ; then discharged a gun several times ; but 
the noise continued without intermission for an hour. After a 
damp cold night we set to, early in the morning, at our work of 
exploring again, but left the pontoon in order to lighten our 
labour. The antliills are here very high, some thirty feet, and 
of a base so broad that trees grow on them ; while the lands, 
annually flooded, bear nothing but grass. From one of these ant- 
hills we discovered an inlet to the Chobe ; and, having gone back 
for the pontoon, we launched ourselves on a deep river, here from 
eighty to one hundred yards wide. I gave my companion strict 
injunctions to stick by the pontoon in case a hippopotamus should 
look at us ; nor was this caution unnecessary, for one came up at 
our side and made a desperate plunge off. We had passed over 
him. The wave lie made caused the pontoon to glide quickly 
away from him. 



Chap. VIII. EETUKN TO LINYANTI. 177 

We paddled on from midday till sunset. There was nothing 
but a wall of reed on each bank, and we saw every prospect of 
spending a supperless night in our float ; but just as the short 
twilight of these parts was commencing, we perceived on the north 
bank the village of Moremi, one of the Makololo, whose acquaint- 
ance I had made in our former visit, and who was now 
located on the island Mahonta (lat. 17° 58' S., long. 24° 6' E.). 
The villagers looked as we may suppose people do who see a 
ghost, and in their figurative way of speaking said, " He has 
dropped among us from the clouds, yet came riding on the back 
of a Inppopotamus ! We Makololo thought no one could cross 
the Chobe without our knowledge, but here he drops among us 
like a bird." 

Next day we returned in canoes across the flooded lands, and 
found that, in our absence, the men had allowed the cattle to 
wander into a very small patch of wood to the west containing 
the tsetse ; this carelessness cost me ten fine large oxen. After 
remaining a few days, some of the head men of the Makololo 
came down from Linyanti, with a large party of Barotse, to take 
us across the river. This they did in fine style, swimming and 
diving among the oxen more like alligators than men, and taking 
the waggons to pieces and carrying them across on a number of 
canoes lashed together. We were now among friends ; so going 
about thirty miles to the north, in order to avoid the still flooded 
lands on the north of the Chobe, we turned westwards towards 
Linyanti (lat. 18° 17' 20" S., long. 23° 50' 9" E.), where we 
arrived on the 23rd of May, 1853. This is the capital town of 
the Makololo, and only a short distance from our waggon-stand 
of 1851 (lat. 18° 20' S., long. 23° 50' E.).

The whole population of Linyanti, numbering between six and 
seven thousand souls, turned out en masse to see the waggons in * 
motion. They had never witnessed the phenomenon before, we 
having on the former occasion departed by night. Sekeletu, now 
in power, received us in what is considered royal style, setting 
before us a great number of pots of boyaloa, the beer of the 
country. These were brought by women, and each bearer takes 
a good draught of the beer when she sets it down, by way of 
" tasting," to show that there is no poison. 

The court herald, an old man who occupied the post also in 
Sebituane's time, stood up, and after some antics, such as leaping, 
and shouting at the top of his voice, roared out some adulatory 
sentences, as, "Don't I see the white man? Don't I see the 
comrade of Sebituane ? Don't I see the father of Sekeletu ? " — 
" We want sleep " — " Give your son sleep, my lord," &c. &c. 
The perquisites of this man are the heads of all the cattle 
slaughtered by the chief, and he even takes a share of the tribute 
before it is distributed and taken out of the kotla. He is ex- 
pected to utter all the proclamations, call assemblies, keep the 
kotla clean, and the fire burning every evening, and when a 
person is executed in public he drags away the body. 

I found Sekeletu a young man of eighteen years of age, of

that dark-yellow or coffee-and-milk colour, of which the Makololo 
are so proud, because it distinguishes them considerably from the 
black tribes on the rivers. He is about five feet seven in height, 
and neither so goodlooldng, nor of so much ability, as his father 
was, but is equally friendly to the English. Sebituane installed 
his daughter Mamochisane into the chieftainship long before his 
death, but, with all Ins acuteness, the idea of her having a husband 
who should not be her lord did not seem to enter his mind. 
He wished to make her Ins successor, probably in imitation of 
some of the negro tribes with whom he had come into contact ; 
but, being of the Bechuana race, he could not look upon the hus- 
band except as the woman's lord, so he told her all the men were 
hers, she might take any one, but ought to keep none. In fact, 
he thought she might do with the men what he could do with the 
women ; but these men had other wives ; and according to a saying 
in the country, " the tongues of women cannot be governed," 
they made her miserable by their remarks. One man whom 
she chose was even called her wife, and her son the child of 
Mamochisane's wife; but the arrangement was so distasteful 
to Mamochisane herself, that, as soon as Sebituane died, she said 
she never would consent to govern the Makololo so long as she 
had a brother living. Sekeletu, being afraid of another mem- 
ber of the family, 'Mpepe, who had pretensions to the chief- 
tainship, urged Ins sister strongly to remain as she had always 
been, and allow him to support her authority by leading the 
Makololo when they went forth to war. Three days were spent 
in public discussion on the point. Mpepe insinuated that Seke- 
letu was not the lawful son of Sebituane, on account of Ins mother 
having been the wife of another chief before her marriage with 
Sebituane ; Maniochisane, however, upheld Sekeletu's claims, and 
at last stood up in the assembly and addressed him with a womanly 
gush of tears : " I have been a chief only because my father 
wished it. I always would have preferred to be married and have 
a family like other women. You, Sekeletu, must be chief and 
build up your father's house." Tins was a death-blow to the 
hopes of Mpepe. 

As it will enable the reader to understand the social and poli- 
tical relations of these people, I will add a few more particulars 
respecting Mpepe. Sebituane, having no son to take the leader-

ship of the " Mopato " of the age of his daughter, chose him as 
the nearest male relative to occupy that post; and presuming 
from Mpepe's connection with his family that he would attend to 
his interests and relieve him from care, he handed his cattle over 
to Ins custody. Mpepe removed to the chief town, " Naliele," 
and took such effectual charge of all the cattle, that Sebituane 
saw he could only set matters on their former footing by the 
severe measure of Mpepe's execution. Being unwilling to do 
this, and fearing the enchantments which, by means of a number 
of Barotse doctors, Mpepe now used in a hut built for the 
purpose, and longing for peaceful retirement after thirty years' 
fighting, he heard with pleasure of our arrival at the lake, and 
came down as far as Sesheke to meet us. He had an idea, 
picked up from some of the numerous strangers who visited him, 
that white men had a " pot (a cannon) in their towns which would 
burn up any attacking party ;" and he thought if he could only 
get this he would be able to " sleep " the remainder of his days 
in peace. This he hoped to obtain from the white men. Hence 
the cry of the herald — " Give us sleep." It is remarkable how 
anxious for peace those who have been fighting all their lives 
appear to be. 

When Sekeletu was installed in the chieftainship, he felt his 
position rather insecure, for it was believed that the incantations 
of Mpepe had an intimate connection with Sebituane's death. 
Indeed, the latter had said to his son, " That hut of incantation 
will prove fatal to either you or me." 

When the Mambari, in 1850, took home a favourable report of 
this new market to the west, a number of half-caste Portuguese 
slave-traders were induced to come in 1853 ; and one, who re- 
sembled closely a real Portuguese, came to Linyanti while I was 
there. This man had no merchandise, and pretended to have 
come in order to inquire " what sort of goods were necessary for 
the market." He seemed much disconcerted by my presence 
there. Sekeletu presented him with an elephant's tusk and an 
ox ; and when he had departed about fifty miles to the west- 
ward, he carried off an entire village of the Bakalahari belonging 
to the Makololo. He had a number of armed slaves with him ; 
and as all the villagers — men, women, and children — were re- 
moved, and the fact was unknown until a considerable time 



Chap. IX. SLAVE-TEADEES. 181 

afterwards, it is not certain whether his object was obtained by 
violence or by fair promises. In either case, slavery must have 
been the portion of these poor people. He was carried in a 
hammock, slung between two poles, which appearing to be a bag, 
the Makololo named him " Father of the Bag." 

Mpepe favoured these slave-traders, and they, as is usual with 
them, founded all their hopes of influence on his successful re- 
bellion. My arrival on the scene was felt to be so much weight 
in the scale against their interests. A large party of Mambari 
had come to Linyanti when I was floundering on the prairies 
south of the Chobe. As the news of my being in the neighbour- 
hood reached them their countenances fell ; and when some 
Makololo, who had assisted us to cross the river, returned with 
hats winch I had given them, the Mambari betook themselves to 
precipitate flight. It is usual for visitors to ask formal permis- 
sion before attempting to leave a chief, but the sight of the hats 
made the Mambari pack up at once. The Makololo inquired the 
cause of the hurry, and were told that, if I found them there, I 
should take all their slaves and goods from them ; and though 
assured by Sekeletu that I was not a robber, but a man of peace, 
they fled by night, while I was still sixty miles off. They went 
to the north, where, under the protection of Mpepe, they had 
erected a stockade of considerable size ; there several half-caste 
slave-traders, under the leadership of a native Portuguese, carried 
on then traffic, without reference to the chief into whose country 
they had unceremoniously introduced themselves ; while Mpepe, 
feeding them with the cattle of Sekeletu, formed a plan of raising 
himself, by means of their fire-arms, to be the head of the Mako- 
lolo. The usual course which the slave-traders adopt is to take 
a part in the political affairs of each tribe, and, siding with the 
strongest, get well paid by captures made from the weaker party. 
Long secret conferences were held by the slave-traders and 
Mpepe, and it was deemed advisable for him to strike the first 
blow ; so he provided himself with a small battle-axe, with the 
intention of cutting Sekeletu down the first time they met. 

My object being first of all to examine the country for a 
healthy locality, before attempting to make a path to either the 
east or west coast, I proposed to Sekeletu the plan of ascending 
the great river which we had discovered in 1851. He volun- 



182 EXECUTION OF MPEPE. Chap. IX. 

teered to accompany me ; and when we got about sixty miles 
away, on the road to Sesheke, we encountered Mpepe. The 
Makololo, though possessing abundance of cattle, had never 
attempted to ride oxen, until I advised it in 1851. The Bechu- 
anas generally were in the same condition, until Europeans came 
among them and imparted the idea of riding. All their journeys 
previously were performed on foot. Sekeletu and his companions 
were mounted on oxen, though, having neither saddle nor bridle, 
they were perpetually falling off. Mpepe, armed with his little 
axe, came along a path parallel to, but a quarter of a mile distant 
from, that of our party ; and when he saw Sekeletu he ran with 
all Ins might towards us ; but Sekeletu, being on Ins guard, gal- 
loped off to an adjacent village. He then withdrew somewhere 
till all our party came up. Mpepe had given his own party to 
understand that he would cut down Sekeletu, either on their first 
meeting, or at the breaking up of their first conference. The 
former intention having been thus frustrated, he then determined 
to effect his purpose after their first interview. I happened to sit 
down between the two in the hut where they met : being tired 
with riding all day in the sun, I soon asked Sekeletu where I 
should sleep, and he replied, " Come, I will show you." As we 
rose together, I unconsciously covered Sekeletu's body with 
mine, and saved him from the blow of the assassin. I knew 
nothing of the plot, but remarked that all Mpepe's men kept 
hold of their arms, even after we had sat down — a thing quite 
unusual in the presence of a chief; and when Sekeletu showed 
me the hut in which I was to spend the night, he said to me, 
" That man wishes to kill me." I afterwards learnt that some 
of Mpepe's attendants had divulged the secret ; and, bearing in 
mind his father's instructions, Sekeletu put Mpepe to death that 
night. It was managed so quietly, that, although I was sleeping 
within a few yards of the scene, I knew nothing of it till the next 
day. Nokuane went to the fire at which Mpepe sat, with a 
handful of snuff, as if he were about to sit down and regale him- 
self therewith. Mpepe said to him, " Nsepisa " (cause me to take 
a pinch) ; and, as he held out his hand, Nokuane caught hold of 
it, wliile another man seized the other hand, and, leading him out 
a mile, speared him. This is the common mode of executing 
criminals. They are not allowed to speak ; though on one occa- 



Chap. IX. COURTS OF LAW. 183 

sion a man, feeling his wrist held too tightly, said, " Hold me 
gently, can't you? you will soon be led out in the same way 
yourselves." Mpepe's men fled to the Barotse, and, it being 
unadvisable for us to go thither during the commotion which 
followed on Mpepe's death, we returned to Linyanti. 

The foregoing may be considered as a characteristic specimen 
of their mode of dealing with grave political offences. In common 
cases there is a greater show of deliberation. The complainant 
asks the man, against whom he means to lodge his complaint, to 
come with him to the chief. This is never refused. When both 
are in the kotla, the complainant stands up and states the whole 
case before the chief and the people usually assembled there. 
He stands a few seconds after he has done this, to recollect if he 
has forgotten anything. The witnesses to whom he has referred 
then rise up and tell all they themselves have seen or heard, but 
not anything that they have heard from others. The defendant, 
after allowing some minutes to elapse so that he may not inter- 
rupt any of the opposite party, slowly rises, folds his cloak around 
him, and, in the most quiet, deliberate way he can assume — 
yawning, blowing his nose, &c. — begins to explain the affair, 
denying the charge or admitting it, as the case may be. Some- 
times, when galled by his remarks, the complainant utters a sen- 
tence of dissent ; the accused turns quietly to him, and says, 
" Be silent : I sat still while you were speaking ; can't you do 
the same? Do you want to have it all to yourself?" And as 
the audience acquiesce in this bantering, and enforce silence, he 
goes on till he has finished all he wishes to say in his defence. 
If he has any witnesses to the truth of the facts of Ins defence, 
they give their evidence. No oath is administered ; but occa- 
sionally, when a statement is questioned, a man will say, " By 
my father," or " By the chief, it is so." Their trutlifulness among 
each other is quite remarkable ; but their system of government 
is such that Europeans are not in a position to realise it readily. 
A poor man will say, in his defence against a rich one, " I am 
astonished to hear a man so great as he make a false accusation ;" 
as if the offence of falsehood were felt to be one against the 
society which the individual referred to had the greatest interest 
in upholding. 

If the case is one of no importance, the chief decides it at once ; 



184 MODE OF TKYING OFFENCES. Chap. IX. 

if frivolous, he may give the complainant a scolding, and put a 
stop to the case in the middle of the complaint, or he may allow 
it to go on without paying any attention to it whatever. Family 
quarrels are often treated in this way, and then a man may be 
seen stating his case with great fluency, and not a soul listening 
to him. But if it is a case between influential men, or brought 
on by under-chiefs, then the greatest decorum prevails. If the 
chief does not see his way clearly to a decision, he remains 
silent ; the elders then rise one by one and give their opinions, 
often in the way of advice rather than as decisions ; and when the 
chief finds the general sentiment agreeing in one view, he de- 
livers his judgment accordingly. He alone speaks sitting: all 
others stand. 

No one refuses to acquiesce in the decision of the chief, as he 
has the power of life and death in his hands, and can enforce the 
law to that extent if he chooses ; but grumbling is allowed, and, 
when marked favouritism is shown to any relative of the chief, 
the people generally are not so astonished at the partiality as we 
would be in England. 

This system was found as well developed among the Makololo 
as among the Bakwains, or even better, and is no foreign im- 
portation. When at Cassange, my men had a slight quarrel 
among themselves, and came to me, as to their chief, for judg- 
ment. Tins had occurred several times before, so without a 
thought I went out of the Portuguese merchant's house in winch 
I was a guest, sat down, and heard the complaint and defence in 
the usual way. * When I had given my decision in the common 
admonitory form, they went off apparently satisfied. Several 
Portuguese, who had been viewing the proceedings with great 
interest, complimented me on the success of my teaching them 
how to act in litigation ; but I could not take any credit to my- 
self for the system which I had found ready-made to my hands. 

Soon after our arrival at Linyanti, Sekeletu took me aside, and 
pressed me to mention those things I liked best and hoped to 
get from him. Anything, either in or out of his town, should be 
freely given if I would only mention it. I explained to him that 
my object was to elevate him and his people to be Christians ; 
but he replied he did not wish to learn to read the Book, for he 
was afraid " it might change his heart, and make hiin content 



Chap. IX. DISPOSAL OF CHIEF'S WIDOWS. 185 

with only one wife, like Sechele." It was of little use to urge 
that the change of heart implied a contentment with one wife 
equal to his present complacency in polygamy. Such a preference 
after the change of mind, could not now be understood by him any 
more than the real, unmistakeable pleasure of religious services 
can, by those who have not experienced what is known by the 
term the " new heart." I assured him that nothing was expected 
but by his own voluntary decision. " No, no ; he wanted always 
to have &ve wives at least." I liked the frankness of Sekeletu, 
for nothing is so wearying to the spirit as talking to those who 
agree with everything advanced. 

Sekeletu, according to the system of the Bechuanas, became 
possessor of his father's wives, and adopted two of them ; the 
children by these women are, however, in these cases, termed 
brothers. When an elder brother dies, the same thing occurs in 
respect of his wives ; the brother next in age takes them, as 
among the Jews, and the children that may be born of those 
women he calls his brothers also. He thus raises up seed to his 
departed relative. An uncle of Sekeletu, being a younger brother 
of Sebituane, got that chieftain's head-wife, or queen : there is 
always one who enjoys this title. Her hut is called the great 
house, and her children inherit the chieftainship. If she dies, a 
new wife is selected for the same position and enjoys the same 
privileges, though she may happen to be a much younger woman 
than the rest. 

The majority of the wives of Sebituane were given to influen- 
tial under-chiefs ; and, in reference to their early casting off the 
widow's weeds, a song was sung, the tenor of which was that the 
men alone felt the loss of their father Sebituane, the women were 
so soon supplied with new husbands that their hearts had not time 
to become sore with grief. 

The women complain, because the proportions between the 
sexes are so changed now, that they are not valued as they de- 
serve. The majority of the real Makololo have been cut off by 
fever. Those who remain are a mere fragment of the people 
who came to the north with Sebituane. Migrating from a very 
healthy climate in the south, they were more subject to the 
febrile diseases of the valley in which we found them, than the 
black tribes they conquered. In comparison with the Barotse, 



186 MAKOLOLO WOMEN. Chap. IX. 

Batoka, and Banyeti, the Makololo have a sickly hue. They are 
of a light-brownish yellow colour, while the tribes referred to are 
veiy dark, with a slight tinge of olive. The whole of the coloured 
tribes consider that beauty and fairness are associated, and women 
long for children of light colour so much, that they sometimes 
chew the bark of a certain tree in hopes of producing that effect. 
To my eye the dark colour is much more agreeable than the 
tawny hue of the half-caste, which that of the Makololo ladies 
closely resembles. The women generally escaped the fever, but 
they are less fruitful than formerly, and, to their complaint of 
being undervalued on account of the disproportion of the sexes, 
they now add their regrets at the want of children, of whom they 
are all excessively fond. 

The Makololo women work but little. Indeed the families of 
that nation are spread over the country, one or two only in each 
village, as the lords of the land. They all have lordship over 
great numbers of subjected tribes, who pass by the general name 
Makalaka, and who are forced to render certain services, and to 
aid in tilling the soil ; but each has his own land under cultivation, 
and otherwise lives nearly independent. They are proud to be 
called Makololo, but the other term is often used in reproach, as 
betokening inferiority. This species of servitude may be termed 
serfdom, as it has to be rendered in consequence of subjection by 
force of arms, but it is necessarily very mild. It is so easy for 
any one who is unkindly treated to make his escape to other 
tribes, that the Makololo are compelled to treat them, to a great 
extent, rather as children than slaves. Some masters, who fail 
from defect of temper or disposition to secure the affections of the 
conquered people, frequently find themselves left without a single 
servant, in consequence of the absence and impossibility of en- 
forcing a fugitive slave law, and the readiness with which those 
who are themselves subjected assist the fugitives across the rivers 
in canoes. The Makololo ladies are liberal in their presents of 
milk and other food, and seldom require to labour, except in the 
way of beautifying their own huts and court-yards. They drink 
large quantities of boyaloa, or o-alo, the buza of the Arabs, 
which, being made of the grain called holcus sorghum, or " dura- 
sain," in a minute state of subdivision, is very nutritious, and 
gives that plumpness of form which is considered beautiful. They 



Chap. IX. PUBLIC RELIGIOUS SERVICES. 187 

dislike being seen at their potations by persons of the opposite 
sex. They cut their woolly hah* quite short, and delight in 
having the whole person shining with butter. Their dress is a 
kilt reaching to the knees ; its material is ox-hide, made as 
soft as cloth. It is not ungraceful. A soft skin mantle is thrown 
across the shoulders when the lady is unemployed, but when 
engaged in any sort of labour she throws this aside, and works 
in the kilt alone. The ornaments most coveted are large brass 
anklets as thick as the little finger, and armlets of both brass 
and ivory, the latter often an inch broad. The rings are so 
heavy that the ankles are often blistered by the weight pressing 
down ; but it is the fashion, and is borne as magnanimously as 
tight lacing and tight shoes among ourselves. Strings of beads 
are hung around the neck, and the fashionable colours being light 
green and pink, a trader could get almost anything he chose for 
beads of these colours. 

At our public religious services in the kotla, the Makololo 
women always behaved with decorum from the first, except at the 
conclusion of the prayer. When all knelt down, many of those 
who had children, in following the example of the rest, bent over 
their little ones; the children, in terror of being crushed to 
death, set up a simultaneous yell, which so tickled the whole 
assembly there was often a subdued titter, to be turned into a 
hearty laugh as soon as they heard Amen. This was not so dif- 
ficult to overcome in them as similar peccadilloes were in the case 
of the women farther south. Long after we had settled at Ma- 
botsa, when preaching on the most solemn subjects, a woman 
might be observed to look round, and, seeing a neighbour seated 
on her dress, give her a hunch with the elbow to make her move 
off; the other would return it with interest, and perhaps the 
remark, " Take the nasty thing away, will you ? " Then three or 
four would begin to hustle the first offenders, and the men to 
swear at them all, by way of enforcing silence. 

Great numbers of little trifling things like these occur, and 
would not be worth the mention but that one cannot form a cor- 
rect idea of missionary work except by examination of the 
minutiae. At the risk of appearing frivolous to some, I shall 
continue to descend to mere trifles. 

The numbers who attended at the summons by the herald, 
who acted as beadle, were often from five to seven hundred. 



188 MEDICAL PRACTICE. Chap. IX. 

The service consisted of reading a small portion of the Bible and 
giving an explanatory address, usually short enough to prevent 
weariness or want of attention. So long as we continue to hold 
services in the kotla, the associations of the place are unfavourable 
to solemnity; hence it is always desirable to have a place of 
worship as soon as possible : and it is of importance too to treat 
such place with reverence, as an aid to secure that serious atten- 
tion which religious subjects demand. This will appear more 
evident when it is recollected that, in the very spot where we had 
been engaged in acts of devotion, half an hour after, a dance 
would be got up ; and these habits cannot be at first opposed 
without the appearance of assuming too much authority over 
them. It is always unwise to hurt their feelings of independence. 
Much greater influence will be gained by studying how you may 
induce them to act aright, with the impression that they are 
doing it of their own free will. Our services having necessarily 
been all in the open air, where it is most difficult to address 
large bodies of people, prevented my recovering so entirely from 
the effects of clergyman's sore throat as I expected, when my 
uvula was excised at the Cape. 

To give an idea of the routine followed for months together, 
on other days as well as on Sundays, I may advert to my habit 
of treating the sick for complaints which seemed to surmount 
the skill of their own doctors. I refrained from going to any one 
unless Ins own doctor wished it, or had given up the case. This led 
to my having a selection of the severer cases only, and prevented 
the doctors being offended at my taking their practice out of 
their hands. When attacked by fever myself, and wishing to 
ascertain what their practices were, I could safely intrust myself 
in their hands on account of their well-known friendly feelings. 

The plan of showing kindness to the natives in their bodily 
ailments secures their friendship ; this is not the case to the same 
degree in old missions, where the people have learned to look 
upon relief as a right, a state of things that sometimes happens 
among ourselves at home. Medical aid is therefore most valuable 
in young missions, though at all stages it is an extremely valuable 
adjunct to other operations. 

I proposed to teach the Makololo to read, but, for the reasons 
mentioned, Sekeletu at first declined ; after some weeks, however, 
Motibe, his father-in-law, and some others determined to brave 



Chap. IX. SEKELETU'S PKESENT. 189 

the mysterious book. To all who have not acquired it, the know- 
ledge of letters is quite unfathomable ; there is nought like it 
within the compass of their observation ; and we have no com- 
parison with anything except pictures, to aid them in compre- 
hending the idea of signs of words. It seems to them super- 
natural that we see in a book things taking place, or having 
occurred at a distance. No amount of explanation conveys the 
idea unless they learn to read. Machinery is equally inex- 
plicable, and money nearly as much so until they see it in actual 
use. They are familiar with barter alone ; and in the centre of 
the country, where gold is totally unknown, if a button and 
sovereign were left to their choice, they would prefer the former 
on account of its having an eye. 

In beginning to learn, Motibe seemed to himself in the posi- 
tion of the doctor, who was obliged to drink his potion before the 
patient, to show that it contained nothing detrimental : after he 
had mastered the alphabet, and reported the thing so far safe, 
Sekeletu and his young companions came forward to try for 
themselves. He must have resolved to watch the effects of the 
book against his views on polygamy, and abstain whenever he 
perceived any tendency, in reading it, towards enforcing him to 
put his wives away. A number of men learned the alphabet in 
a short time and were set to teach others, but before much pro- 
gress could be made I was on my way to Loanda. 

As I had declined to name anything as a present from 
Sekeletu, except a canoe to take me up the river, he brought 
ten fine elephants' tusks and laid them down beside my waggon. 
He would take no denial, though I told him I should prefer to 
see him trading with Fleming, a man of colour from the West 
Indies, who had come for the purpose. I had during the eleven 
years of my previous course invariably abstained from taking pre- 
sents of ivory, from an idea that a religious instructor degraded 
lnmself by accepting gifts from those whose spiritual welfare he 
professed to seek. My precedence of all traders in the line of 
discovery put me often in the way of very handsome offers, but 
I always advised the donors to sell then ivory to traders, who 
would be sure to follow, and when at some future time they had 
become rich by barter, they might remember me or my children. 
When Lake Ngami was discovered I might have refused per- 
mission to a trader who accompanied us ; but when he applied 



190 PRESENTS AND TRADING. Chap. IX. 

for leave to form part of our company, knowing that Mr. Oswell 
would no more trade than myself, and that the people of the 
lake would be disappointed if they could not dispose of their 
ivory, I willingly granted a sanction, without which his people 
would not at that time have ventured so far. This was surely 
preferring the interest of another to my own. . The return I got 
for tins was, a notice in one of the Cape papers, that this " man 
was the true discoverer of the lake !" 

The conclusion I had come to was, that it is quite lawful, 
though perhaps not expedient, for missionaries to trade ; but 
barter is the only means by which a missionary in the interior 
can pay his way, as money has no value. In all the journeys I had 
previously undertaken for wider diffusion of the gospel, the extra 
expenses were defrayed from my salary of 100/. per annum. 
This sum is sufficient to enable a missionary to live in the interior 
of South Africa, supposing he has a garden capable of yielding 
corn and vegetables ; but should he not, and still consider that 
six or eight months cannot lawfully be spent, simply in getting 
goods at a lower price than they can be had from itinerant traders, 
the sum mentioned is barely sufficient for the poorest fare and 
plainest apparel. As we never felt ourselves justified in making 
journeys to the colony for the sake of securing bargains, the most 
frugal living was necessary to enable us to be a little charitable 
to others; but when to this were added extra travelling ex- 
penses, the wants of an increasing family, and liberal gifts to 
chiefs, it was difficult to make both ends meet. The pleasure 
of missionary labour would be enhanced, if one could devote his 
life to the heathen, without drawing a salary from a society at 
all. The luxury of doing good, from one's own private resources, 
without appearing to either natives or Europeans to be making 
a gain of it, is far preferable, and an object worthy the ambition 
of the rich. But few men of fortune, however, now devote 
themselves to Christian missions, as of old. Presents were 
always given to the chiefs whom we visited, and nothing accepted 
in return ; but when Sebituane (in 1851) offered some ivory, I 
took it, and was able by its sale to present his son with a number 
of really useful articles of a higher value than I had ever been 
able to give before to any chief. In doing this, of course, I 
appeared to trade, but, feeling I had a right to do so, I felt per- 
fectly easy in my mind ; and, as I still held the view of the inex- 



Chap. IX. PRESENTS TO SEKELETU. 191 

pediency of combining the two professions, I was glad of the 
proposal of one of the most honourable merchants of Car>e Town, 
Mr. H. E. Kutherford, that he should risk a sum of money in 
Fleming's hands, for the purpose of attempting to develop a trade 
with the Makololo. It was to this man I suggested Sekeletu 
should sell the tusks which he had presented for my acceptance, 
but the chief refused to take them back from me. The goods 
which Fleming had brought were ill adapted for the use of the 
natives, but he got a pretty good load of ivory in exchange ; and 
though it was his first attempt at trading, and the distance tra- 
velled over made the expenses enormous, he was not a loser by 
the trip. Other traders followed, who demanded 90 lbs. of ivory 
for a musket. The Makololo, knowing nothing of steelyards, but 
supposing that they were meant to cheat them, declined to trade 
except by exchanging one bull and one cow elephant's tusk for 
each gun. This would average 70 lbs. of ivory, which sells at 
the Cape for 5s. per pound, for a secondhand musket worth 10s. 
I, being sixty miles distant, did not witness this attempt at barter, 
but, anxious to enable my countrymen to drive a brisk trade, told 
the Makololo to sell my ten tusks on their own account for what- 
ever they would bring. Seventy tusks were for sale, but, the 
parties not understanding each other's talk, no trade was esta- 
blished ; and when I passed the spot some time afterwards, I 
found that the whole of that ivory had been destroyed by an 
accidental fire, which broke out in the village when all the people 
were absent. Success in trade is as much dependent on know- 
ledge of the language as success in travelling. 

I had brought with me as presents an improved breed of goats, 
fowls, and a pair of cats. A superior bull was bought, also as a 
gift to Sekeletu, but I was compelled to leave it on account of its 
having become footsore. As the Makololo are very fond of im- 
proving the breed of their domestic animals, they were much 
pleased with my selection. I endeavoured to bring the bull, in 
performance of a promise made to Sebituane before he died. 
Admiring a calf which we had with us, he proposed to give me a 
cow for it, which in the native estimation was offering three times 
its value. I presented it to him at once, and promised to bring 
him another and a better one. Sekeletu was much gratified by 
my attempt to keep my word given to his father. 

They have two breeds of cattle among them. One called the 



192 THE LOOKING-GLASS. Chap. IX. 

Batoka. because captured from that tribe, is of diminutive size, 
but very beautiful ; and closely resembles the short-horns of our 
own countiy. The little pair presented by the King of Portugal 
to H.E.H. the Prince Consort, is of this breed. They are very 
tame, and remarkably playful ; they may be seen lying on then- 
sides by the fires in the evening ; and, when the herd goes out, 
the herdsman often precedes them, and has only to commence 
capering to set them all a-gambolling. The meat is superior to 
that of the large animal. The other, or Barotse ox, is much 
larger, and comes from the fertile Barotse Valley. They stand 
high on their legs, often nearly six feet at the withers ; and they 
have large horns. Those of one of a similar breed that we brought 
from the lake measured from tip to tip eight and a half feet. 

The Makololo are in the habit of shaving off a little from one 
side of the horns of these animals when still growing, in order to 
make them curve in that direction and assume fantastic shapes. 
The stranger the curvature, the more handsome the ox is con- 
sidered to be, and the longer this ornament of the cattle-pen is 
spared to beautify the herd. This is a very ancient custom in 
Africa, for the tributary tribes of Ethiopia are seen, on some of 
the most ancient Egyptian monuments, bringing contorted-horned 
cattle into Egypt. 

All are remarkably fond of their cattle, and spend much time 
in ornamenting and adorning them. Some are branded all over 
with a hot knife, so as to cause a permanent discolouration of the 
hair, in lines like the bands on the hide of a zebra. Pieces of 
skin two or three inches long and broad are detached, and allowed 
to heal in a dependent position around the head — a strange style 
of ornament; indeed, it is difficult to conceive in what their 
notion of beauty consists. The women have somewhat the same 
ideas with ourselves of what constitutes comeliness. They came 
frequently and asked for the looking-glass; and the remarks 
they made — while I was engaged in reading, and apparently 
not attending to them — on first seeing themselves therein, were 
amusingly ridiculous. " Is that me ? " " What a big mouth I 
have ! " " My ears are as big as pumpkin-leaves." " I have no 
chin at all." Or, " I would have been pretty, but am spoiled by 
these high cheek-bones." " See how my head shoots up in the 
middle ! " laughing vociferously all the time at their own jokes. 
They readily perceive any defect in each other, and give nick- 



Chap. IX. MODE OF PREPARING SKINS. 193 

names accordingly. One man came alone to have a quiet gaze 
at his own features once, when he thought I was asleep : after 
twisting his mouth about in various directions, he remarked to 
himself, " People say I am ugly, and how very ugly I am 
indeed!" 

The Makololo use all the skins of their oxen for making either 
mantles or shields. For the former, the hide is stretched out by 
means of pegs, and dried. Ten or a dozen men then collect 
round it with small adzes, which, when sharpened with an iron 
bodkin, are capable of shaving off the substance of the skin on 
the fleshy side until it is quite thin ; when sufficiently thin, a 
quantity of brain is smeared over it, and some thick milk. Then 
an instrument made of a number of iron spikes tied round a piece 
of wood, so that the points only project beyond it, is applied to 
it in a carding fashion, until the fibres of the bulk of it are quite 
loose. Milk or butter is applied to it again, and it forms a gar- 
ment nearly as soft as cloth. 

The shields are made of hides partially dried in the sun, and 
then beaten with hammers until they are stiff and dry. Two 
broad belts of a differently-coloured skin are sewed into them 
longitudinally, and sticks inserted to make them rigid and not 
liable to bend easily. The shield is a great protection in their 
way of fighting with spears, but they also trust largely to their 
agility in springing aside from the coming javelin. The shield 
assists when so many spears are thrown that it is impossible not 
to receive some of them. Their spears are light javelins ; and, 
judging from what I have seen them do in elephant-hunting, I 
believe, when they have room to make a run and discharge them 
with the aid of the jerk of stopping, they can throw them between 
forty and fifty yards. They give them an upward direction in 
the discharge, so that they come down on the object with acce- 
lerated force. I saw a man who in battle had received one in 
the shin ; the excitement of the moment prevented his feeling 
any pain ; but, when the battle was over, the blade was found to 
have split the bone, and become so impacted in the cleft that no 
force could extract it. It was necessary to take an axe and 
press the split bone asunder before the weapon could be taken 
out.

On the 30th of May I was seized with fever for the first time. 
We reached the town of Linyaiiti on the 23rd ; and as my habits 
were suddenly changed from great exertion to comparative in- 
activity, at the commencement of the cold season I suffered from 
a severe attack of stoppage of the secretions, closely resembling 
a common cold. Warm baths and drinks relieved me, and I 
had no idea but that I was now recovering from the effects of 
a chill, got by leaving the warm waggon in the evening in order 
to conduct family-worship at my people's fire. But on the 2nd 
of June a relapse showed to the Makololo, who knew the com- 
plaint, that my indisposition was no other than the fever, with 
winch I have since made a more intimate acquaintance. Cold 
east winds prevail at tins time ; and as they come over the 
extensive flats inundated by the Chobe, as well as many other 
districts where pools of rain-water are now drying up, they may 
be supposed to be loaded with malaria and watery vapour, and 
many cases of fever follow. The usual symptoms of stopped 
secretion are manifested — shivering and a feeling of coldness, 
though the skin is quite hot to the touch of another. The heat 
in the axilla, over the heart and region of the stomach, was in 
my case 100° ; but along the spine and at the nape of the neck 
103°. The internal processes were all, with the exception of 
the kidneys and liver, stopped ; the latter, in its efforts to free 
the blood of noxious particles, often secretes enormous quantities 
of bile. There were pains along the spine, and frontal headache. 
Anxious to ascertain whether the natives possessed the know- 
ledge of any remedy of winch we were ignorant, I requested the 
assistance' of one of Sekeletu's doctors. He put some roots into

a pot with water, and, when it was boiling, placed it on a spot 
beneath a blanket thrown around both me and it. This pro- 
duced no immediate effect ; he then got a small bundle of different 
kinds of medicinal woods, and, burning them in a potsherd nearly 
to ashes, used the smoke and hot vapour arising from them as 
an auxiliary to the other in causing diaphoresis. I fondly hoped 
that they had a more potent remedy than our own medicines 
afford; but after being stewed in their vapour-baths, smoked 
like a red herring over green twigs, and charmed secundem 
artem, I concluded that 1 could cure the fever more quickly 
than they can. If we employ a wet sheet and a mild aperient in 
combination with quinine, in addition to the native remedies, they 
are an important aid in curing the fever, as they seem to have the 
same stimulating effects on the alimentary canal, as these means 
have on the external surface. Purgatives, general bleedings, or 
indeed any violent remedies, are injurious ; and the appearance 
of a herpetic eruption near the mouth is regarded as an evidence 
that no internal organ is in danger. There is a good deal in 
not " giving in " to this disease. He who is low-spirited, and 
apt to despond at every attack, will die sooner than the man 
who is not of such a melancholic nature. 

The Makololo had made a garden and planted maize for me, 
that, as they remarked, when I was parting with them to pro- 
ceed to the Cape, I might have food to eat when I returned, as 
well as other people. The maize was now pounded by the women 
into fine meal. This they do in large wooden mortars, the exact

counterpart of which may be seen depicted on the Egyptian 
monuments. Sekeletu added to this good supply of meal ten or 
twelve jars of honey, each of which contained about two gallons. 
Liberal supplies of ground-nuts (Arachis hypogoea) were also fur- 
nished every time the tributary tribes brought their dues to 
Linyanti, and an ox was given for slaughter every week or two. 
Sekeletu also appropriated two cows to be milked for us every 
morning and evening. This was in accordance with the acknow- 
ledged rule throughout this country, that the chief should feed 
all strangers who come on any special business to him, and take 
up their abode in his kotla. A present is usually given in return 
for the hospitality, but, except in cases where their aboriginal 
customs have been modified, nothing would be asked. Europeans 
spoil the feeling that hospitality is the sacred duty of the chiefs, 
by what in other circumstances is laudable conduct. No sooner 
do they arrive than they offer to purchase food, and, instead of 
waiting till a meal is prepared for them in the evening, cook for 
themselves, and then often decline even to partake of that which 
has been made ready for their use. A present is also given, 
and before long the natives come to expect a gift without having 
offered any equivalent. 

Strangers frequently have acquaintances among the under- 
chiefs, to whose establishments they turn aside, and are treated 
on the same principle that others are when they are the guests 
of the chief. So generally is the duty admitted, that one of the 
most cogent arguments for polygamy is, that a respectable man 
with only one wife could not entertain strangers as he ought. 
This reason has especial weight where the women are the chief 
cultivators of the soil, and have the control over the corn, as at 
Kolobeng. The poor, however, who have no friends, often suffer 
much hunger, and the very kind attention Sebituane lavished on all 
such, was one of the reasons of his great popularity in the country. 

The Makololo cultivate a large extent of land around their 
villages. Those of them who are real Basutos still retain the 
habits of that tribe, and may be seen going out with their wives 
with then hoes in hand ; a state of things never witnessed at 
Kolobeng, or among any other Bechuana or Caffre tribe. The 
great chief Moshesh affords an example to his people annually, 
by not only taking the hoe in hand, but working hard with it on 
certain public occasions. His Basutos are of the same family 



Chap. X. PRODUCTS OF SOIL— TRIBUTE. 197 

with the Makololo to whom I refer. The younger Makololo, 
who have been accustomed from their infancy to lord it over the 
conquered Makalaka, have unfortunately no desire to imitate 
the agricultural tastes of their fathers, and expect their subjects 
to perform all the manual labour. They are the aristocracy of 
the country, and once possessed almost unlimited power over 
their vassals. Their privileges were, however, much abridged by 
Sebituane himself. 

I have already mentioned that the tribes which Sebituane 
subjected in this great country, pass by the general name of 
Makalaka. The Makololo were composed of a great number of 
other tribes, as well as of these central negroes. The nucleus of 
the whole were Basuto, who came with Sebituane from a com- 
paratively cold and hilly region in the south. When he con- 
quered various tribes of the Bechuanas, as Bakwains, Bangwa- 
ketze, Bamangwato, Batauana, &c, he incorporated the young 
of these tribes into his own. Great mortality by fever having 
taken place in the original stock, he wisely adopted the same 
plan of absorption on a large scale with the Makalaka. So we 
found him with even the sons of the chiefs of the Barotse closely 
attached to his person ; and they say to this day, if anything 
else but natural death had assailed their father, every one of 
them would have laid down his life in his defence. One reason 
for their strong affection was their emancipation by the decree 
of Sebituane, " all are children of the chief." 

The Makalaka cultivate the Holcus sorghum, or dura, as the 
principal grain, with maize, two kinds of beans, ground-nuts 
(Ar adds hypogoea), pumpkins, water-melons, and cucumbers. 
They depend for success entirely upon rain. Those who live in 
the Barotse valley cultivate in addition the sugar-cane, sweet- 
potato, and manioc (Jatropha manihot). The climate there, how- 
ever, is warmer than at Linyanti, and the Makalaka increase the 
fertility of their gardens by rude attempts at artificial irrigation. 

The instrument of culture over all this region is a hoe, the 
iron of which the Batoka and Banyeti obtain from the ore by 
smelting. The amount of iron which they produce annually 
may be understood, when it is known that most of the hoes in 
use at Linyanti are the tribute imposed on the smiths of those 
subject tribes. 

Sekeletu receives tribute from a great number of tribes in

A Batoka hoe. 

corn or dura, ground-nuts, hoes, spears, honey, canoes, paddles, 
wooden vessels, tobacco, mutokuane [Cannabis sativa), various 
wild fruits (dried), prepared skins, and ivory. When these 
articles are brought into the kotla, Sekeletu has the honour of 
dividing them among the loungers who usually congregate there. 
A small portion only is reserved for himself. The ivory belongs 
nominally to him too, but this is simply a way of making a fair 
distribution of the profits. The chief sells it only with the 
approbation of his counsellors, and the proceeds are distri- 
buted in open day among the people as before. He has the 
choice of everything ; but if he is not more liberal to others 
than to himself, he loses in popularity. I have known instances 
in tins and other tribes in which individuals aggrieved, because 
they had been overlooked, fled to other chiefs. One discon- 
tented person, having fled to Lechulatebe, was encouraged to go 
to a village of the Bapalleng, on the river Cho or Tso, and 
abstracted the tribute of ivory thence which ought to have come 
to Sekeletu. This theft enraged the whole of the Makololo, 
because they all felt it to be a personal loss. Some of Lechu- 
latebe's people having come on a visit to Linyanti, a demonstra- 
tion was made, in which about five hundred Makololo, armed, 
went through a mimic fight ; the principal warriors pointed their 
spears towards the lake where Lechulatebe lives, and every 
tlirust in that direction was answered by all with the shout, 
' Hoo ! " while every stab on the ground drew out a simulta- 
neous " Huzz ! " On these occasions all capable of bearing 
arms, even the old, must turn out at the call. In the time of 



Chap. X. LECHULATEBE'S PROVOCATIONS. 199 

Sebituane, any one remaining in his house, was searched for and 
killed without mercy. 

This offence of Lechulatebe was aggravated by repetition, and 
by a song sung in his town accompanying the dances, which 
manifested joy at the death of Sebituane. He had enjoined his 
people to live in peace with those at the lake, and Sekeletu 
felt disposed to follow his advice : but Lechulatebe had now got 
possession of fire-arms, and considered himself more than a match 
for the Makololo. His father had been dispossessed of many 
cattle by Sebituane, and, as forgiveness is not considered among 
the virtues by the heathen, Lechulatebe thought he had a right 
to recover what he could. As I had a good deal of influence 
with the Makololo, I persuaded them that, before they could 
have peace, they must resolve to give the same blessing to 
others, and they never could do that without forgiving and for- 
getting ancient feuds. It is hard to make them feel that 
shedding of human blood is a great crime ; they must be 
conscious that it is wrong, but, having been accustomed to 
bloodshed from infancy, they are remarkably callous to the 
enormity of the crime of destroying human life. 

I sent a message at the same time to Lechulatebe advising 
him to give up the course he had adopted, and especially the 
song ; because, though Sebituane was dead, the arms with which 
he had fought were still alive and strong. 

Sekeletu, in order to follow up his father's instructions and 
promote peace, sent ten cows to Lechulatebe to be exchanged 
for sheep ; these animals thrive well in a bushy country like 
that around the lake, but will scarcely live in the flat prairies 
between the net-work of waters north of the Chobe. The men 
who took the cows carried a number of hoes to purchase goats 
besides. Lechulatebe took the cows and sent back an equal 
number of sheep. Now, according to the relative value of sheep 
and cows in these parts, he ought to have sent sixty or seventy. 

One of the men who had hoes was trying to purchase in a 
village without formal leave from Lechulatebe ; this chief 
punished him by making him sit some hours on the broiling hot 
sand (at least 130°). This farther offence put a stop to amicable 
relations between the two tribes altogether. It was a case in 
which a very small tribe, commanded by a weak and foolish 
chief, had got possession of fire-arms, and felt conscious of 



200 MEANING OF THE TERM " BECHUANAS." Chap. X. 

ability to cope with a numerous and warlike race. Such cases 
are the only ones in which the possession of fire-arms does evil. 
The universal effect of the diffusion of the more potent instru- 
ments of warfare in Africa is the same as among ourselves. 
Fire-arms render wars less frequent and less bloody. It is 
indeed exceedingly rare to hear of two tribes having guns, going 
to war with each other ; and, as nearly all the feuds, in the south 
at least, have been about cattle, the risk which must be incurred 
from long shots, generally proves a preventive to the foray. 

The Makololo were prevailed upon to keep the peace during 
my residence with them, but it was easy to perceive that public 
opinion was against sparing a tribe of Bechuanas for whom the 
Makololo entertained the most sovereign contempt. The young 
men would remark, " Lechulatebe is herding our cows for us ; 
let us only go, we shall ' lift ' the price of them in sheep," &c. 

As the Makololo are the most northerly of the Bechuanas, we 
may glance back at this family of Africans before entering on 
the branch of the negro family which the Makololo distinguish 
by the term Makalaka. The name Bechuana seems derived 
from the word Chuana — alike, or equal — with the personal pro- 
noun Ba (they) prefixed ; and therefore means fellows or equals. 
Some have supposed the name to have arisen from a mistake of 
some traveller, who, on asking individuals of this nation concern- 
ing the tribes living beyond them, received the answer, Ba- 
chuana, "they (are) alike ;" meaning, " They are the same as we 
are ;" and that this nameless traveller, who never wrote a word 
about them, managed to engraft his mistake as a generic term on 
a nation extending from the Orange river to 18° south latitude.* 

As the name was found in use among those who had no inter- 
course with Europeans, before we can receive the above expla- 
nation we must believe that the unknown traveller knew the 
language sufficiently well to ask a question, but not to under- 
stand the answer. We may add, that the way in which they still 
continue to use the word, seems to require no fanciful interpreta- 
tion. When addressed with any degree of scorn, they reply, 
" We are Bachuana, or equals — we are not inferior to any of our 
nation," in exactly the same sense as Irishmen or Scotchmen, 
in the same circumstances, would reply, " We are Britons," or 

* The Makololo have conquered the country as far as 14° south, but it is 
still peopled chiefly by the black tribes named Makalaka. 



Chap. X. DIVISIONS OF SOUTH AFRICAN FAMILY. 201 

" We are Englishmen." Most other tribes are known by the 
terms applied to them by strangers only, as the Caffres, Hotten- 
tots, and Bushmen. The Bechuanas alone use the term to them- 
selves as a generic one for the whole nation. They have ma- 
naged also to give a comprehensive name to the whites, viz. 
Makoa, though they cannot explain the derivation of it any 
more than of their own. It seems to mean " handsome," from 
the manner in which they use it to indicate beauty, but there is 
a word so very like it, meaning " infirm," or " weak," that Bur- 
chell's conjecture is probably the right one. " The different Hot- 
tentot tribes were known by names terminating in kua, which 
means ' man/ and the Bechuanas simply added the prefix Ma 
— denoting a nation :" they themselves were first known as Bri- 
quas or " goat-men." The language of the Bechuanas is termed 
Sichuana ; that of the whites (or Makoa) is called Sekoa. 

The Makololo, or Basuto, have carried their powers of gene- 
ralization still farther, and arranged the other parts of the same 
great family of South Africans into three divisions : 1st. The 
Matebele, or Makonkobi — the Caffre family living on the eastern 
side of the country ; 2nd. The Bakoni, or Basuto ; and 3rd. the 
Bakalahari, or Bechuanas, living in the central parts, which includes 
all those tribes living in or adjacent to the great Kalahari Desert. 

1st. The Caffres are divided by themselves into various sub- 
divisions, as Amakosa, Amapanda, and other well-known titles. 
They consider the name Caffre as an insulting epithet. 

The Zulus of Natal belong to the same family, and they are 
as famed for their honesty, as their brethren who live adjacent to 
our colonial frontier are renowned for cattle-lifting. The Ke- 
corder of Natal declared of them, that history does not present 
another instance in which so much security for life and property 
has been enjoyed, as has been experienced during the whole 
period of English occupation by ten thousand colonists in the 
midst of one hundred thousand Zulus. 

The Matebele of Mosilikatse, living a short distance south of 
the Zambesi, and other tribes living a little south of Tete and 
Senna, are members of this same family. They are not known 
beyond the Zambesi river. This was the limit of the Bechuana 
progress north too, until Sebituane pushed his conquests farther. 

2nd. The Bakoni and Basuto division contains in the south all 



202 DIVISIONS OF SOUTH AFKICAN FAMILY. Chap. X. 

those tribes which acknowledge Moshesh as their paramount 
chief; among them we find the Batau, the Baputi, Makolokue, 
&c, and some mountaineers on the range Maluti, who are be- 
lieved by those who have carefully sifted the evidence, to have 
been at one time guilty of cannibalism. This has been doubted, 
but their songs admit the fact to this day, and they ascribe 
their having left off the odious practice of entrapping human 
prey, to Moshesh having given them cattle. They are called 
Marimo and Mayabathu, men-eaters, by the rest of the Basuto, 
who have various subdivisions, as Makatla, Bamakakana, Mat- 
lapatlapa, &c. 

The Bakoni farther north than the Basuto are the Batlou, 
Baperi, Bapo, and another tribe of Bakuena, Bamosetla, Bama- 
pela or Balaka, Babiriri, Bapiri, Bahukeng, Batlokua, Baakha- 
hela, &c. &c. ; the whole of which tribes are favoured with 
abundance of rain, and, being much attached to agriculture, raise 
very large quantities of grain* It is on their industry that the 
more distant Boers revel in slothful abundance, and follow their 
slave-hunting and cattle-stealing propensities quite beyond the 
range of English influence and law. The Basuto under Moshesh 
are equally fond of cultivating the soil : the chief labour of 
hoeing, driving away birds, reaping, and winnowing, falls to the 
willing arms of the hard-working women ; but, as the men, as 
well as their wives, as already stated, always work, many have 
followed the advice of the missionaries, and now use ploughs and 
oxen, instead of the hoe. 

3rd. The Bakalahari, or western branch of the Bechuana 
family, consists of Barolong, Bahurutse, Bakuena, Bangwaketse, 
Bakaa, Bamangwato, Bakurutse, Batauana, Bamatlaro, and Bat- 
lapi. Among the last the success of missionaries has been 
greatest. They were an insignificant and filthy people when 
first discovered ; but, being nearest to the colony, they have had 
opportunities of trading ; and the long-continued peace they have 
enjoyed, through the influence of religious teaching, has enabled 
them to amass great numbers of cattle. The young, however, 
who do not realize their former degradation, often consider their 
present superiority over the less favoured tribes in the interior to 
be entirely owing to their own greater wisdom and more intel- 
lectual development.

Having waited a month at Linyanti (lat. 18° 17' 20" S., long.

the river from Shesheke (lat. 17° 31' 38" S., long. 25° 13' E.). 
To the Barotse country, the capital of which is Nariele or Naliele

Sekeletu and about one hundred and sixty attendants. We had 
most of the young men with us, and many of the under-chiefs 
besides. The country between Linyanti and Sesheke is perfectly 
flat, except patches elevated only a few feet above the surrounding 
level. There are also many mounds where the gigantic anthills 
of the country have been situated, or still appear ; these mounds 
are evidently the work of the termites. No one who has not 
seen their gigantic structures can fancy the industry of these 
little labourers ; they seem to impart fertility to the soil which 
has once passed through their mouths, for the Makololo find the 
sides of anthills the choice spots for rearing early maize, tobacco, 
or anything on which they wish to bestow especial care. In the 
parts through which we passed the mounds are generally covered 
with masses of wild date-trees ; the fruit is small, and no tree is 
allowed to stand long, for, having abundance of food, the Mako- 
lolo have no inclination to preserve wild fruit-trees : accordingly, 
when a date shoots up to seed, as soon as the fruit is ripe they 
cut down the tree rather than be at the trouble of climbing it. 
The other parts of the more elevated land have the camel-thorn 
(Acacia giraffce), white-thomed mimosa (Acacia horrida), and 
baobabs. In sandy spots there are palmyras somewhat similar 



204 THE CHIEF'S GUAED. Chap. XI. 

to the Indian, but with a smaller seed. The soil on all the flat 
parts is a rich dark tenacious loam, known as the " cotton- 
ground " in India ; it is covered with a dense matting of coarse 
grass, common on all damp spots in this country. We had the 
Chobe on our right, with its scores of miles of reed occupying the 
horizon there. It was pleasant to look back on the long-extended 
line of our attendants, as it twisted and bent according to the 
curves of the footpath, or in and out behind the mounds, the 
ostrich-feathers of the men waving in the wind. Some had the 
white ends of ox-tails on their heads, hussar fashion, and others 
great bunches of black ostrich-feathers, or caps made of lions' 
manes. Some wore red tunics, or various-coloured prints which 
the chief had bought from Fleming ; the common men carried 
burdens ; the gentlemen walked with a small club of rhinoceros 
horn in their hands, and had servants to carry their shields ; 
while the "Machaka," battle-axe men, carried their own, and 
were liable at any time to be sent off a hundred miles on an 
errand, and expected to run all the way. 

Sekeletu is always accompanied by his own Mopato, a number 
of young men of his own age. When he sits down they crowd 
around him ; those who are nearest eat out of the same dish, for 
the Makololo chiefs pride themselves on eating with their people. 
He eats a little, then beckons his neighbours to partake. When 
they have done so, he perhaps beckons to some one at a distance 
to take a share ; that person starts forward, seizes the pot, and 
removes it to his own companions. The comrades of Sekeletu, 
wishing to imitate him in riding on my old horse, leaped on the 
backs of a number of half-broken Batoka oxen as they ran, but, 
having neither saddle nor bridle, the number of tumbles they 
met with was a source of much amusement to the rest. Troops 
of leches, or, as they are here called, " lechwes," appeared feeding 
quite heedlessly all over the flats ; they exist here in prodigious 
herds, although the numbers of them and of the " nakong " that 
are killed annually, must be enormous. Both are water ante- 
lopes, and, when the lands we now tread upon are flooded, they 
betake themselves to the mounds I have alluded to. The Maka- 
laka, who are most expert in the management of their small, 
thin, light canoes, come gently towards them ; the men stand 
upright in the canoe, though it is not more than fifteen or 



Chap. XI. KECEPTION AT VILLAGES. 205 

eighteen inches wide and about fifteen feet long ; their paddles, 
ten feet in length, are of a kind of wood called molompi, very 
light, yet as elastic as ash. With these they either punt or 
paddle, according to the shallowness or depth of the water. 
When they perceive the antelopes beginning to move they 
increase their speed, and pursue them with great velocity ; they 
make the water dash away from the gunwale, and, though the 
leche goes off by a succession of prodigious bounds, its feet 
appearing to touch the bottom at each spring, they manage to 
spear great numbers of them. 

The nakong often shares a similar fate. This is a new species, 
rather smaller than the leche, and, in shape, has more of paunchi- 
ness than any antelope I ever saw. Its gait closely resembles the 
gallop of a dog when tired. The hair is long and rather sparse, 
so that it is never sleek-looking. It is of a greyish-brown colour, 
and has horns twisted in the manner of a koodoo, but much 
smaller, and with a double ridge winding round each of them. 

Its habitat is the marsh and the muddy bogs ; the great length 
of its foot between the point of the toe and supplemental hoofs 
enables it to make a print about a foot in length ; it feeds by 
night, and lies hid among the reeds and rushes by day ; when 
pursued, it dashes into sedgy places containing water, and im- 
merses the whole body, leaving only the point of the nose and 
ends of the horns exposed. The hunters burn large patches of 
reed in order to drive the nakong out of his lair ; occasionally 
the ends of the horns project above the water ; but when it sees 
itself surrounded by enemies in canoes, it will rather allow its 
horns to be scorched in the burning reed, than come forth from 
its hiding-place. 

When we arrived at any village, the women all turned out to 
lulliloo their chief. Their shrill voices, to which they give a 
tremulous sound by a quick motion of the tongue, peal forth 
" Great lion ! " " Great chief! " " Sleep, my lord ! " &c. The men 
utter similar salutations ; and Sekeletu receives all with becoming 
indifference. After a few minutes' conversation and telling the 
news, the head man of the village, who is almost always a Mako- 
lolo, rises, and brings forth a number of large pots of beer. Cala- 
bashes, being used as drinking-cups, are handed round, and as 
many as can partake of the beverage do so, grasping the vessels 
so eagerly that they are in danger of being broken. 



206 SOCIAL MODE OF EATING. Chap. XI. 

They bring forth also large t pots and bowls of thick milk ; 
some contain six or eight gallons ; and each of these, as well as 
of the beer, is given to a particular person, who has the power to 
divide it with whom he pleases. The head man of any section 
of the tribe is generally selected for this office. Spoons not 
being generally in fashion, the milk is conveyed to the mouth 
with the hand. I often presented my friends with iron spoons, 
and it was curious to observe how the habit of hand-eating pre- 
vailed, though they were delighted with the spoons. They lifted 
out a little with the utensil, then put it on the left hand, and ate 
it out of that. 

As the Makololo have great abundance of cattle, and the chief 
is expected to feed all who accompany him, he either selects an 
ox or two of his own from the numerous cattle stations that he 
possesses at different spots all over the country, or is presented 
by the headmen of the villages he visits with as many as he 
needs by way of tribute. The animals are killed by a thrust 
from a small javelin in the region of the heart, the wound being 
purposely small in order to avoid any loss of blood, which, with 
the internal parts, are the perquisites of the men who perform 
the work of the butcher ; hence all are eager to render service 
in that line. Each tribe has its own way of cutting up and dis- 
tributing an animal. Among the Makololo the hump and ribs 
belong to the chief; among the Bakwains the breast is his per- 
quisite. After the oxen are cut up, the different joints are placed 
before Sekeletu, and he apportions them among the gentlemen 
of the party. The whole is rapidly divided by their attendants, 
cut into long strips, and so many of these are thrown into the 
fires at once that they are nearly put out. Half broiled and 
burning hot the meat is quickly handed round ; every one gets a 
mouthful, but no one except the chief has time to masticate. It 
is not the enjoyment of eating they aim at, but to get as much 
of the food into the stomach as possible during the short time 
the others are cramming as well as themselves, for no one can 
eat more than a mouthful after the others have finished. They 
are eminently gregarious in their eating ; and, as they despise 
any one who eats alone, I always poured out two cups of coffee 
at my own meals, so that the chief, or some one of the principal 
men, might partake along with me. They all soon become very 



Chap. XL MAKOLOLO HUTS. 207 

fond of coffee ; and, indeed, some of the tribes attribute greater 
fecundity to the daily use of this beverage. They were all well 
acquainted with the sugar-cane, as they cultivate it in the 
Barotse country, but knew nothing of the method of extracting 
the sugar from it. They use the cane only for chewing. Seke- 
letu, relishing the sweet coffee and biscuits, of which I then had 
a store, said, " he knew my heart loved him by finding Ins own 
heart warming to my food." He had been visited during my 
absence at the Cape by some traders and Griquas, and "their 
coffee did not taste half so nice as mine, because they loved his 
ivory and not himself." This was certainly an original mode of 
discerning character. 

Sekeletu and I had each a little gipsy-tent in which to sleep. 
The Makololo huts are generally clean, while those of the Maka- 
laka are infested with vermin. The cleanliness of the former is 
owing to the habit of frequently smearing the floors with a plaster 
composed of cowdung and earth. If we slept in the tent in some 
villages, the mice ran over our faces and disturbed our sleep, or 
hungry prowling dogs would eat our shoes and leave only the 
soles. When they were guilty of this, and other misdemeanours, 
we got the loan of a hut. The best sort of Makololo huts consist 
of three circular walls, with small holes as doors, each similar to 
that in a dog-house ; and it is necessary to bend down the body 
to get in, even when on all-fours. The roof is formed of reeds or 
straight sticks, in shape like a Chinaman's hat, bound firmly 
together with circular bands, which are lashed with the strong 
inner bark of the mimosa-tree. When all prepared except the 
thatch, it is lifted on to the circular wall, the rim resting on a 
circle of poles, between each of which the third wall is built. 
The roof is thatched with fine grass, and sewed with the same 
material as the lashings ; and, as it projects far beyond the walls, 
and reaches within four feet of the ground, the shade is the best 
to be found in the country. These huts are very cool in the 
hottest day, but are close and deficient in ventilation by night. 

The bed is a mat made of rushes sewn together with twine ; 
the hip-bone soon becomes sore on the hard flat surface, as we 
are not allowed to make a hole in the floor to receive the promi- 
nent part called trochanter by anatomists, as we do when sleep- 
ing on grass or sand. 



208 THE LEEAMBYE. Chap. XI. 

Our course at this time led us to a part above Sesheke, called 
Katonga, where there is a village belonging to a Bashubia man 
named Sekhosi— latitude 17° 29' 13", longitude 24° 33'. The 
river here is somewhat broader than at Sesheke, and certainly 
not less than six hundred yards. It flows somewhat slowly in the 
first part of its eastern course. When the canoes came from Sek- 
hosi to take us over, one of the comrades of Sebituane rose, and, 
looking to Sekeletu, called out, "The elders of a host always 
take the lead in an attack." This was understood at once ; and 
Sekeletu, with all the young men, were obliged to give the 
elders the precedence, and remain on the southern bank and see 
that all went orderly into the canoes. It took a considerable 
time to ferry over the whole of our large party, as, even with 
quick paddling, from six to eight minutes were spent in the 
mere passage from bank to bank. 

Several days were spent in collecting canoes from different 
villages on the river, which we now learned is called by the 
whole of the Barotse the Liambai, or Leeambye. This we could 
not ascertain on our first visit, and, consequently, called the river 
after the town, "Sesheke." This term Sesheke means "white 
sand-banks," many of which exist at this part. There is another 
village in the valley of the Barotse likewise called Sesheke, and 
for the same reason ; but the term Leeambye means " the large 
river," or the river par excellence. Luambeji, Luambesi, Ambezi, 
Ojimbesi, and Zambesi, &c, are names applied to it at different 
parts of its course, according to the dialect spoken, and all pos- 
sess a similar signification, and express the native idea of this 
magnificent stream being the main drain of the country. 

In order to assist in the support of our large party, and at the 
same time to see the adjacent country, I went several times, 
during our stay, to the north of the village for game. The 
country is covered with clumps of beautiful trees, among which 
fine open glades stretch away in every direction ; when the river 
is in flood these are inundated, but the tree-covered elevated 
spots are much more numerous here than in the country between 
the Chobe and the Leeambye. The soil is dark loam, as it is 
everywhere on spots reached by the inundation, while among the 
trees it is sandy, and not covered so densely with grass as else- 
where. A sandy ridge covered with trees, running parallel to, 



Chap. XI. THE TIANYANE. 209 

and about eight miles from the river, is the limit of the inunda- 
tion on the north ; there are large tracts of this sandy forest in 
that direction, till you come to other large districts of alluvial 
soil and fewer trees. The latter soil is always found in the 
vicinity of rivers winch either now overflow their banks annually, 
or formerly did so. The people enjoy rain in sufficient quantity 
to raise very large supplies of grain and ground-nuts. 

This district contains great numbers of a small antelope named 
Tianyane, unknown in the south. It stands about eighteen 
inches high, is very graceful in its movements, and utters a cry 
of alarm not unlike that of the domestic fowl ; it is of a brownish- 
red colour on the sides and back, with the belly and lower part 
of the tail white ; it is very timid, but the maternal affection 
that the little thing bears to its young will often induce it to 
offer battle even to a man approaching it. When the young 
one is too tender to run about with the dam, she puts one foot 
on the prominence about the seventh cervical vertebra, or 
withers ; the instinct of the young enables it to understand that 
it is now required to kneel down, and to remain quite still till it 
hears the bleating of its dam. If you see an otherwise gre- 
garious she-antelope separated from the herd, and going alone 
anywhere, you may be sure she has laid her little one to sleep 
in some cozy spot. The colour of the hair in the young is better 
adapted for assimilating it with the ground than that of the older 
animals, which do not need to be screened from the observation 
of birds of prey. I observed the Arabs at Aden, when making 
their camels kneel down, press the thumb on the withers in 
exactly the same way the antelopes do with their young ; 
probably they have been led to the custom by seeing this plan 
adopted by the gazelle of the Desert. 

Great numbers of buffaloes, zebras, tsessebes, tahaetsi, and 
eland, or pohu, grazed undisturbed on these plains, so that very 
little exertion was required to secure a fair supply of meat for 
the party during the necessary delay. Hunting on foot, as all 
those who have engaged in it in this country will at once admit, 
is very hard work indeed. The heat of the sun by day is so 
great, even in winter, as it now was, that, had there been any one 
on whom I could have thrown the task, he would have been 
most welcome to all the sport the toil is supposed to impart. 



210 AN ELAND SHOT. Chap. XI. 

But the Makololo shot so badly, that, in order to save my powder, 
I was obliged to go myself. 

We shot a beautiful cow-eland, standing in the shade of a fine 
tree. It was evident that she had lately had her calf killed by 
a lion, for there were five long deep scratches on both sides of 
her hind-quarters, as if she had run to the rescue of her calf, and 
the lion, leaving it, had attacked herself, but was unable to pull 
her down. When lying on the ground, the milk flowing from 
the large udder showed that she must have been seeking the 
shade, from the distress its non-removal in the natural manner 
caused. She was a beautiful creature, and Lebeole, a Makololo 
gentleman who accompanied me, speaking in reference to its 
size and beauty, said, "Jesus ought to have given us these 
instead of cattle." It was a new undescribed variety of this 
splendid antelope. It was marked with narrow white bands 
across the body, exactly like those of the koodoo, and had a 
black patch of more than a hand-breadth on the outer side of 
the fore arm.

Having at last procured a sufficient number of canoes, we 
began to ascend the river. I had the choice of the whole fleet, 
and selected the best, though not the largest ; it was thirty-four 
feet long by twenty inches wide. I had six paddlers, and the 
larger canoe of Sekeletu had ten. They stand upright, and 
keep the stroke with great precision, though they change from 
side to side as the course demands. The men at the head 
and stern are selected from the strongest and most expert of 
the whole. The canoes, being flat-bottomed, can go into very 
shallow water ; and whenever the men can feel the bottom they 
use the paddles, winch are about eight feet long, as poles to 
punt with. Our fleet consisted of thirty-three canoes, and about 
one hundred and sixty men. It was beautiful to see them 
skimming along so quickly, and keeping the time so well. On 
land the Makalaka fear the Makololo ; on water the Makololo 
fear them, and cannot prevent them from racing with each 
other, dashing along at the top of their speed, and placing their 
masters' lives in danger. In the event of a capsize many of the 
Makololo would sink like stones. A case of this kind happened 
on the first day of our voyage up. The wind, blowing generally 
from the east, raises very large waves on the Leeambye. An

212 ISLANDS— THE BANYETI. Chap. XII. 

old doctor of the Makololo had his canoe filled by one of these 
waves, and, being unable to swim, was lost; the Barotse who 
were in the canoe with him saved themselves by swimming, and 
were afraid of being punished with death in the evening for not 
saving the doctor as well. Had he been a man of more influence, 
they certainly would have suffered death. 

We proceeded rapidly up the river, and I felt the pleasure of 
looking on lands winch had never been seen by an European 
before. The river is, indeed, a magnificent one, often more 
than a mile broad, and adorned with many islands of from three 
to five miles in length. Both islands and banks are covered with 
forest, and most of the trees on the brink of the water send 
down roots from their branches like the banian, or Ficus Indica. 
The islands at a little distance seem great rounded masses of 
sylvan vegetation reclining on the bosom of the glorious stream. 
The beauty of the scenery of some of the islands is greatly in- 
creased by the date-palm, with its gracefully curved fronds and 
refreshing light-green colour, near the bottom of the picture, and 
the lofty palmyra towering far above, and casting its feathery 
foliage against a cloudless sky. It being winter, we had the 
strange colouring on the banks which many parts of African 
landscape assume. The country adjacent to the river is rocky 
and undulating, abounding in elephants and all the other large 
game, except leches and nakongs, winch seem generally to avoid 
stony ground. The soil is of a reddish colour, and very fertile, 
as is attested by the great quantity of grain raised annually by 
the Banyeti. A great many villages of this poor and very in- 
dustrious people are situated on both banks of the river ; they 
are expert hunters of the hippopotami and other animals, and 
very proficient in the manufacture of articles of wood and iron. 
The whole of this part of the country being infested with the 
tsetse, they are unable to rear domestic animals. This may 
have led to their skill in handicraft works. Some make large 
wooden vessels with very neat lids, and wooden bowls of all 
sizes ; and since the idea of sitting on stools has entered the 
Makololo mind, they have shown great taste in the different 
forms given to the legs of these pieces of furniture. 

Other Banyeti, or Manyeti, as they are called, make neat and 
strong baskets of the split roots of a certain tree, whilst others 



Chap. XII. RAPIDS AND FALLS. 213 

excel in pottery and iron. I cannot find that they have ever 
been warlike. Indeed, the wars in the centre of the country, 
where no slave-trade existed, have seldom been about anything 
else but cattle. So well known is this, that several tribes refuse 
to keep cattle because they tempt their enemies to come and 
steal. Nevertheless they have no objection to eat them when 
offered, and their country admits of being well stocked. I have 
heard of but one war having occurred from another cause. Three 
brothers, Barolongs, fought for the possession of a woman who 
was considered worth a battle, and the tribe has remained per- 
manently divided ever since. 

From the bend up to the north, called Katima-molelo (I 
quenched fire), the bed of the river is rocky, and the stream runs 
fast, forming a succession of rapids and cataracts, which prevent 
continuous navigation when the water is low. The rapids are 
not visible when the river is full, but the cataracts of Nambwe, 
Bombwe, and Kale must always be dangerous. The fall at each 
of these is between four and six feet. But the falls of Glonye 
present a much more serious obstacle. There we were obliged 
to take the canoes out of the water, and carry them more than a 
mile by land. The fall is about thirty feet. The main body of 
water, which comes over the ledge of rock when the river is low, 
is collected into a space seventy or eighty yards wide before it 
takes the leap, and, a mass of rock being thrust forward against 
the roaring torrent, a loud sound is produced. Tradition reports 
the destruction in this place of two hippopotamus-hunters, who, 
over eager in the pursuit of a wounded animal, were, with their 
intended prey, drawn down into the frightful gulf. There is also 
a tradition of a man, evidently of superior mind, who left his 
own countrymen, the Barotse, and came down the river, took 
advantage of the falls, and led out a portion of the water there 
for irrigation. Such minds must have arisen from time to time 
in these regions, as well as in our own country, but, ignorant of 
the use of letters, they have left no memorial behind them. We 
dug out some of an inferior kind of potato (Sisiny&ne) from his 
garden, for when once planted it never dies out. This root is 
bitter and waxy, though it is cultivated. It was not in flower, so 
I cannot say whether it is a solanaceous plant or not. One 
never expects to find a grave nor a stone of remembrance set 



214 THE BAROTSE VALLEY.. Chap. XII. 

up in Africa ; the very rocks are illiterate, they contain so few 
fossils. Those here are of reddish variegated hardened sandstone 
with madrepore-holes in it. This, and broad horizontal strata of 
trap, sometimes a hundred miles in extent, and each layer having 
an inch or so of black silicious matter on it, as if it had floated there 
while in a state of fusion, form a great part of the bottom of the 
central valley. These rocks, in the southern part of the country 
especially, are often covered with twelve or fifteen feet of soft 
calcareous tufa. At Bombwe we have the same trap, with radi- 
ated zeolite, probably mesotype, and it again appears at the 
confluence of the Chobe, further down. 

As we passed up the river, the different villages of Banyeti 
turned out to present Sekeletu with food and skins, as their 
tribute. One large village is placed at Gonye, the inhabitants 
of which are required to assist the Makololo to carry their canoes 
past the falls. The tsetse here lighted on us even in the middle 
of the stream. This we crossed repeatedly, in order to make 
short cuts at bends of the river. The course is however remark- 
ably straight among the rocks ; and here the river is shallow, on 
account of the great breadth of surface which it covers. When 
we came to about 16° 16' S. latitude, the high wooded banks 
seemed to leave the river, and no more tsetse appeared. Viewed 
from the flat reedy basin in which the river then flowed, the 
banks seemed prolonged into ridges of the same wooded character 
two or three hundred feet high, and stretched away to the N.N.E. 
and N.N.W. until they were twenty or thirty miles apart. The 
intervening space, nearly one hundred miles in length, with the 
Leeambye winding gently near the middle, is the true Barotse 
valley. It bears a close resemblance to the valley of the Nile, 
and is inundated annually, not by rains, but by the Leeambye, 
exactly as Lower Egypt is flooded by the Nile. The villages of 
the Barotse are built on mounds, some of which are said to have 
been raised artificially by Santuru, a former chief of the Barotse, 
and during the inundation the whole valley assumes the appear- 
ance of a large lake, with the villages on the mounds like islands, 
just as occurs in Egypt with the villages of the Egyptians. Some 
portion of the waters of inundation comes from the north-west, 
where great floodings also occur, but more comes from the north 
and north-east, descending the bed of the Leeambye itself. 



Chap. XII. EXECUTION OF TWO CONSPIRATORS. 215 

There are but few trees in this valley : those which stand on 
the mounds were nearly all transplanted by Santuru for shade. 
The soil is extremely fertile, and the people are never in want 
of grain, for, by taking advantage of the moisture of the inun- 
dation, they can raise two crops a year. The Barotse are strongly 
attached to this fertile valley ; they say, " Here hunger is not 
known." There are so many things besides corn which a man 
can find in it for food, that it is no wonder they desert from 
Linyanti to return to this place. 

The great valley is not put to a tithe of the use it might 
be. It is covered with coarse succulent grasses, which afford 
ample pasturage for large herds of cattle ; these thrive wonder- 
fully, and give milk copiously to their owners. When the valley 
is flooded, the cattle are compelled to leave it and go to the 
higher lands, where they fall off in condition ; their return is a 
time of joy. 

It is impossible to say whether this valley, which contains so 
much moisture, would raise wheat as the valley of the Nile does. 
It is probably too rich, and would make corn run entirely to 
straw, for one species of grass was observed twelve feet high, 
with a stem as thick as a man's thumb. At present the pas- 
turage is never eaten off, though the Makololo possess immense 
herds of cattle. 

There are no large towns ; the mounds on which the towns 
and villages are built being all small, and the people require to 
live apart on account of their cattle. 

This visit was the first Sekeletu had made to these parts since 
he attained the chieftainship. Those who had taken part with 
Mpepe were consequently in great terror. When we came to 
the town of Mpepe's father, as he and another man had coun- 
selled Mamochisane to put Sekeletu to death and marry Mpepe, 
the two were led forth and tossed into the river. Nokuane was 
again one of the executioners. When I remonstrated against 
human blood being shed in the off-hand way in which they were 
proceeding, the counsellors justified their acts by the evidence 
given by Mamochisane, and calmly added, " You see we are still 
Boers ; we are not yet taught." 

Mpepe had given full permission to the Mambari slave-dealers 
to trade in all the Batoka and Bashukulompo villages to the

east of this. He had given them cattle, ivory, and children, 
and had received in return a large blunderbuss to be mounted 
as a cannon. When the slight circumstance of my having 
covered the body of the chief with my own, deranged the whole 
conspiracy, the Mambari, in their stockade, were placed in very 
awkward circumstances. It was proposed to attack them and 
drive them out of the country at once, but, dreading a com- 
mencement of hostilities, I urged the difficulties of that course, 
and showed that a stockade defended by perhaps forty muskets 
would be a very serious affair. " Hunger is strong enough for 
that," said an under-chief ; " a very great fellow is he." They 
thought of attacking them by starvation. As the chief sufferers 
in case of such an attack would have been the poor slaves chained 
in gangs, I interceded for them, and the result of an intercession 
of which they were ignorant was, that they were allowed to 
depart in peace. 

Naliele, the capital of the Barotse, is built on a mound which 
was constructed artificially by Santuru, and was his storehouse 
for grain. His own capital stood about five hundred yards to 
the south of that, in what is now the bed of the river. All that 
remains of the largest mound in the valley are a few cubic yards 
of earth, to erect winch, cost the whole of the people of Santuru 
the labour of many years. The same thing has happened to 
another ancient site of a town, Linangelo, also on the left bank. 
It would seem, therefore, that the river in this part of the valley 
must be wearing eastwards. No great rise of the river is required 
to submerge the whole valley ; a rise of ten feet above the 
present low-water mark would reach the highest point it ever 
attains, as seen in the markings of the bank on which stood 
Santuru's ancient capital, and two or three feet more would 
deluge all the villages. Tins never happens, though the water 
sometimes comes so near the foundations of the huts, that the 
people cannot move outside the walls of reeds which encircle 
their villages. When the river is compressed among the high 
rocky banks near G-onye, it rises sixty feet. 

The influence of the partial obstruction it meets with there, is 
seen in the more winding course of the river north of 16° ; and 
when the swell gets past Katima-molelo, it spreads out on the 
lands on both banks towards Sesheke. 



Chap. XII. BAROTSE ERAS. 217 

Santuru, at whose ancient granary we are staying, was a great 
hunter, and very fond of taming wild animals. His people, 
aware of his taste, brought to him every young antelope they 
could catch, and, among other things, two young hippopotami. 
These animals gambolled in the river by day, but never failed to 
remember to come up to Naliele for their suppers of milk and 
meal. They were the wonder of the country till a stranger, 
happening to come to visit Santuru, saw them reclining in the 
sun, and speared one of them on the supposition that it was 
wild. The same unlucky accident happened to one of the cats 
I had brought to Sekeletu. A stranger, seeing an animal he 
had never viewed before, killed it, and brought the trophy to 
the chief, thinking that he had made a very remarkable dis- 
covery ; we thereby lost the breed of cats, of which, from the 
swarms of mice, we stood in great need. 

On making inquiries to ascertain whether Santuru, the Mo- 
loiana, had ever been visited by white men, I could find no 
vestige of any such visit ;* there is no evidence of any of San- 
turu's people having ever seen a white man before the arrival of 
Mr. Oswell and myself in 1851. The people have, it is true, no 
written records ; but any remarkable event here is commemo- 
rated in names, as was observed by Park to be the case in the 



* The Barotse call themselves the Baloiana, or little Baloi, as if they 
had been an offset from Loi, or Lni, as it is often spelt. As Lni had been 
visited by Portuguese, but its position not well ascertained, my inquiries re- 
ferred to the identity of Naliele with Lui. On asking the headman of the 
Mambari party, named Porto, whether he had ever heard of Naliele being 
visited previously, he replied in the negative, and stated that he " had him- 
self attempted to come from Bihe three times, but had always been prevented 
by the tribe called Ganguellas." He nearly succeeded in 1852, but was 
driven back. He now (in 1853) attempted to go eastward from Naliele, 
but came back to the Barotse on being unable to go beyond Kainko's village, 
which is situated on the Bashukulompo river, and eight days distant. The 
whole party was anxious to secure a reward believed to be promised by the 
Portuguese Government. Their want of success confirmed my impression 
that I ought to go westwards. Porto kindly offered to aid me, if I would go 
with him to Bihe ; but when I declined, he preceded me to Loanda, and was 
publishing his Journal when I arrived at that city. Ben Habib told me that 
Porto had sent letters to Mosambique by the Arab, Ben Chombo, whom I 
knew ; and he has since asserted, in Portugal, that he himself went to Mosam- 
bique as well as his letters ! 



218 THE MAMBARI. Chap. XII. 

countries lie traversed. The year of our arrival is dignified by 
the name of the year when the white men came, or of Sebitu- 
ane's death ; but they prefer the former, as they avoid, if pos- 
sible, any direct reference to the departed. After my wife's first 
visit, great numbers of children were named Ma-Kobert, or 
mother of Kobert, her eldest child ; others were named Gun, 
Horse, Waggon, Monare, Jesus, &c. ; but though our names, and 
those of the native Portuguese who came in 1853, were adopted, 
there is not a trace of anything of the sort having happened 
previously among the Barotse : the visit of a white man is such a 
remarkable event, that, had any taken place during the last three 
hundred years, there must have remained some tradition of it. 

But Santuru was once visited by the Mambari, and a distinct 
recollection of that visit is retained. They came to purchase 
slaves, and both Santuru and his head men refused them per- 
mission to buy any of the people. The Makololo quoted this 
precedent when speaking of the Mambari, and said that they, 
as the present masters of the country, had as good a right to 
expel them as Santuru. The Mambari reside near Bihe, under 
an Ambonda chief named Kangombe. They profess to use the 
slaves for domestic purposes alone. 

Some of these Mambari visited us while at Naliele. They 
are of the Ambonda family, which inhabits the country south- 
east of Angola, and speak the Bunda dialect, which is of 
the same family of languages with the Barotse, Bayeiye, 
&c, or those black tribes comprehended under the general 
term Makalaka. They plait their hair in three-fold cords, 
and lay them carefully down around the sides of the head. 
They are quite as dark as the Barotse, but have among them a 
number of half-castes, with their peculiar yellow sickly hue. 
On inquiring why they had fled on my approach to Linyanti, 
they let me know that they had a vivid idea of the customs of 
English cruisers on the coast. They showed also their habits 
in their own country by digging up and eating, even here where 
large game abounds, the mice and moles which infest the 
country. The half-castes, or native Portuguese, could all read 
and write, and the head of the party, if not a real Portuguese, 
had European hair, and, influenced probably by the letter of 
recommendation which I held from the Chevalier Duprat, His 



Chap. XII. RELIGIOUS FEELING. 219 

Most Faithful Majesty's Arbitrator in the British and Portu- 
guese Mixed Commission at Cape Town, was evidently anxious 
to show me all the kindness in his power. These persons I feel 
assured were the first individuals of Portuguese blood who ever 
saw the Zambesi in the centre of the country, and they had 
reached it two years after our discovery in 1851. 

The town or mound of Santuru's mother was shown to me ; 
this was the first symptom of an altered state of feeling with 
regard to the female sex that I had observed. There are few or 
no cases of women being elevated to the headships of towns 
further south. The Barotse also showed some relics of their chief, 
which evinced a greater amount of the religious feeling than 
I had ever known displayed among Bechuanas. His more recent 
capital, Lilonda, built, too, on an artificial mound, is covered with 
different kinds of trees, transplanted when young by himself. 
They form a grove on the end of the mound, in which are to be 
seen various instruments of iron just in the state he left them. 
One looks like the guard of a basket-hilted sword ; another has 
an upright stem of the metal, on which are placed branches 
worked at the ends into miniature axes, hoes, and spears ; on 
these he was accustomed to present offerings, according as he 
desired favours to be conferred in undertaking hewing, agricul- 
ture, or fighting. The people still living there, in charge of 
these articles, were supported by presents from the chief ; and 
the Makololo sometimes follow the example, This was the 
nearest approach to a priesthood I met. When I asked them 
to part with one of these relics they replied, " 0, no, he refuses." 
— " Who refuses ? " — " Santuru," was their reply, showing their 
belief in a future state of existence. After explaining to them, 
as I always did when opportunity offered, the nature of true 
worship, and praying with them in the simple form which needs 
no offering from the worshipper except that of the heart, and 
planting some fruit-tree seeds in the grove, we departed. 

Another incident, which occurred at the confluence of the Leeba 
and Leeambye, may be mentioned here, as showing a more vivid 
perception of the existence of spiritual beings, and greater prone- 
ness to worship, than among the Bechuanas. Having taken lunar 
observations in the morning, I was waiting for a meridian altitude 
of the sun for the latitude ; my chief boatman was sitting by, in 



220 GARDENS— GAME. Chap. XII. 

order to pack up the instruments as soon as I had finished ; there 
was a large halo, about 20° in diameter, round the sun ; thinking 
that the humidity of the atmosphere, which this indicated, might 
betoken rain, I asked him if his experience did not lead him to 
the same view. " no," replied he ; " it is the Barimo (gods, or 
departed spirits), who have called a picho ; don't you see they 
have the Lord (sun) in the centre ?" 

While stiU at Naliele I walked out to Katongo (lat. 15° 16' 33"), 
on the ridge which bounds the valley of the Barotse in that 
direction, and found it covered with trees. It is only the com- 
mencement of the lands which are never inundated ; their gentle 
rise from the dead level of the valley much resembles the edge 
of the Desert in the valley of the Nile. But here the Banyeti 
have fine gardens, and raise great quantities of maize, millet, and 
native corn (Holcus sorghum), of large grain and beautifully white. 
They grow, also, yams, sugar-cane, the Egyptian arum, sweet 
potato (Convolulus batata), two kinds of manioc or cassava (Ja- 
tropha manihot and J. utilissima, a variety containing scarcely 
any poison), besides pumpkins, melons, beans, and ground-nuts. 
These, with plenty of fish in the river, its branches and lagoons, 
wild fruits and water-fowl, always make the people refer to the 
Barotse as the land of plenty. The scene from the ridge, on 
looking back, was beautiful. One cannot see the western side 
of the valley in a cloudy day, such as that was when we visited 
the stockade, but we could see the great river glancing out at 
different points, and fine large herds of cattle quietly grazing on 
the green succulent herbage, among numbers of cattle-stations 
and villages which are dotted over the landscape. Leches in 
hundreds fed securely beside them, for they have learned only to 
keep out of bow-shot, or two hundred yards. When guns come 
into a country the animals soon learn their longer range, and 
begin to run at a distance of five hundred yards. 

I imagined the slight elevation (Katongo) might be healthy, 
but was informed that no part of this region is exempt from fever. 
When the waters begin to retire from this valley, such masses of 
decayed vegetation and mud are exposed to the torrid sun, that 
even the natives suffer severely from attacks of fever. The grass 
is so rank in its growth, that one cannot see the black alluvial 
soil of the bottom of this periodical lake. Even when the grass 



Chap. XII. THE HERALD. 221 

falls down in winter, or is " laid " by its own weight, one is obliged 
to lift the feet so high, to avoid being tripped up by it, as to make 
walking excessively fatiguing. Young leches are hidden beneath 
it by their dams; and the Makololo youth complain of being 
unable to run in the Barotse land on this account. There was 
evidently no healthy spot in this quarter ; and the current of the 
river being about four and a half miles per hour (one hundred 
yards in sixty seconds), I imagined we might find what was needed 
in the higher lands, from which the river seemed to come. I 
resolved, therefore, to go to the utmost limits of the Barotse 
country before coming to a final conclusion. Katongo was the 
best place we had seen ; but in order to accomplish a complete 
examination, I left Sekeletu at Naliele, and ascended the river. 
He furnished me with men, besides my rowers, and among the 
rest a herald, that I might enter his villages in what is considered 
a dignified manner. This it was supposed would be effected by the 
herald shouting out at the top of his voice, " Here comes the lord ; 
the great lion;" the latter phrase being "tau e tona," which in 
his imperfect way of pronunciation became " sau e tona," and so 
like " the great sow," that I could not receive the honour with 
becoming gravity, and had to entreat him, much to the annoyance 
of my party, to be silent. 

In our ascent we visited sl number of Makololo villages, and 
were always received with a hearty welcome, as messengers to 
them of peace — which they term " sleep." They behave well in 
public meetings, even on the first occasion of attendance, probably 
from the habit of commanding the Makalaka, crowds of whom 
swarm in every village, and whom the Makololo women seem to 
consider as especially under their charge. 

The river presents the same appearance of low banks without 
trees as we have remarked it had after we came to 16° 16', until 
we arrive at Libonta (14° 59' S. lat.). Twenty miles beyond that, 
we find forest down to the water's edge, and tsetse. Here I might 
have turned back, as no locality can be inhabited by Europeans 
where that scourge exists ; but hearing that we were not far from 
the confluence of the river of Londa, or Lunda, named Leeba, or 
Loiba, and the chiefs of that country being reported to be friendly 
to strangers, and therefore likely to be of use to me on my return 
from the west coast, I still pushed on to latitude 14° 11' 3" S. 



222 NO HEALTHY LOCATION. Chap. XII. 

There the Leeambye assumes the name Kabompo, and seems to 
be coming from the east. It is a fine large river, about three 
hundred yards wide, and the Leeba two hundred and fifty. The 
Loeti, a branch of which is called Langebongo, comes from 
W.N.W., through a level grassy plain named Mango ; it is about 
one hundred yards wide, and enters the Leeambye from the west ; 
the waters of the Loeti are of a light colour, and those of the 
Leeba of a dark mossy hue. After the Loeti joins the Leeambye 
the different coloured waters flow side by side for some distance 
unmixed. 

Before reaching the Loeti we came to a number of people from 
the Lobale region, hunting hippopotami. They fled precipitately 
as soon as they saw the Makololo, leaving their canoes and all 
then utensils and clothing. My own Makalaka, who were accus- 
tomed to plunder wherever they went, rushed after them like 
furies, totally regardless of my shouting. As this proceeding 
would have destroyed my character entirely at Lobale, I took my 
stand on a commanding position as they returned, and forced 
them to lay down all the plunder on a sandbank, and leave it 
there for its lawful owners. 

It was now quite evident that no healthy location could be 
obtained in which the Makololo would be allowed to live in peace. 
I had thus a fair excuse, if I had chosen to avail myself of it, of 
coming home and saying that the " door was shut," because the 
Lord's time had not yet come. But believing that it was my 
duty to devote some portion of my life to these (to me at least) 
very confiding and affectionate Makololo, I resolved to follow out 
the second part of my plan, though I had failed in accomplishing 
the first. The Leeba seemed to come from the N. and by W., or 
N.N.W. ; so, having an old Portuguese map, which pointed out 
the Coanza as rising from the middle of the continent in 9° S. lat., 
I thought it probable that, when we had ascended the Leeba (from 
14° 11') two or three degrees, we should then be within one hun- 
dred and twenty miles of the Coanza, and find no difficulty in 
following it down to the coast near Loanda. This was the logical 
deduction, but, as is the case with many a plausible theory, one 
of the premises was decidedly defective. The Coanza, as we 
afterwards found, does not come from anywhere near the centre 
of the country. 



Ohap. XII. LIONS— ABABS. 223 

The numbers of large game above Libonta are prodigious, and 
they proved remarkably tame. Eighty-one buffaloes denied in 
slow procession before our fire one evening within gun-shot ; and 
herds of splendid elands stood by day without fear at two hundred 
yards distance. They were all of the striped variety, and with 
their forearm markings, large dewlaps, and sleek skins, were a 
beautiful sight to see. The lions here roar much more than in 
the country near the lake, Zouga, and Chobe. One evening we 
had a good opportunity of hearing the utmost exertions the animal 
can make in that line. We had made our beds on a large sand- 
bank, and could be easily seen from all sides ; a lion on the 
opposite shore amused himself for hours by roaring as loudly as 
he could, putting, as is usual in such cases, his mouth near the 
ground, to make the sound reverberate. The river was too broad 
for a ball to reach him, so we let him enjoy himself, certain that 
he durst not have been guilty of the impertinence in the Bushman 
country. Wherever the game abounds, these animals exist in 
proportionate numbers. Here they were very frequently seen, 
and two of the largest I ever saw seemed about as tall as com- 
mon donkeys; but the mane made their bodies appear rather 
larger. 

A party of Arabs from Zanzibar were in the country at this 
time. Sekeletu had gone from Naliele to the town of his mother 
before we arrived from the north, but left an ox for our use, and 
instructions for us to follow him thither. We came down a branch 
of the Leeambye called Marile, which departs from the main river 
in lat. 15° 15' 43" S., and is a fine deep stream about sixty 
yards wide ; it makes the whole of the country around Naliele an 
island. When sleeping at a village in the same latitude as Naliele 
town two of the Arabs mentioned made their appearance ; they 
were quite as dark as the Makololo, but, having their heads shaved, 
I could not compare their hair with that of the inhabitants of the 
country. When we were about to leave they came to bid adieu, 
but I asked them to stay and help us to eat our ox. As they had 
scruples about eating an animal not blooded in their own way, 
I gained their good will by saying I was quite of their opinion as 
to getting quit of the blood, and gave them two legs of an animal 
slaughtered by themselves. They professed the greatest detesta- 



224 TOWN OF MA-SEKELETU. Chap. XII. 

tion of the Portuguese, " because they eat pigs ;" and disliked the 
English, " because they thrash them for selling slaves." I was 
silent about pork ; though, had they seen me at a hippopotamus 
two days afterwards, they would have set me down as being as 
much a heretic as any of that nation ; but I ventured to tell them 
that I agreed with the English, that it was better to let the 
children grow up and comfort their mothers when they became 
old, than to carry them away and sell them across the sea. This 
they never attempt to justify ; " they want them only to cultivate 
the land, and take care of them as their children." It is the same 
old story, justifying a monstrous wrong on pretence of taking 
care of those degraded portions of humanity which cannot take 
care of themselves — doing evil that good may come. 

These Arabs, or Moors, could read and write their own lan- 
guage readily ; and, when speaking about our Saviour, I admired 
the boldness with which they informed me "that Christ was a 
very good prophet, but Mahomet was far greater." And with 
respect to their loathing of pork, it may have some foundation 
in their nature ; for I have known Bechuanas, who had no pre- 
judice against the wild animal, and ate the tame without scruple, 
yet, unconscious of any cause of disgust, vomit it again. The 
Bechuanas south of the lake have a prejudice against eating 
fish, and allege a disgust to eating anything like a serpent. 
This may arise from the remnants of serpent-worship floating 
in their minds, as, in addition to this horror of eating such 
animals, they sometimes render a sort of obeisance to living 
serpents by clapping their hands to them, and refusing to 
destroy the reptiles ; but in the case of the hog they are 
conscious of no superstitious feeling. 

Having parted with our Arab friends, we proceeded down the 
Marile till we re-entered the Leeambye, and went to the town 
of Ma-Sekeletu (mother of Sekeletu), opposite the island of 
Loyela. Sekeletu had always supplied me most liberally with 
food, and, as soon as I arrived, presented me with a pot of boiled 
meat, while his mother handed me a large jar of butter, of which 
they make great quantities for the purpose of anointing their 
bodies. He had himself sometimes felt the benefit of my way 
of putting aside a quantity of the meat after a meal, and had 



Chap. XII. THE MAKOLOLO POLKA. 225 

now followed my example, by ordering some to be kept for me. 
According to their habits, every particle of an ox is devoured at 
one meal ; and, as the chief cannot, without a deviation from 
their customs, eat alone, he is often compelled to suffer severely 
from hunger, before another meal is ready. We henceforth 
always worked into each other's hands by saving a little for each 
other ; and when some of the sticklers for use and custom grum- 
bled, I advised them to eat like men, and not like vultures. 

As this was the first visit which Sekeletu had paid to this part 
of his dominions, it was to many a season of great joy. The 
head men of each village presented oxen, milk, and beer, more 
than the horde winch accompanied him could devour, though 
their abilities in that Hue are something wonderful. The people 
usually show their joy and work off then excitement in dances 
and songs. The dance consists of the men standing nearly 
naked in a circle, with clubs or small battle-axes in their hands, 
and each roaring at the loudest pitch of his voice, while they 
simultaneously lift one leg, stamp heavily twice with it, then lift 
the other and give one stamp with that ; this is the only move- 
ment in common. The arms and head are thrown about also in 
every direction ; and all this time the roaring is kept up with 
the utmost possible vigour ; the continued stamping makes a 
cloud of dust ascend, and they leave a deep ring in the ground 
where they have stood. If the scene were witnessed in a lunatic 
asylum it would be nothing out of the way, and quite appro- 
priate even, as a means of letting off the excessive excitement 
of the brain ; but here grey-headed men joined in the perform- 
ance with as much zest as others whose youth might be an 
excuse for making the perspiration stream off their bodies with 
the exertion. Motibe asked what I thought of the Makololo 
dance. I replied, " It is very hard work, and brings but small 
profit." " It is," replied he, " but it is very nice, and Sekeletu 
will give us an ox for dancing for him." He usually does 
slaughter an ox for the dancers when the work is over. 

The women stand by, clapping their hands, and occasionally 
one advances into the circle, composed of a hundred men, makes 
a few movements, and then retires. As I never tried it, and 
am unable to enter into the spirit of the thing, I cannot recom- 
mend the Makololo polka to the dancing world, but I have the 

Q 



226 HEATHENISM. Chap. XII. 

authority of no less a person than Motibe, Sekeletu's father-in- 
law, for saying "it is very nice." They often asked if white 
people ever danced. I thought of the disease called St. Vitus's 
dance, but could not say that all our dancers were affected by 
it, and gave an answer which, I ought to be ashamed to own, did 
not raise some of our young countrywomen in the estimation of 
the Makololo. 

As Sekeletu had been waiting for me at his mother's, we left 
the town as soon as I arrived, and proceeded down the river. 
Our speed with the stream was very great, for in one day we 
went from Litofe to Gonye, a distance of forty-four miles of 
latitude ; and if we add to this the windings of the river, in longi- 
tude the distance will not be much less than sixty geographical 
miles. At this rate we soon reached Sesheke, and then the town 
of Linyanti. 

I had been, during a nine weeks' tour, in closer contact with 
heathenism than I had ever been before ; and though all, in- 
cluding the chief, were as kind and attentive to me as possible, 
and there was no want of food (oxen being slaughtered daily, 
sometimes ten at a time, more than sufficient for the wants of 
all), yet to endure the dancing, roaring, and singing, the jesting, 
anecdotes, grumbling, quarrelling, and murdering of these chil- 
dren of nature, seemed more like a severe penance than anything 
I had before met with in the course of my missionary duties. I 
took thence a more intense disgust at heathenism than I had 
before, and formed a greatly elevated opinion of the latent effects 
of missions in the south, among tribes which are reported to 
have been as savage as the Makololo. The indirect benefits, 
which to a casual observer lie beneath the surface and are inap- 
preciable, in reference to the probable wide diffusion of Chris- 
tianity at some future time, are worth all the money and labour 
that have been expended to produce them.

Linyanti, September, 1853. — The object proposed to the Mako- 
lolo seemed so desirable, that it was resolved to proceed with 
it, as soon as the cooling influence of the rains should be felt 
in November. The longitude and latitude of Linyanti (lat. 
18° 17' 20" S., long. 23° 50' 9" E.) showed that St. Philip de 
Benguela was much nearer to us than Loanda; and I might 
have easily made arrangements with the Mambari to allow me 
to accompany them as far as Bihe, which is on the road to that 
port ; but it is so undesirable to travel in a path once trodden by 
slave-traders, that I preferred to find out another line of march. 
Accordingly, men were sent at my suggestion to examine all 
the country to the west, to see if any belt of country, free from 
tsetse, could be found to afford us an outlet. The search was 
fruitless. The town and district of Linyanti are surrounded by 
forests infested by this poisonous insect, except at a few points, as 
that by which we entered at Sanshureh and another at Sesheke. 
But the lands both east and west of the Barotse valley are free 
from this insect plague. There, however, the slave-trade had 
defiled the path, and no one ought to follow in its wake unless 
well armed. The Mambari had informed me that many English 
lived at Loanda, so I prepared to go thither. The prospect of 
meeting with countrymen seemed to overbalance the toils of the 
longer march. ¦.- " — 

Q 2 



228 A " PICHO"— ITS EESULTS. Chap. XIII. 

A "picho" was called to deliberate on the steps proposed. 
In these assemblies great freedom of speech is allowed ; and on 
this occasion one of the old diviners said, " Where is he taking 
you to ? This white man is throwing you away. Your gar- 
ments already smell of blood." It is curious to observe how 
much identity of character appears all over the world. This 
man was a noted croaker. He always dreamed something 
dreadful in every expedition, and was certain that an eclipse 
or comet betokened the propriety of flight. But Sebituane 
formerly set his visions down to cowardice, and Sekeletu only 
laughed at him now. The general voice was in my favour ; so 
a band of twenty-seven were appointed to accompany me to the 
west. These men were not hired, but sent to enable me to 
accomplish an object as much desired by the chief and most of 
his people as by me. They were eager to obtain free and 
]:>rofitable trade with white men. The prices which the Cape 
merchants could give, after defraying the great expenses of a 
long journey hither, being very small, made it scarce worth while 
for the natives to collect produce for that market; and the 
Mambari, giving only a few bits of print and baize for elephants' 
tusks worth more pounds than they gave yards of cloth, had 
produced the belief that trade with them was throwing ivory 
away. The desire of the Makololo for direct trade with the sea- 
coast coincided exactly with my own conviction, that no per- 
manent elevation of a people can be effected without commerce. 
Neither could there be a permanent mission here, unless the 
missionaries should descend to the level of the Makololo, for, 
even at Kolobeng, we found that traders demanded three or four 
times the price of the articles we needed, and expected us to be 
grateful to them besides, for letting us have them at all. 

The three men whom I had brought from Kuruman had 
frequent relapses of the fever ; so, finding that instead of serving 
me I had to wait on them, I decided that they should return to 
the south with Fleming as soon as he had finished his trading. 
I was then entirely dependent on my twenty-seven men, whom I 
might name Zambesians, for there were two Makololo only, while 
the rest consisted of Barotse, Batoka, Bashubia, and two of the 
Ambonda. 

The fever had caused considerable weakness in my own frame, 



Chap. XIII. THE LOST JOURNAL -REFLECTIONS. 229 

and a strange giddiness when I looked np suddenly to any celes- 
tial object, for everything seemed to rush to the left, and if I did 
not catch hold of some object I fell heavily on the ground: 
something resembling a gush of bile along the duct from the 
liver caused the same fit to occur at night, whenever I turned 
suddenly round. 

The Makololo now put the question, "In the event of your 
death, will not the white people blame us for having allowed 
you to go away into an unhealthy, unknown country of enemies ?" 
I replied that none of my friends would blame them, because I 
would leave a book with Sekeletu, to be sent to Mr. Moffat in 
case I did not return, which would explain to him all that had 
happened until the time of my departure. The book was a 
volume of my Journal ; and, as I was detained longer than I 
expected at Loanda, this book with a letter was delivered by 
Sekeletu to a trader, and I have been unable to trace it. I 
regret this now, as it contained valuable notes on the habits of 
wild animals, and the request was made in the letter to convey 
the volume to my family. The prospect of passing away from 
this fair and beautiful world thus came before me in a pretty 
plain matter-of-fact form, and it did seem a serious thing to 
leave wife and children — to break up all connection with earth, 
and enter on an untried state of existence ; and I find myself in 
my journal pondering over that fearful migration which lands us 
in eternity ; wondering whether an angel will soothe the flutter- 
ing soul, sadly flurried as it must be on entering the spirit world ; 
and hoping that Jesus might speak but one word of peace, for 
that would establish in the bosom an everlasting calm. But as 
I had always believed that, if we serve God at all, it ought to be 
done in a manly way, I wrote to my brother, commending our 
little girl to Ms care, as I was determined to " succeed or perish" 
in the attempt to open up this part of Africa. The Boers, by 
taking possession of all my goods, had saved me the trouble of 
making a will ; and, considering the light heart now left in my 
bosom, and some faint efforts to perform the duty of Christian 
forgiveness, I felt that it was better to be the plundered party 
than one of the plunderers. 

When I committed the waggon and remaining goods to the 
care of the Makololo, they took all the articles except one box 



230 OUTFIT FOR JOURNEY. Chap. XIII. 

into their huts ; and two warriors, Ponuane and Mahale, brought 
forward each a fine heifer calf. After performing a number of 
warlike evolutions, they asked the chief to witness the agreement 
made between them, that whoever of the two should kill a 
Matebele warrior first, in defence of the waggon, should possess 
both the calves. 

I had three muskets for my people, a rifle and double-bar- 
relled smooth bore for myself; and, having seen such great 
abundance of game in my visit to the Leeba, I imagined that I 
could easily supply the wants of my party. Wishing also to 
avoid the discouragement which would naturally be felt on 
meeting any obstacles if my companions were obliged to carry 
heavy loads, I took only a few biscuits, a few pounds of tea and 
sugar, and about twenty of coffee, which, as the Arabs find, though 
used without either milk or sugar, is a most refreshing bever- 
age after fatigue or exposure to the sun. We carried one small 
tin canister, about fifteen inches square, filled with spare shirting, 
trowsers, and shoes, to be used when we reached civilised life, 
and others in a bag, which were expected to wear out on the 
way ; another of the same size for medicines ; and a third for 
books, my stock being a Nautical Almanac, Thomson's Loga- 
rithm Tables, and a Bible ; a fourth box contained a magic 
lantern, which we found of much use. The sextant and artificial 
horizon, thermometer and compasses, were carried apart. My 
ammunition was distributed in portions through the whole lug- 
gage, so that, if an accident should befall one part, we could still 
have others to fall back upon. Our chief hopes for food were 
upon that, but in case of failure I took about 20 lbs. of beads, 
worth 40s., which still remained of the stock I brought from 
Cape Town; a small gipsy tent, just sufficient to sleep in; a 
sheepskin mantle as a blanket, and a horse-rug as a bed. As 
I had always found that the art of successful travel consisted in 
taking as few " impedimenta " as possible, and not forgetting to 
carry my wits about me, the outfit was rather spare, and in- 
tended to be still more so when we should come to leave the 
canoes. Some would consider it injudicious to adopt this plan, 
but I had a secret conviction that if I did not succeed it would 
not be for lack of the " nicknacks " advertised as indispensable 
for travellers, but from want of " pluck," or because a large 



Chap. XIII. THE CHOBE— HIPPOPOTAMI. 231 

array of baggage excited the cupidity of the tribes through 
whose country we wished to pass. 

The instruments I carried, though few, were the best of their 
kind. A sextant, by the famed makers Troughton and Sims of 
Fleet-Street ; a chronometer watch, with a stop to the seconds 
hand — an admirable contrivance for enabling a person to take 
the exact time of observations : it was constructed by Dent of 
the Strand (61) for the Eoyal Geographical Society, and selected 
for the service by the President, Admiral Smythe, to whose 
judgment and kindness I am in this and other matters deeply 
indebted. It was pronounced by Mr. Maclear to equal most 
chronometers in performance. For these excellent instruments 
I have much pleasure in recording my obligations to my good 
friend Colonel Steele, and at the same time to Mr. Maclear for 
much of my ability to use them. Besides these, I had a ther- 
mometer by Dollond; a compass from the Cape Observatory, 
and a small pocket one in addition ; a good small telescope with 
a stand capable of being screwed into a tree. 

11th of November, 1853. — Left the town of Linyanti, accom- 
panied by Sekeletu and his principal men, to embark on the 
Chobe. The chief came to the river in order to see that all was 
right at parting. We crossed five branches of the Chobe before 
reaching the main stream ; this ramification must be the reason 
why it appeared so small to Mr. Oswell and myself in 1851. 
When all the departing branches re-enter, it is a large deep 
river. The spot of embarkation was the identical island where 
we met Sebituane, first known as the island of Maunku, one of 
his wives. The chief lent me his own canoe, and, as it was 
broader than usual, I could turn about in it with ease. 

The Chobe is much infested by hippopotami, and, as certain 
elderly males are expelled the herd, they become soured in their 
temper, and so misanthropic as to attack every canoe that passes 
near them. The herd is never dangerous, except when a canoe 
passes into the midst of it when all are asleep, and some of them 
may strike the canoe in terror. To avoid this, it is generally 
recommended to travel by day near the bank, and by night in 
the middle of the stream. As a rule, these animals flee the 
approach of man. The " solitaires," however, frequent certain 
localities well known to the inhabitants on the banks, and, like 



232 BANKS OF THE CHOBE— TREES. Chap. XIII. 

the rogue elephants, are extremely dangerous. We came, at 
this time, to a canoe, which had been smashed to pieces by a 
blow from the hind foot of one of them. I was informed by my 
men that, in the event of a similar assault being made upon 
ours, the proper way was to dive to the bottom of the river, and 
hold on there for a few seconds, because the hippopotamus, after 
breaking a canoe, always looks for the people on the surface, 
and, if he sees none, he soon moves off. I have seen some 
frightful gashes made on the legs of the people who have had 
the misfortune to be attacked, and were unable to dive. This 
animal uses his teeth as an offensive weapon, though he is quite 
a herbivorous feeder. One of these " bachelors," living near the 
confluence, actually came out of his lair, and, putting his head 
down, ran after some of our men who were passing with very 
considerable speed. 

The part of the river called Zabesa, or Zabenza, is spread out 
like a little lake, surrounded on all sides by dense masses of tall 
reeds. The river below that, is always one hundred or one 
hundred and twenty yards broad, deep, and never dries up so 
much as to become fordable. At certain parts, where the 
partial absence of reeds affords a view of the opposite banks, the 
Makololo have placed villages of observation against their ene- 
mies the Matebele. We visited all these in succession, and 
found here, as everywhere in the Makololo country, orders had 
preceded us, "that Nake (nake means doctor) must not be 
allowed to become hungry." 

The banks of the Chobe, like those of the Zouga, are of soft 
calcareous tufa, and the river has cut out for itself a deep, per- 
pendicular-sided bed. Where the banks are high, as at the spot 
where the waggons stood in 1851, they are covered with magni- 
ficent trees, the habitat of'tsetse, and the retreat of various ante- 
lopes, wild hogs, zebras, buffaloes, and elephants. 

Among the trees may be observed some species of the Ficus 
indica, light-green coloured acacias, the splendid motsintsela, 
and evergreen cypress-shaped motsouri. The fruit of the last- 
named was ripe, aud the villagers presented many dishes of its 
beautiful pink-coloured plums ; they are used chiefly to form a 
pleasant acid drink. The motsintsela is a very lofty tree, 
yielding a wood of which good canoes are made ; the fruit is 



Chap. XIII. CONFLUENCE OF CHOBE AND LEEAMBYE. 233 

nutritious and good, but, like many wild fruits of this country, 
the fleshy parts require to be enlarged by cultivation: it is 
nearly all stone. 

The course of the river we found to be extremely tortuous, — 
so much so, indeed, as to carry us to all points of the compass 
every dozen miles. Some of us walked from a bend at the 
village of Moremi to another nearly due east of that point, in six 
hours, while the canoes, going at more than double our speed, 
took twelve to accomplish the voyage between the same two 
places. And though the river is from thirteen to fifteen feet 
in depth at its lowest ebb, and broad enough to allow a steamer 
to ply upon it, the suddenness of the bendings would prevent 
navigation ; but, should the country ever become civilised, the 
Chobe would be a convenient natural canal. We spent forty- 
two and a half hours, paddling at the rate of five miles an hour, 
in coming from Linyanti to the confluence ; there we found a 
dyke of amygdaloid lying across the Leeambye. 

This amygdaloid with analami and mesotype contains crystals, 
winch the water gradually dissolves, leaving the rock with a 
worm-eaten appearance. It is curious to observe that the 
water flowing over certain rocks, as in this instance, imbibes an 
appreciable, though necessarily most minute, portion of the mi- 
nerals they contain. The water of the Chobe up to this point 
is of a dark mossy hue, but here it suddenly assumes a lighter 
tint ; and wherever this light colour shows a greater amount of 
mineral, there are not mosquitoes enough to cause serious an- 
noyance to any except persons of very irritable temperaments. 

The large island called Mparia stands at the confluence. This 
is composed of trap (zeolite, probably mesotype) of a younger age 
than the deep stratum of tufa in which the Chobe has formed 
its bed, for, at the point where they come together, the tufa has 
been transformed into saccharoid limestone. 

The actual point of confluence of these two rivers, the Chobe 
and the Leeambye, is ill defined, on account of each dividing 
into several branches as they inosculate ; but when the whole 
body of water collects into one bed, it is a goodly sight for one 
who has spent many years in the thirsty south. Standing on 
one bank, even the keen eye of the natives cannot detect whe- 
ther two large islands, a few miles east of the junction, are 



234 DEFIANCE OF AUTHORITY. Chap. XIII. 

mainland or not. During a flight in former years, when the 
present chief Sekomi was a child in his mother's arms, the Ba- 
rn angwato men were separated from their women, and inveigled 
on to one of these islands by the Makalaka chief of Mparia, on 
pretence of ferrying them across the Leeambye. They were 
left to perish after seeing their wives taken prisoners by these 
cruel lords of the Leeambye, and Sekomi owed his life to the 
compassion of one of the Bayeiye, who, pitying the young chief- 
tain, enabled his mother to make her escape by night. 

After spending one night at the Makololo village on Mparia, 
we left the Chobe, and turning round began to ascend the 
Leeambye ; on the 19th of November we again reached the 
town of Sesheke. It stands on the north bank of the river, and 
contains a large population of Makalaka, under Moriantsane, 
brother-in-law of Sebituane. There are parties of various tribes 
here, assembled under their respective headmen, but a few 
Makololo rule over all. Their sway, though essentially des- 
potic, is considerably modified by certain customs and laws. 
One of the Makalaka had speared an ox belonging to one of the 
Makololo, and being unable to extract the spear, was thereby 
discovered to be the perpetrator of the deed. His object had 
been to get a share of the meat, as Moriantsane is known to 
be liberal with any food that comes into his hands. The culprit 
was bound hand and foot and placed in the sun to force him to 
pay a fine, but he continued to deny his guilt. His mother, 
believing in the innocence of her son, now came forward, with 
her hoe in hand, and, threatening to cut down any one who 
should dare to interfere, untied the cords with which he had 
been bound and took him home. This open defiance of autho- 
rity was not resented by Moriantsane, but referred to Sekeletu 
at Linyanti. 

The following circumstance, which happened here when I was 
present with Sekeletu, shows that the simple mode of punish- 
ment, by forcing a criminal to work out a fine, did not strike 
the Makololo mind until now. 

A stranger, having visited Sesheke for the purpose of barter, 
was robbed by one of the Makalaka of most of his goods. The 
thief, when caught, confessed the theft, and that he had given 
the articles to a person who had removed to a distance. The 



Chap. XIII. PUBLIC ADDRESSES. 235 

Makololo were much enraged at the idea of their good name 
being compromised by this treatment of a stranger. Their cus- 
tomary mode of punishing a crime which causes much indigna- 
tion is to throw the criminal into the river, but, as this would 
not restore the lost property, they were sorely puzzled how to 
act. The case was referred to me, and I solved the difficulty 
by paying for the loss myself, and sentencing the thief to work 
out an equivalent with his hoe in a garden. This system was 
immediately introduced, and thieves are now sentenced to raise 
an amount of corn proportioned to their offences. Among the 
Bakwains, a woman who had stolen from the garden of another, 
was obliged to part with her own entirely ; it became the pro- 
perty of her whose field was injured by the crime. 

There is no stated day of rest in any part of tins country, 
except the day after the appearance of the new moon, and the 
people then refrain only from going to their gardens. A curious 
custom, not to be found among the Bechuanas, prevails among 
the black tribes beyond them. They watch most eagerly for the 
first glimpse of the new moon, and, when they perceive the faint 
outline after the sun has set deep in the west, they utter a loud 
shout of "Kua!" and vociferate prayers to it. My men, for 
instance, called out, " Let our journey with the white man be 
prosperous ! Let our enemies perish, and the children of Nake 
become rich ! May he have plenty of meat on this journey I" 
&c. &c. 

I gave many public addresses to the people of Sesheke under 
the outspreading camel-thorn tree, which serves as a shade to 
the kotla on the high bank of the river. It was pleasant to 
see the long lines of men, women, and children winding along 
from different quarters of the town, each party following behind 
their respective head men. They often amounted to between 
five and six hundred souls, and required an exertion of voice 
which brought back the complaint for which I had got the uvula 
excised at the Cape. They were always very attentive; and 
Moriantsane, in order, as he thought, to please me, on one occa- 
sion rose up in the middle of the discourse, and hurled his staff 
at the heads of some young fellows, whom he saw working with 
a skin instead of listening. My hearers sometimes put very 
sensible questions on the subjects brought before them ; at other 



236 PROGRESS UP THE LEEAMBTE. Chap. XIII. 

times they introduced the most frivolous nonsense, immediately- 
after hearing the most solemn truths. Some begin to pray to 
Jesus in secret as soon as they hear of the white man's God, 
with but little idea of what they are about ; and no doubt are 
heard by Him who, like a father, pitieth his children. Others, 
waking by night, recollect what has been said about the future 
world so clearly, that they tell next day what a fright they got 
by it, and resolve not to listen to the teaching again ; and not a 
few keep to the determination not to believe, as certain villagers 
in the south, who put all their cocks to death because they crowed 
the words, " Tlang lo rapeleng " — " Come along to prayers." 

On recovering partially from a severe attack of fever which 
remained upon me ever since our passing the village of Moremi 
on the Chobe, we made ready for our departure up the river by 
sending messages before us to the villages to prepare food. We 
took four elephants' tusks, belonging to Sekeletu, with us, as a 
means of testing the difference of prices between the Portuguese, 
whom we expected to reach, and the white traders from the 
south. Moriantsane supplied us well with honey, milk, and 
meal. The rains were just commencing in this district; but 
though showers sufficient to lay the dust had fallen, they had 
no influence whatever on the amount of water in the river, yet 
never was there less in any part than three hundred yards of a 
deep flowing stream. 

Our progress up the river was rather slow : this was caused 
by waiting opposite different villages for supplies of food. We 
might have done with much less than we got ; but my Makololo 
man, Pitsane, knew of the generous orders of Sekeletu, and was 
not at all disposed to allow them to remain a dead letter. The 
villages of the Banyeti contributed large quantities of mosibe, 
a bright red bean yielded by a large tree. The pulp enclosing 
the seed is not much thicker than a red wafer, and is the por- 
tion used. It requires the addition of honey to render it at all 
palatable. 

To these were added great numbers of the fruit which yields 
a variety of the nux vomica, from which we derive that virulent 
poison strychnia. The pulp between the nuts is the part eaten, 
and it is of a pleasant juicy nature, having a sweet acidulous 
taste. The fruit itself resembles a large yellow orange, but the 



Chap. XIII. FRUITS— RAPIDS. 237 

rind is hard, and, with the pips and bark, contains much of the 
deadly poison. They evince their noxious qualities by an in- 
tensely bitter taste. The nuts, swallowed inadvertently, cause 
considerable pain, but not death ; and to avoid this inconveni- 
ence, the people dry the pulp before the fire, in order to be able 
the more easily to get rid of the noxious seeds. 

A much better fruit, called mobola, was also presented to us. 
This bears, around a pretty large stone, as much of the fleshy part 
as the common date, and it is stripped off the seeds and preserved 
in bags in a similar manner to that fruit. Besides sweetness, the 
mobola has the flavour of strawberries, with a touch of nauseous- 
ness. We carried some of them, dried as provisions, more than 
a hundred miles from this spot. 

The next fruit, named mamosho (mother of morning), is the 
most delicious of all. It is about the size of a walnut, and, un- 
like most of the other uncultivated fruits, has a seed no larger 
than that of a date. The fleshy part is juicy, and somewhat like 
the cashew-apple, with a pleasant acidity added. Fruits similar 
to those which are here found on trees are found on the plains 
of the Kalahari, growing on mere herbaceous plants. There are 
several other examples of a similar nature. Shrubs, well known 
as such in the south, assume the rank of trees as we go to the 
north ; and the change is quite gradual as our latitude decreases, 
the gradations being herbaceous plants, shrubs, bushes, small, 
then large, trees. But it is questionable if, in the cases of ma- 
mosho, mabola, and mawa, the tree and shrub are identical, 
though the fruits so closely resemble each other ; for I found 
both the dwarf and tree in the same latitude. There is also a 
difference in the leaves, and they bear at different seasons. 

The banks of the river were at this time appearing to greater 
advantage than before. Many trees were putting on their fresh 
green leaves, though they had got no rain, their lighter green 
contrasting beautifully with the dark motsouri, or moyela, now 
covered with pink plums as large as cherries. The rapids 
having comparatively little water in them, rendered our passage 
difficult. The canoes must never be allowed to come broadside 
on to the stream, for, being flat-bottomed, they would, in that 
case, be at once capsized, and everything in them be lost. The 
men work admirably, and are always in good humour ; they 



238 RAPIDS— BIRDS. Chap. XIII. 

leap into the water without the least hesitation, to save the 
canoe from being caught by eddies or dashed against the rocks. 
Many parts were now quite shallow, and it required great 
address and power in balancing themselves to keep the vessel 
free from rocks, which lay just beneath the surface. We might 
have got deeper water in the middle, but the boatmen always 
keep near the banks, on account of danger from the hippo- 
potami. But though we might have had deeper water farther 
out, I believe that no part of the rapids is very deep. The river 
is spread out more than a mile, and the water flows rapidly over 
the rocky bottom. The portions only three hundred yards wide 
are very deep, and contain large volumes of flowing water in 
narrow compass, which, when spread over the much larger sur- 
faces at the rapids, must be shallow. Still, remembering that 
this was the end of the dry season, when such rivers as the 
Orange do not even contain a fifth part of the water of the 
Chobe, the difference between the rivers in the north and south 
must be sufficiently obvious. 

The rapids are caused by rocks of dark-brown trap, or of 
hardened sandstone, stretching across the stream. In some 
places they form miles of flat rocky bottom, with islets covered 
with trees. At the cataracts noted in the map, the fall is from 
four to six feet, and in guiding up the canoe, the stem goes 
under the water, and takes in a quantity before it can attain 
the higher level. We lost many of our biscuits in the ascent 
through this. 

These rocks are covered with a small hard aquatic plant, 
which, when the surface is exposed, becomes dry and crisp, 
crackling under the foot, as if it contained much stony matter in 
its tissue. It probably assists in disintegrating the rocks, for, in 
parts so high as not to be much exposed to the action of the 
water or the influence of the plant, the rocks are covered with a 
thin black glaze. 

In passing along under the overhanging trees of the banks, 
we often saw the pretty turtle-doves sitting peacefully on their 
nests above the roaring torrent. An ibis* had perched her 
home on the end of a stump. Her loud, harsh scream of

Chap. XIII. BIRDS— A GOOD OMEN. 239 

" Wa-wa-wa," and the piping of the fish-hawk, are sounds which 
can never be forgotten by any one who has sailed on the rivers 
north of 20° south. If we step on shore, the Charadrius carun- 
cula, a species of plover, a most plaguy sort of " public-spirited 
individual," follows you, flying overhead, and is most perse- 
vering in its attempts to give fair warning to all the animals 
within hearing, to flee from the approaching danger. The 
alarm-note, " tinc-tinc-tinc," of another variety of the same 
family (Pluvianus armatus of Burchell) has so much of a me- 
tallic ring, that this bird is called " setula-tsipi," or hammering- 
iron. It is furnished with a sharp spur on its shoulder, much 
like that on the heel of a cock, but scarcely half an inch in 
length. Conscious of power, it may be seen chasing the white- 
necked raven with great fury, and making even that compara- 
tively large bird call out from fear. It is this bird which is 
famed for its friendship with the crocodile of the Nile by the 
name siksak, and which Mr. St. John actually saw performing 
the part of toothpicker to the ugly reptile. They are frequently 
seen on the same sandbanks with the alligator, and, to one 
passing by, often appear as if on that reptile's back ; but I never 
had the good fortune to witness the operation described not only 
by St. John and Geoffrey St. Hilaire, but also by Herodotus. 
However, that which none of these authors knew, my head 
boatman, Mashauana, stopped the canoe to tell us, namely, 
that a water-turtle which, in trying to ascend a steep bank 
to lay her eggs, had toppled on her back, thus enabling us 
to capture her, was an infallible omen of good luck for our 
journey. 

Among the forest trees which line the banks of the rocky 
parts of the Leeambye, several new birds were observed. Some 
are musical, and the songs are pleasant in contrast with the 
harsh voice of the little green, yellow-shouldered parrots of the 
country. There are also great numbers of jet-black weavers, 
with yellowish-brown band on the shoulders. 

Here we saw, for the first time, a pretty little bird, coloured 
dark blue, except the wings and tail, which were of a cho- 
colate hue. From the tail two feathers are prolonged beyond 
the rest six inches. Also, little birds coloured white and black, 
of great vivacity, and always in companies of six or eight

together, and various others. From want of books of reference, 
I could not decide whether they were actually new to science. 

Francolins and guinea-fowl abound along the banks ; and on 
every dead tree and piece of rock may be seen one or two 
species of the web-footed Plotus, darter, or snake-bird. They sit 
most of the day sunning themselves over the stream, sometimes 
standing erect with their wings outstretched ; occasionally they 
may be seen engaged in fishing by diving, and, as they swim about, 
their bodies are so much submerged, that hardly anything appears 
above the water but their necks. Their chief time of feeding is 
by night, and, as the sun declines, they may be seen in flocks 
flying from their roosting-places to the fishing-grounds. This is 
a most difficult bird to catch when disabled. It is thoroughly 
expert in diving, — goes down so adroitly and comes up again 
in the most unlikely places, that the people, though most 
skilful in the management of the canoes, can rarely secure 
them. The rump of the darter is remarkably prolonged, and 
capable of being bent, so as to act both as a rudder in swimming, 
and as a lever to lift the bird high enough out of the water to 
give free scope to its wings. It can rise at will from the water 
by means of this appendage. 

The fine fish-hawk, with white head and neck, and reddish- 
chocolate coloured body, may also frequently be seen perched 
on the trees, and fish are often found dead, which have fallen 
victims to its talons. One most frequently seen in tins con- 
dition is itself a destroyer of fish. It is a stout-bodied fish, 
about fifteen or eighteen inches long, of a light-yellow colour, 
and gaily ornamented with stripes and spots. It has a most 
imposing array of sharp, conical teeth outside the lips — objects 
of dread to the fishermen, for it can use them effectually. One, 
which we picked up dead, had killed itself by swallowing another 
fish, winch, though too large for its stomach and throat, could 
not be disgorged. 

Tins fish-hawk generally kills more prey than it can devour. 
It eats a portion of the back of the fish, and leaves the rest for 
the Barotse, who often had a race across the river when they 
saw an abandoned morsel lying on the opposite sandbanks. The 
hawk is, however, not always so generous, for, as I myself was a 
witness on the Zouga, it sometimes plunders the purse of the 



Chap. XIII. FISH— IGUANOS— HIPPOPOTAMI. 241 

pelican. Soaring over head, and seeing this large, stupid bird 
fishing beneath, it watches till a fine fish is safe in the pelican's 
pouch ; then descending, not very quickly, but with considerable 
noise of wing, the pelican looks up to see what is the matter, 
and, as the hawk comes near, he supposes that he is about to be 
killed, and roars out " Murder ! " The opening of his mouth 
enables the hawk to whisk the fish out of the pouch, upon which 
the pelican does not fly away, but commences fishing again ; the 
fright having probably made him forget he ever had anything in 
his purse. 

A fish called mosheba, about the size of a minnow, often 
skims along the surface for several yards, in order to get out of 
the way of the canoe. It uses the pectoral fins, as the flying 
fish do, but never makes a clean flight. It is rather a succession 
of hops along the surface, made by the aid of the side fins. It 
never becomes large. 

Numbers of iguanos (mpulu) sit sunning themselves on over- 
hanging branches of the trees, and splash into the water as we 
approach. They are highly esteemed as an article of food, the 
flesh being tender and gelatinous. The chief boatman, who 
occupies the stem, has in consequence a light javelin always at 
hand, to spear them if they are not quickly out of sight. These, 
and large alligators gliding in from the banks with a heavy 
plunge as we come round a sudden bend of the stream, were the 
occurrences of every hour as we sped up the river. 

The rapids in the part of the river between Katima-molelo 
and Name'ta are relieved by several reaches of still deep water, 
fifteen or twenty miles long. In these, very large herds of hippo- 
potami are seen, and the deep furrows they make, in ascending 
the banks to graze during the nights, are everywhere apparent. 
They are guided back to the water by the scent, but a long- 
continued pouring rain makes it impossible for them to perceive, 
by that means, in which direction the river lies, and they are 
found standing bewildered on the land. The hunters take ad- 
vantage of their helplessness on these occasions to kill them. 

It is impossible to judge of the numbers in a herd, for they 
are almost always hidden beneath the waters; but as they 
require to come up every few minutes to breathe, when there is 
a constant succession of heads thrust up, then the herd is sup- 

K 



242 HIPPOPOTAMI. Chap. XIII. 

posed to be large. They love a still reach of the stream, as in 
the more rapid parts of the channel they are floated down so 
quickly, that much exertion is necessary to regain the distance 
lost, by frequently swimming up again — such constant exertion 
disturbs them in their nap. They prefer to remain by day in a 
drowsy yawning state, and, though their eyes are open, they 
take little notice of things at a distance. The males utter a 
loud succession of snorting grunts, winch may be heard a mile 
off. The canoe in which I was, in passing over a wounded one, 
elicited a distinct grunting, though the animal lay entirely 
under water. 

The young, when very little, take their stand on the neck of 
the dam, and the small head, rising above the large, comes 
soonest to the surface. The dam, knowing the more urgent 
need of her calf, comes more frequently to the surface when it 
is in her care. But in the rivers of Londa, where they are 
much in danger of being shot, even the hippopotamus gains wit 
by experience; for while those in the Zambesi put up 'their 
heads openly to blow, those referred to keep their noses among 
water-plants and breathe so quietly that one would not dream of 
their existence in the river, except by footprints on the banks.

30^ November, 1853. — At Gonye Falls. No rain has fallen 
here, so it is excessively hot. The trees have put on their 
gayest dress, and many flowers adorn the landscape, yet the 
heat makes all the leaves droop at mid-day and look languid 
for want of rain. If the country increases as much in beauty in 
front, as it has done within the last four degrees of latitude, it 
will be indeed a lovely land. 

We all felt great lassitude in travelling. The atmosphere is 
oppressive both in cloud and sunshine. The evaporation from 
the river must be excessively great, and I feel as if the fluids 
of the system joined in the general motion of watery vapour 
upwards, as enormous quantities of water must be drunk to 
supply its place. 

When under weigh our usual procedure is this : — We get up 
a little before five in the morning ; it is then beginning to dawn. 
While I am dressing, coffee is made ; and, having filled my 
pannikin, the remainder is handed to my companions, who 
eagerly partake of the refreshing beverage. The servants are 
busy loading the canoes, while the principal men are sipping the 
coffee, and, that being soon over, we embark. The next two 
hours are the most pleasant part of the day's sail, The men 
paddle away most vigorously ; the Barotse, being a tribe of boat- 

R 2 



244 FALLS OF GONYE. Chap. XIV. 

men, have large, deeply-developed chests and shoulders, with 
indifferent lower extremities. They often engage in loud scold- 
ing of each other, in order to relieve the tedium of then- work. 
About eleven we land, and eat any meat which may have re- 
mained from the previous evening meal, or a biscuit with honey, 
and drink water. 

After an hour's rest we again embark and cower under an 
umbrella. The heat is oppressive, and, being, weak from the 
last attack of fever, I cannot land, and keep the camp supplied 
with flesh. The men, being quite uncovered in the sun, perspire 
profusely, and in the afternoon begin to stop, as if waiting for 
the canoes which have been left behind. Sometimes we reach a 
sleeping-place two hours before sunset, and, all being troubled 
with languor, we gladly remain for the night. Coffee again, and 
a biscuit, or a piece of coarse bread made of maize meal, or that 
of the native corn, make up the bill of fare for the evening, 
unless we have been fortunate enough to kill something, when 
we boil a potful of flesh. This is done by cutting it up into long- 
strips and pouring in water till it is covered. When that is 
boiled dry, the meat is considered ready. 

The people at Gonye carry the canoes over the space requisite 
to avoid the falls, by slinging them on poles tied on diagonally. 
They place these on their shoulders, and, setting about the work 
with good humour, soon accomplish the task. They are a merry 
set of mortals, — a feeble joke sets them off in a fit of laughter. 
Here, as elsewhere, all petitioned for the magic lantern, and, as 
it is a good means of conveying instruction, I willingly complied. 

The falls of Gonye have not been made by wearing back, 
like those of Niagara, but are of a fissure form. For many 
miles below, the river is confined in a narrow space of not 
more than one hundred yards wide. The water goes boiling 
along, and gives the idea of great masses of it rolling over and 
over, so that even the most expert swimmer would find it diffi- 
cult to keep on the surface. Here it is that the river when in 
flood rises fifty or sixty feet in perpendicular height. The 
islands above the falls are covered with foliage as beautiful as 
can be seen anywhere. Viewed from the mass of rock which 
overhangs the fall, the scenery was the loveliest I had seen. 

Nothing worthy of note occurred on our way up to Nameta. 



Chap. XIV. MAKOLOLO FOE AY. 245 

There we heard that a party of the Makololo, headed by Lerimo, 
had made a foray to the north and up the Leeba, in the very 
direction in which we were about to proceed. Mpololo, the 
uncle of Sekeletu, is considered the headman of the Barotse 
valley; and the perpetrators had his full sanction, because 
Masiko, a son of Santuru, the former chief of the Barotse, had 
fled high up the Leeambye, and, establishing himself there, had 
sent men down to the vicinity of Naliele to draw away the 
remaining Barotse from their allegiance. Lerimo's party had 
taken some of this Masiko's subjects prisoners, and destroyed 
several villages of the Balonda, to whom we were going. This 
was in direct opposition to the policy of Sekeletu, who wished 
to be at peace with these northern tribes ; and Pitsane, my head 
man, was the bearer of orders to Mpololo to furnish us with 
presents for the very chiefs they had attacked. Thus, we were 
to get large pots of clarified butter and bunches of beads, in 
confirmation of the message of peace we were to deliver. 

When we reached Litofe, we heard that a fresh foray was in 
contemplation, but I sent forward orders to disband the party 
immediately. At Ma-Sekeletu's town Ave found the head offender, 
Mpololo himself, and I gave him a bit of my mind, to the effect 
that, as I was going with the full sanction of Sekeletu, if any 
harm happened to me in consequence of his ill-advised expedi- 
tion, the guilt would rest with him. Ma-Sekeletu, who was pre- 
sent, heartily approved all I said, and suggested that all the 
captives taken by Lerimo should be returned by my hand, to 
show Masiko that the guilt of the foray lay not with the superior 
persons of the Makololo, but with a mere servant. Her good 
sense appeared in other respects besides, and, as this was ex- 
actly what my own party had previously resolved to suggest, 
we were pleased to hear Mpololo agree to do what he was 
advised. He asked me to lay the matter before the under- 
chiefs of Naliele, and when we reached that place, on the 
9th of December, I did so in a picho, called expressly for the 
purpose. Lerimo was present, and felt rather crestfallen when 
his exploit was described by Mohorisi, one of my companions, as 
one of extreme cowardice, he having made an attack upon the 
defenceless villagers of Londa, while, as we had found on our 
former visit, a lion had actually killed eight people of JSTaliele, 



246 LIBEKALITY OF THE PEOPLE. Chap. XIV. 

without his daring to encounter it. The Makololo are cowardly 
in respect to animals, but brave against men. Mpololo took all 
the guilt upon himself before the people, and delivered up a 
caj)tive child whom his wife had in her possession ; others fol- 
lowed his example till we procured the release of five of the 
prisoners. Some thought, as Masiko had tried to take their 
children by stratagem, they ought to take his by force, as the 
two modes suited the genius of each people — the Makalaka 
delight in cunning, and the Makololo in fighting ; and others 
thought, if Sekeletu meant them to be at peace with Masiko, he 
ought to have told them so. 

It is rather dangerous to tread in the footsteps of a marauding 
party with men of the same tribe as the aggressors, but my 
people were in good spirits, and several volunteers even offered 
to join our ranks. We, however, adhered strictly to the orders 
of Sekeletu as to our companions, and refused all others. 

The people of every village treated us most liberally, present- 
ing, besides oxen, butter, milk, and meal, more than we could 
stow away in our canoes. The cows in this valley are now yield- 
ing, as they frequently do, more milk than the people can use, 
and both men and women present butter in such quantity, that 
I shall be able to refresh my men as we move along. Anointing 
the skin prevents the excessive evaporation of the fluids of the 
body, and acts as clothing in both sun and shade. They always 
made their presents gracefully. When an ox was given, the 
owner would say, " Here is a little bit of bread for you." This 
was pleasing, for I had been accustomed to the Bechuanas pre- 
senting a miserable goat, with the pompous exclamation, " Be- 
hold an ox ! " The women persisted in giving me copious sup- 
plies of shrill praises, or " lullilooing ; " but though I frequently 
told them to modify their " great lords " and " great lions " to 
more humble expressions, they so evidently intended to do me 
honour; that I could not help being pleased with the poor 
creatures' wishes for our success. 

The rains began while we were at Naliele ; this is much later 
than usual, but, though the Barotse valley has been in need of 
rain, the people never lack abundance of food. The showers 
are refreshing, but the air feels hot and close ; the thermometer 
however, in a cool hut, stands only at 84°. The access of the 



Chap. XIV. SEKOBINYANE'S MISGOVEBNMENT. 247 

external air to any spot at once raises its temperature above 90°. 
A new attack of fever here caused excessive languor ; but, as I 
am already getting tired of quoting my fevers, and never liked 
to read travels myself, where much was said about the illnesses 
of the traveller, I shall henceforth endeavour to say little about 
them. 

We here sent back the canoe of Sekeletu, and got the loan of 
others from Mpololo. Eight riding oxen, and seven for slaughter, 
were, according to the orders of that chief, also furnished ; some 
were intended for our own use, and others as presents to the 
chiefs of the Balonda. Mpololo was particularly liberal in giving 
all that Sekeletu ordered, though, as he feeds on the cattle he 
has in charge, he might have felt it so much abstracted from his 
own perquisites. Mpololo now acts the great man, and is fol- 
lowed everywhere by a crowd of toadies, who sing songs in dis- 
paragement of Mpepe, of whom he always lived in fear. While 
Mpepe was alive, he too was regaled with the same fulsome 
adulation, and now they curse him. They are very foul-tongued ; 
equals, on meeting, often greet each other with a profusion of 
oaths, and end the volley with a laugh. 

In coming up the river to Naliele we met a party of fugitive 
Barotse returning to their homes, and, as the circumstance illus* 
trates the social status of these subjects of the Makololo, I intro- 
duce it here. The villagers in question were the children, or 
serfs, if we may use the term, of a young man of the same age 
and tribe as Sekeletu, who, being of an irritable temper, went 
by the nickname of Sekobinyane — a little slavish thing. His 
treatment of his servants was so bad, that most of them had fled ; 
and when the Mambari came, and, contrary to the orders of 
Sekeletu, purchased slaves, Sekobinyane sold one or two of the 
Barotse children of his village. The rest fled immediately to 
Masiko, and were gladly received by that Barotse chief as his 
subjects. 

When Sekeletu and I first ascended the Leeambye we met 
Sekobinyane coming down, on his way to Linyanti. On being 
asked the news, he remained silent about the loss of his village, 
it being considered a crime among the Makololo for any one to 
treat Ins people so ill, as to cause them to run away from him. 
He then passed us, and, dreading the vengeance of Sekeletu for 



248 FUGITIVES— THE BEE-EATEB. Chap. XIV. 

Lis crime, secretly made his escape from Linyanti to Lake 
Ngami. He was sent for, however, and the chief at the lake 
delivered him up, on Sekeletu declaring that he had no intention 
of punishing him otherwise than by scolding. He did not even 
do that, as Sekobinyane was evidently terrified enough, and 
also became ill through fear. 

The fugitive villagers remained only a few weeks with then- 
new master Masiko, and then fled back again, and were received 
as if they had done nothing wrong. All united in abusing the 
conduct of Sekobinyane, and no one condemned the fugitives ; 
and the cattle, the use of which they had previously enjoyed, 
never having been removed from their village, they re-esta- 
blished themselves with apparent gladness. 

This incident may give some idea of the serfdom of the subject 
tribes, and, except that they are sometimes punished for running 
away and other offences, I can add nothing more by way of 
showing the true nature of this form of servitude. 

Leaving Naliele, amidst abundance of good wishes for the 
success of our expedition and hopes that we might return accom- 
panied with white traders, we began again our ascent of the river. 
It was now beginning to rise, though the rains had but just com- 
menced in the valley. The banks are low, but cleanly cut, and 
seldom sloping. At low water they are from four to eight feet 
high, and make the river always assume very much the aspect 
of a canal. They are in some parts of whitish tenacious clay 
with strata of black clay intermixed, and black loam in sand, or 
pure sand stratified. As the river rises it is always wearing to 
one side or the other, and is known to have cut across from one 
bend to another, and to form new channels. As we coast along 
the shore, pieces which are undermined often fall in with a splash 
like that caused by the plunge of an alligator, and endanger 
the canoe. 

These perpendicular banks afford building-places to a pretty 
bee-eater,* which loves to breed in society. The face of the 
sandbank is perforated with hundreds of holes leading to their 
nests, each of which is about a foot apart from the other ; 
and as we pass they pour out of their hiding-places, and float 
overhead. 

* Jiferojjs aplaster and M. bullockoidcs (Smith). 



Chap. XIV. BIRDS— SPONGES. 249 

A speckled kingfisher is seen nearly every hundred yards, 
which builds in similar spots, and attracts the attention of herd- 
boys, who dig out its nest for the sake of the young. This, 
and a most lovely little blue-and-orange kingfisher, are seen 
everywhere along the banks, dashing down like a shot into the 
water for their prey. A third, seen more rarely, is as large as a 
pigeon, and is of a slaty colour. 

Another inhabitant of the banks is the sand-martin, which 
also likes company in the work of raising a family. They 
never leave this part of the country. One may see them 
preening themselves in the very depth of winter, while the 
swallows, of which we shall yet speak, take winter trips. I 
saw sand-martins at the Orange river during a period of winter 
frost ; it is, therefore, probable that they do not migrate even 
from thence. 

Around the reeds, which in some parts line the banks, we see 
fresh-water sponges. They usually encircle the stalk, and are 
hard and brittle, presenting numbers of small round grains near 
their circumference. 

The river was running at the rate of five miles an hour, and 
carried bunches of reed and decaying vegetable matter on its 
surface ; yet the water was not discoloured. It had, however, 
a slightly yellowish-green tinge, somewhat deeper than its 
natural colour. This arose from the quantity of sand carried 
by the rising flood from sandbanks, which are annually shifted 
from one spot to another, and from the pieces falling in as the 
banks are worn ; for when the water is allowed to stand in a 
glass, a few seconds suffice for its deposit at the bottom. This 
is considered an unhealthy period. When waiting, on one 
occasion, for the other canoes to come up, I felt no inclination 
to leave the one I was in ; but my head boatman, Mashauana, 
told me never to remain on board while so much vegetable 
matter was floating down the stream. 

11th December. — At Libonta. We were detained for days 
together collecting contributions of fat and butter, according 
to the orders of Sekeletu, as presents to the Balonda chiefs. 
Much fever prevailed, and ophthalmia was rife, as is generally 
the case before the rains begin. Some of my own men required 
my assistance, as well as the people of Libonta. A lion had 



250 LIBONTA. Chap. XIV. 

done a good deal of mischief here, and when the people went to 
attack it two men were badly wounded ; one of them had his 
thigh-bone quite broken, showing the prodigious power of this 
animal's jaws. The inflammation produced by the teeth-wounds 
proved fatal to one of them. 

Here we demanded the remainder of the captives, and got 
our number increased to nineteen. They consisted of women 
and children, and one young man of twenty. One of the boys 
was smuggled away in the crowd as we embarked. The Mako- 
lolo under-chiefs often act in direct opposition to the will of 
the head chief, trusting to circumstances and brazenfacedness to 
screen themselves from his open displeasure; and as he does 
not always find it convenient to notice faults, they often go to 
considerable lengths in wrongdoing. 

Libonta is the last town of the Makololo, so, when we parted 
from it, we had only a few cattle-stations and outlying hamlets 
in front, and then an uninhabited border country till we came 
to Londa, or Lunda. Libonta is situated on a mound like the 
rest of the villages in the Barotse valley, but here the tree- 
covered sides of the valley begin to approach nearer the river. 
The village itself belongs to two of the chief wives of Sebituane, 
who furnished us with an ox and abundance of other food. The 
same kindness was manifested by all who could afford to give 
anything; and as I glance over their deeds of generosity re- 
corded in my journal, my heart glows with gratitude to them, 
and I hope and pray that God may spare me to make them 
some return. 

Before leaving the villages entirely, we may glance at our way 
of spending the nights. As soon as we land, some of the men cut 
a little grass for my bed, while Mashauana plants the poles of 
the little tent. These are used by day for carrying burdens, for 
the Barotse fashion is exactly like that of the natives of India, 
only the burden is fastened near the ends of the pole, and not 
suspended by long cords. The bed is made, and boxes ranged 
on each side of it, and then the tent pitched over all. Four or 
five feet in front of my tent is placed the principal or kotla fire, 
the wood for which must be collected by the man who occupies 
the post of herald, and takes as his perquisite the heads of all the 
oxen slaughtered, and of all the game too. Each person knows 



Chap. XIV. MODE OF PASSING THE NIGHT. 251 

the station he is to occupy, in reference to the post of honour at 
the fire in front of the door of the tent. The two Makololo 
occupy my right and left, both in eating and sleeping, as long 
as the journey lasts. But Mashauana, my head boatman, 
makes his bed at the door of the tent as soon as I retire. The 
rest, divided into small companies according to their tribes, 
make sheds all round the fire, leaving a horseshoe-shaped space 
in front sufficient for the cattle to stand in. The fire gives 
confidence to the oxen, so the men are always careful to keep 
them in sight of it. The sheds are formed by planting two 
stout forked poles in an inclined direction, and placing another 
over these in a horizontal position. A number of branches are 
then stuck in the ground in the direction to which the poles 
are inclined, the twigs drawn clown to the horizontal pole and 
tied with strips of bark. Long grass is then laid over the 
branches in sufficient quantity to draw off the rain, and we have 
sheds open to the fire in front, but secure from beasts behind. 
In less than an hour we were usually all under cover. We 
never lacked abundance of grass during the whole journey. It 
is a picturesque sight at night, when the clear bright moon of 
these climates glances on the sleeping forms around, to look 
out upon the attitudes of profound repose both men and beasts 
assume. There being no danger from wild animals in such a 
night, the fires are allowed almost to go out ; and as there is 
no fear of hungry clogs coming over sleepers and devouring the 
food, or quietly eating up the poor fellows' blankets, which at 
best were but greasy skins, which sometimes happened in the 
villages, the picture was one of perfect peace. 

The cooking is usually done in the natives' own style, and, 
as they carefully wash the dishes, pots, and the hands before 
handling food, it is by no means despicable. Sometimes altera- 
tions are made at my suggestion, and then they believe that 
they can cook in thorough white man's fashion. The cook always 
comes in for something left in the pot, so all are eager to obtain 
the office. 

I taught several of them to wash my shirts, and they did it 
well, though their teacher had never been taught that work 
lnmself. Frequent changes of linen and sunning of my blanket 
kept me more comfortable than might have been anticipated* 



252 ABUNDANCE OF ANIMAL LIFE. Chap. XIV. 

and I feel certain that the lessons of cleanliness rigidly instilled 
by my mother in childhood, helped to maintain that respect 
which these people entertain for European ways. It is ques- 
tionable if a descent to barbarous ways ever elevates a man in 
the eyes of savages. 

When quite beyond the inhabited parts, we found the country 
abounding in animal life of every form. There are upwards of 
tlrirty species of birds on the river itself. Hundreds of the Ibis 
religiosa come down the Leeambye with the rising water, as 
they do on the Nile ; then large white pelicans, in flocks of 
three hundred at a time, following each other in long extending 
line, rising and falling as they fly, so regularly all along, as to 
look like an extended coil of birds; clouds of a black shell- 
eating bird, called linongolo {Anastomus lamelligerus) ; also 
plovers, snipes, curlews, and herons, without number. 

There are, besides the more common, some strange varieties. 
The pretty white ardetta is seen in flocks, settling on the backs 
of large herds of buffaloes, and following them on the wing- 
when they run; while the kala (Textor erythrorhynclius) is a 
better horseman, for it sits on the withers when the animal is at 
full speed. 

Then those strange birds the scissor-bills, with snow-white 
breast, jet-black coat, and red beak, sitting by day on the sand- 
banks, the very picture of comfort and repose. Their nests are 
only little hollows made on these same sandbanks, without any 
attempt at concealment ; they watch them closely, and frighten 
away the marabou and crows from their eggs by feigned attacks 
at their heads. When man approaches their nests, they change 
their tactics, and, like the lapwing and ostrich, let one wing 
drop and make one leg limp, as if lame. The upper mandible 
being so much shorter than the lower, the young are more help- 
less than the stork in the fable with the flat dishes, and must 
have everything conveyed into the mouth by the parents, till 
they are able to provide for themselves. The lower mandible, 
as thin as a paper-knife, is put into the water while the bird 
skims along the surface, and scoops up any little insects it 
meets. It has great length of wing, and can continue its flight 
with perfect ease, the wings acting, though kept above the 
level of the body. The wonder is, how this ploughing of the 



Chap. XIV. WATER-FOWL. 253 

surface of the water can be so well performed as to yield a 
meal, for it is usually done in the dark. Like most aquatic 
feeders, they work by night, when insects and fishes rise to 
the surface. They have great affection for their young, its 
amount being increased in proportion to the helplessness of the 
offspring. 

There are also numbers of spoonbills, nearly white in plumage ; 
the beautiful, stately flamingo ; the Numidian crane, or demoiselle, 
some of which, tamed at Government House, Cape Town, struck 
every one as most graceful ornaments to a noble mansion as they 
perched on its pillars. There are two cranes besides — one light 
blue, the other also light blue, but with a white neck ; and gulls 
(Procellarid) of different sizes abound. 

One pretty little wader, an avoset, appears as if standing on 
stilts, its legs are so long ; and its bill seems bent the wrong- 
way, or upwards. It is constantly seen wading in the shallows, 
digging up little slippery insects, the peculiar form of the bill 
enabling it to work them easily out of the sand. When feeding, 
it puts its head under the water to seize the insect at the 
bottom, then lifts it up quickly, making a rapid gobbling, as if 
swallowing a wriggling worm. 

The Parr a African a runs about on the surface as if walking 
on water, catching insects. It too has long, thin legs, and 
extremely long toes, for the purpose of enabling it to stand on 
the floating lotus-leaves and other aquatic plants. When it 
stands on a lotus-leaf five inches in diameter, the spread of toes, 
acting on the principle of snow-shoes, occupies all the surface, 
and it never sinks, though it obtains a livelihood, not by swim- 
ming or flying, but by walking on the water. 

Water-birds, whose prey or food requires a certain aim or 
action in one direction, have bills quite straight in form, as the 
heron and snipe; while those which are intended to come in 
contact with hard substances, as breaking shells, have the bills 
gently curved, in order that the shock may not be communicated 
to the brain. 

The Barotse valley contains great numbers of large black 
geese.* They may be seen everywhere walking slowly about 

* Anser leucagaster and melanogastcr. 



254 WATER-FOWL— ALLIGATORS, Chap. XIV, 

feeding. They have a strong black spur on the shoulder like the 
armed plover, and as strong as that on the heel of a cock, but are 
never seen to use them, except in defence of their young. They 
choose anthills for their nests ; and, in the time of laying, the 
Barotse consume vast quantities of their eggs. There are also 
two varieties of geese, of somewhat smaller size, but better 
eating. One of these, the Egyptian goose or Yulpanser, cannot 
rise from the water, and dining the floods of the river great 
numbers are killed by being pursued in canoes. The third is 
furnished with a peculiar knob on the beak. These, with myriads 
of ducks of three varieties, abound everywhere on the Leeambye. 
On one occasion the canoe neared a bank on which a large 
flock was sitting. Two shots furnished our whole party with a 
supper, for we picked up seventeen ducks and a goose. No 
wonder the Barotse always look back to tins fruitful valley as the 
Israelites did to the flesh-pots of Egypt. The poorest persons 
are so well supplied with food from their gardens, fruits from 
the forest trees, and fish from the river, that their children, when 
taken into the service of the Makololo, where they have only one 
large meal a-day, become quite emaciated and pine for a return 
to their parents. 

Part of our company marched along the banks with the oxen, 
and part went in the canoes, but our pace was regulated by 
the speed of the men on shore. Their course was rather difficult, 
on account of the numbers of departing and re-entering branches 
of the Leeambye, which they had to avoid, or wait at till we 
ferried them over. The number of alligators is prodigious, and 
in this river they are more savage than in some others. Many 
cliildren are carried off annually at Sesheke and other towns ; 
for, notwithstanding the clanger, when they go down for water 
they almost always must play awhile. This reptile is said by the 
natives to strike the victim with its tail, then drag him in and 
drown him. When lying in the water watching for prey, the 
body never appears. Many calves are lost also, and it is seldom 
that a number of cows can swim over at Sesheke without some 
loss. I never could avoid shuddering on seeing my men 
swimming across these branches, after one of them had been 
caught by the thigh and taken below. He, however, retained, as 
nearly all of them in the most trying circumstances do, his full 



Chap. XIV. ALLIGATORS- SUPERSTITION. 255 

presence of mind, and, having a small, square, ragged-edged 
javelin with him, when dragged to the bottom gave the alligator 
a stab behind the shoulder. The alligator, writhing in pain, left 
him, and he came out with the deep marks of the reptile's teeth 
on his thigh. Here the people have no antipathy to persons who 
have met with such an adventure, but, in the Bamangwato and 
Bakwain tribes, if a man is either bitten or even has had water 
splashed over him by the reptile's tail, he is expelled his tribe. 
When on the Zouga we saw one of the Bamangwato living among 
the Bayeiye, who had the misfortune to have been bitten and 
driven out of his tribe in consequence. Fearing that I would 
regard Mm with the same disgust which his countrymen profess 
to feel, he would not tell me the cause of his exile, but the 
Bayeiye informed me of it, and the scars of the teeth were visible 
on his thigh. If the Bakwains happened to go near an alligator 
they would spit on the ground, and indicate its presence by 
saying, " Boleo ki bo " — " There is sin." They imagine the mere 
sight of it would give inflammation of the eyes ; and, though they 
eat the zebra without hesitation, yet if one bites a man he is ex- 
pelled the tribe, and obliged to take his wife and family away to the 
Kalahari. These curious relics of the animal-worship of former 
times scarcely exist among the Makololo. Sebituane acted on 
the principle, " Whatever is food for men is food for me :" so no 
man is here considered unclean. The Barotse appear inclined 
to pray to alligators and eat them too, for when I wounded a 
water-antelope, called mochose, it took to the water ; when near 
the other side of the river an alligator appeared at its tail, and 
then both sank together. Mashauana, who was nearer to it than 
I, told me that, " though he had called to it to let his meat 
alone, it refused to listen." One day we passed some Barotse 
lads who had speared an alligator, and were waiting in expecta- 
tion of its floating soon after. The meat has a strong musky 
odour, not at all inviting for any one except the very hungry. 

When we had gone thirty or forty miles above Libonta we 
sent eleven of our captives to the west to the chief called 
Makoma with an explanatory message. This caused some delay ; 
but as we were loaded with presents of food from the Makololo, 
and the wild animals were in enormous herds, we fared sumptu- 
ously. It w T as grievous, however, to shoot the lovely creatures, 



256 GAME—COMPARATIVE TENACITY OF LIFE. Chap. XIV. 

they were so tame. With but little skill in stalking, one could 
easily get within fifty or sixty yards of them. There I lay, look- 
ing at the graceful forms and motions of beautiful pokus,* leches, 
and other antelopes, often till my men, wondering what was the 
matter, came up to see, and frightened them away. If we had 
been starving, I could have slaughtered them with as little 
hesitation as I should cut off a patient's leg ; but I felt a doubt, 
and the antelopes got the benefit of it. Have they a guardian 
spirit over them? I have repeatedly observed, when I ap- 
proached a herd lying beyond an anthill with a tree on it, and 
viewed them with the greatest caution, they very soon showed 
symptoms of uneasiness. They did not snuff danger in the 
wind, for I was to leeward of them, but the almost invariable 
apprehension of danger which arose, while unconscious of the 
direction in which it lay, made me wonder whether each had 
what the ancient physicians thought we all possessed, an archon, 
or presiding spirit. 

If we could ascertain the most fatal spot in an animal, we 
could despatch it with the least possible amount of suffering ; but 
as that is probably the part to which the greatest amount of 
nervous influence is directed at the moment of receiving the 
shot, if we cannot be sure of the heart or brain, we are never 
certain of speedy death. Antelopes, formed for a partially 
amphibious existence, and other animals of that class, are much 
more tenacious of life than those which are purely terrestrial. 
Most antelopes, when in distress or pursued, make for the water. 
If hunted they always do. A leche shot right through the body, 
and no limb-bone broken, is almost sure to get away, while a 
zebra, with a wound of no greater severity, will probably drop 
down dead. I have seen a rhinoceros, while standing apparently 
chewing the cud, drop down dead from a shot in the stomach, 
wliile others shot through one lung and the stomach go off as if 
little hurt. But if one should crawl up silently to within twenty 
yards of either the white or black rhinoceros, throwing up a 
pinch of dust every now and then, to find out that the anxiety 
to keep the body concealed by the bushes, has not led him to

traveller, Major Vardon. 



Chap. XIV. r GUN MEDICINE. 257 

the windward side, then sit down, rest the elbows on the knees, 
and aim, slanting a little upwards, at a dark spot behind the 
shoulders, it falls stone dead. 

To show that a shock on the part of the system to which 
much nervous force is at the time directed, will destroy life, it 
may be mentioned that an eland, when hunted, can be despatched 
by a wound, wliich does little more than injure the muscular 
system ; its whole nervous force is then imbuing the organs 
of motion : and a giraffe, when pressed hard by a good horse 
only two or three hundred yards, has been known to drop down 
dead, without any wound being inflicted at all. A full gallop 
by an eland or giraffe quite dissipates its power, and the 
hunters, aware of this, always try to press them at once to it, 
knowing that they have but a short space to run before the 
animals are in their power. In doing this, the old sportsmen 
are careful not to go too close to the giraffe's tail, for this animal 
can swing his hind foot round in a way which would leave little 
to choose, between a kick with it, and a clap from the arm of a 
windmill. 

When the nervous force is entire, terrible wounds may be 
inflicted without killing ; a tsessebe having been shot through 
the neck while quietly feeding, we went to him, and one of the 
men cut his throat deep enough to bleed him largely. He 
started up after this and ran more than a mile, and would have 
got clear off, had not a dog brought him to bay under a tree, 
where we found him standing. 

My men, having never had fire-arms in their hands before, 
found it so difficult to hold the musket steady at the flash of 
fire in the pan, that they naturally expected me to furnish them 
with " gun medicine," without which, it is almost universally 
believed, no one can shoot straight. Great expectations had 
been formed when I arrived among the Makololo on this subject ; 
but having invariably declined to deceive them, as some for 
their own profit have done, my men now supposed that I would 
at last consent, and thereby relieve myself from the hard work 
of hunting by employing them after due medication. This I 
was most willing to do, if I could have done it honestly ; for, 
having but little of the hunting furore in my composition, I 

s

always preferred eating the game to killing it. Sulphur is the 
remedy most admired, and I remember Sechele giving a large 
price for a very small bit. He also gave some elephants' tusks, 
worth 30/., for another medicine which was to make him invul- 
nerable to musket-balls. As I uniformly recommended that 
these things should be tested by experiment, a calf was anointed 
with the charm and tied to a tree. It proved decisive, and 
Sechele remarked it was " pleasanter to be deceived than un- 
deceived." I offered sulphur for the same purpose, but that was 
declined, even though a person came to the town afterwards 
and rubbed his hands with a little before a successful trial of 
shooting at a mark. 

I explained to my men the nature of the gun, and tried to 
teach them, but they would soon have expended all the ammu- 
nition in my possession. I was thus obliged to do all the 
shooting myself ever afterwards. Their inability was rather a 
misfortune ; for, in consequence of working too soon after having 
been bitten by the lion, the bone of my left arm had not united 
well. Continual hard manual labour, and some falls from ox- 
back, lengthened the ligament by which the ends of the bones 
were united, and a false joint was the consequence. The limb 
has never been painful, as those of my companions on the day 
of the rencontre with the lion have been, but, there being a joint 
too many, I could not steady the rifle, and was always obliged to 
shoot with the piece resting on the left shoulder. I wanted 
steadiness of aim, and it generally happened that the more 
hungry the party became, the more frequently I missed the 
animals. 

We spent a Sunday on our way up to the confluence of the 
Leeba and Leeambye. Rains had fallen here before we came, 
and the woods had put on their gayest hue. Flowers of great 
beauty and curious forms grow everywhere ; they are unlike 
those in the south, and so are the trees. Many of the forest-tree 
leaves are palmated and largely developed; the trunks are 
covered with lichens, and the abundance of ferns which appear 
in the woods, shows we are now in a more humid climate than 
any to the south of the Barotse valley. The ground begins to 
swarm with insect life ; and in the cool, pleasant mornings the 



Chap. XIV. DEPRAVITY— ITS TREATMENT. 259 

welkin rings with the singing of birds, which is not so delightful 
as the notes of birds at home, because I have not been familiar 
with them from infancy. The notes here, however, strike the 
mind by their loudness and variety, as the wellings forth from 
joyous hearts, of praise to Him who fills them with overflowing 
gladness. All of us rise early to enjoy the luscious balmy air of 
the morning. We then have worship ; but amidst all the beauty 
and loveliness with which we are surrounded, there is still a 
feeling of want in the soul in viewing one's poor companions, 
and hearing bitter impure words jarring on the ear in the per- 
fection of the scenes of nature, and a longing that both their 
hearts and ours might be brought into harmony with the Great 
Father of Spirits. I pointed out, in, as usual, the simplest 
words I could employ, the remedy which God has presented to 
us, in the inexpressibly precious gift of His own Son, on whom 
the Lord " laid the iniquity of us all." The great difficulty in 
dealing with these people is to make the subject plain. The 
minds of the auditors cannot be understood by one who has not 
mingled much with them. They readily pray for the forgive- 
ness of sins, and then sin again ; confess the evil of it, and there 
the matter ends. 

I shall not often advert to their depravity. My practice has 
always been to apply the remedy with all possible earnestness, 
but never allow my own mind to dwell on the dark shades of 
men's characters. I have never been able to draw pictures of 
guilt, as if that could awaken Christian sympathy. The evil is 
there. But all around in this fair creation are scenes of beauty, 
and to turn from these to ponder on deeds of sin, cannot promote 
a healthy state of the faculties. I attribute much of the bodily 
health I enjoy to following the plan, adopted by most physicians, 
who, while engaged in active, laborious efforts to assist the 
needy, at the same time follow the delightful studies of some 
department of natural history. The human misery and sin 
we endeavour to alleviate and cure, may be likened to the sick- 
ness and impurity of some of the back slums of great cities. 
One, contents himself by ministering to the sick and trying 
to remove the causes, without remaining longer in the filth than 
is necessary for his work ; another, equally anxious for the 

s 2 



260 WILD FRUITS. Chap. XIV. 

public good, stirs up every cesspool, that lie may describe its 
reeking vapours, and, by long contact with impurities, becomes 
himself infected, sickens, and dies. 

The men went about during the day, and brought back wild 
fruits of several varieties, which I had not hitherto seen. One, 
called mogametsa, is a bean with a little pulp round it, which 
tastes like sponge-cake ; another, named mawa, grows abun- 
dantly on a low bush. There are many berries and edible bulbs 
almost everywhere. The mamosho or moshomosho, and milo 
(a medlar), were to be found near our encampment. These are 
both good, if indeed one can be a fair judge who felt quite dis- 
posed to pass a favourable verdict on every fruit which had the 
property of being eatable at all. Many kinds are better than 
our crab-apple or sloe ; and, had they half the care and culture 
these have enjoyed, might take high rank among the fruits of 
the world. All that the Africans have thought of has been pre- 
sent gratification ; and now, as I sometimes deposit date-seeds 
in the soil, and tell them I have no hope whatever of seeing the 
fruit, it seems to them, as the act of the South-Sea Islanders 
appears to us, when they planted in their gardens iron nails 
received from Captain Cook. 

There are many fruits and berries in the forests, the uses of 
which are unknown to my companions. Great numbers of a kind 
of palm I have never met with before, were seen growing at and 
below the confluence of the Loeti and Leeambye ; the seed pro- 
bably came down the former river. It is nearly as tall as the 
palmyra. The fruit is larger than of that species ; it is about 
four inches long, and has a soft yellow pulp round the kernel, or 
seed ; when ripe, it is fluid and stringy, like the wild mango, 
and not very pleasant to eat. 

Before we came to the junction of the Leeba and Leeambye, 
we found the banks twenty feet high, and composed of marly 
sandstone. They are covered with trees, and the left bank has 
the tsetse and elephants. I suspect the fly has some connection 
with this animal, and the Portuguese in the district of Tete must 
think so too, for they call it the Musca da elephant (the elephant 

fly). 

The water of inundation covers even these lofty banks, but 



Chap. XIV. PIGEONS— FISH. 261 

does not stand long upon them — hence the crop of trees. Where 
it remains for any length of time, trees cannot live. On the 
right bank, or that in which the Loeti flows, there is an exten- 
sive flat country called Manga, which, though covered with grass, 
is destitute in a great measure of trees. 

Flocks of green pigeons rose from the trees as we passed along 
the banks, and the notes of many birds told that we were now 
among strangers of the feathered tribe. The beautiful trogon, 
with bright scarlet breast and black back, uttered a most 
peculiar note, similar to that we read of as having once been 
emitted by Memnon, and likened to the tuning of a lyre. The 
boatmen answered it by calling " Nama, nama ! " — meat, meat 
— as if they thought that a repetition of the note would be a 
good omen for our success in hunting. Many more interesting 
birds were met ; but I could make no collection, as I was pro- 
ceeding on the plan of having as little luggage as possible, so as 
not to excite the cupidity of those through whose country we 
intended to pass. 

Vast shoals of fish come down the Leeambye with the rising 
waters, as we observed they also do in the Zouga. They are 
probably induced to make this migration, by the increased 
rapidity of the current dislodging them from their old pasture- 
grounds higher up the river. Insects constitute but a small 
portion of the food of many fish. Fine vegetable matter, like 
slender mosses, growing on the bottom, is devoured greedily ; 
and, as the fishes are dislodged from the main stream by the 
force of the current, and find abundant pasture on the flooded 
plains, the whole community becomes disturbed and wanders. 

The mosala (Clarias Capensis and Glanis siluris), the mullet 
(Mugil Africanus), and other fishes, spread over the Barotse 
valley in such numbers that, when the waters retire, all the 
people are employed in cutting them up and drying them in the 
sun. The supply exceeds the demand, and the land in numerous 
places is said to emit a most offensive smell. Wherever you see 
the Zambesi in the centre of the country, it is remarkable for 
the abundance of animal life in and upon its waters, and on the 
adjacent banks. 

We passed great numbers of hippopotami. They are very 



262 HIPPOPOTAMI. Chap. XIV. 

numerous in the parts of the river where they are never hunted. 
The males appear of a dark colour, the females of yellowish 
brown. There is not such a complete separation of the sexes 
among them as among elephants. They spend most of their 
time in the water, lolling about in a listless, dreamy manner. 
When they come out of the river by night, they crop off the soft 
succulent grasses very neatly. When they blow, they puff up 
the water about three feet high.

On the 27th December we were at the confluence of the Leeba 
and Leeambye (lat. 14° 10' 52" S., long. 23° 35' 40" E.). Ma- 
siko, the Barotse chief, for whom we had some captives, lived 
nearly due east of this point. They were two little boys, a little 
girl, a young man, and two middle-aged women. One of these 
was a member of a Babimpe tribe, who knock out both upper 
and lower front teeth as a distinction. As we had been informed 
by the captives on the previous Sunday, that Masiko was in the 
habit of seizing all orphans, and those who have no powerful 
friend in the tribe whose protection they can claim, and selling 
them for clothing to the Mambari, we thought the objection of 
the women to go first to his town before seeing their friends, 
quite reasonable, and resolved to send a party of our own peoj)le 
to see them safely among their relatives. I told the captive 
young man to inform Masiko that he was very unlike Ins father 
Santuru, who had refused to sell Ins people to Mambari. He 
will probably be afraid to deliver such a message himself, but it 
is meant for his people, and they will circulate it pretty widely, 
and Masiko may yet feel a little pressure from without. We 
sent Mosantu, a Batoka man, and his companions, with the 
captives. The Barotse whom we had, were unwilling to go to 
Masiko, since they owe him allegiance as the son of Santuru, 
and while they continue with the Makololo are considered rebels. 



26-± NAVIGATION OF THE LEEAMBYE. Chap. XV. 

The message by Mosantu was, that " I was sorry to find that 
Santuru had not borne a wiser son. Santura loved to govern 
men, but Masiko wanted to govern wild beasts only, as he sold 
Ins people to the Mambari ;" adding an explanation of the return 
of the captives, and an injunction to him to live in peace, and 
prevent Ins people kidnapping the children and canoes of the 
Makololo, as a continuance in these deeds would lead to war, 
which I wished to prevent. He was also instructed to say, if 
Masiko wanted fuller explanation of my views, he must send a 
sensible man to talk with me at the first town of the Balonda, 
to which I was about to proceed. 

We ferried Mosantu over to the left bank of the Leeba. The 
journey required five days, but it could not have been at a 
quicker rate than ten or twelve miles per day ; the children 
were between seven and eight years of age, and unable to walk 
fast in a hot sun. 

Leaving Mosantu to pursue his course, we shall take but one 
glance down the river, winch we are now about to leave, for it 
comes at this point from the eastward, and our course is to be 
directed to the north-west, as we mean to go to Loanda in 
Angola. From the confluence, where we now are, down to 
Mosioatunya, there are many long reaches, where a vessel equal 
to the Thames steamers plying between the bridges, could run 
as freely as they do on the Thames. It is often, even here, as 
broad as that river at London Bridge, but, without accurate 
measurement of the depth, one could not say which contained 
most water. There are, however, many and serious obstacles 
to a continued navigation for hundreds of miles at a stretch. 
About ten miles below the confluence of the Loeti, for instance, 
there are many large sandbanks in the stream ; then you have 
a hundred miles to the river Simah, where a Thames steamer 
could ply at all times of the year ; but, again, the space between 
Simah and Katima-molelo has five or six rapids with cataracts, 
one of which, Gonye, could not be passed at any time without 
portage. Between these rapids there are reaches of still, deep 
water, of several miles in length. Beyond Katima-molelo to 
the confluence of the Chobe, you have nearly a hundred miles 
again, of a river capable of being navigated in the same way as 
in the Barotse valley. 



Chap. XV. THE LEEBA. 265 

Now, I do not say that this part of the river presents a very- 
inviting prospect for extemporaneous European enterprise ; but 
when we have a pathway which requires only the formation of 
portages to make it equal to our canals for hundreds of miles, 
where the philosophers supposed there was nought but an exten- 
sive sandy desert, we must confess that the future partakes at 
least of the elements of hope. My deliberate conviction was 
and is, that the part of the country indicated, is as capable of 
supporting millions of inhabitants as it is of its thousands. The 
grass of the Barotse valley, for instance, is such a densely 
matted mass that, when "laid," the stalks bear each other up, so 
that one feels as if walking on the sheaves of a hay-stack, and 
the leches nestle under it to bring forth their young. The soil 
which produces this, if placed under the plough, instead of being 
mere pasturage, would yield grain sufficient to feed vast mul- 
titudes. 

We now began to ascend the Leeba. The water is black in 
colour as compared with the main stream, which here assumes 
the name of Kabompo. The Leeba flows placidly, and, unlike the 
parent river, receives numbers of little rivulets from both sides. 
It winds slowly through the most charming meadows, each of 
which has either a soft sedgy centre, large pond, or trickling rill, 
down the middle. The trees are now covered with a profusion of 
the freshest foliage, and seem planted in groups of such pleasant, 
graceful outline, that art could give no additional charm. The 
grass, which had been burned off and was growing again after 
the rains, was short and green ; and all the scenery so like that 
of a carefully-tended gentleman's park, that one is scarcely re- 
minded that the surrounding region is in the hands of simple 
nature alone. I suspect that the level meadows are inundated 
annually, for the spots on which the trees stand are elevated 
three or four feet above them, and these elevations, being of dif- 
ferent shapes, give the strange variety of outline of the park-like 
woods. Numbers of a fresh-water shell are scattered all over 
these valleys. The elevations, as I have observed elsewhere, are 
of a soft sandy soil, and the meadows of black rich alluvial loam. 
There are many beautiful flowers, and many bees to sip their 
nectar. We found plenty of honey in the woods, and saw the

stages on which the Balonda dry their meat, when they come 
down to hunt and gather the produce of the wild hives. In one 
part we came upon groups of lofty trees as straight as masts, 
with festoons of orchilla-weed hanging from the branches. This, 
which is used as a dye-stuff, is found nowhere in the dry country 
to the south. It prefers the humid climate near the west coast. 

A large buffalo was wounded, and ran into the thickest part 
of the forest, bleeding profusely. The young men went on his 
trail ; and, though the vegetation was so dense that no one could 
Lave run more than a few yards, most of them went along quite 
carelessly, picking and eating a fruit of the melon family, called 
Mponko. When the animal heard them approach he always 
fled, shifting his stand and doubling on Ins course in the most 
cunning manner. In other cases I have known them turn back 
to a point a few yards from their own trail, and then lie down in 
a hollow, waiting for the hunter to come up. Though a heavy, 
lumbering-looking animal, his charge- is then rapid and terrific. 
More accidents happen by the buffalo, and the black rhinoceros, 
than by the lion. Though all are aware of the mischievous 
nature of the buffalo when wounded, our young men went after 
Mm quite carelessly. They never lose their presence of mind, 
but, as a buffalo charges back in a forest, dart dexterously out 
of Ins way behind a tree, and, wheeling round it, stab him as he 
passes. 

A tree in flower brought the pleasant fragrance of hawthorn- 
hedges back to memory ; its leaves, flowers, perfume, and fruit, 
resembled those of the hawthorn, only the flowers were as large 
as dog-roses, and the " haws " like boys' marbles. Here the 
flowers smell sweetly, while few in the south emit any scent at 
all, or only a nauseous odour. A botanist would find a rich 
harvest on the banks of the Leeba. Tins would be his best 
season, for the flowers all run rapidly to seed, and then insects 
of every shape spring into existence to devour them. The 
climbing plants display great vigour of growth, being not only 
thick in the trunk, but also at the very point, in the manner of 
quickly-growing asparagus. The maroro or malolo now appears, 
and is abundant in many parts between tins and Angola. It 
is a small bush with a yellow fruit, and in its appearance a dwarf

" anmiar The taste is sweet, and the fruit is wholesome : it is 
full of seeds, like the custard-apple. 

On the 28th we slept at a spot on the right bank, from which 
had just emerged two broods of alligators. We had seen many 
young ones as we came up, so this seems to be their time of 
coming forth from the nests, for we saw them sunning them- 
selves on sandbanks in company with the old ones. We made 
our fire in one of the deserted nests, which were strewed all over 
with the broken shells. At the Zouga we saw sixty eggs taken 
out of one such nest alone. They are about the size of those of 
a goose, only the eggs of the alligator are of the same diameter 
at both ends ; and the white shell is partially elastic, from having 
a strong internal membrane and but little lime in its composi- 
tion. The distance from the water was about ten feet, and there 
were evidences of the same place having been used for a similar 
purpose in former years. A broad path led up from the water 
to the nest, and the dam, it was said by my companions, after 
depositing the eggs, covers them up, and returns afterwards to 
assist the young out of the place of confinement and out of the 
egg. She leads them to the edge of the water, and then leaves 
them to catch small fish for themselves. Assistance to come 
forth seems necessary, for here, besides the tough membrane of 
the shell, they had four inches of earth upon them ; but they do 
not require immediate aid for food, because they all retain a 
portion of yolk, equal to that of a hen's egg, in a membrane in 
the abdomen, as a stock of nutriment, while only beginning inde- 
pendent existence by catching fish. Fish is the principal food 
of both small and large, and they are much assisted in catching 
them by their broad scaly tails. Sometimes an alligator, viewing 
a man in the water from the opposite bank, rushes across the 
stream with wonderful agility, as is seen by the high ripple he 
makes on the surface caused by his rapid motion at the bottom ; 
but in general they act by stealth, sinking underneath as soon 
as they see man. They seldom leave the water to catch prey, 
but often come out by day to enjoy the pleasure of basking in 
the sun. In walking along the bank of the Zouga once, a small 
one, about three feet long, made a dash at my feet, and caused 
me to rush quickly in another direction ; but this is unusual, for 
I never^heard of a similar case. A wounded leche, chased into 



268 ALLIGATORS. Chap. XV. 

any of the lagoons in the Barotse valley, or a man or dog going 
in for the purpose of bringing out a dead one, is almost sure to 
be seized, though the alligators may not appear on the surface. 
When employed in looking for food they keep out of sight ; they 
fish chiefly by night. When eating, they make a loud champing 
noise, winch when once heard is never forgotten. 

The young, which had come out of the nests where we spent 
the night, did not appear wary ; they were about ten inches 
long, with yellow eyes, and pupil merely a perpendicular slit. 
They were all marked with transverse stripes of pale green and 
brown, half an inch broad. When speared, they bit the weapon 
savagely, though their teeth were but partially developed, 
uttering at the same time a sharp bark, like that of a whelp 
when it first begins to use its voice. I could not ascertain 
whether the dam devours them, as reported, or whether the 
ichneumon has the same reputation here as in Egypt. Probably 
the Barotse and Bayeiye would not look upon it as a bene- 
factor ; they prefer to eat the eggs themselves, and be their own 
ichneumons. The white of the egg does not coagulate, but the 
yolk does, and this is the only part eaten. 

As the population increases the alligators will decrease, for 
their nests will be oftener found ; the principal check on their 
inordinate multiplication seems to be man. They are more 
savage and commit more mischief in the Leeambye, than in any 
other river. After dancing long in the moonlight nights, young 
men run down to the water to wash off the dust, and cool them- 
selves before going to bed, and are thus often carried away. 
One wonders they are not afraid ; but the fact is, they have as 
little sense of danger impending over them as the hare has when 
not actually pursued by the hound ; and in many rencontres, in 
which they escape, they had not time to be afraid, and only 
laugh at the circumstance afterwards : there is a want of calm 
reflection. In many cases, not referred to in tins book, I feel 
more horror now in thinking on dangers I have run, than I did 
at the time of their occurrence. 

When we reached the part of the river opposite to the village 
of Manenko, the first female chief whom we encountered, two of 
the people called Balunda, or Balonda, came to us in their little 
canoe. From them we learned that Kolimbota, one of our party, 



Chap. XV. SEKELENKE'S PRESENT. 269 

who had been in the habit of visiting these parts, was believed 
by the Balonda to have acted as a guide to the marauders under 
Lerimo, whose captives we were now returning. They very 
naturally suspected this, from the facility with which their vil- 
lages had been found, and, as they had since removed them to 
some distance from the river, they were unwilling to lead us to 
their places of concealment. We were in bad repute, but, having 
a captive boy and girl to show in evidence of Sekeletu and our- 
selves not being partakers in the guilt of inferior men, I could 
freely express my desire that all should live in peace. They 
evidently felt that I ought to have taught the Makololo first, 
before coming to them, for they remarked that what I advanced 
was very good, but guilt lay at the door of the Makololo for 
disturbing the previously existing peace. They then went away 
to report us to Manenko. 

When the strangers visited us again in the evening, they 
were accompanied by a number of the people of an Ambonda 
chief named Sekelenke. The Ambonda live far to the N.W. ; 
their language, the Bonda, is the common dialect in Angola. 
Sekelenke had fled, and was now living with his village as a 
vassal of Masiko. As notices of such men will perhaps convey 
the best idea of the state of the inhabitants to the reader, I 
shall hereafter allude to the conduct of Sekelenke, whom I at 
present only introduce. Sekelenke had gone with his villagers 
to hunt elephants on the right bank of the Leeba, and was now 
on his way back to Masiko. He sent me a dish of boiled zebra's 
flesh, and a request that I should lend him a canoe to ferry his 
wives and family across the river to the bank on which we were 
encamped. Many of Sekelenke' s people came to salute the first 
white man they ever had an opportunity of seeing ; but Seke- 
lenke himself did not come near. We heard he was offended 
with some of his people for letting me know he was among the 
company. He said that I should be displeased with him for not 
coming and making some present. This was the only instance 
in which I was shunned in this quarter. 

As it would have been impolitic to pass Manenko, or any 
chief, without at least showing so much respect as to call and 
explain the objects of our passing through the country, we 
waited two entire days for the return of the messengers to 



270 HUNTERS. Chap. XV. 

Manenko ; and as I could not hurry matters, I went into the 
adjacent country to search for meat for the camp. 

The country is furnished largely with forest, having occa- 
sionally open lawns covered with grass, not in tufts as in the 
south, but so closely planted that one cannot see the soil. We 
came upon a man and his two wives and children, burning coarse 
rushes and the stalks of tsitla, growing in a brackish marsh, in 
order to extract a kind of salt from the ashes. They make a 
funnel of branches of trees, and line it with grass rope, twisted 
round until it is, as it were, a beehive-roof inverted. The ashes 
are put into water, in a calabash, and then it is allowed to per- 
colate through the small hole in the bottom and through the 
grass. When this water is evaporated in the sun, it yields 
sufficient salt to form a relish with food. The women and 
children fled with precipitation, but we sat down at a distance, 
and allowed the man time to gain courage enough to speak. He, 
however, trembled excessively at the apparition before him ; 
but when we explained that our object was to hunt game, and 
not men, he became calm, and called back his wives. We soon 
afterwards came to another party on the same errand with our- 
selves. The man had a bow about six feet long, and iron- 
headed arrows about thirty inches in length; he had also 
wooden arrows neatly barbed, to shoot in cases where he might 
not be quite certain of recovering them again. We soon after- 
wards got a zebra, and gave our hunting acquaintances such a 
liberal share that we soon became friends. All whom we saw 
that day then came with us to the encampment to beg a little 
meat ; and as they have so little salt, I have no doubt they felt 
grateful for what we gave. 

Sekelenke and his people, twenty-four in number, defiled past 
our camp carrying large bundles of dried elephants' meat. Most 
of them came to say good-bye, and Sekelenke himself sent to say 
that he had gone to visit a wife living in the village of Manenko. 
It was a mere African manoeuvre to gain information, and not 
commit himself to either one line of action or another, with re- 
spect to our visit. As he was probably in the party before us, I 
replied that it was all right, and when my peojue came up from 
Masiko, I would go to my wife too. Another zebra came to our 
camp, and as we had friends near, it was shot. It was the Equus 



Chap. XV. MAMBAEI TRADERS. 271 

montanits, though the country is perfectly flat, and was finely 
marked down to the feet, as all the zebras are in these parts. 

To our first message, offering a visit of explanation to Ma- 
nenko, we got an answer, with a basket of manioc-roots, that we 
must remain where we were till she should visit me. Having 
waited two days already for her, other messengers arrived with 
orders for me to come to her. After four days of rains and 
negotiation, I declined going at all, and proceeded up the river 
to the small stream Makonclo (lat. 13° 23' 12" S.), which enters 
the Leeba from the east, and is between twenty and thirty yards 
broad. 

January 1st, 1854. — We had heavy rains almost every day ; 
indeed the rainy season had fairly set in. Baskets of the purple 
fruit called mawa were frequently brought to us by the villagers ; 
not for sale, but from a belief that their chiefs would be pleased 
to hear that they had treated us well ; we gave them pieces of 
meat in return. 

When crossing at the confluence of the Leeba and Makondo, 
one of my men picked up a bit of a steel watch-chain of English 
manufacture, and we were informed that tins was the spot where 
the Mambari cross in coming to Masiko. Their visits explain 
why Sekelenke kept his tusks so carefully. These Mambari are 
very enterprising merchants : when they mean to trade with a 
town, they deliberately begin the affair by building huts, as if 
they knew that little business could be transacted without a 
liberal allowance of time for palaver. They bring Manchester 
goods into the heart of Africa ; these cotton prints look so won- 
derful that the Makololo could not believe them to be the work 
of mortal hands. On questioning the Mambari they were an- 
swered that English manufactures came out of the sea, and beads 
were gathered on its shore. To Africans our cotton-mills are 
fairy dreams. " How can the irons spin, weave, and print so 
beautifully ? " Our country is like what Taprobane was to our 
ancestors : a strange realm of light, whence came the diamond, 
muslin, and peacocks ; an attempt at explanation of our manu- 
factures, usually elicits the expression, " Truly ! ye are gods ! " 

When about to leave the Makondo, one of my men had dreamed 
that Mosantu was shut up a prisoner in a stockade ; this dream 
depressed the spirits of the whole party, and when I came out of 



272 SHEAKONDO AND HIS PEOPLE. Chap. XV. 

my little tent in the morning, they were sitting the pictures of 
abject sorrow. I asked if we were to be guided by dreams, or by 
the authority I derived from Sekeletu, and ordered them to load 
the boats at once ; they seemed ashamed to confess their fears ; 
the Makololo picked up courage and upbraided the others for 
having such superstitious views, and said this was always their 
way ; if even a certain bird called to them, they would turn back 
from an enterprise, saying it was unlucky. They entered the 
canoes at last, and were the better of a little scolding for being 
inclined to put dreams before authority. It rained all the morn- 
ing, but about eleven we reached the village of Sheakondo, on a 
small stream named Lonkonye. We sent a message to the 
head-man, who soon appeared with two wives, bearing handsome 
presents of manioc : Sheakondo could speak the language of the 
Barotse well, and seemed awe-struck when told some of the 
" words of God." He manifested no fear, always spoke frankly, 
and when he made an asseveration, did so by simply pointing up 
to the sky above him. The Balonda cultivate the manioc, or 
cassava, extensively ; also dura, ground-nuts, beans, maize, sweet 
potatoes, and yams, here called " lekoto," but as yet we see only 
the outlying villages. 

The people who came with Sheakondo to our bivouac, had 
their teeth filed to a point by way of beautifying them, though 
those which were left untouched were always the whitest ; they 
are generally tattooed in various parts, but chiefly on the ab- 
domen : the skin is raised in small elevated cicatrices, each 
nearly half an inch long and a quarter of an inch in diameter, so 
that a number of them may constitute a star, or other device. 
The dark colour of the skin prevents any colouring matter being 
deposited in these figures, but they love much to have the whole 
surface of their bodies anointed with a comfortable varnish of 
oil. In their unassisted state they depend on supplies of oil 
from the Palma-Christi, or castor-oil-plant, or from various other 
oliferous seeds, but they are all excessively fond of clarified butter 
or ox fat. Sheakondo's old wife presented some manioc-roots, 
and then politely requested to be anointed with butter : as I had 
been bountifully supplied by the Makololo, I gave her as much as 
would suffice, and as they have little clothing, I can readily 
believe that she felt her comfort greatly enhanced thereby. 



Chap. XV. INTEKVIEW WITH FEMALE CHIEF. 273 

The favourite wife, who was also present, was equally anxious 
for butter. She had a profusion of iron rings on her ankles, to 
which were attached little pieces of sheet-iron, to enable her to 
make a tinkling as she walked in her mincing African style ; the 
same thing is thought pretty by our own dragoons in walking 
jauntingly. 

We had so much rain and cloud, that I could not get a single 
observation for either longitude or latitude for a fortnight. Yet 
the Leeba does not show any great rise, nor is the water in the 
least discoloured. It is slightly black, from the number of mossy 
rills which fall into it. It has remarkably few birds and fish, 
while the Leeambye swarms with both. It is noticeable that 
alligators here, possess more of the fear of man than in the 
Leeambye. The Balonda have taught them, by their poisoned 
arrows, to keep out of sight. We did not see one basking in the 
sun. The Balonda set so many little traps for birds, that few 
appear. I observed, however, many (to me) new small birds of 
song on its banks. More rain has been falling in the east than 
here, for the Leeambye was rising fast and working against 
the sandy banks so vigorously, that a slight yellow tinge was 
perceptible in it. 

One of our men was bitten by a non-venomous serpent, and 
of course felt no harm. The Barotse concluded, that this was 
owing to many of them being present and seeing it, as if the 
sight of human eyes could dissolve the poison, and act as a 
charm. 

On the 6th of January, we reached the village of another 
female chief, named Nyamoana, who is said to be the mother of 
Manenko, and sister of Shinte or Kabompo, the greatest Balonda 
chief in this part of the country. Her people had but recently 
come to the present locality, and had erected only twenty huts. 
Her husband, Samoana, was clothed in a kilt of green and red 
baize, and was armed with a spear, and a broad-sword of antique 
form, about eighteen inches long and three broad. The chief 
and her husband, were sitting on skins, placed in the middle of a 
circle, thirty paces in diameter, a little raised above the ordinary 
level of the ground, and having a trench round it. Outside the 
trench sat about a hundred persons of all ages and both sexes : 
the men were well armed with bows, arrows, spears, and broad- 

T 



274 COURT ETIQUETTE. Chap. XV. 

swords. Beside the husband sat a rather aged woman, having a 
bad outward squint in the left eye. We put down our arms 
about forty yards off, and I walked up to the centre of the 
circular bench, and saluted him in the usual way, by clapping 
the hands together in their fashion. He pointed to his wife, as 
much as to say, the honour belongs to her. I saluted her in the 
same way, and, a mat having been brought, I squatted down in 
front of them. 

The talker was then called, and I was asked who was my 
spokesman. Having pointed to Kolimbota, who knew their 
dialect best, the palaver began in due form. I explained the 
real objects I had in view, without any attempt to mystify or 
appear in any other character than my own, for I have always 
been satisfied that, even though there were no other consi- 
derations, the truthful way of dealing with the uncivilised is 
unquestionably the best. Kolimbota repeated to Nyamoana's 
talker what I had said to him. He delivered it all verbatim to 
her husband, who repeated it again to her. It was thus all 
rehearsed four times over, in a tone loud enough to be heard by 
the whole party of auditors. The response came back by the 
same roundabout route, beginning at the lady to her hus- 
band, &c. 

After explanations and re-explanations, I perceived that our 
new friends were mixing up my message of peace and friendship 
with Makololo affairs, and stated, that it was not delivered on the 
authority of any one less than that of their Creator, and that, if 
the Makololo did again break His laws and attack the Balonda, 
the guilt would rest with the Makololo and not with me. The 
palaver then came to a close. 

By way of gaining their confidence, I showed them my hair, 
which is considered a curiosity in all this region. They said, 
" Is that hair ? It is the mane of a lion, and not hair at all." 
Some thought that I had made a wig of lion's mane, as they 
sometimes do with the fibres of the " ife," and dye it black, and 
twist it, so as to resemble a mass of their own wool. I could not 
return the joke, by telling them that theirs was not hair but 
the wool of sheep, for they have none of these in the country ; 
and even though they had, as Herodotus remarked, " the African 
sheep are clothed with hair, and men's heads with wool." So I 



Chap. XV. INCREASE OF SUPERSTITION. 275 

had to be content with asserting, that mine was the real original 
hair, such as theirs would have been, had it not been scorched 
and frizzled by the sun. In proof of what the sun could do, I 
compared my own bronzed face and hands, then about the same 
in complexion as the lighter-coloured Makololo, with the white 
skin of my chest. They readily believed that, as they go nearly 
naked and fully exposed to that influence, we might be of common 
origin after all. Here, as everywhere when heat and moisture 
are combined, the people are very dark, but not quite black. 
There is always a shade of brown in the most deeply coloured. 
I showed my watch and pocket compass, which are considered 
great curiosities ; but, though the lady was called on by her 
husband to look, she would not be persuaded to approach near 
enough. 

These people are more superstitious than any we had yet 
encountered ; though still only building their village, they had 
found time to erect two little sheds at the chief dwelling in it, in 
which were placed two pots having charms in them. When 
asked what medicine they contained, they replied, " Medicine 
for the Barimo ;" but when I rose and looked into them, they 
said they were medicine for the game. Here we saw the first 
evidence of the existence of idolatry, in the remains of an old 
idol at a deserted village. It was simply a human head carved 
on a block of wood. Certain charms mixed with red ochre and 
white pipe-clay are dotted over them, when they are in use ; and 
a crooked stick is used in the same way for an idol, when they 
have no professional carver. 

As the Leeba seemed still to come from the direction in which 
we wished to go, I was desirous of proceeding farther up with 
the canoes ; but Nyamoana was anxious that we should allow 
her people to conduct us to her brother Shinte ; and when I 
explained the advantage of water-carriage, she represented that 
her brother did not live near the river, and, moreover, there was 
a cataract in front, over which it would be difficult to convey the 
canoes. She was afraid, too, that the Balobale, whose country 
lies to the west of the river, not knowing the objects for which 
we had come, would kill us. To my reply, that I had been so 
often threatened with death if I visited a new tribe, that I was 
now more afraid of killing any one than of being killed, she 

T 2 



276 MODE OF SALUTATION. Chap. XV. 

rejoined, that the Balobale would not kill me, but the Makololo 
would all be sacrificed as their enemies. This produced con- 
siderable effect on my companions, and inclined them to the 
plan of Nyamoana, of going to the town of her brother, rather 
than ascending the Leeba. The arrival of Manenko herself on 
the scene, threw so much weight into the scale on their side, that 
I was forced to yield the point. 

Manenko was a tall strapping woman about twenty, distin- 
guished by a profusion of ornaments and medicines hung round 
her person ; the latter are supposed to act as charms. Her body 
was smeared all over with a mixture of fat and red ochre, as a 
protection against the weather ; a necessary precaution, for, like 
most of the Balonda ladies, she was otherwise in a state of 
frightful nudity. Tins was not from want of clothing, for, being 
a chief, she might have been as well clad as any of her subjects, 
but from her peculiar ideas of elegance in dress. When she 
arrived with her husband, Sambanza, they listened for some time 
to the statements I was making to the people of Nyamoana, 
after which the husband, acting as spokesman, commenced an 
oration, stating the reasons for their coming, and, during every 
two or three seconds of the delivery, he picked up a little sand, 
and rubbed it on the upper part of his arms and chest. This is 
a common mode of salutation in Londa ; and when they wish 
to be excessively polite, they bring a quantity of ashes or pipe- 
clay in a piece of skin, and, taking up handfuls, rub it on the 
chest and upper front part of each arm ; others, in saluting, drum 
their ribs with their elbows ; while others still, touch the ground 
with one cheek after the other, and clap their hands. The chiefs 
go through the manoeuvre of rubbing the sand on the arms, but 
only make a feint at picking up some. When Sambanza had 
finished liis oration, he rose up, and showed his ankles orna- 
mented, with a bundle of copper rings ; had they been very 
heavy, they would have made him adopt a straggling walk. 
Some chiefs have really so many, as to be forced, by the weight 
and size, to keep one foot apart from the other ; the weight 
being a serious inconvenience in walking. The gentlemen like 
Sambanza, who wish to imitate their betters, do so in their 
walk ; so you see men, with only a few ounces of ornament on 
their legs, strutting along as if they had double the number of 



Chap. XV. EMBASSY AND PRESENT FROM MASIKO. 277 

pounds. When I smiled at Sambanza's walk, the people re- 
marked, " That is the way in which they show off their lordship 
in these parts." 

Manenko was quite decided in the adoption of the policy of 
friendship with the Makololo which we recommended ; and, by 
way of cementing the bond, she and her counsellors proposed 
that Kolimbota should take a wife among them. By this expe- 
dient she hoped to secure his friendship, and also accurate in- 
formation as to the future intentions of the Makololo. She 
thought that he would visit the Balonda more frequently after- 
wards, having the good excuse of going to see his wife ; and the 
Makololo would never, of course, kill the villagers among whom 
so near a relative of one of their own children dwells. Kolim- 
bota, I found, thought favourably of the proposition, and it after- 
wards led to his desertion from us. 

On the evening of the day in which Manenko arrived, we were 
delighted by the appearance of Mosantu and an imposing em- 
bassy from Masiko. It consisted of all his underchiefs, and they 
brought a fine elephant's tusk, two calabashes of honey, and a 
large piece of blue baize, as a present. The last was intended 
perhaps to show me that he was a truly great chief, who had 
such stores of white men's goods at hand that he could afford 
to give presents of them ; it might also be intended for Mosantu, 
for chiefs usually remember the servants ; I gave it to hini. 
Masiko expressed delight, by his principal men, at the return of 
the captives, and at the proposal of peace and alliance with the 
Makololo. He stated that he never sold any of his own people 
to the Mambari, but only captives whom his people kidnapped 
from small neighbouring tribes. When the question was put, 
whether his people had been in the habit of molesting the Mako- 
lolo by kidnapping their servants and stealing canoes, it was 
admitted that two of his men, when hunting, had gone to the 
Makololo gardens, to see if any of their relatives were there. 
As the great object in all native disputes is to get both parties 
to turn over a new leaf, I explained the desirableness of forget- 
ting past feuds, accepting the present Makololo professions 
as genuine, and avoiding in future to give them any cause for 
marauding. I presented Masiko with an ox, furnished by Seke- 
letu as provision for ourselves. All these people are excessively 



278 MANENKO A SCOLD. Chap. XV. 

fond of beef and butter, from having been accustomed to them 
in their youth, before the Makololo deprived them of cattle. 
They have abundance of game, but I am quite of their opinion, 
that, after all, there is nought in the world equal to roast beef; 
and that in their love for it the English show both good taste 
and sound sense. The ox was intended for Masiko, but Ins men 
were very anxious to get my sanction for slaughtering it on the 
spot. I replied, that when it went out of my hands I had no 
more to do with it. They, however, wished the responsibility of 
slaughtering it to rest with me ; if I had said they might kill it, 
not many ounces would have remained in the morning. I would 
have given permission, but had nothing else to offer in return 
for Masiko' s generosity. 

We were now without any provisions except a small dole of 
manioc-roots each evening from Nyamoana, which, when eaten 
raw, produce poisonous effects. A small loaf, made from nearly 
the last morsel of maize-meal from Libonta, was my stock, and 
our friends from Masiko were still more destitute ; yet we all 
rejoiced so much at their arrival, that we resolved to spend a 
day with them. The Barotse of our party, meeting with relatives 
and friends among the Barotse of Masiko, had many old tales to 
tell ; and, after pleasant hungry converse by day, we regaled 
our friends with the magic lantern by night, and, in order to 
make the thing of use to all, we removed our camp up to the 
village of Nyamoana. This is a good means of arresting the 
attention, and conveying important facts to the minds of these 
people. 

When erecting our sheds at the village, Manenko fell upon 
our friends from Masiko in a way that left no doubt on our 
minds but that she is a most accomplished scold. Masiko had, 
on a former occasion, sent to Samoana for a cloth, a common 
way of keeping up intercourse, and, after receiving it, sent it 
back, because it had the appearance of having had " witchcraft 
medicine " on it ; this was a grave offence, and now Manenko 
had a good excuse for venting her spleen, the ambassadors 
having called at her village, and slept in one of the huts without 
leave. If her family was to be suspected of dealing in evil 
charms, why were Masiko s people not to be thought guilty of 
leaving the same in her hut? She advanced and receded in 



Chap. XV. DETAINED BY MANENKO. 279 

true oratorical style, belabouring her own servants as well for 
allowing the offence, and, as usual in more civilized feminine 
lectures, she leaned over the objects of her ire, and screamed 
forth all their faults and failings ever since they were born, and 
her despair of ever seeing them become better, until they were 
all " killed by alligators." Masiko's people followed the plan of 
receiving this torrent of abuse in silence, and, as neither we nor 
they had anything to eat, we parted next morning. In reference 
to Masiko selling slaves to the Mambari, they promised to ex- 
plain the relationship which exists between even the most abject 
of his people and our common Father ; and that no more kid- 
napping ought to be allowed, as he ought to give that peace and 
security to the smaller tribes on Ins eastern borders, which he so 
much desired to obtain himself from the Makololo ; we promised 
to return through his town when we came back from the sea- 
coast. 

Manenko gave us some manioc-roots in the morning, and had 
determined to carry our baggage to her uncle's, Kabompo or 
Shinte. We had heard a sample of what she could do with her 
tongue ; and as neither my men nor myself had much inclination 
to encounter a scolding from this black Mrs. Caudle, we made 
ready the packages ; but she came and said the men whom she 
had ordered for the service had not yet come; they would 
arrive to-morrow. Being on low and disagreeable diet, I felt 
annoyed at this further delay, and ordered the packages to be 
put into the canoes to proceed up the river without her servants ; 
but Manenko was not to be circumvented in this way ; she came 
forward with her people, and said her uncle would be angry if 
she did not carry forward the tusks and goods of Sekeletu, seized 
the luggage, and declared that she would carry it in spite of 
me. My men succumbed sooner to this petticoat government 
than I felt inclined to do, and left me no power ; and, being 
unwilling to encounter her tongue, I was moving off to the 
canoes, when she gave me a kind explanation, and, with her 
hand on my shoulder, put on a motherly look, saying, " Now, 
my little man, just do as the rest have done." My feelings of 
annoyance of course vanished, and I went out to try and get 
some meat. 

The only game to be found in these parts are, the zebra, the 



280 UNSUCCESSFUL ZEBKA-HUNT. Chap. XV. 

kualata or tahetsi (Aigoceros equina), kama (Bubalus caama), 
buffaloes, and the small antelope hakitenwe (Philantomba). 

The animals can be seen here only by following on their trail 
for many miles. Urged on by hunger, we followed that of some 
zebras during the greater part of the day : when within fifty yards 
of them, in a dense thicket, I made sure of one, but, to my in- 
finite disgust, the gun missed fire, and off they bounded. The 
climate is so very damp, from daily heavy rains, that everything 
becomes loaded with moisture, and the powder in the gun- 
nipples cannot be kept dry. It is curious to mark the intelli- 
gence of the game ; in districts where they are much annoyed 
by fire-arms, they keep out on the most open spots of country 
they can find, in order to have a widely-extended range of vision, 
and a man armed is carefully shunned. From the frequency 
with which I have been allowed to approach nearer without than 
with a gun, I believe they know the difference between safety and 
danger in the two cases. But here, where they are killed by the 
arrows of the Balonda, they select for safety the densest forest, 
where the arrow cannot be easily shot. The variation in the 
selection of standing spots during the day may, however, be 
owing partly to the greater heat of the sun, for here it is parti- 
cularly sharp and penetrating. However accounted for, the wild 
animals here do select the forests by day, while those farther 
south generally shun these covers, and, on several occasions, I 
have observed there was no sunshine to cause them to seek for 
shade.

11th January, 1854. — On starting this morning, Samoana (or 
rather Nyanioana, for the ladies are the chiefs here) presented a 
string of beads, and a shell highly valued among them, as an 
atonement for having assisted Manenko, as they thought, to vex 
me the day before. They seemed anxious to avert any evil 
which might arise from my displeasure ; but having replied that 
I never kept up my anger all night, they were much pleased to 
see me satisfied. We had to cross, in a canoe, a stream which 
flows past the village of Nyamoana. Manenko's doctor waved 
some charms over her, and she took some in her hand and on 
her body before she ventured upon the water. One of my men 
spoke rather loudly when near the doctor's basket of medicines. 
The doctor reproved hini, and always spoke in a whisper himself, 
glancing back to the basket as if afraid of being heard by some- 
thing therein. So much superstition is quite unknown in the 
south, and is mentioned here to show the difference in the feel- 
ings of this new people, and the comparative want of reverence 
on these points among Caffres and Bechuanas. 

Manenko was accompanied by her husband and her drum- 
mer; the latter continued to thump most vigorously, until a 
heavy drizzling mist set in and compelled him to desist. Her

husband used various incantations and vociferations to drive 
away the rain, but down it poured incessantly, and on our Amazon 
went, in the very lightest marching order, and at a pace that few of 
the men could keep up with. Being on ox-back, I kept pretty 
close to our leader, and asked her why she did not clothe herself 
during the rain, and learned that it is not considered proper for 
a chief to appear effeminate. He or she must always wear the 
appearance of robust youth, and bear vicissitudes without wine" 
ing. My men, in admiration of her pedestrian powers, every 
now and then remarked, " Manenko is a soldier ;" and thoroughly 
wet and cold, we were all glad when she proposed a halt to pre- 
pare our night's lodging on the banks of a stream. 

The country through winch we were passing was the same 
succession of forest and open lawns as formerly mentioned — 
the trees were nearly all evergreens, and of good, though not very 
gigantic, size. The lawns were covered with grass, which in 
thickness of crop looked like ordinary English hay. We passed 
two small hamlets surrounded by gardens of maize and manioc, 
and near each of these I observed, for the first time, an ugly idol 
common in Londa — the figure of an animal, resembling an alli- 
gator, made of clay. It is formed of grass, plastered over with 
soft clay ; two cowrie-shells are inserted as eyes, and numbers of 
the bristles from the tail of an elephant are stuck in about the 
neck. It is called a lion, though, if one were not told so, he 
would conclude it to be an alligator. It stood in a shed, and the 
Balonda pray and beat drums before it all night in cases of sick- 
ness. 

Some of the men of Manenko's train had shields made of 
reeds, neatly woven into a square shape, about five feet long and 
three broad. With these, and short broadswords and sheaves of 
iron-headed arrows, they appeared rather ferocious. But the 
constant habit of wearing arms is probably only a substitute for 
the courage they do not possess. We always deposited our fire- 
arms and spears outside a village before entering it, while the 
Balonda, on visiting us at our encampment, always came fully 
armed, until we ordered them either to lay down their weapons 
or be off. Next day we passed through a piece of forest so 
dense that no one could have penetrated it without an axe. It 
was flooded, not by the river, but by the heavy rains which 



Chap. XVI. HUNGER— PALISADES. 



283 



poured down every day, and kept those who had clothing con- 
stantly wet. I observed, in tins piece of forest, a very strong 
smell of sulphuretted hydrogen. This I had observed repeatedly 
in other parts before. I had attacks of fever of the intermittent 
type again and again, in consequence of repeated drenchings in 
these unhealthy spots. 

On the 11th and 12th we were detained by incessant rains, 
and so heavy I never saw the like in the south. I had a little 
tapioca and a small quantity of Libonta meal, which I still 
reserved for worse times. The patience of my men under hunger 
was admirable ; the actual want of the present is never so painful 
as the thought of getting nothing in the future. We thought 
the people of some large hamlets near us very niggardly and 
very independent of then chiefs, for they gave us and Manenko 
nothing, though they had large fields of maize in an eatable 
state around them. When she went and kindly begged some 
for me, they gave her five ears only. They were subjects of her 
uncle ; and, had they been Makololo, would have been lavish in 
then gifts to the niece of their chief. I suspected that they 
were dependants of some of Shinte's principal men, and had no 
power to part with the maize of their masters. 

Each house of these hamlets has a palisade of thick stakes 
around it, and the door is made to resemble the rest of the 
stockade ; the door is never seen open ; when the owner wishes 
to enter, he removes a stake or two, squeezes his body in, then 
plants them again in their places, so that an enemy coming in 
the night would find it difficult to discover the entrance. These 
palisades seem to indicate a sense of insecurity in regard to their 
fellow-men, for there are no wild beasts to disturb them ; the 
bows and arrows have been nearly as efficacious in clearing the 
country here, as guns have in the country further south. This 
was a disappointment to us, for we expected a continuance of 
the abundance of game in the north, which we found when we 
first came up to the confluence of the Leeba and Leeambye. 

A species of the silver-tree of the Cape (Leucodendron argen- 
teum) is found in abundance in the parts through which we have 
travelled since leaving Samoana's. As it grows at a height of 
between two and three thousand feet above the level of the 
sea, on the Cape Table Mountain, and again on the northern 



284 DENSE FOEESTS. Chap. XVI. 

slope of the Cashan Mountains, and here at considerably greater 
heights (four thousand feet), the difference of climate prevents 
the botanical range being considered as affording a good approxi- 
mation to the altitude. The rapid flow of the Leeambye, which 
once seemed to me evidence of much elevation of the country 
from winch it comes, I now found, by the boiling point of water, 
was fallacious.* 

The forests became more dense as we went north. We tra- 
velled much more in the deep gloom of the forest than in open 
sunlight. No passage existed on either side of the narrow path 
made by the axe. Large climbing plants entwined themselves 
around the trunks and branches of gigantic trees like boa- 
constrictors, and they often do constrict the trees by which they 
rise, and, killing them, stand erect themselves. The bark of a 
fine tree found in abundance here, and called " motuia," is 
used by the Barotse for making fish lines and nets, and the 
"molompi," so well adapted for paddles by its lightness and 
flexibility, was abundant. There were other trees quite new to 
my companions ; many of them ran up to a height of fifty feet of 
one thickness, and without branches. 

In these forests, we first encountered the artificial beehives 
so commonly met with all the way from this to Angola ; they 
consist of about five feet of the bark of a tree fifteen or eighteen 



* On examining this subject when I returned to Linyanti, I found that, 
according to Dr. Arnott, a declivity of three inches per mile gives a velocity in 
a smooth straight channel of three miles an hour. The general velocity of the 
Zambesi is three miles and three quarters per hour, though in the rocky parts 
it is sometimes as much as four and a half. If, however, we make allowances 
for roughness of bottom, bendings of channel, and sudden descents at cataracts, 
and say the declivity is even seven inches per mile, those 800 miles between 
the east coast and the great falls would require less than 500 feet to give the 
observed velocity, and the additional distance to this point would require but 
150 feet of altitude more. If my observation of this altitude may be depended 
on, we have a steeper declivity for the Zambesi than for some other great rivers. 
The Ganges, for instance, is said to be at 1800 miles from its mouth only 800 
feet above the level of the sea, and water requires a month to come that distance. 
But there are so many modifying circumstances, it is difficult to draw any 
reliable conclusion from the currents. The Chobe is sometimes heard of as 
flooded, about 40 miles above Linyanti, a fortnight before the inundation reaches 
that point ; but it is very tortuous. The great river Magdalena falls only 500 
feet in a thousand miles : other rivers much more. 



Chap. XVI. BEEHIVES— MUSHROOMS. 285 

inches in diameter. Two incisions are made right round the 
tree at points five feet apart, then one longitudinal slit from one 
of these to the other ; the workman next lifts up the bark on 
each side of this slit, and detaches it from the trunk, taking- 
care not to break it, until the whole comes from the tree. The 
elasticity of the bark makes it assume the form it had before ; 
the slit is sewed or pegged up with wooden pins, and ends made 
of coiled grass-rope are inserted, one of which has a hole for the 
ingress of the bees in the centre, and the hive is complete. 
These hives are placed in a horizontal position on high trees in 
different parts of the forest, and in this way all the wax exported 
from Benguela and Loanda is collected. It is all the produce 
of free labour. A " piece of medicine " is tied round the trunk 
of the tree, and proves sufficient protection against thieves. 
The natives seldom rob each other, for all believe that certain 
medicines can inflict disease and death ; and though they con- 
sider that these are only known to a few, they act on the 
principle that it is best to let them all alone. The gloom 
of these forests strengthens the superstitious feelings of the 
people. In other quarters, where they are not subjected to 
this influence, I have heard the chiefs issue proclamations to 
the effect, that real witchcraft medicines had been placed at 
certain gardens from which produce had been stolen ; the thieves 
having risked the power of the ordinary charms previously placed 
there. 

This being the rainy season, great quantities of mushrooms 
were met with, and were eagerly devoured by my companions ; 
the edible variety is always found growing out of ant-hills, and 
attains the diameter of the crown of a hat ; they are quite 
white, and very good, even when eaten raw ; they occupy an 
extensive region of the interior ; some, not edible, are of a 
brilliant red, and others are of the same light blue as the paper 
used by apothecaries to put up their medicines. 

There was considerable pleasure, in spite of rain and fever, in 
this new scenery. The deep gloom contrasted strongly with the 
shadeless glare of the Kalahari, which had left an indelible 
impression on my memory. Though drenched day by day at 
this time, and for months afterwards, it was long before I could 
believe that we were getting too much of a good thing. Nor 



286 LENDING ROOFS OF HUTS. Chap. XVI. 

could I look at water being thrown away, without a slight, quick 
impression flitting across the mind that we were guilty of 
wasting it. Every now and then we emerged from the deep 
gloom into a pretty little valley, having a damp portion in the 
middle ; which, though now filled with water, at other times 
contains moisture enough for wells only. These wells have 
shades put over them in the form of little huts. 

We crossed, in canoes, a little never-failing stream, which 
passes by the name Lefuje, or " the rapid." It comes from a 
goodly high mountain, called Monakadzi (the woman), which 
gladdened our eyes as it rose to our sight about twenty or thirty 
miles to the east of our course. It is of an oblong shape, and 
seemed at least eight hundred feet above the plains. The Lefuje 
probably derives its name from the rapid descent of the short 
course it has to flow from Monakadzi to the Leeba. 

The number of little villages seemed about equal to the 
number of valleys. At some we stopped and rested, the people 
becoming more liberal as we advanced. Others we found de- 
serted, a sudden panic having seized the inhabitants, though the 
drum of Manenko was kept beaten pretty constantly, in order 
to give notice of the approach of great people. When we had 
decided to remain for the night at any village, the inhabitants 
lent us the roofs of their huts, which in form resemble those of 
the Makololo, or a Chinaman's hat, and can be taken off the walls 
at pleasure. They lifted them off, and brought them to the spot 
we had selected as our lodging, and, when my men had propped 
them up with stakes, they were then safely housed for the night. 
Every one who comes to salute either Manenko or ourselves, 
rubs the upper parts of the arms and chest with ashes ; those 
who wish to show profounder reverence, put some also on the 
face. 

We found that every village had its idols near it. This is the 
case all through the country of the Balonda, so that, when we 
came to an idol in the woods, we always knew that we were 
within a quarter of an hour of human habitations. One very 
ugly idol we passed, rested on a horizontal beam placed on 
two upright posts. This beam was furnished with two loops of 
cord, as of a chain, to suspend offerings before it. On remarking 
to my companions that these idols had ears, but that they heard 



Chap. XVI. MANENKO'S WHIMS. 287 

not, &c, I learned that the Balonda, and even the Barotse, 
believe that divination may be performed by means of these 
blocks of wood and clay ; and though the wood itself could not 
hear, the owners had medicines by which it could be made to 
hear and give responses ; so that if an enemy were approaching 
they would have full information. Manenko having brought us 
to a stand, on account of slight indisposition and a desire to send 
forward notice of our approach to her uncle, I asked why it was 
necessary to send forward information of our movements, if 
Shinte had idols who could tell him everything ? " She did it 
only," * was the reply. It is seldom of much use to show one 
who worships idols the folly of idolatry, without giving something 
else as an object of adoration instead. They do not love them. 
They fear them, and betake themselves to their idols only when 
in perplexity and danger. 

Whilst delayed, by Manenko's management, among the Ba- 
londa villages, a little to the south of the town of Shinte, we 
were well supplied by the villagers with sweet potatoes and 
green maize ; Sambanza went to his mother's village for sup- 
plies of other food. I was labouring under fever, and did not 
find it very difficult to exercise patience with her whims ; but it 
being Saturday, I thought we might as well go to the town for 
Sunday (15th.) "No; her messenger must return from her 
uncle first." Being sure that the answer of the uncle would be 
favourable, I thought we might go on at once, and not lose two 
days in the same spot. " No, it is our custom ;" and everything 
else I could urge was answered in the genuine pertinacious lady 
style. She ground some meal for me with her own hands, and, 
when she brought it, told me she had actually gone to a village 
and begged corn for the purpose. She said this with an air as 
if the inference must be drawn by even a stupid white man : 
" I know how to manage, don't I ? " It was refreshing to get 
food which could be eaten without producing the unpleasantness 
described by the Be v. John Newton, of St. Mary's, Woolnoth, 
London, when obliged to eat the same roots while a slave in the 
West Indies. The day (January 14th) for a wonder was fair, and 

* This is a curious African idiom, by which a person implies he had no 
particular reason for his act. 



288 MODE OF APPROACHING VILLAGES. Chap. XVI. 

the sun shone, so as to allow us to dry our clothing and other 
goods, many of which were mouldy and rotten from the long- 
continued damp. The guns rusted, in spite of being oiled every 
evening. 

During the night we were all awakened by a terrific shriek 
from one of Manenko's ladies. She piped out so loud and long 
that we all imagined she had been seized by a lion, and my 
men snatched up their arms, which they always place so as to 
be ready at a moment's notice, and ran to the rescue ; but we 
found the alarm had been caused by one of the oxen thrusting 
his head into her hut, and smelling her : she had put her hand 
on his cold wet nose, and thought it was all over with her. 

On Sunday afternoon messengers arrived from Shinte, ex- 
pressing his approbation of the objects we had in view in our 
journey through his country, and that he was glad of the pros- 
pect of a way being opened by which white men might visit 
him, and allow him to purchase ornaments at pleasure. Ma- 
nenko now threatened in sport to go on, and I soon afterwards 
perceived that what now seemed to me the dilly-dallying way of 
this lady, was the proper mode of making acquaintance with the 
Balonda ; and much of the favour with which I was received in 
different places was owing to my sending forward messengers, to 
state the object of our coming, before entering each town and 
village. When we came in sight of a village, we sat down under 
the shade of a tree, and sent forward a man to give notice who 
we were, and what were our objects. The head man of the 
village then sent out his principal men, as Shinte now did, to bid 
us welcome, and show us a tree under which we might sleep. 
Before I had profited by the rather tedious teaching of Manenko, 
I sometimes entered a village, and created unintentional alarm. 
The villagers would continue to look upon us with suspicion as 
long as we remained. Shinte sent us two large baskets of 
manioc, and six dried fishes. His men had the skin of a monkey, 
called in their tongue "poluma" (Colobus guereza), of a jet black 
colour, except the long mane, which is pure white ; it is said to 
be found in the north, in the country of Matiamvo, the para- 
mount chief of all the Balonda. We learned from them, that 
they are in the habit of praying to their idols when unsuccessful 
in killing game, or in any other enterprise. They behaved with 



Chap. XVI. A MERMAN. 289 

reverence at our religious services. This will appear important, 
if the reader remembers the almost total want of prayer and 
reverence we encountered in the south. 

Our friends informed us that Shinte would be highly honoured 
by the presence of three white men in his town at once. Two 
others had sent forward notice of their approach from another 
quarter (the west) ; could it be Barth or Krapf ? How pleasant 
to meet with Europeans in such an out-of-the-way region ! The 
rush of thoughts made me almost forget my fever. Are they of 
the same colour as I am ? — " Yes ; exactly so." — And have the 
same hair ? — " Is that hair ? we thought it was a wig ; we never 
saw the like before ; this white man must be of the sort that 
lives in the sea." Henceforth my men took this hint, and 
always sounded my praises as a true specimen of the variety 
of white men who live in the sea. u Only look at Ins hair — it 
is made quite straight by the sea-water !" 

I explained to them again and again that, when it was said we 
came out of the sea, it did not mean that we came from beneath 
the water ; but the fiction has been widely spread in the interior 
by the Mambari, that the real white men live in the sea, and the 
myth was too good not to be taken advantage of by my com- 
panions ; so, notwithstanding my injunctions, I believe that, when 
I was out of hearing, my men always represented themselves as 
led by a genuine merman : " Just see his hah* ! " If I returned 
from walking to a little distance, they would remark of some to 
whom they had been holding forth, " These people want to see 
your hair." 

As the strangers had woolly hair like themselves, I had to 
give up the idea of meeting anything more European, than two 
half-caste Portuguese, engaged hi trading for slaves, ivory, and 
bees'-wax. 

16th. — After a short march we came to a most lovely 
valley about a mile and a half wide, and stretching away east- 
wards up to a low prolongation of Monakadzi. A small stream 
meanders down the centre of this pleasant green glen ; and on a 
little rill, which flows into it from the western side, stands the 
town of Kabompo ; or, as he likes best to be called, Shinte. 
(Lat. 12° 37' 35" S., long. 22° 47' E.) When Manenko thought 
the sun was high enough for us to make a lucky entrance, we 

u 



290 SLAVE-TEADEES. Chap. XVI. 

found the town embowered in banana and other tropical trees 
having great expansion of leaf; the streets are straight, and 
present a complete contrast to those of the Bechuanas, which 
are all very tortuous. Here too we first saw native huts with 
square walls and round roofs. The fences or walls of the courts, 
which surround the huts, are wonderfully straight, and made of 
upright poles a few inches apart, with strong grass or leafy 
bushes neatly woven between. In the courts were small planta- 
tions of tobacco, and a little solanaceous plant which the Balonda 
use as a relish, also sugar-cane and bananas. Many of the poles 
have grown again, and trees of the Fieus indiea family have been 
planted around, in order to give to the inhabitants a grateful 
shade ; they regard this tree with some sort of veneration as a 
medicine or charm. Goats were browsing about, and, when we 
made our appearance, a crowd of negroes, all fully armed, ran 
towards us as if they would eat us up ; some had guns, but the 
manner in winch they were held, showed that the owners were 
more accustomed to bows and arrows, than to white men's 
weapons. After surrounding and staring at us for an hour, they 
began to disperse. 

The two native Portuguese traders of whom we had heard, had 
erected a little encampment opposite the place where ours was 
about to be made. One of them, whose spine had been injured 
in youth, a rare sight in this country, came and visited us. I 
returned the visit next morning. His tall companion had that 
sickly yellow hue which made him look fairer than myself, but 
his head w r as covered with a crop of unmistakeable wool. They 
had a gang of young female slaves in a chain, hoeing the ground 
in front of their encampment to clear it of weeds and grass ; 
these were purchased recently in Lobale, whence the traders had 
now come. There were many Mambari with them, and the 
establishment was conducted with that military order which 
pervades all the arrangements of the Portuguese colonists. A 
drum was beaten, and trumpet sounded at certain hours, quite in 
military fashion. It was the first time most of my men had seen 
slaves in chains. " They are not men !" they exclaimed (mean- 
ing they are beasts), " who treat their children so ! " 

The Balonda are real negroes, having much more wool on their 
heads and bodies than any of the Bechuana or Caffre tribes. 



Chap. XVI. RECEPTION BY SHINTE. 291 

They are generally very dark in colour, but several are to be 
seen of a lighter hue ; many of the slaves who have been ex- 
ported to Brazil, have gone from this region ; but while they 
have a general similarity to the typical negro, I never could, 
from my own observation, think that our ideal negro, as seen in 
tobacconists' shops, is the true type. A large proportion of the 
Balonda, indeed, have heads somewhat elongated backwards and 
upwards, thick lips, flat noses, elongated ossa calces, &c. &c. ; 
but there are also many good-looking, well-shaped heads and 
persons among them. 

17th, Tuesday. — We were honoured with a grand reception by 
Shinte about eleven o'clock. Sambanza claimed the honour of 
presenting us, Manenko being slightly indisposed. The native 
Portuguese and Mambari went fully armed with guns, in order 
to give Shinte a salute ; then- drummer and trumpeter making 
all the noise that very old instruments would produce. 
The kotla, or place of audience, was about a hundred yards 
square, and two graceful specimens of a species of banian stood 
near one end ; under one of these sat Shinte, on a sort of throne 
covered with a leopard's skin. He had on a checked jacket, and 
a kilt of scarlet baize edged with green ; many strings of large 
beads hung from Ins neck, and Ins limbs were covered with iron 
and copper armlets and bracelets ; on Ins head he wore a helmet 
made of beads woven neatly together, and crowned with a great 
bunch of goose-feathers. Close to him sat three lads with ldfrge 
sheaves of arrows over their shoulders. 

When we entered the kotla, the whole of Manenko's party 
saluted Shinte by clapping their hands ; and Sambanza did 
obeisance by rubbing his chest and arms with ashes. One of 
the trees being unoccupied, I retreated to it for the sake of the 
shade, and my whole party did the same. We were now about 
forty yards from the chief, and could see the whole ceremony. 
The different sections of the tribe came forward in the same way 
that we did, the head man of each making obeisance with ashes 
which he carried with him for the purpose ; then came the sol- 
diers, all armed to the teeth, running and shouting towards us, 
with their swords drawn, and their faces screwed up so as to 
appear as savage as possible, for the purpose, I thought, of 
trying whether they could not make us take to our heels. As 

u 2 



292 EECEPTION BY SHINTE. Chap. XVI. 

we did not, they turned round towards Shinte, and saluted him ; 
then retired. When all had come, and were seated, then began 
the curious capering usually seen in pichos. A man starts up, 
and imitates the most approved attitudes observed in actual 
fight, — as if throwing one javelin, receiving another on the 
shield, springing to one side to avoid a third, running backwards 
or forwards, leaping, &c. This over, Sambanza, and the spokes- 
man of ISTyamoana, stalked backwa. '- 1 s and forwards in front of 
Shinte, and gave forth, in a loud voice, all they had been able 
to learn, either from myself or people, of my past history and 
connection with the Makololo ; the return of the captives ; the 
wish to open the country to trade ; the Bible as a word from 
heaven ; the white man's desire for the tribes to live in peace : 
he ought to have taught the Makololo that first, for the Baloncla 
never attacked them, yet they had assailed the Balonda : per- 
haps he is fibbing, perhaps not ; they rather thought he was ; 
but as the Balonda had good hearts, and Shinte had never done 
harm to any one, he had better receive the white man well, and 
send him on his way. Sambanza was gaily attired, and, besides 
a profusion of beads, had a cloth so long that a boy carried it 
after him as a train. 

Behind Shinte sat about a hundred women, clothed in then* 
best, which happened to be a profusion of red baize. The chief 
wife of Shinte, one of the Matebele or Zulus, sat in front with a 
curious red cap on her head. During the intervals between the 
speeches, these ladies burst forth into a sort of plaintive ditty ; 
but it was impossible for any of us to catch whether it was in 
praise of the speaker, of Shinte, or of themselves. This was the 
first time I had ever seen females present in a public assembly. 
In the south the women are not permitted to enter the kotla ; 
and even when invited to come to a religious service there, would 
not enter until ordered to do so by the chief ; but here they 
expressed approbation by clapping their hands, and laughing 
to different speakers ; and Shinte frequently turned round and 
spoke to them. 

A party of musicians, consisting of three drummers and four 
performers on the piano, went round the kotla several times, 
regaling us with their music. The drums are neatly carved 
from the trunk of a tree, and have a small hole in the side

covered with a bit of spider's web : the ends are covered with the 
skin of an antelope pegged on ; and when they wish to tighten 
it they hold it to the fire to make it contract : the instruments 
are beaten with the hands. 




The Marimba, or Musical Instrument of the Balonda. 

The piano, named " marimba," consists of two bars of wood 
placed side by side, here quite straight, but, farther north, bent 
round so as to resemble half the tire of a carriage-wheel ; across 
these are placed about fifteen wooden keys, each of which is two 
or three inches broad, and fifteen or eighteen inches long ; their 
thickness is regulated according to the deepness of the note 
required : each of the keys has a calabash beneath it ; from the 
upper part of each, a portion is cut off to enable them to embrace 
the bars, and form hollow sounding-boards to the keys, which 
also are of different sizes, according to the note required ; and 
little drumsticks elicit the music. Rapidity of execution seems 
much admired among them, and the music is pleasant to the 
ear. In Angola the Portuguese use the marimba in their 
dances. 

When nine speakers had concluded their orations, Shinte 
stood up, and so did all the people. He had maintained true 



294 PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH SHINTE. Chap. XVI. 

African dignity of manner all the while, but my people remarked 
that he scarcely ever took his eyes off me for a moment. About 
a thousand people were present, according to my calculation, 
and three hundred soldiers. The sun had now become hot ; and 
the scene ended by the Mambari discharging their guns. 

18th. — We were awakened during the night by a message from 
Shinte, requesting a visit at a very unseasonable hour. As I 
was just in the sweating stage of an intermittent, and the path 
to the town lay through a wet valley, I declined going. Kolim- 
bota, who knows their customs best, urged me to go ; but, inde- 
pendent of sickness, I hated words of the night and deeds of 
darkness. " I was neither a hyaena nor a witch." Kolimbota 
thought that we ought to conform to their wishes in everything : 
I thought we ought to have some choice in the matter as well, 
which put him into high dudgeon. However, at ten next 
morning we went, and were led into the courts of Shinte, the 
walls of which were woven rods, all very neat and high. Many 
trees stood within the enclosure and afforded a grateful shade. 
These had been planted, for we saw some recently put in, with 
grass wound round the trunk to protect them from the sun. The 
otherwise waste corners of the streets were planted with sugar- 
cane and bananas, which spread their large light leaves over the 
walls. 

The Ficus indica tree, under which we now sat, had very large 
leaves, but showed its relationship to the Indian banian by send- 
ing down shoots towards the ground. Shinte soon came, and 
appeared a man of upwards of fifty-five years of age, of frank and 
open countenance, and about the middle height. He seemed in 
good humour, and said he had expected yesterday " that a man 
who came from the gods, would have approached and talked to 
him." That had been my own intention in going to the recep- 
tion, but when we came and saw the formidable preparations, 
and all his own men keeping at least forty yards off from him, I 
yielded to the solicitations of my men, and remained by the tree 
opposite to that under which he sat. His remark confirmed my 
previous belief that a frank, open, fearless manner is the most 
winning with all these Africans. I stated the object of my jour- 
ney and mission, and to all I advanced the old gentleman 
clapped his hands in approbation. He replied through a spokes- 



Chap. XVJ. FERTILITY OF SOIL. 295 

man ; then all the company joined in the response by clapping 
of hands too. 

After the more serious business was over, I asked if he had 
ever seen a white man before. He replied, " Never ; you are 
the very first I have seen with a white skin and straight hair ; 
your clothing too is different from any we have ever seen." 
They had been visited by native Portuguese and Mambari 
only. 

On learning from some of the people that " Shinte's mouth 
was bitter for want of tasting ox-flesh," I presented him with an 
ox, to his great delight ; and as Ins country is so well adapted 
for cattle, I advised him to begin a trade in cows with the Mako- 
lolo. He was pleased with the idea ; and when we returned 
from Loanda, we found that he had profited by the hmt, for he 
had got three, and one of them justified my opinion of the coun- 
try, for it was more like a prize heifer for fatness than any we 
had seen in Africa. He soon afterwards sent us a basket of 
green maize boiled, another of manioc-meal, and a small fowl. 
The maize shows by its size the fertility of the black soil of all 
the valleys here, and so does the manioc, though no manure is 
ever applied. We saw manioc attain a height of six feet and 
upwards, and this is a plant which requires the very best soil. 

During this time Manenko had been extremely busy with all 
her people in getting up a very pretty hut and court-yard, to be, 
as she said, her residence always when white men were brought 
by her along the same path. When she heard that we had given 
an ox to her uncle, she came forward to us with the air of one 
wronged, and explained that " This white man belonged to her ; 
she had brought Inm here, and therefore the ox was hers, not 
Shinte's." She ordered her men to bring it, got it slaughtered 
by them, and presented her uncle with a leg only. Shinte did 
not seem at all annoyed at the occurrence. 

19th. — I was awakened at an early horn* by a messenger from 
Shinte, but the thirst of a raging fever being just assuaged, 
by the bursting forth of a copious perspiration, I declined going 
for a few hours. Violent action of the heart all the way to the 
town, did not predispose me to be patient with the delay which 
then occurred, probably on account of the divination bemg unfa- 
vourable : " They could not find Shinte." When I returned to 



296 CONVERSATION WITH SHINTE. Chap. XVI. 

bed, another message was received, " Shinte wished to say all he 
had to tell me at once." This was too tempting an offer, so we 
went ; and he had a fowl ready in his hand to present, also a basket 
of manioc-meal, and a calabash of mead. Referring to the con- 
stantly recurring attacks of fever, he remarked that it was the 
only thing which would prevent a successful issue to my journey, 
for he had men to guide me who knew all the paths winch led to 
the white men. He had himself travelled far when a young man. 
On asking what he would recommend for the fever, "Drink 
plenty of the mead, and, as it gets in, it will 'drive the fever out." 
It was rather strong, and I suspect he liked the remedy pretty 
well, even though he had no fever. He had always been a friend 
to Sebituane, and, now that his son Sekeletu was in his place, 
Shinte was not merely a friend but a father to him ; and if a son 
asks a favour the father must give it. He was highly pleased 
with the large calabashes of clarified butter and fat, which 
Sekeletu had sent him, and wished to detain Kolhnbota, that he 
might send a present back to Sekeletu by Ins hands. This pro- 
position we afterwards discovered was Kolimbota's own, as he 
had heard so much about the ferocity of the tribes through which 
we were to pass, that he wished to save his skin. It will be seen 
further on, that he was the only one of our party who returned 
with a wound. 

We were particularly struck, in passing through the village, 
with the punctiliousness of manners shown by the Balonda. The 
inferiors, on meeting their superiors in the street, at once drop on 
their knees and rub dust on their arms and chest ; they continue 
the salutation of clapping the hands until the great ones have 
passed. Sambanza knelt down in this manner, till the son of 
Shinte had passed him. 

We several times saw the woman who occupies the office of 
drawer of water for Shinte ; she rings a bell as she passes along 
to give warning to all to keep out of her way ; it would be a 
grave offence for any one to come near her, and exercise an evil 
influence by his presence on the drink of the chief. I suspect 
that offences of the slightest character among the poor, are made 
the pretext for selling them or their children to the Mambari. 
A young man of Lobale had fled into the country of Shinte, and 
located himself without showing hiinself to the chief. This was 



Chap. XVI. KIDNAPPING. 297 

considered an offence sufficient to warrant his being seized and 
offered for sale while we were there. He had not reported him- 
self, so they did not know the reason of his running away from 
his own chief, and that chief might accuse them of receiving a 
criminal. It was curious to notice the effect of the slave-trade 
in blunting the moral susceptibility : no chief in the south would 
treat a fugitive in this way. My men were horrified at the act, 
even though old Shinte and his council had some show of reason 
on then* side ; and both the Barotse and the Makololo declared 
that, if the Balonda only knew of the policy pursued by them to 
fugitives, but few of the discontented would remain long with 
Shinte. My men excited the wonder of his people, by stating 
that every one of them had one cow at least in his possession. 

Another incident, winch occurred while we were here," may 
be mentioned, as of a character totally unknown in the south. 
Two children, of seven and eight years old, went out to collect 
firewood a short distance from their parents' home, which was a 
quarter of a mile from the village, and were kidnapped ; the 
distracted parents could not find a trace of them. This hap- 
pened so close to the town, where there are no beasts of prey, 
that we suspect some of the high men of Shinte's court were the 
guilty parties ; they can sell them by night. The Mambari 
erect large huts of a square shape to stow these stolen ones in ; 
they are well fed, but aired by night only. The frequent kid- 
napping from outlying hamlets explains the stockades we saw 
around them ; the parents have no redress, for even Shinte 
himself seems fond of working in the dark. One night he sent 
for me, though I always stated I liked all my dealings to be 
aboveboard. When I came he presented me with a slave-girl 
of about ten years old ; he said he had always been in the habit 
of presenting his visitors with a child. On my thanking him, 
and saying that I thought it wrong to take away children from 
their parents, that I wished him to give up this system alto- 
gether, and trade in cattle, ivory, and bees'-wax, he urged that 
she was " to be a child " to bring me water, and that a great 
man ought to have a child for the purpose, yet I had none. As 
I replied that I had four children, and should be very sorry if 
my chief were to take my little girl and give her away, and that 
I would prefer tins child to remain and carry water for her own 



298 MAGIC LANTERN. Chap. XVI. 

mother, he thought I was dissatisfied with her size, and sent for 
one a head taller ; after many explanations of our abhorrence of 
slavery, and how displeasing it must be to God to see his 
children selling one another, and giving each other so much 
grief as this child's mother must feel, I declined her also. If I 
could have taken her into my family for the purpose of instruc- 
tion, and then returned her as a free woman, according to a 
promise I should have made to the parents, I might have done 
so ; but to take her away, and probably never be able to secure 
her return, would have produced no good effect on the minds of 
the Balonda ; they would not then have seen evidence of our 
hatred to slavery, and the kind attentions of my friends would, 
as it almost always does in similar cases, have turned the poor 
thing's head. The difference in position between them and us 
is as great as between the lowest and highest in England, and 
we know the effects of sudden elevation on wiser heads than 
hers, whose owners have not been born to it. 

Shinte was most anxious to see the pictures of the magic 
lantern, but fever had so weakening an effect, and I had such 
violent action of the heart, with buzzing in the ears, that I could 
not go for several clays ; when I did go for the purpose, he had 
his principal men and the same crowd of court beauties near 
him as at the reception. The first picture exhibited was Abra- 
ham about to slaughter his son Isaac ; it was shown as large as 
life, and the uplifted knife was in the act of striking the lad ; 
the Balonda men remarked that the picture was much more like 
a god than the things of wood or clay they worshipped. I 
explained that this man was the first of a race to whom God had 
given the Bible we now held, and that among his children our 
Saviour appeared. The ladies listened with silent awe ; but, 
when I moved the slide, the uplifted dagger moving towards 
them, they thought it was to be sheathed in their bodies instead 
of Isaac's. " Mother ! mother ! " all shouted at once, and off 
they rushed helter-skelter, tumbling pell-mell over each other, 
and over the little idol-huts and tobacco-bushes : we could not 
get one of them back again. Shinte, however, sat bravely 
through the whole, and afterwards examined the instrument 
with interest. An explanation was always added after each 
time of showing its powers, so that no one should imagine there 



Chap. XVI. DELAY— HEAVY RAINS. 209 

was aught supernatural in it ; and had Mr. Murray, who kindly 
brought it from England, seen its popularity among both Mako- 
lolo and Balonda, he would have been gratified with the direc- 
tion Ins generosity then took. It was the only mode of 
instruction I was ever pressed to repeat. The people came long 
distances, for the express purpose of seeing the objects and 
hearing the explanations. 

One cannot get away quickly from these chiefs, they like to 
have the honour of strangers residing in their villages ; here we 
had an additional cause of delay in frequent rains — twenty-four 
hours never elapsed without heavy showers ; everything is 
affected by the dampness : surgical instruments become all 
rusty, clothing mildewed, and shoes mouldy ; my little tent was 
now so rotten and so full of small holes, that every smart shower 
caused a fine mist to descend on my blanket, and made me fain 
to cover the head with it. Heavy dews lay on everything in 
the morning, even inside the tent ; there is only a short time 
of sunshine in the afternoon, and even that is so interrupted by 
tliuncler-showers that we cannot dry our bedding. 

The winds coming from the north, always bring heavy clouds 
and rain ; in the south, the only heavy rains noticed are those 
which come from the north-east or east. The thermometer falls 
as low as 72° when there is no sunshine, though, when the 
weather is fair, the protected thermometer generally rises as 
high as 82°, even in the mornings and evenings. 

24:th. — We expected to have started to-day, but Sambanza, 
who had been sent off early in the morning for guides, returned 
at midday without them, and drunk. This was the first case of 
real babbling intoxication we had seen in this region. The 
boyaloa, or beer of the country, has more of a stupifying than 
exciting nature ; hence the beer-bibbers are great sleepers ; 
they may frequently be seen lying on their faces sound asleep. 
This peculiarity of posture was ascribed, by no less an authority 
than Aristotle, to wine, while those who were sent asleep by 
beer were believed "to lie upon their backs." 

Sambanza had got into a state of inebriation from indulging 
in mead, similar to that which Shinte presented to us, which is 
much more powerful than boyaloa. As far as we could collect 
from his incoherent sentences, Shinte had said, the ram was too 



300 



SHIOTE'S LAST PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP. Chap. XVI. 



heavy for our departure, aud the guides still required time for 
preparation. Shinte hiniself was busy getting some meal ready 
for my use in the journey. As it rained nearly all day, it was 
no sacrifice to submit to his advice and remain. Sambanza 
staggered to Manenko's hut ; she, however, who had never pro- 
mised " to love, honour, and obey him," had not been " nursing 
her wrath to keep it warm," so she coolly bundled him into the 
hut, and put him to bed. 

As the last proof of friendship, Shinte came into my tent, 
though it could scarcely contain mofe than one person, looked 
at all the curiosities, the quicksilver, the looking-glass, books, 
hair-brushes, comb, watch, &c. &c, with the greatest interest; 
then closing the tent, so that none of his own people might 




Shell, and ornament made of its end. 



Chap. XVI. FAREWELL TO SHINTE. 301 

see the extravagance of which he was about to be guilty, he 
drew out from his clothing a string of beads, and the end of a 
conical shell, which is considered, in regions far from the sea, of 
as great value as the Lord Mayor's badge is in London. He 
hung it round my neck, and said, " There, now you have a proof 
of my friendship." 

My men informed me, that these shells are so highly valued 
in this quarter, as evidences of distinction, that for two of 
them a slave might be bought, and five would be considered a 
handsome price for an elephant's tusk worth ten pounds. At 
our last interview old Shinte pointed out our principal guide, 
Intemese, a man about fifty, who was, he said, ordered to remain 
by us till we should reach the sea ; that I had now left Sekeletu 
far behind, and must henceforth look to Shinte alone for aid, 
and that it would always be most cheerfully rendered. This 
was only a polite way of expressing his wishes for my success. 
It was the good words only of the guides which were to aid me 
from the next chief, Katema, on to the sea ; they were to turn 
back on reaching him, but he gave a good supply of food for the 
journey before us, and, after mentioning as a reason for letting 
us go even now, that no one could say we had been driven away 
from the town, since we had been several days with him, he gave 
a most hearty salutation, and we parted with the wish that God 
might bless him.

26t7i. — Leaving Shinte, with, eight of his men to aid in carry- 
ing our luggage, we passed, in a northerly direction, down the 
lovely valley on which the town stands, then went a little to 
the west through pretty open forest, and slept at a village of 
Balonda. In the morning we had a fine range of green hills 
called Salofsho on our right, and were informed that they were 
rather thickly inhabited by the people of Shinte, who worked in 
iron, the ore of which abounds in these hills. 

The country through which we passed, possessed the same 
general character of flatness and forest that we noticed before. 
The soil is dark, with a tinge of red ; in some places it might 
be called red; and appeared very fertile. Every valley con- 
tained villages of twenty or thirty huts, with gardens of manioc, 
which here is looked upon as the staff of life. Very little labour 
is required for its cultivation. The earth is drawn up into 
oblong beds, about three feet broad and one in height, and in 



Chap. XVII. MANIOC-PORRIDGE. 303 

these are planted pieces of the manioc-stalk, at four feet apart. 
A crop of beans, or ground-nuts, is sown between them, and 
when these are reaped, the land around the manioc is cleared of 
weeds. In from ten to eighteen months after planting, accord- 
ing to the quality of the soil, the roots are fit for food. There 
is no necessity for reaping soon, as the roots do not become 
bitter and dry until after three years. When a woman takes up 
the roots, she thrusts a piece or two of the upper stalks into 
the hole she has made, draws back the soil, and a new crop is 
thereby begun. The plant grows to a height of six feet, and 
every part of it is useful: the leaves may be cooked as a 
vegetable. The roots are from three to four inches in diameter, 
and from twelve to eighteen inches long. 

There are two varieties of the manioc or cassava — one sweet 
and wholsome, the other bitter and containing poison, but much 
more speedy in its growth than the former. This last property 
causes its perpetuation. When we reached the village of 
Kapende, on the banks of the rivulet Lonaje, we were presented 
with so much of the poisonous kind, that we were obliged to 
leave it. To get rid of the poison the people place it four days 
in a pool of water. It then becomes partially decomposed, and 
is taken out, stripped of its skin, and exposed to the sun. When 
dried, it is easily pounded into fine white meal, closely resem- 
bling starch, which has either a little of the peculiar taste 
arising from decomposition, or no more flavour than starch. 
When intended to be used as food, this meal is stirred into 
boiling water : they put as much in as can be moistened, one 
man holding the vessel and the other stirring the porridge 
with all his might. This is the common mess of the country. 
Though hungry, we could just manage to swallow it with the aid 
of a little honey, which I shared with my men as long as it 
lasted. It is very unsavoury (Scotticb wersh) ; and no matter 
how much one may eat, two hours afterwards he is as hungry as 
ever. When less meal is employed, the mess is exactly like a 
basin of starch in the hands of a laundress ; and if the starch 
were made from diseased potatoes, some idea might be formed 
of the Balonda porridge, winch hunger alone forced us to eat. 
Santuru forbade his nobles to eat it, as it caused coughing and 
expectoration. 



304 PUNCTILIOUSNESS OF THE BALONDA. Chap. XVII. 

Our chief guide, Inteniese, sent orders to all the villages 
around our route that Shinte's friends must have abundance of 
provisions. Our progress was impeded by the time requisite for 
communicating the chief's desire, and consequent preparation of 
meal. We received far more food from Shinte's people than 
from himself. Kapende, for instance, presented two large baskets 
of meal, three of manioc-roots steeped and dried in the sun and 
ready to be converted into flour, three fowls and seven eggs, with 
three smoke-dried fishes ; and others gave with similar liberality. 
I gave to the headmen small bunches of my stock of beads, with 
an apology that we were now on our way to the market for these 
goods. The present was always politely received. 

We had an opportunity of observing that our guides had 
much more etiquette than any of the tribes farther south. They 
gave us food, but would not partake of it when we had cooked 
it ; nor would they eat their own food in our presence. When 
it was cooked they retired into a thicket, and ate their porridge ; 
then all stood up, and clapped their hands, and praised Intemese 
for it. The Makololo, who are accustomed to the most free and 
easy manners, held out handfuls of what they had cooked to any 
of the Balonda near, but they refused to taste. They are very 
punctilious in their manners to each other. Each hut has its 
own fire, and when it goes out they make it afresh for themselves 
rather than take it from a neighbour. I believe much of this 
arises from superstitious fears. In the deep, dark forests near 
each village, as already mentioned, you see idols intended to 
represent the human head or a lion, or a crooked stick smeared 
with medicine, or simply a small pot of medicine in a little shed, 
or miniature huts with little mounds of earth in them. But in 
the darker recesses we meet with human faces cut in the bark of 
trees, the outlines of which, with the beards, closely resemble 
those seen on Egyptian monuments. Frequent cuts are made 
on the trees all along the paths, and offerings of small pieces of 
manioc-roots, or ears of maize, are placed on branches. There 
are also to be seen every few miles heaps of sticks, which are 
treated in cairn fashion, by every one throwing a small branch 
to the heap in passing ; or a few sticks are placed on the path, 
and each passer-by turns from his course, and forms a sudden 
bend in the road to one side. It seems as if their minds were 



Chap. XVII. VILLAGES BEYOND THE LONAJE. 305 

ever in doubt and dread in these gloomy recesses of the forest, 
and that they were striving to propitiate, by their offerings, some 
superior beings residing there. 

The dress of the Balonda men consists of the softened skins of 
small animals, as the jackal or wild cat, hung before and behind 
from a girdle round the loins. The dress of the women is of a 
nondescript character; but they were not immodest. They 
stood before us as perfectly unconscious of any indecorum as 
we could be with our clothes on. But, while ignorant of their 
own deficiency, they could not maintain their gravity at the sight 
of the nudity of my men behind. Much to the annoyance of my 
companions, the young girls laughed outright whenever their 
backs were turned to them. 

After crossing the Lonaje, we came to some pretty villages, 
embowered, as the negro villages usually are, in bananas, shrubs, 
and manioc, and near the banks of the Leeba we formed our 
encampment in a nest of serpents, one of which bit one of our 
men, but the wound was harmless. The people of the sur- 
rounding villages presented us with large quantities of food, in 
obedience to the mandate of Shinte, without expecting any equi- 
valent. One village had lately been transferred hither from the 
country of Matiamvo. They, of course, continue to acknowledge 
him as paramount chief; but the frequent instances which occur 
of people changing from one part of the country to another, 
show that the great chiefs possess only a limited power. The 
only peculiarity we observed in these people is the habit of 
plaiting the beard into a threefold cord. 

The town of the Balonda chief, Cazembe, was pointed out to 
us as lying to the N.E. and by E. from the town of Shinte, and 
great numbers of people in this quarter have gone thither for 
the purpose of purchasing copper anklets, made at Cazembe' s, 
and report the distance to be about five days' journey. I made 
inquiries of some of the oldest inhabitants of the villages at 
which we were staying, respecting the visit of Pereira and 
Lacerda to that town. An old grey-headed man replied that 
they had often heard of white men before, but never had seen 
one, and added that one had come to Cazembe when our informant 
was young, and returned again without entering this part of the 
country. The people of Cazembe are Balonda or Baloi, and 

x 



o

his country lias been termed Londa, Lunda, or Lui, by the 
Portuguese. 

It was always difficult to get our guides to move away from a 
place. With the authority of the chief, they felt as comfortable 
as king's messengers could, and were not disposed to forego the 
pleasure of living at free quarters. My Makololo friends were 
but ill drilled as yet ; and since they had never^ left their own 
country before, except for purposes of plunder, they did not take 
readily to the peaceful system we now meant to follow. They 
either spoke too imperiously to strangers, or, when reproved for 
that, were disposed to follow the dictation of every one we met. 
When Intemese, our guide, refused to stir towards the Leeba on 
the 31st of January, they would make no effort to induce him 
to go ; but, having ordered them to get ready, Intemese saw 
the preparations, and soon followed the example. It took us 
about four hours to cross the Leeba,. which is considerably 
smaller here than where we left it, — indeed, only about a hundred 
yards wide. It has the same dark mossy hue. The villagers 
lent us canoes to effect our passage ; and, having gone to a vil- 
lage about two miles beyond the river, I had the satisfaction of 
getting observations for both longitude and latitude — for the 
former, the distance between Saturn and the Moon, and for the 
latter a meridian altitude of Canopus. Long. 22° 57' E. ; 
lat. 12° 6' 6" S. 

These were the only opportunities I had of ascertaining my 
whereabouts in tins part of Londa. Again and again did I take 
out the instruments, and, just as all was right, the stars would be 
suddenly obscured by clouds. I had never observed so great an 
amount of cloudiness in any part of the south country ; and as 
for the rains, I believe that years at Kolobeng would not have 
made my little tent so rotten and thin as one month had done in 
Londa. I never observed in the south, the heavy night and 
early morning rains we had in this country. They often con- 
tinued all night, then became heavier about an hour before 
dawn. Or if fair during the night, as day drew nigh, an ex- 
tremely heavy, still, pouring rain set in without warning. Five 
out of every six days we had this pouring rain, at or near break 
of day, for months together ; and it soon beat my tent so thin, 
that a mist fell through on my face and made everything damp. 



Chap. XYII. INTEMESE'S FICTION— THEFT. 307 

The rains were occasionally, but not always, accompanied with 
yery loud thunder. . 

February 1st. — This day we had a fine view of two hills called 
Phi (Peeri), meaning " two," on the side of the river we had left. 
The country there is named Mokwankwa. And there Intemese 
informed us one of Shinte's children was born, when he was in 
his progress southwards from the country of Matiamvo. This 
part of the country, would thus seem not to have been inhabited 
by the people of Shinte, at any very remote period. He told me 
himself that he had come into his present country by command 
of Matiamvo. 

Here we were surprised to hear English cotton cloth much 
more eagerly inquired after than beads and ornaments. They 
are more in need of clothing than the Bechuana tribes living 
adjacent to the Kalahari Desert, who have plenty of skins for the 
purpose. Animals of all kinds are rare here, and a very small 
piece of calico is of great value. 

In the midst of the heavy rain, which continued all the morn- 
ing, Intemese sent to say he was laid up with pains in the stomach, 
and must not be disturbed ; but when it cleared up, about eleven, 
I saw our friend walking off to the village, and talking with a very 
loud voice. On reproaching him for telling an untruth, he 
turned it off with a laugh, by saying he really had a complaint 
in his stomach, which I might cure by slaughtering one of the 
oxen and allowing him to eat beef. He was evidently revelling 
in the abundance of good food the chiefs orders brought us. 
And he did not feel the shame I did, when I gave a few beads 
only, in return for large baskets of meal. 

A very old man visited us here with a present of maize : like 
the others he had never before seen a white man, and, when con- 
versing with him, some of the young men remarked that thev 
were the true ancients, for they had now seen more wonderful 
things than their forefathers. 

One of Intemese's men stole a fowl given me by the lady of 
the village. When charged with the theft, every one of Inte- 
mese's party vociferated his innocence, and indignation at being 
suspected ; continuing their loud asseverations and gesticulations 
for some minutes. One of my men, Loyanke, went off to the vil- 
lage, brought the lady who had presented the fowl to identify it, 

x 2 



308 PLAINS COVEEED WITH WATEE. Chap. XVII. 

and then pointed to the hut in which it was hidden. The Balonda 
collected round him, evincing great wrath ; but Loyanke seized 
his battleaxe in the proper manner for striking, and, placing him- 
self on a little hillock, soon made them moderate their tones. 
Intemese then called on me to send one of my people to search 
the huts, if I suspected Ins people. The man sent soon found it, 
and brought it out, to the confusion of Intemese and the laughter 
of our party. This incident is mentioned to show that the greater 
superstition which exists here, does not lead to the practice of the 
virtues. We never met an instance like this, of theft from a 
white man among the Makololo, though they complain of the 
Makalaka as addicted to pilfering. The honesty of the Bak- 
wains has been already noticed. Probably the estimation in 
which I was held as a public benefactor, in winch character I was 
not yet known to the Balonda, may account for the sacredness with 
which my property was always treated before. But other inci- 
dents which happened subsequently, showed, as well as this, that 
idolaters are not so virtuous as those who have no idols. 

As the people on the banks of the Leeba were the last of 
Sliinte's tribe over which Intemese had power, he was naturally 
anxious to remain as long as possible. He was not idle, but 
made a large wooden mortar and pestle for his wife during our 
journey. He also carved many wooden spoons and a bowl ; then 
commenced a basket ; but as what he considered good living was 
anything but agreeable to us, who had been accustomed to milk 
and maize, we went forward on the 2nd without him. He soon 
followed, but left our pontoon, saying it would be brought by the 
head man of the village. This was a great loss, as we afterwards 
found ; it remained at this village more than a year, and when 
we returned, a mouse had eaten a hole in it. 

We entered on an extensive plain beyond the Leeba, at least 
twenty miles broad, and covered with water, ankle deep in the 
shallowest parts. We deviated somewhat from our N.W. course 
by the direction of Intemese, and kept the hills Piri nearly on 
our right during a great part of the first day, in order to avoid 
the still more deeply flooded plains of Lobale (Luval ?) on the 
west. These, according to Intemese, are at present impassable 
on account of being thigh deep. The plains are so perfectly 
level that rain-water, which this was, stands upon them for 



Chap. XVII. LOVE OF BALONDA FOR THEIR MOTHERS. 309 

months together. They were not flooded by the Leeba, for that 
was still far within its banks. Here and there, dotted over the 
surface, are little islands, on which grow stunted date-bushes and 
scraggy trees. The plains themselves are covered with a thick 
sward of grass, which conceals the water, and makes the flats 
appear like great pale yellow-coloured prairie-lands, with a clear 
horizon, except where interrupted here and there by trees. The 
clear rain-water must have stood some time among the grass, for 
great numbers of lotus-flowers were seen in full blow ; and the 
runs of water tortoises and crabs were observed ; other animals 
also, which prey on the fish that find their way to the plains. 

The continual splashing of the oxen keeps the feet of the rider 
constantly wet, and my men complain of the perpetual moisture 
of the paths by winch we have travelled in Londa, as softening 
their horny soles. The only information we can glean is from 
Intemese, who points out the different localities as we pass along, 
and among the rest " Mokala a Mama," his " mama's home." 
It was interesting to hear this tall grey-headed man recall the 
memories of boyhood. All the Makalaka cliildren cleave to the 
mother in cases of separation, or removal from one part of the 
country to another. This love for mothers does not argue 
superior morality in other respects, or else Intemese has for- 
gotten mi/ njunctions his mama may have given him not to tell 
lies. The respect, however, with which he spoke of her, was 
quite characteristic of Ins race. The Bechuanas, on the con- 
trary, care notliing for their mothers, but cling to their fathers, 
especially if they have any expectation of becoming hens to their 
cattle. Our Bakwain guide to the lake, Rachosi, told me that 
his mother lived in the country of Sebituane, but, though a good 
specimen of the Bechuanas, he laughed at the idea of going so 
far as from the Lake Ngami to the Chobe, merely for the 
purpose of seeing her. Had he been one of the Makalaka, he 
never would have parted from her. 

We made our beds on one of the islands, and were wretchedly 
supplied with firewood. The booths constructed by the men were 
but sorry shelter, for the rain poured down without intermission 
till mid-day. There is no drainage for the prodigious masses of 
water on these plains, except slow percolation into the different 
feeders of the Leeba, and into that river itself. The quantity of 



310 GRASS OF THE PLAINS. Chap. XYII. 

vegetation has prevented the country from becoming furrowed by- 
many rivulets or " nullahs." Were it not so remarkably flat, the 
drainage must have been effected by torrents, even in spite of the 
matted vegetation. 

That these extensive plains are covered with grasses only, and 
the little islands with but scraggy trees, may be accounted for 
by the fact, observable everywhere in this country, that, where 
water stands for any length of time, trees cannot live. The 
want of speedy drainage destroys them, and injures the growth 
of those that are planted on the islands, for they have no depth 
of earth not subjected to the souring influence of the stagnant 
water. The plains of Lobale, to the west of these, are said to 
be much more extensive than any we saw, and their vegetation 
possesses similar peculiarities. When the stagnant rain-water 
has all soaked in, as must happen during the months in which 
there is no rain, travellers are even put to straits for want of 
water. Tin's is stated on native testimony ; but I can very well 
believe that level plains, in which neither wells nor gullies are 
met with, may, after the dry season, present the opposite ex- 
treme to what we witnessed. Water, however, could always be 
got by digging, a proof of which we had on our return when 
brought to a stand on this very plain by severe fever : about 
twelve miles from the Kasai my men dug down a few feet, and 
found an abundant supply ; and we saw on one of the islands 
the garden of a man who, in the dry season, had drunk water 
from a well in like manner. Plains like these cannot be inha- 
bited while the present system of cultivation lasts. The popu- 
lation is not yet so very large as to need them. They find 
garden-ground enough on the gentle slopes at the sides of the 
rivulets, and possess no cattle to eat off the millions of acres 
of fine hay we were now wading through. Any one who has 
visited the Cape colony, will understand me when I say that 
these immense crops resemble sown grasses more than the tufty 
vegetation of the south. 

I would here request the particular attention of the reader to 
the phenomena these periodically deluged plains present, be- 
cause they have a most important bearing on the physical geo- 
graphy of a very large portion of this country. The plains of 
Lobale, to the west of tins, give rise to a great many streams, 



Chap. XVII. LOAN OF ROOFS— A HALT. 311 

which unite, and form the deep, never-failing Chobe. Similar 
extensive flats give birth to the Loeti and Kasai, and, as we shall 
see further on, all the rivers of an extensive region owe their 
origin to oozing bogs, and not to fountains. 

When released from our island by the rain ceasing, we 
marched on, till we came to a ridge of dry inhabited land in the 
N.W. The inhabitants, according to custom, lent us the roofs 
of some huts to save the men the trouble of booth-making. I 
suspect that the story in Park's ' Travels,' of the men lifting up 
the hut to place it on the lion, referred to the roof only. We 
leave them for the villagers to replace at their leisure. No 
payment is expected for the use of them. By night it rained 
so copiously, that all our beds were flooded from below ; and 
from this time forth we always made a furrow round each booth, 
and used the earth to raise our sleeping-places. My men turned 
out to work in the wet most willingly ; indeed they always did. 
I could not but contrast their conduct with that of Intemese. 
He was thoroughly imbued with the slave spirit, and lied on all 
occasions without compunction. Untruthfulness is a sort of 
refuge for the weak and oppressed. We expected to move on 
the 4th, but he declared that we were so near Katema's, if we 
did not send forward to apprise that chief of our approach, he 
would certainly impose a fine. It rained the whole day, so we 
were reconciled to the delay ; but on Sunday, the 5th, he let us 
know that we were still two days distant from Katema. We 
unfortunately could not manage without him, for the country 
was so deluged, we should have been brought to a halt before 
we went many miles, by some deep valley, every one of which 
was full of water. Intemese continued to plait Ins basket with 
all his might, and would not come to our religious service. He 
seemed to be afraid of our incantations ; but was always merry 
and jocular. 

6th. — Soon after starting we crossed a branch of the Loka- 
lueje by means of a canoe, and in the afternoon passed over the 
main stream by a like conveyance. The former, as is the case 
with all branches of rivers in this country, is called nuana Kalu- 
eje (child of the Kalueje). Hippopotami exist in the Lokalueje, 
so it may be inferred to be perennial, as the inhabitants asserted. 
We cannot judge of the size of the stream from what we now 



312 FERTILE COUNTRY— OMNIVOROUS FISH. Chap. XVII. 

saw. It had about forty yards of deep fast-flowing water, but 
probably not more than half that amount in the dry season. 
Besides these, we crossed numerous feeders in our N.N.W. 
course, and, there being no canoes, got frequently wet in the 
course of the day. The oxen in some places had their heads 
only above water, and the stream flowing over their backs wetted 
our blankets, which we used as saddles. The arm-pit was the 
only safe spot for carrying the watch, for there it was preserved 
from rains above and waters below. The men on foot crossed 
these gullies holding up their burdens at arms' length. 

The Lokalueje winds from north-east to south-west into the 
Leeba. The country adjacent to its banks is extremely fine and 
fertile, with here and there patches of forest or clumps of mag- 
nificent trees. The villagers through whose gardens we passed, 
continue to sow and reap all the year round. The grains, as 
maize, lotsa (Pennisetum typlwideum), lokesh or millet, are to 
be seen at all stages of their growth — some just ripe, while at 
this time the Makololo crops are not half grown. My com- 
panions, who have a good idea of the different qualities of soils, 
expressed the greatest admiration of the agricultural capabilities 
of the whole of Londa, and here they were loud in their praises 
of the pasturage. They have an accurate idea of the varieties 
of grasses best adapted for different kinds of stock, and lament 
because here there are no cows to feed off the rich green crop, 
winch at this time imparts special beauty to the landscape. 

Great numbers of the omnivorous feeding fish, Qlanis siluris, 
or mosala, spread themselves over the flooded plains, and, as the 
waters retire, try to find their way back again to the rivers. 
The Balonda make earthen dykes and hedges across the outlets 
of the retreating waters, leaving only small spaces through 
which the chief part of the water flows. In these open spaces 
they plant creels, similar in shape to our own, into which the 
fish can enter, but cannot return. They secure large quantities 
of fish in this way, which, when smoke-dried, make a good relish 
for their otherwise insipid food. They use also a weir of mats 
made of reecls sewed together, with but half an inch between 
each. Open spaces are left for the insertion of the creels as 
before. 

In still water, a fish-trap is employed of the same shape and 



Chap. XVII. THE GUIDE'S PERVERSITY. 313 

plan as the common round wire mouse-trap, which has an open- 
ing surrounded with wires pointing inwards. This is made of 
reeds and supple wands, and food is placed inside to attract the 
fish. 

Besides these means of catching fish, they use a hook of iron 
without a barb ; the point is bent inwards instead, so as not to 
allow the fish to escape. Nets are not so common as in the 
Zouga and Leeambye, but they kill large quantities of fishes by 
means of the bruised leaves of a shrub, which may be seen 
planted beside every village in the country. 

On the 7th we came to the village of Soana Molopo, a half- 
brother of Katema, a few miles beyond the Lokalueje. When 
we went to visit him, we found him sitting, with about one hun- 
dred men. He called on Intemese to give some account of us, 
though no doubt it had been done in private before. He then 
pronounced the following sentences : — " The journey of the white 
man is very proper, but Shinte has disturbed us by showing the 
path to the Makololo who accompany him. He ought to have 
taken them through the country without showing them the 
towns. We are afraid of the Makololo." He then gave us a 
handsome present of food, and seemed perplexed by my sitting 
down familiarly, and giving him a few of our ideas. When we 
left, Intemese continued busily imparting an account of all we 
had given to Shinte and Masiko, and instilling the hope, that 
Soana Molopo might obtain as much as they had received. Ac- 
cordingly, when we expected to move on the morning of the 
8th, we got some hints about the ox which Soana Molopo ex- 
pected to eat, but we recommended him to get the breed of 
cattle for himself, seeing his country was so well adapted for 
rearing stock. Intemese also refused to move ; he, moreover, 
tried to frighten us into parting with an ox, by saying that 
Soana Molopo would send forward a message that we were a 
marauding party, but we packed up and went on without him. 
We did not absolutely need him, but he was useful in preventing 
the inhabitants of secluded villages from betaking themselves to 
flight. We wished to be on good terms with all, and therefore 
put up with our guide's peccadilloes. His good word respecting 
us had considerable influence, and he was always asked if we 
had behaved ourselves like men on the way. The Makololo are 



314 MOZINKWA AND HIS FAMILY. Chap. XVII. 

viewed as great savages, but Intemese could not justly look with 
scorn on them, for he has the mark of a large gash on his arm, 
got in fighting ; and he would never tell the cause of battle, but 
boasted of his powers as the Makololo do, till asked about a scar 
on his back, betokening anything but bravery. 

Intemese was useful in cases like that of Monday, when we 
came upon a whole village in a forest enjoying their noonday 
nap. Our sudden appearance in their midst so terrified them, 
that one woman nearly went into convulsions from fear. When 
they saw and heard Intemese, their terror subsided. 

As usual, we were caught by rains after leaving Soana Mo- 
lopo's, and made our booths at the house of Mozinkwa, a most 
intelligent and friendly man belonging to Katema. He had a 
fine large garden in cultivation, and well hedged round. He 
had made the walls of his compound, or courtyard, of branches 
of the banian, which, taking root, had grown to be a live hedge 
of that tree. Mozinkwa's wife had cotton growing all round 
her premises, and several plants used as relishes to the insipid 
porridge of the country. She cultivated also the common castor- 
oil plant, and a larger shrub (Jatropha curcas), which also yields 
a purgative oil. Here, however, the oil is used for anointing 
the heads and bodies alone. We saw in her garden likewise the 
Indian bringalls, yams, and sweet potatoes. Several trees were 
planted in the middle of the yard, and in the deep shade they 
gave, stood the huts of his fine family. His children, all by one 
mother, very black but comely to view, were the finest negro 
family I ever saw. We were much pleased with the frank 
friendship and liberality of this man and his wife. She asked 
me to bring her a cloth from the white man's country, but, when 
we returned, poor Mozinkwa's wife was in her grave, and he, as 
is the custom, had abandoned trees, garden, and huts to ruin. 
They cannot live on a spot where a favourite wife has died, pro- 
bably because unable to bear the remembrance of the happy 
times they have spent there, or afraid to remain in a spot where 
death has once visited the establishment. If ever the place is 
re-visited, it is to pray to her, or make some offering. Tins feeling 
renders any permanent village in the country impossible. 

We learned from Mozinkwa that Soana Molopo was the elder 
brother of Katema, but that he was wanting in wisdom ; and 



Chap. XVII. QUENDENDE'S POLITENESS. 315 

Katema, by purchasing cattle and receiving in a kind manner 
all the fugitives who came to him, had secured the birthright to 
himself, so far as influence in the country is concerned. Soana's 
first address to us did not savour much of African wisdom. 

Friday, 10th. — On leaving Mozinkwa's hospitable mansion we 
crossed another stream, about forty yards wide, in canoes. While 
this tedious process was going on, I was informed that it is called 
the Mona-Kalueje, or brother of Kalueje, as it flows into that 
river ; that both the Kalueje and Livoa flow into the Leeba ; 
and that the Chifumadze, swollen by the Lotembwa, is a feeder 
of that river also, below the point where we lately crossed it. It 
may be remarked here, that these rivers were now in flood, and 
that the water was all perfectly clear. The vegetation on the 
banks is so thickly planted, that the surface of the earth is not 
abraded by the torrents. The grass is laid flat, and forms a pro- 
tection to the banks, which are generally a stiff black loam. 
The fact of canoes being upon them shows that, though not 
large, they are not like the southern rivulets, which dry up 
during most of the year, and render canoes unnecessary. 

As we were crossing the river, we were joined by a messenger 
from Katema, called Shakatwala. This person was a sort of 
steward or factotum to his chief. Every chief has one attached 
to his person, and, though generally poor, they are invariably 
men of great shrewdness and ability. They act the part of mes- 
sengers on all important occasions, and possess considerable 
authority in the chief's household. Shakatwala informed us that 
Katema had not received precise information about us, but if we 
were peaceably disposed, as he loved strangers, we were to come 
to his town. We proceeded forthwith, but were turned aside, by 
the strategy of our friend Intemese, to the village of Quendende, 
the father-in-law of Katema. This fine old man was so very 
polite, that we did not regret being obliged to spend Sunday at 
Ins village. He expressed his pleasure at having a share in the 
honour of a visit as well as Katema ; though it seemed to me 
that the conferring that pleasure, required something like a 
pretty good stock of impudence, in leading twenty-seven men 
through the country, without the means of purchasing food. My 
men did a little business for themselves in the begging line ; 
they generally commenced every interview with new villagers 



316 CROP OF WOOL. Chap. XVII. 

by saying, " I have come from afar ; give me something to eat." 
I forbade this at first, believing that, as the Makololo had a bad 
name, the villagers gave food from fear. But, after some time 
it was evident that in many cases maize and manioc were given 
from pure generosity. The first time I came to this conclusion 
was at the house of Mozinkwa ; scarcely any one of my men 
returned from it without something in his hand ; and as they 
protested they had not begged, I asked himself, and found that 
it was the case, and that he had given spontaneously. In other 
parts the clriefs attended to my wants, and the common people 
gave liberally to my men. I presented some of my razors and 
iron spoons to different headmen, but my men had nothing to 
give ; yet every one tried to appropriate an individual in each 
village as " Molekane," or comrade, and the villagers often 
assented ; so if the reader remembers the molekane system of 
the Mopato, he may perceive that those who presented food 
freely would expect the Makololo to treat them in like manner, 
should they ever be placed in similar circumstances. Their 
country too is so fertile that they are in no want of food them- 
selves ; however, their generosity was remarkable ; only one 
woman refused to give some of my men food, but her husband 
calling out to her to be more liberal, she obeyed, scolding all 
the while. 

In this part of the country, buffaloes, elands, koodoos, and 
various antelopes are to be found ; but we did not get any, as 
they are exceedingly wary from being much hunted. We had 
the same woodland and meadow as before, with here and there 
pleasant negro villages; and being all in good health, could 
enjoy the fine green scenery. 

Quendende's head was a good specimen of the greater crop of 
wool with which the negroes of Londa are furnished. The front 
was parted in the middle, and plaited into two thick rolls, which, 
falling down behind the ears, reached the shoulders ; the rest 
was collected into a large knot, which lay on the nape of the 
neck. As he was an intelligent man, we had much conversation 
together ; he had just come from attending the funeral of one of 
Ins people, and I found that the great amount of drum-beating 
which takes place on these occasions was with the idea that the 
Barimo, or spirits, could be drummed to sleep. There is a drum 



Chap. XYII. MATIAMVO'S CONDUCT. 317 

in every village, and we often hear it going from snnset to sun- 
rise. They seem to look upon the departed as vindictive beings, 
and I suspect are more influenced by fear than by love. In be- 
ginning to speak on religious subjects with those who have never 
heard of Christianity, the great fact of the Son of God having 
come down from heaven to die for us, is the prominent theme. 
No fact more striking can be mentioned. " He actually came 
to men. He himself told us about his Father, and the dwelling- 
place whither he has gone. We have his words in this book, 
and he really endured punishment in our stead from pure love," 
&c. If this fails to interest them, nothing else will succeed. 

We here met with some people just arrived from the town of 
Matiamvo (Muata yanvo), who had been sent to announce the 
death of the late chieftain of that name. Matiam vo is the here- 
ditary title — muata meaning lord, or chief. The late Matiamvo 
seems, from the report of these men, to have been insane, for he 
is said to have sometimes indulged the whim of running a muck 
in the town and beheading whomsoever he met, until he had 
quite a heap of human heads. Matiamvo explained this conduct 
by saying that his people were too many, and he wanted to dimi- 
nish them. He had absolute power of life and death. On in- 
quiring whether human sacrifices were still made, as in the time 
of Pereira, at Cazembe's, we were informed that these had never 
been so common as was represented to Pereira, but that it occa- 
sionally happened, when certain charms were needed by the chief, 
that a man was slaughtered for the sake of some part of his 
body. He added that he hoped the present chief would not act 
like his (mad) predecessor, but kill only those who were guilty 
of witchcraft or theft. These men were very much astonished 
at the liberty enjoyed by the Makololo ; and when they found 
that all my people held cattle, we were told that Matiamvo alone 
had a herd. One very intelligent man among them asked, " If 
he should make a canoe and take it down the river to the Mako- 
lolo, would he get a cow for it ? " This question, which my men 
answered in the affirmative, was important, as showing the know- 
ledge of a water communication from the country of Matiamvo 
to the Makololo ; and the river runs through a fertile country 
abounding in large timber. If the tribes have intercourse with 
each other, it exerts a good influence on their chiefs to hear what 



318 SUPERSTITIOUS CUSTOMS. Chap. XVII. 

other tribes think of their deeds. The Makololo have such a 
bad name on account of their perpetual forays, that they have 
not been known in Londa except as ruthless destroyers. The 
people in Matianivo's country submit to much wrong from their 
chiefs ; and no voice can be raised against cruelty, because they 
are afraid to flee elsewhere. 

We left Quendende's village in company with Quendende him- 
self, and the principal man of the ambassadors of Matiamvo, and 
after two or three miles' march to the N.W., came to the ford of 
the Lotembwa, which flows southwards. A canoe was waiting 
to ferry us over, but it was very tedious work ; for though the 
river itself was only eighty yards wide, the whole valley was 
flooded, and we were obliged to paddle more than half a mile to 
get free of the water. A fire was lit to warm old Quendende, 
and enable him to dry his tobacco-leaves. The leaves are taken 
from the plant, and spread close to the fire, until they are quite 
dry and crisp ; they are then put into a snuff-box, which, with a 
little pestle, serves the purpose of a mill to grind them into 
powder ; it is then used as snuff. As we sat by the fire the 
ambassadors communicated then thoughts freely respecting the 
customs of their race. When a chief dies, a number of servants 
are slaughtered with him to form his company in the other world. 
The Barotse followed the same custom, and this and other usages 
show them to be genuine negroes, though neither they nor the 
Balonda resemble closely the typical form of that people. Quen- 
dende said if he were present on these occasions he would hide 
his people, so that they might not be slaughtered. As we go 
north, the people become more bloodily superstitious. 

We were assured that, if the late Matiamvo took a fancy to 
anything, such, for instance, as my watch-chain, which was of 
silver wire, and was a great curiosity, as they had never seen 
metal plaited before, he would order a whole village to be 
brought up to buy it from a stranger. When a slave-trader 
visited him, he took possession of all his goods ; then, after ten 
days or a fortnight, he would send out a party of men to pounce 
upon some considerable village, and, having killed the head man, 
would pay for all the goods by selling the inhabitants. This has 
frequently been the case, and nearly all the visitants he ever had 
were men of colour. On asking, if Matiamvo did not know he 



Chap. XVII. PKESENTATION TO KATEMA. 319 

was a man, and would be judged, in company with those lie 
destroyed, by a Lord who is no respecter of persons ? the am- 
bassador replied, " We do not go up to God, as you do ; we are 
put into the ground." I could not ascertain that even those who 
have such a distinct perception of the continued existence of de- 
parted spirits, had any notion of heaven ; they appear to imagine 
the souls to be always near the place of sepulture. 

After crossing the river Lotembwa we travelled about eight 
miles, and came to Katema's straggling town (lat. 11° 35' 49" S., 
long. 22° 27' E.). It is more a collection of villages than a town. 
We were led out about half a mile from the houses, that we might 
make for ourselves the best lodging we could of the trees and 
grass, while Intemese was taken to Katema to undergo the usual 
process of pumping, as to our past conduct and professions. Ka- 
tema soon afterwards sent a handsome present of food. 

Next morning we had a formal presentation, and found Katema 
seated on a sort of throne, with about three hundred men on the 
ground around, and thirty women, who were said to be his wives, 
close behind him. The main body of the people were seated in 
a semicircle, at a distance of fifty yards. Each party had its 
own head man stationed at a little distance in front, and, when 
beckoned by the chief, came near him as councillors. Intemese 
gave our history, and Katema placed sixteen large baskets of 
meal before us, half a dozen fowls, and a dozen eggs, and ex- 
pressed regret that we had slept hungry — he did not like any 
stranger to suffer want in his town ; and added, " Go home, and 
cook and eat, and you will then be in a fit state to speak to me, 
at an audience I will give you to-morrow." He was busily en- 
gaged in hearing the statements of a large body of fine young 
men who had fled from Kangenke, chief of Lobale, on account 
of his selling their relatives to the native Portuguese who fre- 
quent his country. Katema is a tall man, about forty years of 
age, and his head was ornamented with a helmet of beads and 
feathers. He had on a snuff-brown coat, with a broad band of 
tinsel down the arms, and carried in Ins hand a large tail made 
of the caudal extremities of a number of gnus. Tins has charms 
attached to it, and he continued waving it in front of himself, all 
the time we were there. He seemed in good spirits, laughing 
heartily several times. This is a good sign, for a man who shakes 



320 INTEKVIEW WITH KATEMA. Chap. XVII. 

his sides with mirth, is seldom difficult to deal with. When we 
rose to take leave, all rose with us, as at Shinte's. 

Returning next morning, Katenia addressed me thus — "I 
am the great Moene (lord) Katema, the fellow of Matiamvo. 
There is no one in this country equal to Matiamvo and me. I 
have always lived here, and my forefathers too. There is the 
house in which my father lived. You found no human skulls 
near the place where you are encamped. I never killed any 
of the traders ; they all come to me. I am the great Moene 
Katema, of whom you have heard." He looked as if he had 
fallen asleep tipsy, and dreamed of his greatness. On explain- 
ing my objects to him, he promptly pointed out three men who 
would be our guides, and explained that the N.W. path was 
the most direct, and that by which all traders came, but that 
the water at present standing on the plains would reach up to 
the loins ; he would therefore send us by a more northerly route, 
which no trader had yet traversed. Tins was more suited to our 
wishes, for we never found a path safe that had been trodden by 
slave-traders. 

We presented a few articles, which pleased him highly; a 
small shawl, a razor, three bunches of beads, some buttons, and 
a powder-horn. Apologising for the insignificance of the gift, 
I wished to know what I could bring him from Loanda, saying 
not a large thing, but something small. He laughed heartily 
at the limitation, and replied, " Everything of the white people 
would be acceptable, and he would receive anything thankfully ; 
but the coat he had then on was old, and he would like 
another." I introduced the subject of the Bible, but one of 
the old councillors broke in, told all he had picked up from 
the Mambari, and glided off into several other subjects. It 
is a misery to speak through an interpreter, as I was now 
forced to do. With a body of men like mine, composed as 
they were of six different tribes, and all speaking the lan- 
guage of the Bechuanas, there was no difficulty in communi- 
cating on common subjects with any tribe we came to; but 
doling out a story in which they felt no interest, and winch I 
understood only sufficiently well to perceive that a mere abridg- 
ment was given, was uncommonly slow work. Neither could 
Katema's attention be arrested, except by compliments, of winch 



Chap. XVII. CATTLE— A FEAST. 321 

they have always plenty to bestow as well as receive. We were 
strangers, and knew that, as Makololo, we had not the best of 
characters, yet his treatment of us was wonderfully good and 
liberal. 

I complimented him on the possession of cattle, and pleased 
him by telling him how he might milk the cows. He has a 
herd of about thirty, really splendid animals, all reared from 
two which he bought from the Balobale when he was young. 
They are generally of a white colour and are quite wild, running 
off with graceful ease like a herd of elands on the approach of 
a stranger. They excited the unbounded admiration of the 
Makololo, and clearly proved that the country was well adapted 
for them. When Katema wishes to slaughter one, he is obliged 
to shoot it as if it were a buffalo. Matiamvo is said to possess a 
herd of cattle in a similar state. I never could feel certain as 
to the reason why they do not all possess cattle in a country 
containing such splendid pasturage. 

As Katema did not offer an ox, as would have been done by 
a Makololo or Caffre chief, we slaughtered one of our own, and 
all of us were delighted to get a meal of meat, after subsisting 
so long on the light porridge and green maize of Londa. On 
occasions of slaughtering an animal, some pieces of it are in the 
fire before the skin is all removed from the body. A frying-pan 
full of these pieces having been got quickly ready, my men 
crowded about their father, and I handed some all round. It 
was a strange sight to the Balonda, who were looking on, 
wondering. I offered portions to them too, but these were 
declined, though they are excessively fond of a little animal 
food, to eat with their vegetable diet. They would not eat 
with us, but they would take the meat and cook it in their own 
way, and then use it. I thought at one time that they had 
imported something from the Mahometans, and the more espe- 
cially as an exclamation of surprise, " Allah," sounds like the 
Illah of the Arabs ; but we found, a little farther on, another 
form of salutation, of Christian (?) origin, "Ave-rie" (Ave 
Marie). The salutations probably travel farther than the faith. 
My people, when satisfied with a meal like that which they enjoy 
so often at home, amused themselves by an uproarious dance. 
Katema sent to ask what I had given them to produce so much 

Y 



322 A DIGNIFIED ANCIENT. Chap. XYII. 

excitement. Intemese replied it was their custom, and they 
meant no harm. The companion of the ox we slaughtered 
refused food for two days, and went lowing about for him con- 
tinually. He seemed inconsolable for his loss, and tried again 
and again to escape back to the Makololo country. My men 
remarked, " He thinks, they will kill me as well as my friend." 
Katema thought it the result of art, and had fears of my skill 
in medicine, and of course witchcraft. He refused to see the 
magic lantern. 

One of the affairs which had been intrusted by Shinte to 
Intemese, was the rescue of a wife, who had eloped with a young 
man belonging to Katema. As this was the only case I have 
met with in the interior, in which a fugitive was sent back to a 
chief against his own will, I am anxious to mention it. On 
Intemese claiming her as his master's wife, she protested loudly 
against it, saying, " she knew she was not going back to be a 
wife again : she was going back to be sold to the Mambari." My 
men formed many friendships with the people of Katema, and 
some of the poorer classes said in confidence, "We wish our 
children could go back with you to the Makololo country ; here 
we are all in danger of being sold." My men were of opinion 
that it was only the want of knowledge of the southern country 
which prevented an exodus of all the lower portions of Londa 
population thither. 

It is remarkable how little people living in a flat forest 
country like this, know of distant tribes. An old man, who" said 
he had been born about the same time as the late Matiamvo, 
and had been his constant companion through life, visited us ; 
and as I was sitting on some grass in front of the little gipsy 
tent mending my camp stool, I invited him to take a seat on 
the grass beside me. This was peremptorily refused : " he had 
never sat on the ground during the late chief's reign, and he 
was not going to degrade himself now." One of my men 
handed him a log of wood taken from the fire, and helped him 
out of the difficulty. When I offered him some cooked meat on 
a plate, he would not touch that either, but would take it home. 
So I humoured him by sending a servant to bear a few ounces 
of meat to the town behind him. He mentioned the Lolo 
(Lulua) as the branch of the Leeambye which flows southwards 



Chap. XVII. LAX GOVERNMENT. 323 

or S.S.E. ; but the people of Matiamvo had never gone far 
down it, as their chief had always been afraid of encountering 
a tribe who, from the description given, I could recognise as 
the Makololo. He described five rivers as falling into the Lolo, 
viz. the Lishish, Liss or Lise, Kali] erne, Ishidish, and Molong. 
None of these are large, but when they are united in the Lolo, 
they form a considerable stream. The country through which 
the Lolo flows is said to be flat, fertile, well peopled, and there 
are large patches of forest. In this report he agreed perfectly 
with the people of Matiamvo, whom we had met at Quendende's 
village. But we never could get him, or any one in this quarter, 
to draw a map on the ground, as people may readily be got to 
do in the south. 

Katema promised us the aid of some of his people as carriers, 
but his rule is not very stringent or efficient, for they refused to 
turn out for the work. They were Balobale ; and he remarked 
on their disobedience that, though he received them as fugi- 
tives, they did not feel grateful enough to obey, and if they 
continued rebellious he must drive them back whence they 
came : but there is little fear of that, as all the chiefs are exces- 
sively anxious to collect men in great numbers around them. 
These Balobale would not go, though our guide Shakatwala ran 
after some of them with a drawn sword. This degree of liberty 
to rebel was very striking to us, as it occurred in a country 
where people may be sold, and often are so disposed of when 
guilty of any crime ; and we well knew that open disobedience 
like this among the Makololo, would be punished with death 
without much ceremony. 

On Sunday, the 19th, both I and several of our party were 
seized with fever, and I could do nothing but toss about in my 
little tent, with the thermometer above 90°, though this was the 
beginning of winter, and my men made as much shade as pos- 
sible by planting branches of trees all round and over it. We 
have, for the first time in my experience in Africa, had a cold 
wind from the north. All the winds from that quarter are hot, 
and those from the south are cold, but they seldom blow from 
either direction. 

20th. — We were glad to get away, though not on account of 
any scarcity of food ; for my men, by giving small presents of 

Y 2 



324 SINGING BIRDS. Chap. XVII. 

meat as an earnest of their sincerity, formed many friendships 
with the people of Katema. We went about four or five miles 
in a N.N.W. direction, then two in a westerly one, and came 
round the small end of Lake Dilolo. It seemed, as far as we 
could at this time discern, to be like a river a quarter of a mile 
wide. It is abundantly supplied with fish and hippopotami ; the 
broad part, which we did not this time see, is about three miles 
wide, and the lake is almost seven or eight long. If it be 
thought strange that I did not go a few miles to see the broad 
part, which, according to Katema, had never been visited by 
any of the traders, it must be remembered that in consequence 
of fever I had eaten nothing for two entire days, and, instead of 
sleep, the whole of the nights were employed in incessant drink- 
ing of water, and I was now so glad to get on in the journey 
and see some of my fellow fever-patients crawling along, that I 
could not brook the delay, which astronomical observations for 
accurately determining the geographical position of this most 
interesting spot, would have occasioned. 

We observed among the people of Katema a love for singing- 
birds. One pretty little songster, named " cabazo," a species of 
canary, is kept in very neatly made cages, having traps on the 
top to entice its still free companions. On asking why they 
kept them in confinement, "Because they sing sweetly," was 
the answer. They feed them on the lotsa (Permisetum typhoi- 
deum), of which great quantities are cultivated as food for man, 
and these canaries plague the gardeners here, very much in the 
same way as our sparrows do at home. 

I was pleased to hear the long-forgotten cry of alarm of the 
canaries in the woods, and observed one warbling forth its song, 
and keeping in motion from side to side, as these birds do in the 
cage. We saw also tame pigeons ; and the Barotse, who always 
take care to exalt Santuru, reminded us that this chief had many 
doves, and kept canaries which had reddish heads when the birds 
attained maturity. Those we now see have the real canary 
colour on the breast with a tinge of green ; the back, yellowish 
green, with darker longitudinal bands meeting in the centre ; a 
narrow dark band passes from the bill over the eye and back to 
the bill again. 

The birds of song here set up quite a merry chorus in the 



Chap. XVII. SPIDEES. 325 

mornings, and abound most near the villages. Some sing as 
loudly as our thrushes, and the king-hunter {Halcyon Senegal- 
ensis) makes a clear whirring sound like that of a whistle with a 
pea in it. During the heat of the day all remain silent and 
take their siesta in the shadiest parts of the trees, but in the 
cool of the evening they again exert themselves in the produc- 
tion of pleasant melody. It is remarkable that so many song- 
birds abound where there is a general paucity of other animal 
life. As we went forward we were struck by the comparative 
absence of game and the larger kind of fowls. The rivers con- 
tain very few fish. Common flies are not troublesome as they 
are wherever milk is abundant ; they are seen in company with 
others of the same size and shape, but whose tiny feet do not 
tickle the skin, as is the case with their companions. Mosquitoes 
are seldom so numerous as to disturb the slumbers of a weary 
man. 

But though this region is free from common insect plagues, 
and from tsetse, it has others. Feeling something running 
across my forehead as I was falling asleep, I put up the hand to 
wipe it off, and was sharply stung both on the hand and head : 
the pain was very acute. On obtaining a light, we found that it 
had been inflicted by a light-coloured spider, about half an inch 
in length, and, one of the men having crushed it with his fingers, 
I had no opportunity of examining whether the pain had been 
produced by poison from a sting, or from its mandibles. No 
remedy was applied, and the pain ceased in about two hours. 
The Bechuanas believe that there is a small black spider in the 
country, whose bite is fatal. I have not met with an instance in 
which death could be traced to this insect, though a very large 
black hairy spider, an inch and a quarter long and three quarters 
of an inch broad, is frequently seen, having a process at the end 
of its front claws similar to that at the end of the scorpion's tail, 
and when the bulbous portion of it is pressed, the poison may be 
seen oozing out from the point. 

We have also spiders in the south which seize their prey by 
leaping upon it from a distance of several inches. When alarmed, 
they can spring about a foot away from the object of their own 
fear. Of this kind there are several varieties. 

A large reddish spider {Mygale) obtains its food in a different 



326 SPIDEKS. Chap. XVIT. 

manner than either patiently waiting in ambush, or by catching 
it with a bound. It runs about with great velocity in and out, 
behind and around every object, searching for what it may 
devour, and, from its size and rapid motions, excites the horror 
of every stranger. I never knew it to do any harm except 
frightening the nervous, and I believe few could look upon it 
for the first time without feeling himself in danger. It is named 
by the natives " selali," and is believed to be the maker of a 
hinged cover for its nest. You see a door, about the size of a 
shilling, lying beside a deep hole of nearly similar diameter. 
The inside of the door lying upwards, and which attracts your 
notice, is of a pure white silky substance, like paper. The outer 
side is coated over with earth, precisely like that in which the 
hole is made. If you try to lift it, you find it is fastened by a 
hinge on one side, and, if it is turned over upon the hole, it fits 
it exactly, and the earthy side being then uppermost, it is quite 
impossible to detect the situation of the nest. Unfortunately, 
this cavity for breeding is never seen, except when the owner is 
out, and has left the door open behind her. 

In some parts of the country there are great numbers of a 
large beautiful yellow-spotted spider, the webs of which are 
about a yard in diameter. The lines on which these webs are 
spun are suspended from one tree to another, and are as thick as 
coarse thread. The fibres radiate from a central point, where 
the insect waits for its prey. The webs are placed perpendicu- 
larly, and a common occurrence in walking is to get the face 
enveloped in them as a lady is in a veil. 

Another kind of spider lives in society, and forms so great a 
collection of webs placed at every angle, that the trunk of a tree 
surrounded by them cannot be seen. A piece of a hedge is 
often so hidden by this spider, that the branches are invisible. 
Another is seen on the inside of the walls of huts among the 
Makololo in great abundance. It is round in shape, spotted, 
brown in colour, and the body half an inch in diameter : the 
spread of the legs is an inch and a half. It makes a smooth 
spot for itself on the wall, covered with the above-mentioned 
white silky substance. There it is seen standing the whole day, 
and I never could ascertain how it fed. It has no web, but a 
carpet, and is a harmless, though an ugly neighbour. 



Chap. XVII. TRADITION OF LAKE DILOLO. 327 

Immediately beyond Dilolo there is a large flat about twenty 
miles in breadth. Here Shakatwala insisted on our remaining 
to get supplies of food from Katema's subjects, before entering 
the uninhabited watery plains. When asked the meaning of 
the name Dilolo, Shakatwala gave the following account of the 
formation of the lake. A female chief, called Moene (lord) Mo- 
nenga, came one evening to the village of Mosogo, a man who 
lived in the vicinity, but who had gone to hunt with his dogs. 
She asked for a supply of food, and Mosogo's wife gave her a 
sufficient quantity. Proceeding to another village standing on 
the spot now occupied by the water, she preferred the same 
demand, and was not only refused, but, when she uttered a 
threat for their niggardliness, was taunted with the question, 
" What could she do though she were thus treated?" In order 
to show what she could do she began a song, in slow time, and 
uttered her own name, Monenga-woo. As she prolonged the 
last note, the village, people, fowls, and dogs, sank into the space 
now called Dilolo. When Kasimakate, the headman of this 
village, came home and found out the catastrophe, he cast him- 
self into the lake, and is supposed to be in it still. The name is 
derived from " ilolo," despair, because this man gave up all hope 
when his family was destroyed. Monenga was put to death. 
This may be a faint tradition of the Deluge, and it is remarkable 
as the only one I have met with in this country. 

Heavy rains prevented us from crossing the plain in front 
(N.N.W.) in one day, and the constant wading among the grass 
hurt the feet of the men. There is a footpath all the way 
across, but as this is worn down beneath the level of the rest of 
the plain, it is necessarily the deepest portion, and the men, 
avoiding it, make a new walk by its side. A path, however 
narrow, is a great convenience, as any one who has travelled on 
foot in Africa will readily admit. The virtual want of it here 
caused us to make slow and painful progress. 

Ants surely are wiser than some men, for they learn by expe- 
rience. They have established themselves even on these plains, 
where water stands so long annually, as to allow the lotus, and 
other aqueous plants, to come to maturity. When all the ant 
horizon is submerged a foot deep, they manage to exist by 
ascending to little houses built of black tenacious loam on stalks 



328 SAGACITY OF ANTS. Chap. XVII. 

of grass, and placed higher than the line of inundation. This 
must have been the result of experience, for, if they had waited 
till the water actually invaded their terrestrial habitations, they 
would not have been able to procure materials for their aerial 
buarters, unless they dived down to the bottom for every mouthful 
of clay. Some of these upper chambers are about the size of a 
bean, and others as large as a man's thumb. They must have 
built in anticipation, and if so, let us humbly hope that the 
sufferers by the late inundations in France, may be possessed 
of as much common sense as the little black ants of the Dilolo 
plains.

24tfA February. — On reaching unflooded lands beyond the plain, we 
found the villages there acknowledged the authority of the chief 
named Kate'nde, and we discovered also, to our surprise, that the 
almost level plain we had passed, forms the watershed between 
the southern and northern rivers, for we had now entered a dis- 
trict in which the rivers flowed in a northerly direction into the 
Kasai or Loke, near to which we now were, while the rivers we 
had hitherto crossed were all running southwards. Having met 
with kind treatment and aid at the first village, Katema's guides 
returned, and we were led to the N.N.W. by the inhabitants, 
and descended into the very first really deep valley we had seen 
since leaving Kolobeng. A stream ran along the bottom of a 
slope of three or four hundred yards from the plains above. 

We crossed this by a rustic bridge at present submerged 
thigh deep by the rains. The trees growing along the stream 
of this lovely valley were thickly planted and very high. 
Many had sixty or eighty feet of clean straight trunk, and 
beautiful flowers adorned the ground beneath them. Ascending 
the opposite side, we came, in two hours' time, to another valley, 



330 FOUNTAINS— VILLAGE OF KABINJE. Chap. XVIII. 

equally beautiful, and with a stream also in its centre. It may 
seem mere trifling to note such an unimportant thing as the 
occurrence of a valley, there being so many in every country 
under the sun ; but as these were branches of that in which the 
Kasai or Loke flows, and both that river and its feeders derive 
their water in a singular manner from the valley sides, I may be 
excused for calling particular attention to the more furrowed 
nature of the country. 

At different points on the slopes of these valleys which we 
now for the first time entered, there are oozing fountains, sur- 
rounded by clumps of the same evergreen, straight, large-leaved 
trees we have noticed along the streams. These spots are gene- 
rally covered with a mat of grassy vegetation, and possess more 
the character of bogs than of fountains. They slowly discharge 
into the stream below, and are so numerous along both banks 
as to give a peculiar character to the landscape. These groups 
of sylvan vegetation are generally of a rounded form, and the 
trunks of the trees are tall and straight, while those on the level 
plains above are low and scraggy in their growth. There can 
be little doubt but that the water, which stands for months on 
the plains, soaks in, and finds its way into the rivers and rivulets 
by percolating through the soil, and out by these oozing bogs ; 
and the difference between the growth of the trees, though they 
be of different species, may be a proof that the stuntedness of 
those on the plains, is owing to being in the course of each year 
more subjected to drought than moisture. 

Reaching the village of Kabinje, in the evening he sent us a 
present of tobacco, Mutokuane or "bang" (Cannabis sativa), and 
maize, by the man who went forward to announce our arrival, 
and a message expressing satisfaction at the prospect of having 
trade with the coast. The westing we were making brought us 
among people who are frequently visited by the Mambari, as 
slave-dealers. This trade causes bloodshed ; for when a poor 
family is selected as the victims, it is necessary to get rid of the 
older members of it, because they are supposed to be able to give 
annoyance to the chief afterwards by means of enchantments. 
The belief in the power of charms for good or evil produces 
not only honesty, but a great amount of gentle dealing. The 
powerful are often restrained in their despotism, from a fear 



Chap. XVIII. DEMAND FOR GUNPOWDER AND CALICO. 331 

that the weak and helpless may injure them by their medical 
knowledge. They have many fears. A man at one of the 
villages we came to, showed us the grave of his child, and 
with much apparent feeling, told us she had been burned to 
death in her hut. He had come with all his family, and built 
huts around it in order to weep for her. He thought, if the 
grave were left unwatched, the witches would come and bewitch 
them by putting medicines on the body. They have a more 
decided belief in the continued existence of departed spirits than 
any of the more southerly tribes. Even the Barotse possess it 
in a strong degree, for one of my men of that tribe, on expe- 
riencing headache, said, with a sad and thoughtful countenance, 
"My father is scolding me because I do not give him any of 
the food I eat." I asked where his father was. " Among the 
Barimo," was the reply. 

When we wished to move on, Kabinje refused a guide to the 
next village, because he was at war with it; but after much 
persuasion he consented, provided that the guide should be 
allowed to return as soon as he came in sight of the enemy's 
village. This we felt to be a misfortune, as the people all sus- 
pect a man who comes telling his own tale ; but there being 
no help for it, we went on and found the headman of a village 
on the rivulet Kalomba, called Kange'nke, a very different man 
from what his enemy represented. We found too that the idea 
of buying and selling, took the place of giving for friendship. 
As I had nothing with which to purchase food except a parcel 
of beads which were preserved for worse times, I began to fear 
that we should soon be compelled to suffer more from hunger 
than we had done. The people demanded gunpowder for 
everything. If we had possessed any quantity of that article 
we should have got on well, for here it is of great value. On 
our return, near this spot we found a good-sized fowl was sold 
for a single charge of gunpowder. Next to that, English calico 
was in great demand, and so were beads ; but money was of no 
value whatever. Gold is quite unknown ; it is thought to be 
brass ; trade is carried on by barter alone. The people know 
nothing of money. A purse-proud person would here feel the 
ground move from beneath his feet. Occasionally a large piece 
of copper, in the shape of a St. Andrew's cross, is offered for sale. 



332 VEXATIOUS TRICK. Chap. XVIII. 

21th February. — Kangenke promptly furnished guides this 
morning, so we went briskly on a short distance, and came to 
a part of the Kasye, Kasai, or Loke, where he had appointed 
two canoes to convey us across. This is a most beautiful river, 
and very much like the Clyde in Scotland. The slope of the 
valley down to the stream is about five hundred yards, and 
finely wooded. It is, perhaps, one hundred yards broad, and 
was winding slowly from side to side in the beautiful green 
glen, in a course to the north and north-east. In both the 
directions from which it came and to which it went, it seemed 
to be alternately embowered in sylvan vegetation, or rich 
meadows covered with tall grass. The men pointed out its 
course and said, " Though you sail along it for months, you 
will turn without seeing the end of it." 

While at the ford of the Kasai, we were subjected to a trick 
of which we had been forewarned by the people of Shinte. A 
knife had been dropped by one of Kangenke's people in order 
to entrap my men ; it was put down near our encampment, as 
if lost, the owner in the mean time watching till one of my 
men picked it up. Nothing was said until our party was 
divided, one half on this, and the other on that bank of the 
river. Then the charge was made to me that one of my men 
had stolen a knife. Certain of my people's honesty, I desired 
the man, who was making a great noise, to search the luggage 
for it ; the unlucky lad who had taken the bait, then came 
forward and confessed that he had the knife in a basket, which 
was already taken over the river. When it was returned, the 
owner would not receive it back unless accompanied with a fine. 
The lad offered beads, but these were refused with scorn. A 
shell hanging round his neck, similar to that which Shinte had 
given me, was the object demanded, and the victim of the trick, 
as we all knew it to be, was obliged to part with his costly orna- 
ment. I could not save him from the loss, as all had been fore- 
warned ; and it is the universal custom among the Makololo, 
and many other tribes, to show whatever they may find to the 
chief person of their company, and make a sort of offer of it to 
him. This lad ought to have done so to me ; the rest of the 
party always observed this custom. I felt annoyed at the impo- 
sition, but the order we invariably followed in crossing a river 



Chap. XVIII; WANT OF FOOD. 333 

forced me to submit. The head of the party remained to be 
ferried over last ; so, if I had not come to terms, I would have 
been, as I always was in crossing rivers which we could not 
swim, completely in the power of the enemy. It was but rarely 
we could get a headman so witless as to cross a river with us, 
and remain on the opposite bank in a convenient position to be 
seized as a hostage, in case of my being caught. 

This trick is but one of a number equally dishonourable which 
are practised by tribes that lie adjacent to the more civilised 
settlements. The Balonda farther east told us, by way of 
warning, that many parties of the more central tribes had at 
various periods set out, in order to trade with the white men 
themselves, instead of through the Mambari, but had always 
been obliged to return without reaching their destination, in 
consequence of so many pretexts being invented by the tribes 
encountered in the way, for fining them of their ivory. 

This ford was in 11° 15' 47" S. latitude, but the weather was 
so excessively cloudy, we got no observation for longitude. 

We were now in want of food, for, to the great surprise of my 
companions, the people of Kangenke gave nothing except by 
way of sale, and charged the most exorbitant prices for the little 
meal and manioc they brought. The only article of barter my 
men had, was a little fat saved from the ox we slaughtered at 
Katema's, so I was obliged to give them a portion of the stock 
of beads. One day (29th) of westing brought us from the Kasai 
to near the village of Katende, and we saw that we were in a 
land where no hope could be entertained of getting supplies of 
animal food, for one of our guides caught a light-blue coloured 
mole and two mice for his supper. The care with which he 
wrapped them up in a leaf and slung them on his spear, told that 
we could not hope to enjoy any larger game. We saw no evi- 
dence of any animals besides ; and, on coming to the villages 
beyond this, we often saw boys and girls engaged in digging up 
these tiny quadrupeds. 

Katende sent for me on the day following our arrival, and, 
being quite willing to visit him, I walked, for this purpose, 
about three miles from our encampment. When we approached 
the village we were desired to enter a hut, and, as it was raining 
at the time, we did so. After a long time spent in giving and 



334 A GRAVE OFFENCE. Chap. XVIII. 

receiving messages from the great man, we were told that he 
wanted either a man, a tusk, beads, copper rings, or a shell, as 
payment for leave to pass through his country. No one, we 
were assured, was allowed that liberty, or even to behold him, 
without something of the sort being presented. Having humbly 
explained our circumstances, and that he could not expect to 
" catch a humble cow by the horns," — a proverb similar to ours 
that " you can't draw milk out of a stone " — we were told to go 
home, and he would speak again to us next day. I could not 
avoid a hearty laugh at the cool impudence of the savage, and 
made the best of my way home in the still-pouring rain. My 
men were rather nettled at this want of hospitality, but, after 
talking over the matter with one of Katende's servants, he pro- 
posed that some small article should be given, and an attempt 
made to please Katende. I turned out my shirts, and selected 
the worst one as a sop for him, and invited Katende to come and 
choose anything else I had, but added that, when I should reach 
my own chief naked, and was asked what I had done with my 
clothes, I should be obliged to confess that I had left them with 
Katende. The shirt was despatched to him, and some of my 
people went along with the servant ; they soon returned, saying 
that the shirt had been accepted, and guides and food too would 
be sent to us next day. The chief had, moreover, expressed a 
hope to see me on my return. He is reported to be very cor- 
pulent. The traders who have come here seem to have been 
very timid, yielding to every demand made on the most frivolous 
pretences. One of my men, seeing another much like an ac- 
quaintance at home, addressed him by the name of the latter in 
sport, telling him at the same time why he did so ; this was 
pronounced to be a grave offence, and a large fine demanded ; 
when the case came before me I could see no harm in what had 
been done, and told my people not to answer the young fellow. 
The latter felt himself disarmed, for it is chiefly in a brawl they 
have power ; then words are spoken in anger, which rouse the 
passions of the complainant's friends. In this case, after voci- 
ferating some time, the would-be offended party came and said 
to my man, that, if they exchanged some small gift, all would be 
right, but, my man taking no notice of him, he went off rather 
crestfallen. 



Chap. XVIII. GKEEDY GUIDES. 335 

My men were as much astonished as" myself at the demand for 
payment for leave to pass, and the almost entire neglect of the 
rules of hospitality. Katende gave us only a little meal and 
manioc, and a fowl. Being detained two days by heavy rains, 
we felt that a good stock of patience was necessary in travelling 
through this country in the rainy season. 

Passing onwards without seeing Katende, we crossed a small 
rivulet, the Sengko, by which we had encamped, and after two 
hours came to another, the Totelo, which was somewhat larger, 
and had a bridge over it. At the further end of this structure 
stood a negro, who demanded fees. He said the bridge was his ; 
the path his ; the guides were his children ; and if we did not 
pay him, he would prevent farther progress. This piece of 
civilization I was not prepared to meet, and stood a few seconds 
looking at our bold toll-keeper, when one of my men took off 
three copper bracelets, which paid for the whole party. The 
negro was a better man than he at first seemed, for he imme- 
diately went to his garden and brought us some leaves of tobacco 
as a present. 

When we had got fairly away from the villages, the guides 
from Kangenke sat down and told us that there were three paths 
in front, and, if we did not at once present them with a cloth, 
they would leave us to take whichever we might like best. As 
I had pointed out the direction in which Loanda lay, and had 
only employed them for the sake of knowing the paths between 
villages which lay along our route, and always objected when 
they led us in any other than the Loanda direction, I wished my 
men now to go on without the guides, trusting to ourselves to 
choose the path which would seem to lead us in the direction we 
had always followed. But Mashauana, fearing lest we might 
wander, asked leave to give his own cloth, and when the guides 
saw that, they came forward shouting, " Averie, Averie ! " 

In the afternoon of this day we came to a valley about a mile 
wide, filled with clear fast-flowing water. The men on foot were 
chin deep in crossing, and we three on oxback got wet to the 
middle, the weight on the animals preventing them from swim- 
ming. A thunder-shower descending, completed the partial 
drenching of the plain, and gave a cold uncomfortable " packing 
in a wet blanket" that night. Next day we found another 



336 FLOODED VALLEYS. Chap. XVIII. 

flooded valley about half a mile wide, with a small and now deep 
rivulet in its middle, flowing rapidly to the S.S.E. or towards 
the Kasai. The middle part of this flood, being the bed of what 
at other times is the rivulet, was so rapid that we crossed by 
holding on to the oxen, and the current soon dashed them to the 
opposite bank ; we then jumped off, and, the oxen being relieved 
of their burdens, we could pull them on to the shallower part. 
The rest of the valley was thigh deep and boggy, but holding on 
by the belt which fastened the blanket to the ox, we each floun- 
dered through the nasty slough as well as we could. These 
boggy parts, lying parallel to the stream, were the most extensive 
we had come to — those mentioned already were mere circum- 
scribed patches, these stretched for miles along each bank ; but 
even here, though the rapidity of the current was very consider- 
able, the thick sward of grass was " laid " flat along the sides 
of the stream, and the soil was not abraded so much as to dis- 
colour the flood. When we came to the opposite side of this 
valley, some pieces of the ferruginous conglomerate, which forms 
the capping to all other rocks in a large district around and 
north of this, cropped out, and the oxen bit at them as if sur- 
prised by the appearance of stone as much as we were ; or it may 
have contained some mineral of which they stood in need. We 
had not met with a stone since leaving Shinte's. The country 
is covered with deep alluvial soil of a dark colour and very 
fertile. 

In the afternoon we came to another stream, nuana Loke (or 
child of Loke) with a bridge over it. The men had to swim off 
to each end of the bridge, and when on it were breast deep ; 
some preferred holding on by the tails of the oxen the whole 
way across. I intended to do this too, but, riding to the deep 
part, before I could dismount and seize the helm the ox dashed 
off with his companions, and his body sank so deep, that I failed 
in my attempt even to catch the blanket belt, and if I pulled 
the bridle, the ox seemed as if he would come backwards upon 
me, so I struck out for the opposite bank alone. My poor fellows 
were dreadfully alarmed •when they saw me parted from the 
cattle, and about twenty of them made a simultaneous rush into 
the water for my rescue, and just as I reached the opposite bank 
one seized my arm, and another threw his around my body. 



Chap. XVIII. UNCULTIVATED VALLEYS. 337 

When I stood up, it was most gratifying to see them all 
struggling towards me. Some had leaped off the bridge, and 
allowed their cloaks to float down the stream. Part of my 
goods, abandoned in the hurry, were brought up from the 
bottom after I was safe. Great was the pleasure expressed when 
they found that I could swim like themselves, without the aid 
of a tail, and I did, and do feel grateful to these poor heathens 
for the promptitude with which they dashed in to save, as they 
thought, my life. I found my clothes cumbersome in the water ; 
they could swim quicker from being naked. They swim like 
dogs, not frog-fashion, as we do. 

In the evening we crossed the small rivulet Lozeze, and came 
to some villages of the Kasabi, from whom we got some manioc 
in exchange for beads. They tried to frighten us by telling of 
the deep rivers we should have to cross in our way. I was 
drying my clothes by turning myself round and round before the 
fire. My men laughed at the idea of being frightened by rivers. 
"We can all swim : who carried the white man across the river 
but himself ? " I felt proud of their praise. 

Saturday, 4th March. — Came to the outskirts of the territory 
of the Chiboque. We crossed the Konde and Kaliize rivulets. 
The former is a deep small stream with a bridge, -the latter in- 
significant ; the valleys in which these rivulets run are beautifully 
fertile. My companions are continually lamenting over the un- 
cultivated vales, in such words as these, — " What a fine country 
for cattle ! My heart is sore to see such fruitful valleys for corn 
lying waste ! " At the time these words were put down, I had 
come to the belief that the reason why the inhabitants of this 
fine country possess no herds of cattle, was owing to the despotic 
sway of their chiefs, and that the common people would not be 
allowed to keep any domestic animals, even supposing they 
could acquire them ; but on musing on the subject since, I have 
been led to the conjecture that the rich fertile country of Londa, 
must formerly have been infested by the tsetse, but that, as the 
people killed off the game on which, in the absence of man, the 
tsetse must subsist, the insect was starved out of the country. 
It is now found only where wild animals abound, and the Ba- 
londa, by the possession of guns, having cleared most of the 
country of all the large game, we may have happened to come 

z 



338 DIFFERENCE IN COLOUR OF AFRICANS. Chap. XVIII. 

just when it was possible to admit of cattle. Hence the success 
of Katema, Shinte, and Matiamvo with their herds. It would 
not be surprising, though they know nothing of the circum- 
stance ; a tribe on the Zambesi, which I encountered, whose 
country was swarming with tsetse, believed that they could not 
keep any cattle because " no one loved them well enough to 
give them the medicine of oxen ;" and even the Portuguese at 
Loanda accounted for the death of the cattle brought from the 
interior to the sea-coast, by the prejudicial influence of the sea 
air ! One ox which I took down to the sea from the interior, 
died at Loanda, with all the symptoms of the poison injected by 
tsetse, which I saw myself, in a district a hundred miles from 
the coast. 

While at the villages of the Kasabi, we saw no evidence of 
want of food among the people. Our beads were very valuable, 
but cotton cloth would have been still more so ; as we tra- 
velled along, men, women, and children came running after us, 
with meal and fowls for sale, which we would gladly have pur- 
chased had we possessed any English manufactures. When 
they heard that we had no cloth, they turned back much dis- 
appointed. 

The amount of population in the central parts of the country 
may be called large, only as compared with the Cape Colony or 
the Bechuana country. The cultivated land is as nothing com- 
pared with what might be brought under the plough. There 
are flowing streams in abundance, which, were it necessary, 
could be turned to the purpose of irrigation with but little 
labour. Miles of fruitful country are now lying absolutely waste, 
for there is not even game to eat off the fine pasturage, and to 
recline under the evergreen shady groves which we are ever 
passing in our progress. The people who inhabit the central 
region are not all quite black in colour. Many incline to that 
of bronze, and others are as light in hue as the Bushmen ; who, 
it may be remembered, afford a proof that heat alone does not 
cause blackness, but that heat and moisture combined, do very 
materially deepen the colour. Wherever we find people who 
have continued for ages in a hot humid district, they are deep 
black, but to this apparent law there are exceptions, caused by 
the migrations of both tribes and individuals ; the Makololo for 



Chap. XVIII. AFKICAN DIALECTS. 339 

instance, among the tribes of the humid central basin, appear of 
a sickly sallow hue, when compared with the aboriginal inha- 
bitants ; the Batoka also, who lived in an elevated region, are, 
when seen in company with the Batoka of the rivers, so much 
lighter in colour, they might be taken for another tribe ; but their 
language, and the very marked custom of knocking out the upper 
front teeth, leave no room for doubt that they are one people. 

Apart from the influences of elevation, heat, humidity, and 
degradation, I have imagined that the lighter and darker 
colours observed in the native population, run in five longi- 
tudinal bands along the southern portion of the continent. 
Those on the seaboard of both the east and west are very dark ; 
then two bands of lighter colour lie about three hundred miles 
from each coast, of which the westerly one, bending round, em- 
braces the Kalahari Desert and Bechuana countries ; and then 
the central basin is very dark again. This opinion is not given 
with any degree of positiveness. It is stated just as it struck 
my mind in passing across the country, and if incorrect, it is 
singular that the dialects spoken by the different tribes, have 
arranged themselves in a fashion which seems to indicate migra- 
tion along the lines of colour. The dialects spoken in the ex- 
treme south, whether Hottentot or Caffre, bear a close affinity 
to those of the tribes living immediately on their northern 
borders : one glides into the other, and their affinities are so 
easily detected, that they are at once recognised to be cognate. 
If the dialects of extreme points are compared, as that of the 
Caffres and the tribes near the Equator, it is more difficult to 
recognise the fact, which is really the case, that all the dialects 
belong to but two families of languages. Examination of the 
roots of the words of the dialects, arranged in geographical 
order, shows that they merge into each other, and there is not 
nearly so much difference between the extremes of east and 
west as between those of north and south ; the dialect spoken at 
Tete resembling closely that in Angola. 

Having, on the afore-mentioned date, reached the village of 
Njambi, one of the chiefs of the Chiboque, we intended to pass a 
quiet Sunday ; and our provisions being quite spent, I ordered a 
tired riding-ox to be slaughtered. As we wished to be on good 
terms with all, we sent the hump and ribs to Njambi, with the 

z 2 



340 OUK ENCAMPMENT SUREOUNDED. Chap. XVIII. 

explanation that this was the customary tribute to chiefs in the 
part from which we had come, and that we always honoured men 
in his position. He returned thanks, and promised to send food. 
Next morning he sent an impudent message, with a very small 
present of meal ; scorning the meat he had accepted, he de- 
manded either a man, an ox, a gun, powder, cloth, or a shell ; 
and in the event of refusal to comply with his demand, he inti- 
mated his intention to prevent our further progress. We replied, 
we should have thought ourselves fools if we had scorned his 
small present, and demanded other food instead; and even sup- 
posing we had possessed the articles named, no black man ought 
to impose a tribute on a party that did not trade in slaves. The 
servants who brought the message said that, when sent to the 
Mambari, they had always got a quantity of cloth from them for 
their master, and now expected the same, or something else as 
an equivalent, from me. 

We heard some of the Chiboque remark, " They have only five 
guns ;" and about mid-day, Njainbi collected all his people, and 
surrounded our encampment. Their object was evidently to 
plunder us of everything. My men seized their javelins, and 
stood on the defensive, while the young Chiboque had drawn 
their swords and brandished them with great fury. Some even 
pointed their guns at me, and nodded to each other, as much as 
to say, " This is the way we shall do with him." I sat on my 
camp-stool, with my double-barrelled gun across my knees, and 
invited the chief to be seated also. When he and his counsellors 
had sat down on the ground in front of me, I asked what crime 
we had committed that he had come armed in that way. He 
replied that one of my men, Pitsane, while sitting at the fire 
that morning, had, in spitting, allowed a small quantity of the 
saliva to fall on the leg of one of his men, and this " guilt " he 
wanted to be settled by the fine of a man, ox, or gun. Pitsane 
admitted the fact of a little saliva having fallen on the Chiboque, 
and in proof of its being a pure accident, mentioned that he had 
given the man a piece of meat, by way of making friends, just 
before it happened, and wiped it off with his hand as soon as it 
fell. In reference to a man being given, I declared that we were 
all ready to die rather than give up one of our number to be a 
slave ; that my men might as well give me as I give one of them, 



Chap. XVIII. PEOSPECTS OF A FIGHT. 341 

for we were all free men. " Then you can give the gun with 
which the ox was shot." As we heard some of his people re- 
marking even now that we had only " five guns," we declined, 
on the ground that, as they were intent on plundering us, giving 
a gun would be helping them to do so. 

This they denied, saying they wanted the customary tribute 
only. I asked what right they had to demand payment for leave 
to tread on the ground of God, our common Father ? If we trod 
on their gardens we would pay, but not for marching on land 
which was still God's and not theirs. They did not attempt to 
controvert this, because it is in accordance with their own ideas, 
but reverted again to the pretended crime of the saliva. 

My men now entreated me to give something ; and after asking 
the chief if he really thought the affair of the spitting a matter 
of guilt, and receiving an answer in the affirmative, I gave him 
one of my shirts. The young Chiboque were dissatisfied, and 
began shouting and brandishing their swords for a greater fine. 

As Pitsane felt that he had been the cause of this disagreeable 
affair, he asked me to add something else. I gave a bunch of 
beads, but the counsellors objected this time, so I added a large 
handkerchief. The more I yielded, the more unreasonable their 
demands became, and at every fresh demand, a shout was raised 
by the armed party, and a rush made around us with brandishing 
of arms. One young man made a charge at my head from be- 
hind, but I quickly brought round the muzzle of my gun to his 
mouth, and he retreated. I pointed him out to the chief, and he 
ordered him to retire a little. I felt anxious to avoid the effusion 
of blood ; and though sure of being able with my Makololo, who 
had been drilled by Sebituane, to drive off twice the number of 
our assailants, though now a large body, and well armed with 
spears, swords, arrows, and guns, I strove to avoid actual col- 
lision. My men were quite unprepared for this exhibition, but 
behaved with admirable coolness. The chief and counsellors, by 
accepting my invitation to be seated, had placed themselves in 
a trap ; for my men very quietly surrounded them, and made 
them feel that there was no chance of escaping their spears. I 
then said, that, as one thing after another had failed to satisfy 
them, it was evident that they wanted to fight, while we only 
wanted to pass peaceably through the country ; that they must 



342 THE FIGHT AVERTED. Chap. XVIII. 

begin first and bear the guilt before God : we would not fight 
till they had struck the first blow. I then sat silent for some 
time. It was rather trying for me, because I knew that the Chi- 
boque would aim at the white man first ; but I was careful not to 
appear flurried, and, having four barrels ready for instant action, 
looked quietly at the savage scene around. The Chiboque coun- 
tenance, by no means handsome, is not improved by the practice 
winch they have adopted of filing the teeth to a point. The 
chief and counsellors, seeing that they were in more danger than 
I, did not choose to follow our decision that they should begin by 
striking the first blow, and then see what we could do ; and were 
perhaps influenced by seeing the air of cool preparation, which 
some of my men displayed, at the prospect of a work of blood. 

The Chiboque at last put the matter before us in tins way : 
'• You come among us in a new way, and say you are quite 
friendly : how can we know it unless you give us some of your 
food, and you take some of ours ? If you give us an ox we 
will give you whatever you may wish, and then we shall be 
friends." In accordance with the entreaties of my men I gave 
an ox ; and when asked what I should like in return, mentioned 
food, as the thing which we most needed. In the evening 
Njambi sent a very small basket of meal, and two or three 
pounds of the flesh of our own ox ! with the apology that he 
had no fowls, and very little of any other food. It was impos- 
sible to avoid a laugh at the coolness of the generous creatures. 
I was truly thankful nevertheless that, though resolved to die 
rather than deliver up one of our number to be a slave, we had 
so far gained our point as to be allowed to pass on without 
having shed human blood. 

In the midst of the commotion, several Chiboque stole pieces 
of meat out of the sheds of my people, and Mohorisi, one of the 
Makololo, went boldly into the crowd and took back a marrow- 
bone from one of them. A few of my Batoka seemed afraid, 
and would perhaps have fled had the affray actually begun, 
but upon the whole I thought my men behaved admirably. 
They lamented having left their shields at home by command 
of Sekeletu, who feared that, if they carried these, they might 
be more disposed to be overbearing in their demeanour to the 
tribes we should meet. We had proceeded on the principles 



Chap. XVIIT. CHANGE OF PATH. 343 

of peace and conciliation, and the foregoing treatment shows 
in what light our conduct was viewed : in fact, we were taken 
for interlopers trying to cheat the revenue of the tribe. They 
had been accustomed to get a slave or two from every slave- 
trader who passed them, and now that we disputed the right, 
they viewed the infringement on what they considered lawfully 
due, with most virtuous indignation. 

March 6th. — We were informed that the people on the west 
of the Chiboque of Njambi were familiar with the visits of slave- 
traders ; and it was the opinion of our guides from Kangenke, 
that so many of my companions would be demanded from me, 
in the same manner as the people of Njambi had done, that I 
should reach the coast without a single attendant ; I therefore 
resolved to alter our course and strike away to the N.N.E., in 
the hope that at some point farther north I might find an exit to 
the Portuguese settlement of Cassange. We proceeded at first 
due north, with the Kasabi villages on our right, and the Kasau 
on our left. During the first twenty miles we crossed many 
small, but now swollen streams, having the usual boggy banks, 
and wherever the water had stood for any length of time, it was 
discoloured with rust of iron. We saw a "nakong" antelope 
one day, a rare sight in this quarter ; and many new and pretty 
flowers adorned the valleys. We could observe the difference 
in the seasons in our northing in company with the sun. 
Summer was now nearly over at Kuruman, and far advanced 
at Linyanti, but here we were in the middle of it ; fruits, 
which we had eaten ripe on the Leeambye, were here quite 
green ; but we were coming into the region where the inha- 
bitants are favoured with two rainy seasons and two crops, i.e. 
when the sun is going south, and when he comes back on his 
way to the north, as was the case at present. 

On the 8th, one of the men had left an ounce or two of 
powder at our sleeping-place, and went back several miles for 
it. My clothing being wet from crossing a stream, I was com- 
pelled to wait for him ; had I been moving in the sun I should 
have felt no harm, but the inaction led to a violent fit of fever. 
The continuance of this attack was a source of much regret, for 
we went on next day to a small rivulet called Chihune, in a 
lovely valley, and had, for a wonder, a clear sky and a clear 



344 INSTINCT OF TREES. Chap. XVIII. 

moon; but such was the confusion produced in my mind by 
the state of my body, that I could scarcely manage, after some 
hours' trial, to get a lunar observation in which I could repose 
confidence. The Chihune flows into the Longe, and that into 
the Chihombo, a feeder of the Kasai. Those who know the 
difficulties of taking altitudes, times, and distances, and com- 
mitting all of them to paper, will sympathise with me in this 
and many similar instances. Whilst at Chihune, the men of a 
village brought wax for sale, and, on finding that we wished 
honey, went off and soon brought a hive. All the bees in the 
country are in possession of the natives, for they place hives 
sufficient for them all. After having ascertained this, we never 
attended the call of the honey-guide, for we were sure it would 
only lead us to a hive which we had no right to touch. The 
bird continues its habit of inviting attention to the honey, 
though its services in this district are never actually needed. 
My Makololo lamented that they never knew before that wax 
could be sold for anything of value. 

As we traverse a succession of open lawns and deep forests, 
it is interesting to observe something like instinct developed 
even in trees. One which, when cut, emits a milky juice, if 
met with on the open lawns, grows as an ordinary umbrageous 
tree, and shows no disposition to be a climber ; when planted 
in a forest it still takes the same form, then sends out a 
climbing branch, which twines round another tree until it rises 
thirty or forty feet, or to the level of the other trees, and there 
spreads out a second crown where it can enjoy a fair share of 
the sun's rays. In parts of the forest still more dense than this, 
it assumes the form of a climber only, and at once avails itself 
of the assistance of a tall neighbour by winding vigorously 
round it, without attempting to form a lower head. It does 
not succeed so well as parasites proper, but where forced to 
contend for space, it may be mistaken for one which is inva- 
riably a climber. The paths here were very narrow and very 
much encumbered with gigantic creepers, often as thick as a 
man's leg. There must be some reason why they prefer, in 
some districts, to go up trees in the common form of the thread 
of a screw, rather than in any other. On the one bank of the 
Chihune they appeared to a person standing opposite them to 



Chap. XVIII. ABSENCE OF THORNS IN FOREST. 345 

wind up from left to right, on the other bank from right to left. 
I imagined this was owing to the sun being at one season of 
the year on their north, and at another on their south. But 
on the Leeambye, I observed creepers winding up on opposite 
sides of the same reed, and making a figure like the lacings of 
a sandal. 

In passing through these narrow paths, I had an opportunity 
of observing the peculiarities of my ox "Sinbad." He had a 
softer back than the others, but a much more intractable temper. 
His horns were bent downwards and hung loosely, so he could 
do no harm with them ; but as we wended our way slowly along 
the narrow path, he would suddenly dart aside. A string tied 
to a stick put through the cartilage of the nose serves instead 
of a bridle : if you jerk this back, it makes him run faster on ; 
if you pull it to one side, he allows the nose and head to go, 
but keeps the opposite eye directed to the forbidden spot, and 
goes in spite of you. The only way he can be brought to a 
stand is by a stroke with a wand across the nose. When Sinbad 
ran in below a climber stretched over the path, so low that I 
could not stoop under it, I was dragged off and came down on 
the crown of my head ; and he never allowed an opportunity of 
the kind to pass without trying to inflict a kick, as if I neither 
had nor deserved his love. 

A remarkable peculiarity in the forests of this country is the 
absence of thorns ; there are but two exceptions — one a tree 
bearing a species of nux vomica, and a small shrub very like the 
plant of the sarsaparilla, bearing in addition to its hooked thorns 
bunches of yellow berries. The thornlessness of the vegetation 
is especially noticeable to those who have been in the south, 
where there is so great a variety of thorn-bearing plants and 
trees. We have thorns of every size and shape ; thorns straight, 
thin and long, short and thick, or hooked, and so strong as to be 
able to cut even leather like a knife. Seed-vessels are scattered 
everywhere by these appendages. One lies flat as a shilling, 
with two thorns in its centre, ready to run into the foot of any 
animal that treads upon it, and stick there for days together. 
Another (the Uncaria procumbens, or grapple-plant) has so many 
hooked thorns as to cling most tenaciously to any animal to 
which it may become attached ; when it happens to lay hold of 



346 



PLANT OF FOKSAKEN GAEDENS. Chap. XVIII. 



the mouth of an ox, the animal stands and roars with pain and 
a sense of helplessness. 




Seed-vessel of the " grapple-plant." 

Wherever a part of the forest has been cleared for a garden, 
and afterwards abandoned, a species of plant with leaves like 
those of ginger springs up, and contends for the possession of 
the soil with a great crop of ferns. This is the case all the way 
down to Angola, and shows the great difference of climate be- 
tween this and the Bechuana country, where a fern, except one 
or two hardy species, is never seen. The plants above men- 
tioned bear a pretty pink flower close to the ground, which is 
succeeded by a scarlet fruit full of seeds, yielding, as so many 
fruits in this country do, a pleasant acid juice, which like the 
rest is probably intended as a corrective to the fluids of the 
system in the hot climate. 

On leaving the Chihune we crossed the Longe, and, as the 
day was cloudy, our guides wandered in a forest away to the 
west till we came to the river Chihombo, flowing to the E.N.E. 
My men depended so much on the sun for guidance that, having 
seen nothing of the luminary all day, they thought we had wan- 
dered back to the Chiboque, and, as often happens when be- 
wildered, they disputed as to the point where the sun should 
rise next morning. As soon as the rains would allow next day, 
we went off to the N.E. It would have been better to have 
travelled by compass alone, for the guides took advantage of any 



Chap. XVIII. INSUBORDINATION SUPPRESSED. 347 

fears expressed by my people, and threatened to return if pre- 
sents were not made at once. But my men had never left their 
own country before, except for rapine and murder. When they 
formerly came to a village they were in the habit of killing 
numbers of the inhabitants, and then taking a few young men 
to serve as guides to the next place. As this was their first 
attempt at an opposite line of conduct, and as they were without 
their shields, they felt defenceless among the greedy Chiboque, 
and some allowance must be made for them on that account. 

Saturday, 11th. — Beached a small village on the banks of a 
narrow stream. I was too ill to go out of my little covering, 
except to quell a mutiny which began to show itself among 
some of the Batoka and Ambonda of our party. They grumbled, 
as they often do against their chiefs, when they think them 
partial in their gifts, because they supposed that I had shown 
a preference in the distribution of the beads ; but the beads I 
had given to my principal men were only sufficient to purchase 
a scanty meal, and I had hastened on to this village in order to 
slaughter a tired ox, and give them all a feast as well as a rest 
on Sunday, as preparation for the journey before us. I explained 
this to them, and thought their grumbling was allayed. I soon 
sank into a state of stupor, winch the fever sometimes produced, 
and was oblivious to all their noise in slaughtering. On Sunday 
the mutineers were making a terrible din in preparing a skin 
they had procured. I requested them twice, by the man who 
attended me, to be more quiet, as the noise pained me : but as 
they paid no attention to this civil request, I put out my head, 
and, repeating it myself, was answered by an impudent laugh. 
Knowing that discipline would be at an end if this mutiny were 
not quelled, and that our lives depended on vigorously uphold- 
ing authority, I seized a double-barrelled pistol, and darted forth 
from the domicile, looking, I suppose, so savage as to put them 
to a precipitate flight. As some remained within hearing, I 
told them that I must maintain discipline, though at the expense 
of some of their limbs ; so long as we travelled together they 
must remember that I was master, and not they. There being 
but little room to doubt my determination, they immediately 
became very obedient, and never afterwards gave me any 
trouble, or imagined that they had any right to my property. 



348 DEMANDS OF THE CHIBOQUE. Chap. XVIII. 

13^. — We went forward some miles, but were brought to a 
stand by the severity of my fever on the banks of a branch of 
the Loajima, another tributary of the Kasai. I was in a state of 
partial coma until late at night, when it became necessary for 
me to go out ; and I was surprised to find that my men had 
built a little stockade, and some of them took their spears and 
acted as a guard. I found that we were surrounded by enemies, 
and a party of Chiboque lay near the gateway, after having pre- 
ferred the demand of " a man, an ox, a gun, or a tusk." My 
men had prepared for defence in case of a night attack, and 
when the Chiboque wished to be shown where I lay sick, they 
very properly refused to point me out. In the morning I went 
out to the Chiboque, and found that they answered me civilly 
regarding my intentions in opening the country, teaching them, 
&c. &c. They admitted that their chiefs would be pleased with 
the prospect of friendship, and now only wished to exchange 
tokens of goodwill with me, and offered three pigs, which they 
hoped I would accept. The people here are in the habit of 
making a present, and then demanding whatever they choose in 
return ; we had been forewarned of this by our guides, so I tried 
to decline, by asking if they would eat one of the pigs in com- 
pany with us. To this proposition they said that they durst not 
accede. I then accepted the present in the hope that the blame 
of deficient friendly feeling might not rest with me, and pre- 
sented a razor, two bunches of beads, and twelve copper rings, 
contributed by my men from their arms. They went off to report 
to their chief; and as I was quite unable to move from excessive 
giddiness, we continued in the same spot on Tuesday evening, 
when they returned with a message couched in very plain terms, 
that a man, tusk, gun, or even an ox, alone would be accept- 
able ; that he had everything else in his possession but oxen, 
and that, whatever I should please to demand from him, he 
would gladly give it. As this was all said civilly, and there was 
no help for it if we refused, but bloodshed, I gave a tired riding- 
ox. My late chief mutineer, an Ambonda man, was now over- 
loyal, for he armed himself and stood at the gateway. He would 
rather die than see his father imposed on ; but I ordered Mo- 
santu to take him out of the way, which he did promptly, and 
allowed the Chiboque to march off well pleased with their booty. 



Chap. XVIIT. A ROBBER PARTY. 349 

I told my men that I esteemed one of their lives of more value 
than all the oxen we had, and that the only cause which could 
induce me to fight, would be to save the lives and liberties of 
the majority. In the propriety of this they all agreed, and said 
that, if the Chiboque molested us who behaved so peaceably, 
the guilt would be on their heads. This is a favourite mode of 
expression throughout the whole country. All are anxious to 
give explanation of any acts they have performed, and conclude 
the narration with, "I have no guilt or blame" ("molatu"). 
" They have the guilt." I never could be positive whether the 
idea in their minds is guilt in the sight of the Deity, or of man- 
kind only. 

Next morning the robber party came with about thirty yards 
of strong striped English calico, an axe, and two hoes for our 
acceptance, and returned the copper rings, as the chief was a 
great man, and did not need the ornaments of my men, but we 
noticed that they were taken back again. I divided the cloth 
among my men, and pleased them a little by thus compensating 
for the loss of the ox. I advised the chief, whose name we did 
not learn, as he did not deign to appear except under the alias 
Matiamvo, to get cattle for his own use, and expressed sorrow 
that I had none wherewith to enable him to make a commence- 
ment. Rains prevented our proceeding till Thursday morning, 
and then messengers appeared to tell us that their chief had 
learned, that all the cloth sent by him had not been presented ; 
that the copper rings had been secreted by the persons ordered 
to restore them to us, and that he had stripped the thievish 
emissaries of their property as a punishment. Our guides 
thought these were only spies of a larger party, concealed in the 
forest through which we were now about to pass. We prepared 
for defence by marching in a compact body, and allowing no one 
to straggle far behind the others. We marched through many 
miles of gloomy forest in gloomier silence, but nothing disturbed 
us. We came to a village, and found all the men absent, the 
guides thought, in the forest, with their countrymen. I was too 
ill to care much whether we were attacked or not. Though a 
pouring rain came on, as we were all anxious to get away out of 
a bad neighbourhood, we proceeded. The thick atmosphere pre- 
vented my seeing the creeping plants in time to avoid them ; so 



350 MOKE TEOUBLES. Chap. XYIII. 

Pitsane, Mohorisi, and I, who alone were mounted, were often 
caught ; and as there is no stopping the oxen when they have 
the prospect of giving the rider a tumble, we came frequently 
to the ground. In addition to these mishaps, Sinbad went off 
at a plunging gallop, the bridle broke, and I came down back- 
wards on the crown of my head. He gave me a kick on the 
thigh at the same time. I felt none the worse for this rough 
treatment, but would not recommend it to others as a palliative 
in cases of fever! This last attack of fever was so obstinate 
that it reduced me almost to a skeleton. The blanket which I 
used as a saddle on the back of the ox, being frequently wet, 
remained so beneath me even in the hot sun, and, aided by the 
heat of the ox, caused extensive abrasion of the skin, which was 
continually healing and getting sore again. To this incon- 
venience was now added the chafing of my projecting bones on 
the hard bed. 

On Friday we came to a village of civil people on the banks 
of the Loajima itself, and we were wet all day in consequence of 
crossing it. The bridges over it, and another stream which we 
crossed at mid-day, were submerged, as we have hitherto in- 
variably found, by a flood of perfectly clear water. At the second 
ford we were met by a hostile party who refused us further 
passage. I ordered my men to proceed in the same direction we 
had been pursuing, but our enemies spread themselves out in 
front of us with loud cries. Our numbers were about equal to 
theirs this time, so I moved on at the head of my men. Some ran 
off to other villages, or back to their own village, on pretence of 
getting ammunition ; others called out that all traders came to 
them, and that we must do the same. As these people had plenty 
of iron-headed arrows and some guns, when we came to the edge 
of the forest I ordered my men to put the luggage in our centre ; 
and, if our enemies did not fire, to cut down some young trees 
and make a screen as quickly as possible, but do nothing to them 
except in case of actual attack. I then dismounted, and, advancing 
a little towards our principal opponent, showed him how easily 
I could kill him, but pointed upwards, saying, " I fear God." 
He did the same, placing his hand on his heart, pointing up- 
wards, and saying, " I fear to kill ; but come to our village ; come 
— do come." At this juncture, the old headman, Ionga Panza, a 



Chap. XYIII. CONTINUED DEMANDS. 351 

venerable negro, came up, and I invited him and all to be seated, 
that we might talk the matter over. Ionga Panza soon let us 
know that he thought himself very ill-treated in being passed by. 
As most skirmishes arise from misunderstanding, tin's might have 
been a serious one ; for, like all the tribes near the Portuguese 
settlements, people here imagine that they have a right to de- 
mand payment from every one who passes through the country ; 
and now, though Ionga Panza was certainly no match for my 
men, yet they were determined not to forego their right without 
a struggle. I removed with my men to the vicinity of the vil- 
lage, thankful that no accident had as yet brought us into actual 
collision. 

The reason why the people have imbibed the idea so strongly, 
that they have a right to demand payment for leave to pass 
through the country, is probably tins. They have seen no traders 
except those either engaged in purchasing slaves, or who have 
slaves in their employment. These slave-traders have always 
been very much at the mercy of the chiefs through whose country 
they have passed ; for if they afforded a ready asylum for run- 
away slaves, the traders might be deserted at any moment, and 
stripped of their property altogether. They are thus obliged to 
curry favour with the chiefs, so as to get a safe conduct from 
them. The same system is adopted to induce the chiefs to part 
with their people, whom all feel to be the real source of their 
importance in the country. On the return of the traders from 
the interior with chains of slaves, it is so easy for a chief who 
may be so disposed to take away a chain of eight or ten unre- 
sisting slaves, that the merchant is fain to give any amount of 
presents in order to secure the good will of the rulers. The inde- 
pendent chiefs, not knowing why their favour is so eagerly sought, 
become excessively proud and supercilious in their demands, and 
look upon white men with the greatest contempt. To such 
lengths did the Bangala, a tribe near to which we had now ap- 
proached, proceed, a few years ago, that they compelled the 
Portuguese traders to pay for water, wood, and even grass, and 
every possible pretext was invented for levying fines ; and these 
were patiently submitted to so long as the slave-trade continued 
to flourish. We had unconsciously come in contact with a system 
winch was quite unknown in the country from which my men 



352 VILLAGE OF IONGA PANZA. Chap. XYIII. 

had set out. An English trader may there hear a demand for 
payment of guides, but never, so far as I am aware, is he asked 
to pay for leave to traverse a country. The idea does not 
seem to have entered the native mind, except through slave- 
traders, for the aborigines all acknowledge that the untilled land, 
not needed for pasturage, belongs to God alone, and that no 
harm is done by people passing through it. I rather believe 
that, wherever the slave-trade has not penetrated, the visits of 
strangers are esteemed a real privilege. 

The village of old Ionga Panza (lat. 10° 25' S., long. 20° 15' E.) 
is small and embowered in lofty evergreen trees, which were 
hung around with fine festoons of creepers. He sent us food 
immediately, and soon afterwards a goat, which was considered a 
handsome gift, there being but few domestic animals, though the 
country is well adapted for them. I suspect this, like the country 
of Shinte and Katema, must have been a tsetse district, and only 
recently rendered capable of supporting other domestic animals 
besides the goat, by the destruction of the game through the 
extensive introduction of fire-arms. We might all have been as 
ignorant of the existence of this insect-plague as the Portuguese, 
had it not been for the numerous migrations of pastoral tribes, 
winch took place in the south in consequence of Zulu irruptions. 

During these exciting scenes I always forgot my fever, but 
a terrible sense of sinking came back with the feeling of safety. 
The same demand of payment for leave to pass, was made on 
the 20th by old Ionga Panza as by the other Chiboque. I 
offered the shell presented by Shinte, but Ionga Panza said 
he was too old for ornaments. We might have succeeded very 
well with him, for he was by no means unreasonable, and had 
but a very small village of supporters ; but our two guides from 
Kangenke complicated our difficulties by sending for a body of 
Bangala traders, with a view to force us to sell the tusks of 
Sekeletu and pay them with the price. We offered to pay 
them handsomely, if they would perform their promise of guid- 
ing us to Cassange, but they knew no more of the paths than 
we did ; and my men had paid them repeatedly, and tried to 
get rid of them, but could not. They now joined with our 
enemies, and so did the traders. Two guns and some beads, 
belonging to the latter, were standing in our encampment, and 



Chap. XVIII. DISCOURAGEMENTS. 353 

the guides seized them and ran off. As my men knew that 
we should be called upon to replace them, they gave chase, 
and when the guides saw that they would be caught, they 
threw down the guns, directed their flight to the village, and 
rushed into a hut. The doorway is not much higher than that 
of a dog's kennel. One of the guides was reached by one of my 
men as he was in the act of stooping* to get in, and a cut was 
inflicted on a projecting part of the body which would have 
made any one in that posture wince. The guns were restored, 
but the beads were lost in the flight. All I had remaining of 
my stock of beads could not replace those lost ; and though we 
explained that we had no part in the guilt of the act, the 
traders replied that we had brought the thieves into the 
country ; these were of the Bangala, who had been accustomed 
to plague the Portuguese in the most vexatious way. We were 
striving to get a passage through the country, and, feeling anxious 
that no crime whatever should be laid to our charge, tried the 
conciliatory plan here, though we were not, as in the other in- 
stances, likely to be overpowered by numbers. 

My men offered all their ornaments, and I offered all my 
beads and shirts ; but though we had come to the village against 
our will, and the guides had also followed us contrary to our desire, 
and had even sent for the Bangala traders without our knowledge 
or consent, yet matters could not be arranged without our 
giving an ox and one of the tusks. We were all becoming 
disheartened, and could not wonder that native expeditions 
from the interior to the coast had generally failed to reach their 
destinations. My people were now so much discouraged that 
some proposed to return home ; the prospect of being obliged 
to return when just on the threshold of the Portuguese settle* 
ments distressed me exceedingly. After using all my powers 
of persuasion, I declared to them that if they returned I would 
go on alone, and went into my little tent with the mind directed 
to Him who hears the sighing of the soul ; and was soon followed 
by the head of Mohorisi, saying — " We will never leave you. 
Do not be disheartened. Wherever you lead we will follow. 
Our remarks were made only on account of the injustice of 
these people." Others followed, and with the most artless 
simplicity of manner told me to be comforted — "they were all

my children ; they knew no one but Sekeletu and me, and they 
would die for me ; they had not fought because I did not wish 
it ; they had just spoken in the bitterness of their spirit, and 
when feeling that they could do nothing ; but if these enemies 
begin you will see what we can do." One of the oxen we 
offered to the Chiboque had been rejected because he had lost 
part of his tail, as they thought that it had been cut off and 
witchcraft medicine inserted ; and some mirth was excited by 
my proposing to raise a similar objection to all the oxen we 
still had in our possession. The remaining four soon presented 
a singular shortness of their caudal extremities, and though no 
one ever asked whether they had medicine in the stumps or 
no, we were no more troubled by the demand for an ox ! We 
now slaughtered another ox, that the spectacle might not be 
seen of the owners of the cattle fasting, while the Chiboque were 
feasting.

24:th. — Ionga Pantza's sons agreed to act as guides into the 
territory of the Portuguese if I would give them the shell given 
by Shinte. I was strongly averse to this, and especially to give 
it beforehand; but yielded to the entreaty of my people to 
appear as if showing confidence in these hopeful youths. They 
urged that they wished to leave the shell with their wives, as a 
sort of payment to them for enduring their husbands' absence 
so long. Having delivered the precious shell, we went west- 
by-north to the river Chikapa, which here (lat. 10° 22' S.) is 
forty or fifty yards wide, and at present was deep ; it was seen 
flowing over a rocky broken cataract with great noise about 
half a mile above our ford. We were ferried over in a canoe, 
made out of a single piece of bark sewed together at the ends, 
and having sticks placed in it at different parts to act as ribs. 
The word Chikapa means bark or skin ; and as this is the only 
river in which we saw this kind of canoe used, and we heard 

2 a 2 



356 DESERTED BY GUIDES. Chap. XIX. 

that this stream is so low during most of the year as to be 
easily fordable, it probably derives its name from the use made 
of the bark canoes when it is in flood. We now felt the loss of 
our pontoon, for the people to whom the canoe belonged, made 
us pay once when we began to cross, then a second time when 
half of us were over, and a third time when all were over but 
my principal man Pitsane and myself. Loyanke took off his 
cloth and paid my passage with it. The Makololo always 
ferried their visitors over rivers without pay, and now began to 
remark that they must in future fleece the Mambari as these 
Chiboque had done to us ; they had all been loud in condemna- 
tion of the meanness, and when I asked if they could descend to 
be equally mean, I was answered that they would only do it in 
revenge. They like to have a plausible excuse for meanness. 

Next morning our guides went only about a mile, and then told 
us they would return home. I expected this when paying them 
beforehand, in accordance with the entreaties of the Makololo, 
who are rather ignorant of the world. Very energetic remon- 
strances were addressed to the guides, but, they slipped off one by 
one in the thick forest through which we were passing, and I 
was glad to hear my companions coming to the conclusion, that, 
as we were now in parts visited by traders, we did not require 
the guides, whose chief use had been to prevent misapprehension 
of our objects in the minds of the villagers. The country was 
somewhat more undulating now than it had been, and several 
fine small streams flowed in deep woody dells. The trees are very 
tall and straight, and the forests gloomy and damp ; the ground in 
these solitudes is quite covered with yellow and brown mosses, and 
light-coloured lichens clothe all the trees. The soil is extremely 
fertile, being generally a black loam covered with a thick crop of 
tall grasses. We passed several villages too. The headman of 
a large one scolded us well for passing, when he intended to 
give us food. Where slave-traders have been in the habit of 
coming, they present food, then demand three or four times its 
value as a custom. We were now rather glad to get past 
villages without intercourse with the inhabitants. 

We were travelling W.N.W., and all the rivulets we here 
crossed had a northerly course, and were reported to fall into the 
Kasai or Loke ; most of them had the peculiar boggy banks of 



Chap. XIX. FEELINGS OF FREED SLAVES. 357 

the country. As we were now in the alleged latitude of the 
Coanza, I was much astonished at the entire absence of any 
knowledge of that river among the natives of this quarter. But I 
was then ignorant of the fact that the Coanza rises considerably 
to the west of this, and has a comparatively short course from 
its source to the sea. 

The famous Dr. Lacerda seems to have laboured under the 
same mistake as myself, for he recommended the government 
of Angola to establish a chain of forts along the banks of that 
river, with a view to communication with the opposite coast. 
As a chain of forts along its course would lead southwards instead 
of eastwards, we may infer that the geographical data within 
reach of that eminent man, were no better than those according 
to which I had directed my course to the Coanza where it does 
not exist. 

26th. — We spent Sunday on the banks of the Quilo, or Kweelo ; 
here a stream of about ten yards wide. It runs in a deep 
glen, the sides of which are almost five hundred yards of slope, 
and rocky, the rocks being hardened calcareous tufa lying on 
clay shale and sandstone below, with a capping of ferruginous 
conglomerate. The scenery would have been very pleasing, but 
fever took away much of the joy of life, and severe daily inter- 
mittents rendered me very weak and always glad to recline. 

As we were now in the slave-market, it struck me that the 
sense of insecurity felt by the natives, might account for the 
circumstance that those who have been sold as slaves, and freed 
again, when questioned, profess to like the new state better than 
their primitive one. They lived on rich fertile plains, winch 
seldom inspire that love of country which the mountains do. If 
they had been mountaineers they would have pined for home. To 
one who has observed the hard toil of the poor in old civilized 
countries, the state in which the inhabitants here live is one 
of glorious ease. The country is full of little villages. Food 
abounds, and very little labour is required for its cultivation ; 
the soil is so rich that no manure is required ; when a garden 
becomes too poor for good crops of maize, millet, &c, the owner 
removes a little farther into the forest, applies fire round the roots 
of the larger trees to kill them, cuts down the smaller, and a new 
rich garden is ready for the seed. The gardens usually present 



358 GARDENS AND VILLAGES. Chap. XIX. 

the appearance of a great number of tall dead trees standing 
without bark, and maize growing between them. The old 
gardens continue to yield manioc for years, after the owners have 
removed to other spots, for the sake of millet and maize. But 
while vegetable aliment is abundant, there is a want of salt and 
animal food, so that numberless traps are seen, set for mice, in all 
the forests of Londa. The vegetable diet leaves great craving 
for flesh, and I have no doubt, but that, when an ordinary quan- 
tity of mixed food is supplied to freed slaves, they actually do 
feel more comfortable than they did at home. Their assertions, 
however, mean but little, for they always try to give an answer to 
please, and if one showed them a nugget of gold, they would 
generally say that these abounded in their country. 

One could detect, in passing, the variety of character found 
among the owners of gardens and villages. Some villages were 
the pictures of neatness. We entered others enveloped in a 
wilderness of weeds, so high that, when sitting on ox-back in the 
middle of the village, we could only see the tops of the huts. 
If we entered at midday, the owners would come lazily forth, pipe 
in hand, and leisurely puff away in dreamy indifference. In 
some villages weeds are not allowed to grow ; cotton, tobacco, 
and different plants used as relishes, are planted round the huts ; 
fowls are kept in cages, and the gardens present the pleasant 
spectacle of different kinds of grain and pulse at various periods 
of their growth. I sometimes admired the one class, and at times 
wished I could have taken the world easy for a time, like the 
other. Every village swarms with children, who turn out to see 
the white man pass, and run along with strange cries and antics ; 
some run up trees to get a good view : all are agile climbers 
throughout Londa. At friendly villages they have scampered 
alongside our party for miles at a time. We usually made a 
little hedge around our sheds; crowds of women came to the 
entrance of it, with children on their backs, and long pipes in 
their mouths, gazing at us for hours. The men, rather than 
disturb them, crawled through a hole in the hedge, and it was 
common to hear a man in ruiming off say to them, " I am going 
to tell my mama to come and see the white man's oxen." 

In continuing our W.N.W. course, we met many parties of 
native traders, each carrying some pieces of cloth and salt, with 



Chap. XIX. TRADERS— A GRAVE. 359 

a few beads to barter for bees'-wax. They are all armed with 
Portuguese guns, and have cartridges with iron balls. When we 
meet, we usually stand a few minutes. They present a little 
salt, and we give a bit of ox-hide, or some other trifle, and then 
part with mutual good wishes. The hide of the oxen we 
slaughtered had been a valuable addition to our resources, for we 
found it in so great repute for girdles all through Londa, that we 
cut up every skin into strips about two inches broad, and sold 
them for meal and manioc as we went along. As we came nearer 
Angola we found them of less value, as the people there possess 
cattle themselves. 

The village on the Kweelo, at which we spent Sunday, was 
that of a civil, lively old man, called Sakandala, who offered no 
objections to our progress. We found we should soon enter on 
the territory of the Bashinje (Chinge of the Portuguese), who 
are mixed with another tribe, named Bangala, which have been 
at war with the Babindele or Portuguese. Bains and fever, as 
usual, helped to impede our progress until we were put on the 
path, which leads from Cassange and Bihe to Matiamvo, by a 
headman named Kamboela. This was a well-beaten footpath, 
and, soon after entering upon it, we met a party of half-caste 
traders from Bihe, who confirmed the information we had 
already got of this path leading straight to Cassange, through 
which they had come on their way from Bihe to Cabango. They 
kindly presented my men with some tobacco, and marvelled 
greatly when they found that I had never been able to teach 
myself to smoke. On parting with them we came to a trader's 
grave. This was marked by a huge cone of sticks placed in the 
form of the roof of a hut, with a palisade around it. At an 
opening on the western side an ugly idol was placed: several 
strings of beads and bits of cloth were hung around. We learned 
that he had been a half-caste, who had died on his way back 
from Matiamvo. 

As we were now alone, and sure of being on the way to the 
abodes of civilisation, we went on briskly. 

On the 30th we came to a sudden descent from the high land, 
indented by deep, narrow valleys, over which we had lately been 
travelling. It is generally so steep, that it can only be descended 
at particular points, and even there I was obliged to dismount, 



360 VALLEY OF THE QUANGO. Chap. XIX. 

though so weak that I had to be led by my companions to pre- 
vent my toppling over in walking down. It was annoying to feel 
myself so helpless, for I never liked to see a man, either sick or 
well, giving in effeminately. Below us lay the valley of the 
Quango. If you sit on the spot where Mary Queen of Scots 
viewed the battle of Langside, and look down on the vale of 
Clyde, you may see in miniature the glorious sight which a much 
greater and richer valley presented to our view. It is about a 
hundred miles broad, clothed with dark forest, except where 
the light-green grass covers meadow-lands on the Quango, which 
here and there glances out in the sun as it wends its way to 
the north. The opposite side of tins great valley appears like 
a range of lofty mountains, and the descent into it about a mile, 
winch, measured perpendicularly, may be from a thousand to 
twelve hundred feet. Emerging from the gloomy forests of Londa, 
tins magnificent prospect made us all feel as if a weight had 
been lifted off our eyelids. A cloud was passing across the 
middle of the valley, from winch rolling thunder pealed, while 
above all was glorious sunlight ; and when we went down to the 
part where we saw it passing, we found that a very heavy 
thunder-shower had fallen under the path of the cloud : and the 
bottom of the valley, which from above seemed quite smooth, we 
discovered to be intersected and farrowed by great numbers of 
deep-cut streams. Looking back from below, the descent appears 
as the edge of a table-land, with numerous indented dells and 
spurs jutting out all along, giving it a serrated appearance. Both 
the top and sides of the sierra are covered with trees, but large 
patches of the more perpendicular parts are bare, and exhibit the 
red soil, which is general over the region we have now entered. 

The hollow affords a section of this part of the country ; and 
we find that the uppermost stratum is the ferruginous conglo- 
merate already mentioned. The matrix is rust of iron (or 
hydrous peroxide of iron and haematite), and in it are embedded 
water-worn pebbles of sandstone and quartz. As this is the rock 
underlying the soil of a large part of Londa, its formation must 
have preceded the work of denudation by an arm of the sea, 
winch washed away the enormous mass of matter required, before 
the valley of Cassange could assume its present form. The strata 
under the conglomerate are all of red clay shale of different 



Chap. XIX. THE BAMBOO. 361 

degrees of hardness, the most indurated being at the bottom. 
This red clay shale is named " keele " in Scotland, and has always 
been considered as an indication of gold ; but the only thing we 
discovered was, that it had given rise to a very slippery clay soil, 
so different from that which we had just left, that Mashauana, 
who always prided himself on being an adept at balancing himself 
in the canoe on water, and so sure of foot on land that he could 
afford to express contempt for any one less gifted, came down 
in a very sudden and undignified manner, to the delight of all 
whom he had previously scolded for falling. 

Here we met with the bamboo as thick as a man's arm, and 
many new trees. Others, which we had lost sight of since 
leaving Shinte, now re-appeared; but nothing struck us more 
than the comparative scragginess of the trees in this hollow. 
Those on the high lands we had left were tall and straight ; here 
they were stunted, and not by any means so closely planted 
together. The only way I could account for this was by sup- 
posing, as the trees were of different species, that the greater 
altitude suited the nature of those above, better than the lower 
altitude did the other species below. 

Sunday, 2nd April. — We rested beside a small stream, and 
our hunger being now very severe, from having lived on manioc 
alone since leaving Ionga Panza's, we slaughtered one of our 
four remaining oxen. The people of this district seem to feel the 
craving for animal food as much as we did, for they spend much 
energy in digging large white larvae out of the damp soil adjacent 
to their streams, and use them as a relish for their vegetable diet. 
The Bashinje refused to sell any food for the poor old ornaments 
my men had now to offer. We could get neither meal nor manioc ; 
but should have been comfortable, had not the Bashinje chief 
Sansawe pestered us for the customary present. The native 
traders informed us, that a display of force was often necessary 
before they could pass this man. 

Sansawe, the chief of a portion of the Bashinje, having sent the 
usual formal demand for a man, an ox, or a tusk, spoke very 
contemptuously of the poor things we offered him instead. We 
told his messengers, that the tusks were Sekeletu's : everything 
was gone, except my instruments, which could be of no use to 
them whatever. One of them begged some meat, and, when it 



362 THE CHIEF SANSAWE. Chap. XIX. 

was refused, said to niy men, " You may as well give it, for we 
shall take all after we have killed you to-morrow." The more 
humbly we spoke, the more insolent the Bashinje became, till at 
last we were all feeling savage and sulky, but continued to speak 
as civilly as we could. They are fond of argument, and when I 
denied their right to demand tribute from a white man, who did 
not trade in slaves, an old white-headed negro put rather a posing 
question : " You know that God has placed chiefs among us whom 
we ought to support. How is it that you, who have a book that 
tells you about him, do not come forward at once to pay this chief 
tribute, like every one else ? " I replied by asking, " How could 
I know that tins was a chief, who had allowed me to remain a day 
and a half near liim without giving me anything to eat ? " This, 
which to the uninitiated may seem sophistry, was, to the central 
Africans, quite a rational question, for he at once admitted that 
food ought to have been sent, and added, that probably Ins chief 
was only making it ready for me, and that it would come soon. 

After being wearied by talking all day to different parties sent 
by Sansawe, we were honoured by a visit from himself: he is 
quite a young man, and of rather a pleasing countenance. There 
cannot have been much intercourse between real Portuguese and 
these people even here, so close to the Quango, for Sansawe asked 
me to show him my hair, on the ground that, though he had 
heard of it, and some white men had even passed through his 
country, he had never seen straight hair before. This is quite 
possible, as most of the slave-traders are not Portuguese, but half- 
castes. The difference between their wool and our hair, caused 
liim to burst into a laugh, and the contrast between the exposed 
and unexposed parts of my skin, when exhibited in evidence of 
our all being made of one stock originally, and the children of 
one Maker, seemed to strike him with wonder. I then showed 
liim my watch, and wished to win my way into his confidence by 
conversation; but when about to exhibit my pocket compass 
he desired me to desist, as he was afraid of my wonderful things. 
I told him, if he knew my aims, as the tribes in the interior 
did, and as I hoped he would yet know them and me, he 
would be glad to stay, and see also the pictures of the magic 
lantern; but as it was now getting dark he had evidently got 
enough of my witchery, and began to use some charms to dispel 



Chap. XIX. HOSTILITY OF THE BASHINJE. 363 

any kindly feelings he might have found stealing round his heart. 
He asked leave to go, and when his party moved off a little way, 
he sent for my spokesman, and told him that, " if we did not add 
a red jacket and a man, to our gift of a few copper rings and a few 
pounds of meat, we must return by the way we had come." I 
said in reply, " that we should certainly go forward next day, and 
if he commenced hostilities, the blame before God would be that 
of Sansawe ; " and my man added of his own accord, " How many 
white men have you killed in this path ? " which might be inter- 
preted into, " You have never killed any white man, and you will 
find ours more difficult to manage than you imagine." It ex- 
pressed a determination, which we had often repeated to each other, 
to die rather than yield one of our party to be a slave. 

Hunger has a powerful effect on the temper. When we had got 
a good meal of meat, we could all bear the petty annoyances of 
these borderers on the more civilized region in front, with equani- 
mity ; but having suffered considerably of late, we were all rather 
soured in our feelings, and not unfrequently I overheard my 
companions remark in their own tongue, in answer to threats 
of attack, " That's what we want — only begin then ; " or with 
clenched teeth they would exclaim to each other, " These things 
have never travelled, and do not know what men are." The 
worrying, of which I give only a slight sketch, had considerable 
influence on my own mind, and more especially, as it was im- 
possible to make any allowance for the Bashinje, such as I was 
willing to award to the Chiboque. They saw that we had nothing 
to give, nor would they be benefited in the least, by enforcing 
the impudent order to return whence we had come. They were 
adding insult to injury, and this put us all into a fighting spirit, 
and, as nearly as we could judge, we expected to be obliged to 
cut our way through the Bashinje next morning. 

3rd April. — As soon as day dawned we were astir, and, set- 
ting off in a drizzling rain, passed close to the village. This 
rain probably damped the ardour of the robbers. We, how- 
ever, expected to be fired upon from every clump of trees, or 
from some of the rocky hillocks among which we were passing ; 
and it was only after two hours' march that we began to breathe 
freely, and my men remarked, in thankfulness, " We are children 
of Jesus." We continued our course, notwithstanding the rain, 



364 THE QUANGO. Chap. XIX. 

across the bottom of the Quango valley, which we found broken 
by clay shale rocks jutting out, though lying nearly horizontally. 
The grass in all the hollows, at this time quite green, was about 
two feet higher than my head while sitting on ox-back. This 
grass, wetted by the rain, acted as a shower-bath on one side of 
our bodies ; and some deep gullies, full of discoloured water, com- 
pleted the cooling process. We passed many villages during this 
drenching, one of which possessed a flock of sheep ; and after six 
hours we came to a stand near the river Quango (lat. 9° 53' S., 
long. 18° 37' E.), which may be called the boundary of the 
Portuguese claims to territory on the west. As I had now no 
change of clothing, I was glad to cower under the shelter of 
my blanket, thankful to Glod for his goodness in bringing us so 
far, without losing one of the party. 

4:th April. — We were now on the banks of the Quango, a river 
one hundred and fifty yards wide, and very deep. The water was 
discoloured — a circumstance winch we had observed in no river in 
Londa or in the Makololo country. This fine river flows among 
extensive meadows clothed with gigantic grass and reeds, and in 
a direction nearly north. 

The Quango is said by the natives to contain many venomous 
water-snakes, which congregate near the carcase of any hippo- 
potamus that may be killed in it. If this is true, it may account 
for all the villages we saw, being situated far from its banks. We 
were advised not to sleep near it ; but, as we were anxious to 
cross to the western side, we tried to induce some of the Bashinje 
to lend us canoes for the purpose. This brought out the chief of 
these parts, who informed us that all the canoe-men were his 
children, and nothing could be done without his authority. He 
then made the usual demand for a man, an ox, or a gun, adding 
that otherwise, we must return to the country from which we had 
come. As I did not believe that this man had any power over the 
canoes of the other side, and suspected that if I gave him my 
blanket — the only thing I now had in reserve— he might leave us 
in the lurch after all, I tried to persuade my men to go at once 
to the bank, about two miles off, and obtain possession of the 
canoes before we gave up the blanket ; but they thought that this 
chief might attack us in the act of crossing, should we do so. 
The chief came himself to our encampment and made his 



Chap. XIX. 



OPPORTUNE AID. 



365 



demand again. My men stripped off the last of their copper rings 
and gave them ; but he was still intent on a man. He thought, 
as others did, that my men were slaves. He was a young man, 
with his woolly hair elaborately dressed : that behind was made 
up into a cone, about eight inches in diameter at the base, care- 
fully swathed round with red and black thread. As I resisted

the proposal to deliver up my blanket until they had placed us 
on the western bank, tins chief continued to worry us with his 
demands till I was tired. My little tent was now in tatters, and 
having a wider hole behind than the door in front, I tried in vain 
to lie down out of sight of our persecutors. We were on a reedy 
flat, and could not follow our usual plan of a small stockade, in 
which we had time to think over and concoct our plans. As I was 
trying to persuade my men to move on to the bank in spite of 
these people, a young half-caste Portuguese sergeant of militia, 
Cypriano di Abreu, made his appearance, and gave the same 
advice. He had come across the Quango in search of bees'-wax. 
When we moved off from the chief who had been plaguing us, 
his people opened a fire from our sheds, and continued to blaze 
away some time in the direction we were going, but none of the 
bullets reached us. It is probable that they expected a demon- 



366 CYPRIANO'S GENEROUS HOSPITALITY. Chap. XIX. 

stration of the abundance of ammunition they possessed, would 
make us run ; but when we continued to move quietly to the 
ford, they proceeded no farther than our sleeping-place. Cypriano 
assisted us in making a more satisfactory arrangement with the 
ferrymen than parting with my blanket ; and as soon as we 
reached the opposite bank, we were in the territory of the Ban- 
gala, who are subjects of the Portuguese, and often spoken of as 
the Cassanges or Cassantse ; and happily all our difficulties with 
the border tribes were at an end. 

Passing with light hearts through the high grass by a narrow 
footpath for about three miles to the west of the river, we came to 
several neat square houses with many cleanly-looking half-caste 
Portuguese standing in front of them to salute us. They are all 
enrolled in the militia, and our friend Cypriano is the commander 
of a division established here. The Bangala were very trouble- 
some to the Portuguese traders, and at last proceeded so far as to 
kill one of them ; the government of Angola then sent an expe- 
dition against them, which being successful, the Bangala were 
dispersed, and are now returning to their former abodes as vassals. 
The militia are quartered amongst them, and engage in trade and 
agriculture for their support, as no pay is given to this branch of 
the service by the government. 

We came to the dwelling of Cypriano after dark, and I pitched 
my little tent in front of it for the night. We had the company 
of mosquitoes here. We never found them troublesome on the 
banks of the pure streams of Londa. On the morning of the 5th 
Cypriano generously supplied my men with pumpkins and maize, 
and then invited me to breakfast, which consisted of ground-nuts 
and roasted maize, then boiled manioc-roots and ground-nuts, 
with guavas and honey as a dessert. I felt sincerely grateful for 
this magnificent breakfast. 

At dinner Cypriano was equally bountiful, and several of his 
friends joined us in doing justice to his hospitality. Before eating, 
all had water poured on the hands by a female slave to wash them. 
One of the guests cut up a fowl with a knife and fork. Neither 
forks nor spoons were used in eating. The repast was partaken of 
with decency and good manners, and concluded by washing the 
hands as at first. 

All of them could read and write with ease. I examined the 



Chap. XIX. BOOKS AND IMAGES. 367 

books they possessed, and found a small work on medicine, a 
small cyclopaedia, and a Portuguese dictionary, in which the 
definition of a " priest " seemed strange to a Protestant, namely, 
" one who takes care of the conscience." They had also a few 
tracts containing the Lives of the Saints, and Cypriano had three 
small wax images of saints in his room. One of these was St. 
Anthony, who, had he endured the privations he did in Ins cell 
in looking after these lost sheep, would have lived to better pur- 
pose. Neither Cypriano nor his companions knew what the 
Bible was, but they had relics in German-silver cases hung round 
their necks, to act as charms and save them from danger by land 
or by water, in the same way as the heathen have medicines. It 
is a pity that the church to which they belong, when unable to 
attend to the wants of her children, does not give them the sacred 
writings in their own tongue ; it would surely be better to see 
them good Protestants, if these would lead them to be so, than 
entirely ignorant of God's message to man. For my part, I 
would much prefer to see the Africans good Eoman Catholics, 
than idolatrous heathen. 

Much of the civility shown to us here was, no doubt, owing to 
the flattering letters of recommendation I carried from the Che- 
valier Du Prat, of Cape Town ; but I am inclined to believe, that 
my friend Cypriano was influenced too by feelings of genuine 
kindness, for he quite bared his garden in feeding us during the 
few days which I remained, anxiously expecting the clouds to 
disperse, so far as to allow of my taking observations for the deter- 
mination of the position of the Quango. He slaughtered an ox 
for us, and furnished his mother and her maids with manioc- 
roots, to prepare farina for the four or five days of our journey 
to Cassange, and never even hinted at payment. My wretched 
appearance must have excited his compassion. The farina is 
prepared by washing the roots well, then rasping them down to a 
pulp. Next, this is roasted slightly on a metal plate over a fire, 
and is then used with meat as a vegetable. It closely resembles 
wood sawings, and on that account is named " wood-meal." It 
is insipid, and employed to lick up any gravy remaining on one's 
plate. Those who have become accustomed to it, relish it even 
after they have returned to Europe. 

The manioc cultivated here is of the sweet variety : the bitter, 



368 ARRIVAL AT CASSANGE. Chap. XIX. 

to which we were accustomed in Londa, is not to be found very 
extensively in this fertile valley. May is the beginning of winter, 
yet many of the inhabitants were busy planting maize; that 
which we were now eating was planted in the beginning of 
February. The soil is exceedingly fertile, of a dark red colour, 
and covered with such a dense heavy crop of coarse grass, that 
when a marauding party of Ambonda once came for plunder 
while it was in a dried state, the Bangala encircled the common 
enemy with a fire which completely destroyed them. This, which 
is related on the authority of Portuguese who were then in the 
country, I can easily believe to be true, for the stalks of the 
grass are generally as thick as goose-quills, and no flight could be 
made through the mass of grass in any direction where a foot- 
path does not exist. Probably, in the case mentioned, the direc- 
tion of the wind was such, as to drive the flames across the paths, 
and prevent escape along them. On one occasion I nearly lost 
my waggon by fire, in a valley where the grass was only about 
three feet high. We were roused by the roar, as of a torrent, 
made by the fire coming from the windward. I immediately set 
fire to that on our leeward, and had just time to drag the 
waggon on to the bare space there, before the windward flames 
reached the place where it had stood. 

We were detained by rains, and a desire to ascertain our 
geographical position, till Monday the 10th, and only got the 
latitude 9° 50' S. ; and after three days* pretty hard travelling 
tlirough the long grass, reached Cassange, the farthest inland 
station of the Portuguese in Western Africa. We crossed several 
fine little streams running into the Quango ; and as the grass 
continued to tower about two feet over our heads, it generally 
obstructed our view of the adjacent country, and sometimes 
hung over the path, making one side of the body wet with the 
dew every morning, or when it rained kept me wet during the 
whole day. I made my entrance, in a somewhat forlorn state as 
to clothing, among our Portuguese allies. The first gentleman I 
met in the village asked if I had a passport, and said, it was 
necessary to take me before the authorities. As I was in the same 
state of mind, in which individuals are, who commit a petty de- 
predation, in order to obtain the shelter and food of a prison, 
I gladly accompanied him to the house of the Commandant or 



Chap. XIX. VEGETABLE PKODUCTIONS. 369 

Chefe, Senhor de Silva Eego. Having shown my passport to this 
gentleman, he politely asked me to supper, and as we had eaten 
nothing except the farina of Cypriano from the Quango to this, 
I suspect I appeared particularly ravenous to the other gentlemen 
around the table. They seemed, however, to understand my 
position pretty well, from having all travelled extensively them- 
selves ; had they not been present, I might have put some in my 
pocket to eat by night, for, after fever, the appetite is excessively 
keen, and manioc is one of the most unsatisfying kinds of food. 
Captain Antonio Rodrigues Neves then kindly invited me to 
take up my abode in his house. Next morning this generous 
man arrayed me in decent clothing, and continued during the 
whole period of my stay to treat me as if I had been his brother. 
I feel deeply grateful to him for his disinterested kindness ; he 
not only attended to my wants, but also furnished food for my 
famishing party free of charge. 

The village of Cassange (pronounced Kassanje) is composed of 
thirty or forty traders' houses, scattered about without any regu- 
larity, on an elevated flat spot in the great Quango or Cassange 
valley. They are built of wattle and daub, and surrounded by 
plantations of manioc, maize, &c. Behind them, there are usually 
kitchen gardens, in which the common European vegetables, as 
potatoes, peas, cabbages, onions, tomatoes, &c. &c, grow. Guavas 
and bananas appear, from the size and abundance of the trees, to 
have been introduced many years ago, while the land was still in the 
possession of the natives, but pine-apples, orange, fig, and cashew- 
trees have but lately been tried. There are about forty Portuguese 
traders in this district, all of whom are officers in the militia, and 
many of them have become rich from adopting the plan of 
sending out Pombeiros, or native traders, with large quantities 
of goods, to trade in the more remote parts of the country. Some 
of the governors of Loanda, the capital of this, the kingdom of 
Angola, have insisted on the observance of a law which, from 
motives of humanity, forbids the Portuguese themselves from 
passing beyond the boundary. They seem to have taken it for 
granted, that, in cases where the white trader was killed, the 
aggression had been made by him, and they wished to avoid the 
necessity of punishing those who had been provoked to shed 
Portuguese blood. This indicates a much greater impartiality 

2 B 



370 POKTUGUESE CURIOSITY. Chap. XIX. 

than has obtained in our own dealings with the Caffres, for we 
have engaged in most expensive wars with them without once 
inquiring whether any of the fault lay with our frontier colonists. 
The Cassange traders seem inclined to spread along the Quango, 
in spite of the desire of their government to keep them on one 
spot, for mutual protection in case of war. If I might judge from 
the week of feasting I passed among them, they are generally 
prosperous. 

As I always preferred to appear in my own proper character, 
I was an object of curiosity to these hospitable Portuguese. 
They evidently looked upon me as an agent of the English 
Government, engaged in some new movement for the suppression 
of slavery. They could not divine what a " missionario " had to 
do with the latitudes and longitudes, which I was intent on ob- 
serving. When we became a little familiar, the questions put 
were rather amusing, "Is it common for missionaries to be 
doctors ?" " Are you a doctor of medicine and a ' doutor mathema- 
tico' too ? You must be more than a missionary to know how to 
calculate the longitude ! Come ; tell us at once what rank you 
hold in the English army." They may have given credit to my 
reason for wearing the moustache, as that explains why men 
have beards and women have none; but that which puzzled 
many besides my Cassange friends was the anomaly of my 
being a " sacerdote," with a wife and four children ! I usually 
got rid of the last question by putting another, " Is it not better 
to have children with a wife, than to have children without a 
wife?" But all were most kind and hospitable, and as one 
of their festivals was near, they invited me to partake of the 
feast. 

The anniversary of the Resurrection of our Saviour was ob- 
served on the 16th April as a day of rejoicing, though the Portu- 
guese have no priests at Cassange. The coloured population 
dressed up a figure intended to represent Judas Iscariot, and 
paraded him on a riding-ox about the village ; sneers and male- 
dictions were freely bestowed on the poor wretch thus represented. 
The slaves and free coloured population, dressed in their gayest 
clothing, made visits to all the principal merchants, and wishing 
them " a good feast," expected a present in return. This, though 
frequently granted in the shape of pieces of calico to make new 



Chap. XIX. NO PKEJUDICE AGAINST COLOUR. 371 

dresses, was occasionally refused, but the rebuff did not much 
affect the petitioner. 

At ten a.m. we went to the residence of the Commandant, and on 
a signal being given, two of the four brass guns belonging to the 
Government, commenced firing, and continued some time, to the 
great admiration of my men, whose ideas of the power of a cannon 
are very exalted. The Portuguese flag was hoisted and trumpets 
sounded, as an expression of joy at the resurrection of our Lord. 
Captain Neves invited all the principal inhabitants of the place, 
and did what he could to feast them in a princely style. All 
manner of foreign preserved fruits and wine from Portugal, 
biscuits from America, butter from Cork, and beer from England, 
were displayed, and no expense spared in rendering the enter- 
tainment joyous. After the feast was over they sat down to the 
common amusement of card-playing, which continued till eleven 
o'clock at night. As far as a mere traveller could judge, they 
seemed to be polite and willing to aid each other. They live in a 
febrile district, and many of them had enlarged spleens. They 
have neither doctor, apothecary, school, nor priest, and, when 
taken ill, trust to each other and to Providence. As men left in 
such circumstances must think for themselves, they have all a 
good idea of what ought to be done in the common diseases of 
the country, and what they have of either medicine or skill, they 
freely impart to each other. 

None of these gentlemen had Portuguese wives. They usually 
come to Africa, in order to make a little money, and return to 
Lisbon. Hence they seldom bring their wives with them, and 
never can be successful colonists in consequence. It is common 
for them to have families by native women. It was particularly 
gratifying to me, who had been familiar with the stupid prejudice 
against colour, entertained only by those who are themselves 
becoming tawny, to view the liberality with which people of 
colour were treated by the Portuguese. Instances, so common in 
the south, in which half-caste children are abandoned, are here 
extremely rare. They are acknowledged at table, and provided 
for by their fathers, as if European. The coloured clerks of the 
merchants sit at the same table with their employers, without any 
embarrassment. The civil manners of superiors to inferiors is 
probably the result of the position they occupy — a few whites

372 COUNTRY AROUND CASSANGE. Chap. XIX. 

among thousands of blacks ; but nowhere else in Africa is there 
so much goodwill between Europeans and natives as here. If 
some border colonists had the absolute certainty of our Govern- 
ment declining to bear them out in their arrogance, we should 
probably hear less of Caffre insolence. It is insolence which 
begets insolence. 

From the village of Cassange we have a good view of the sur- 
rounding country : it is a gently undulating plain, covered with 
grass and patches of forest. The western edge of the Quango 
valley appears about twenty miles off as if it were a range of lofty 
mountains, and passes by the name of Tala Mungongo, " Behold 
the range." In the old Portuguese map, to which I had been 
trusting in planning my route, it is indicated as Talla Mugongo, 
or " Castle of rocks ! " and the Coanza is put down as rising there- 
from ; but here I was assured that the Coanza had its source near 
Bihe, far to the south-west of this, and we should not see that river 
till we came near Pungo Andongo. It is somewhat remarkable, 
that more accurate information about this country has not been 
published. Captain Neves and others had a correct idea of the 
courses of the rivers, and communicated their knowledge freely ; 
yet about this time, maps were sent to Europe from Angola repre- 
senting the Quango and Coanza as the same river, and Cassange 
placed about one hundred miles from its true position. The fre- 
quent recurrence of the same name, has probably helped to 
increase the confusion. I have crossed several Quangos, but all 
insignificant, except that which drains this valley. The repeti- 
tion of the favourite names of chiefs, as Catende, is also per- 
plexing, as one Catende may be mistaken for another. To avoid 
tins confusion as much as possible, I have refrained from intro- 
ducing many names. Numerous villages are studded all over 
the valley ; but these possess no permanence, and many more 
existed previous to the Portuguese expedition of 1850 to punish 
the Bangala. 

This valley, as I have before remarked, is all fertile in the 
extreme. My men could never cease admiring its capability for 
raising their corn (ITolcus sorghum), and despising the compara- 
tively limited cultivation of the inhabitants. The Portuguese 
informed me that no manure is ever needed, but that the more 
the ground is tilled, the better it yields. Virgin soil does not give 



Chap. XIX. SALE OF IVORY. 373 

such a heavy crop as an old garden, and, judging from the size of 
the maize and manioc in the latter, I can readily believe the 
statement. Cattle do well, too. Yiewing the valley as a whole, 
it may be said that its agricultural and pastoral riches are lying 
waste. Both the Portuguese and their descendants turn their 
attention almost exclusively to trade in wax and ivory, and though 
the country would yield any amount of corn and dairy produce, 
the native Portuguese live chiefly on manioc, and the Europeans 
purchase their flour, bread, butter, and cheese from the Americans. 

As the traders of Cassange were the first white men we had 
come to, we sold the tusks belonging to Sekeletu, which had been 
brought to test the difference of prices in the Makololo and white 
men's country. The result was highly satisfactory to my com- 
panions, as the Portuguese give much larger prices for ivory than 
traders from the Cape can possibly give, who labour under the 
disadvantage of considerable overland expenses and ruinous re- 
strictions. Two muskets, three small barrels of gunpowder, and 
English calico and baize sufficient to clothe my whole party, with 
large bunches of beads, all for one tusk, were quite delightful for 
those who had been accustomed to give two tusks for one gun. 
With another tusk we procured calico, which here is the chief 
currency, to pay our way down to the coast. The remaining two 
were sold for money to purchase a horse for Sekeletu at Loanda. 

The superiority of this new market was quite astounding to the 
Makololo, and they began to abuse the traders by whom they 
had, while in their own country, been visited, and, as they now 
declared, " cheated." They had no idea of the value of time and 
carriage, and it was somewhat difficult for me to convince them, 
that the reason of the difference of prices lay entirely in what 
they themselves had done in coming here, and that, if the Portu- 
guese should carry goods to their country, they would by no 
means be so liberal in their prices. They imagined that, if the 
Cassange traders came to Linyanti, they would continue to vend 
their goods at Cassange prices. I believe I gave them at last a 
clear idea of the manner in which prices were regulated by the 
expences incurred ; and when we went to Loanda, and saw goods 
delivered at a still cheaper rate, they concluded that it would be 
better for them to come to that city, than to turn homewards at 
Cassange, 



374 DEPASTURE FROM CASSANGE. Chap. XTX. 

It was interesting for me to observe the effects of the restric- 
tive policy, pursued by the Cape government towards the Bechu- 
anas. Like all other restrictions on trade, the law of preventing 
friendly tribes from purchasing arms and ammunition, only in- 
jures the men who enforce it. The Cape Government, as already 
observed, in order to gratify a company of independent Boers, 
whose well-known predilection for the practice of slavery caused 
them to stipulate, that a number of peaceable honest tribes should 
be kept defenceless, agreed to allow free trade in arms and ammu- 
nition to the Boers, and prevent the same trade to the Bechuanas. 
The Cape Government thereby unintentionally aided, and con- 
tinues to aid, the Boers to enslave the natives. But arms and 
ammunition flow in on all sides by new channels, and where 
formerly the price of a large tusk procured but one musket, one 
tusk of the same size now brings ten. The profits are reaped 
by other nations, and the only persons really the losers, in the 
long run, are our own Cape merchants, and a few defenceless 
tribes of Bechuanas on our immediate frontier. 

Mr. Rego, the Commandant^ very handsomely offered me a 
soldier as a guard to Ambaca. My men told me that they had 
been thinking it would be better to turn back here, as they had 
been informed by the people of colour at Cassange that I was 
leading them down to the sea-coast only to sell them, and they 
would be taken on board ship, fattened, and eaten, as the white 
men were cannibals. I asked if they had ever heard of an 
Englishman buying or selling people ; if I had not refused to take 
a slave when she was offered to me by Shinte; but as I had 
always behaved as an English teacher, if they now doubted my 
intentions, they had better not go to the coast : I, however, who 
expected to meet some of my countrymen there, was determined 
to go on. They replied that they only thought it right to tell 
me what had been told to them, but they did not intend to leave 
me, and would follow wherever I should lead the way. This 
affair being disposed of for the time, the Commandant gave them 
an ox, and me a friendly dinner before parting. All the mer- 
chants of Cassange accompanied us, in their hammocks carried by 
slaves, to the edge of the plateau on which their village stands, 
and we parted with the feeling in my mind that I should never 
forget their disinterested kindness. They not only did everything

Chap. XIX. A SOLDIER-GUIDE. 375 

they could to make my men and me comfortable during our 
stay, but, there being no hotels in Loanda, they furnished me 
with letters of recommendation to their friends in that city, 
requesting them to receive me into their houses, for without these, 
a stranger might find himself a lodger in the streets. May God 
remember them in their day of need ! 

The latitude and longitude of Cassange, the most easterly 
station of the Portuguese in Western Africa, is lat. 9° 37' 30" S., 
and long. 17° 49' E. ; consequently we had still about 300 miles 
to traverse before we could reach the coast. We had a black 
militia corporal as a guide. He was a native of Ambaca, and, like 
nearly all the inhabitants of that district, known by the name of 
Ambakistas, could both read and write. He had three slaves with 
him, and was carried by them ina " tipoia," or hammock slung 
to a pole. His slaves were young, and unable to convey him far at 
a time, but he was considerate enough to walk except when we 
came near to a village. He then mounted his tipoia and entered 
the village in state ; his departure was made in the same manner, 
and he continued in the hammock till the village was out of sight. 
It was interesting to observe the manners of our soldier-guide. 
Two slaves- were always employed in carrying his tipoia, and the 
third carried a wooden box, about three feet long, containing his 
writing materials, dishes, and clothing. He was cleanly in all his 
ways, and, though quite black himself, when he scolded any one 
of his own colour, abused him as a " negro." When he wanted 
to purchase any article from a village, he would sit down, mix a 
little gunpowder as ink, and write a note in a neat hand to ask 
the price, addressing it to the shopkeeper with the rather pom- 
pous title, " Illustrissimo Senhor" (Most Illustrious Sir). This 
is the invariable mode of address throughout Angola. The 
answer returned would be in the same style, and, if satisfactory, 
another note followed to conclude the bargain. There is so 
much of this note correspondence carried on in Angola, that a 
very large quantity of paper is annually consumed. Some other 
peculiarities of our guide were not so pleasing. A land of slaves 
is a bad school for even the free ; and I was sorry to find less 
truthfulness and honesty in him, than in my own people. We 
were often cheated through his connivance with the sellers of 
food, and could perceive that he got a share of the plunder from 



376 HILL KASALA. Chap. XIX. 

them. The food is very cheap, but it was generally made dear 
enough, until I refused to allow him to come near the place 
where we were bargaining. But he took us safely down to 
Ambaca, and I was glad to see, on my return to Cassange, that 
he was promoted to be sergeant-major of a company of militia. 

Having left Cassange on the 21st, we passed across the re- 
maining portion of this excessively fertile valley to the foot of 
Tala Mungongo. We crossed a fine little stream called the Lui 
on the 22nd, and another named the Luare on the 24th, then 
slept at the bottom of the height, which is from a thousand to 
fifteen hundred feet. The clouds came floating along the valley, 
and broke against the sides of the ascent, and the dripping rain 
on the tall grass, made the slaps in the face it gave, when the 
hand or a stick was not held up before it, anything but agreeable. 
Tins edge of the valley is exactly like the other ; jutting spurs 
and defiles give the red ascent the same serrated appearance as 
that which we descended from the highlands of Londa. The 
whole of this vast valley has been removed by denudation, for 
pieces of the plateau which once filled the now vacant space 
stand in it, and present the same structure of red horizontal 
strata of equal altitudes with those of the acclivity which we 
are now about to ascend. One of these insulated masses, named 
Kasala, bore E.S.E. from the place where we made our exit 
from the valley, and about ten miles W.S.W. from the village 
of Cassange. It is remarkable for its perpendicular sides ; even 
the natives find it extremely difficult, almost impossible, to reach 
its summit, though there is the temptation of marabou-nests and 
feathers, which are highly prized. There is a small lake reported 
to exist on its southern end, and, during the rainy season, a sort 
of natural moat is formed around the bottom. What an acqui- 
sition this would have been in feudal times in England ! There 
is land sufficient for considerable cultivation on the top, with 
almost perpendicular sides more than a thousand feet in height. 

We had not yet got a clear idea of the nature of Tala Mun- 
gongo. A gentleman at Cassange described it as a range of very 
high mountains, which it would take four hours to climb ; so, 
though the rain and grass had wetted us miserably, and I was suf- 
fering from an attack of fever got while observing by night for the 
position of Cassange, I eagerly commenced the ascent. The path 



Chap. XIX. TALA MUNGONGO. 377 

was steep and slippery ; deep gorges appear on each side of it, 
leaving but a narrow path along certain spurs of the sierra for 
the traveller ; but we accomplished the ascent in an hour, and 
when there, found we had just got on to a table-land similar to 
that we had left, before we entered the great Quango valley. We 
had come among lofty trees again. One of these, bearing a fruit 
about the size of a thirty-two pounder, is named Mononga-zambi. 

We took a glance back to this valley, which equals that of the 
Mississippi in fertility, and thought of the vast mass of material 
which had been scooped out and carried away in its formation. 
This naturally led to reflection on the countless ages required for 
the previous formation and deposition of the same material (clay 
shale) ; then of the rocks, whose abrasion formed that, until the 
mind grew giddy in attempting to ascend the steps, which lead up 
through a portion of the eternity before man. The different 
epochs of geology are like landmarks in that otherwise shoreless 
sea. Our own epoch, or creation, is but another added to the 
number of that wonderful series which presents a grand display 
of the mighty power of God: every stage of progress in the 
earth and its habitants, is such a display. So far from this 
science having any tendency to make men undervalue the power 
or love of God, it leads to the probability that the exhibition of 
mercy we have in the gift of his Son, may possibly not be the 
only manifestation of grace which has taken place in the countless 
ages, during which, works of creation have been going on. 

Situated a few miles from the edge of the descent, we found 
the village of Tala Mungongo, and were kindly accommodated 
with a house to sleep in, which was very welcome, as we were all 
both wet and cold. We found that the greater altitude, and the 
approach of winter, lowered the temperature so much, that many 
of my men suffered severely from colds. At this, as at several 
other Portuguese stations, they have been provident enough to 
erect travellers' houses on the same principle as khans or cara- 
vanserais of the East. They are built of the usual wattle and 
daub, and have benches of rods for the wayfarer to make his bed 
on ; also chairs and a table, and a large jar of water. These 
benches, though far from luxurious couches, were better than the 
ground under the rotten fragments of my gipsy-tent, for we had 
still showers occasionally, and the dews were very heavy. I con-

tinued to use them for the sake of the shelter they afforded, until 
I found that they were lodgings also, for certain inconvenient 
bedfellows. 

21th. — Five hours' ride through a pleasant country of forest and 
meadow like those of Londa, brought us to a village of Basongo, a 
tribe living in subjection to the Portuguese. We crossed several 
little streams, which were flowing in the westerly direction in 
which we were marching, and unite to form the Quize, a feeder 
of the Coanza. The Basongo were very civil, as indeed all the 
tribes were who had been conquered by the Portuguese. The 
Basongo and Bangala are yet only partially subdued. The 
farther west we go from this, the less independent we find the 
black population until we reach the vicinity of Loanda, where the 
free natives are nearly identical in their feelings towards the 
government with the slaves. But the governors of Angola wisely 
accept the limited allegiance and tribute rendered by the more 
distant tribes, as better than none. 

All the inhabitants of this region, as well as those of Londa, 
may be called true negroes, if the limitations formerly made be 
borne in mind. The dark colour, thick lips, heads elongated 
backwards and upwards and covered with wool, flat noses, with 
other negro peculiarities, are general; but while these charac- 
teristics place them in the true negro family, the reader would 
imbibe a wrong idea, if he supposed that all these features com- 
bined are often met with in one individual. All have a certain 
thickness and prominence of lip, but many are met with in every 
village in whom thickness and projection are not more marked 
than in Europeans. All are dark, but the colour is shaded off 
in different individuals from deep black to light yellow. As we 
go westward, we observe the light colour predominating over the 
dark, and then again, when we come within the influence of damp 
from the sea air, we find the shade deepen into the general 
blackness of the coast population. The shape of the head, with 
its woolly crop, though general, is not universal. The tribes on 
the eastern side of the continent, as the Caffres, have heads finely 
developed and strongly European. Instances of this kind are 
frequently seen, and after I became so familiar with the dark 
colour as to forget it in viewing the countenance, I was struck 
by the strong resemblance some natives bore to certain of our 



Chap. XIX. THE QUIZE. 379 

own notabilities. The Bushmen and Hottentots are exceptions 
to these remarks, for both the shape of their heads and growth 
of wool are peculiar — the latter, for instance, springs from the 
scalp in tufts with bare spaces between, and when the crop is 
short, resembles a number of black peppercorns stuck on the skin, 
and very unlike the thick frizzly masses which cover the heads 
of the Balonda and Maravi. With every disposition to pay due 
deference to the opinions of those who have made ethnology their 
special study, I have felt myself unable to believe that the exag- 
gerated features usually put forth as those of the typical negro, 
characterize the majority of any nation of south central Africa. 
The monuments of the ancient Egyptians seem to me to embody 
the ideal of the inhabitants of Londa, better than the figures of 
any work of ethnology I have met with. 

Passing through a fine fertile and well-peopled country to Sanza, 
we found the Quize river again touching our path, and here we had 
the pleasure of seeing a field of wheat growing luxuriantly without 
irrigation. The ears were upwards of four inches long, an object 
of great curiosity to my companions, because they had tasted my 
bread at Linyanti, but had never before seen wheat growing. 
This small field was cultivated by Mr. Miland, an agreeable Por- 
tuguese merchant. His garden was interesting, as showing what 
the land at this elevation is capable of yielding, for, besides wheat, 
we saw European vegetables in a flourishing condition, and we 
afterwards discovered that the coffee-plant has propagated itself 
on certain spots of this same district. It may be seen on the 
heights of Tala Mungongo, or nearly 300 miles from the west 
coast, where it was first introduced by the Jesuit missionaries. 

We spent Sunday the 30th of April at Ngio, close to the ford 
of the Quize as it crosses our path to fall into the Coanza. The 
country becomes more open, but is still abundantly fertile, with 
a thick crop of grass between two and three feet high. It is 
also well wooded and watered. Villages of Basongo are dotted 
over the landscape, and frequently a square house of wattle and 
daub, belonging to native Portuguese, is placed beside them for 
the purposes of trade. The people here possess both cattle and 
pigs. The different sleeping-places on our path, from eight to ten 
miles apart, are marked by a cluster of sheds made of sticks and 
grass. There is a constant stream of people going and returning 



380 CARRIERS — FEVER. Chap. XIX. 

to and from the coast. The goods are carried on the head, or on 
one shoulder, in a sort of basket attached to the extremities of 
two poles between five and six feet long, and called Motete. 
When the basket is placed on the head, the poles project forwards 
horizontally, and when the carrier wishes to rest himself, he plants 
them on the ground and the burden against a tree, so he is not 
obliged to lift it up from the ground to the level of the head. It 
stands against the tree propped up by the poles at that level. 
The carrier frequently plants the poles on the ground, and stands 
holding the burden until he has taken breath, thus avoiding the 
trouble of placing the burden on the ground and lifting it up 
again. 

When a company of these carriers, or our own party, arrives 
at one of these sleeping-places, immediate possession is taken of 
the sheds. Those who come late and find all occupied, must then 
erect others for themselves ; but this is not difficult, for there is 
no lack of long grass. No sooner do any strangers appear at the 
spot, than the women may be seen emerging from their villages 
bearing baskets of manioc-meal, roots, ground-nuts, yams, bird's- 
eye pepper, and garlic for sale. Calico, of which we had brought 
some from Cassange, is the chief medium of exchange. We 
found them all civil, and it was evident, from the amount of 
talking and laughing in bargaining, that the ladies enjoyed their 
occupation. They must cultivate largely, in order to be able to 
supply the constant succession of strangers. Those, however, 
near to the great line of road, purchase also much of the food from 
the more distant villages for the sake of gain. 

Pitsane and another of the men had violent attacks of fever, 
and it was no wonder, for the dampness and evaporation from 
the ground was excessive. When at any time I attempted to get 
an observation of a star, if the trough of mercury were placed on 
the ground, so much moisture was condensed on the inside of the 
glass roof over it, that it was with difficulty the reflection of the 
star could be seen. When the trough was placed on a box to 
prevent the moisture entering from below, so much dew was 
deposited on the outside of the roof, that it was soon necessary, 
for the sake of distinct vision, to wipe the glass. This would 
not have been of great consequence, but a short exposure to 
this dew was so sure to bring on a fresh fever, that I was obliged 



Chap. XIX. DISTRICT OF AMBACA. 381 

to give up observations by night altogether. The inside of the 
only covering I now had was not much better, but under the 
blanket, one is not so liable to the chill which the dew produces. 

It would have afforded me pleasure to have cultivated a more 
intimate acquaintance with the inhabitants of this part of the 
country, but the vertigo produced by frequent fevers made it as 
much as I could do to stick on the ox and crawl along in misery. 
In crossing the Lombe, my ox Sinbad, in the indulgence of his 
propensity to strike out a new path for himself, plunged overhead 
into a deep hole, and so soused me, that I was obliged to move 
on to dry my clothing, without calling on the Europeans who 
live on the bank. This I regretted, for all the Portuguese were 
very kind, and like the Boers placed in similar circumstances, 
feel it a slight to be passed without a word of salutation. But 
we went on to a spot where orange-trees had been planted by 
the natives themselves, and where abundance of that refreshing 
fruit was exposed for sale. 

On entering the district of Ambaca, we found the landscape 
enlivened by the appearance of lofty mountains in the distance, 
the grass comparatively short, and the whole country at this time 
looking gay and verdant. On our left we saw certain rocks of 
the same nature with those of Pungo Andongo, and which closely 
resemble the Stonehenge group on Salisbury Plain, only the 
stone pillars here are of gigantic size. This region is all wonder- 
fully fertile, famed for raising cattle, and all kinds of agricultural 
produce, at a cheap rate. The soil contains sufficient ferruginous 
matter, to impart a red tinge to nearly the whole of it. It is 
supplied with a great number of little flowing streams which 
unite in the Lucalla. This river drains Ambaca, then falls into 
the Coanza to the south-west at Massangano. We crossed the 
Lucalla by means of a large canoe kept there by a man who farms 
the ferry from the government, and charges about a penny per 
head. A few miles beyond the Lucalla, we came to the village 
of Ambaca, an important place in former times, but now a mere 
paltry village, beautifully situated on a little elevation in a plain 
surrounded on all hands by lofty mountains. It has a gaol, and 
a good house for the Commandant, but neither fort nor church, 
though the ruins of a place of worship are still standing. 

We were most kindly received by the Commandant of Ambaca, 



382 FKUITS OF JESUIT TEACHING. Chap. XIX. 

Arsenio de Garpo, who spoke a little English. He recommended 
wine for my debility, and here I took the first glass of that 
beverage I had taken in Africa. I felt much refreshed, and could 
then realize and meditate on the weakening effects of the fever. 
They were curious even to myself, for, though I had tried several 
times since we left Ngio to take lunar observations, I could not 
avoid confusion of time and distance, neither could I hold the 
instrument steady, nor perform a simple calculation ; hence many 
of the positions of this part of the route were left till my return 
from Loanda. Often, on getting up in the mornings, I found my 
clothing as wet from perspiration as if it had been dipped in 
water. In vain had I tried to learn or collect words of the 
Bunda, or dialect spoken in Angola. I forgot the days of the 
week and the names of my companions, and, had I been asked, 
I probably could not have told my own. The complaint itself 
occupied many of my thoughts. One day I supposed that I had 
got the true theory of it, and would certainly cure the next 
attack whether in myself or companions, but some new symptoms 
would appear, and scatter all the fine speculations which had 
sprung up, with extraordinary fertility, in one department of my 
brain. 

This district is said to contain upwards of 40,000 souls. Some 
ten or twelve miles to the north of the village of Ambaca, there 
once stood the missionary station of Cahenda, and it is now quite 
astonishing to observe the great numbers who can read and write 
in this district. This is the fruit of the labours of the Jesuit and 
Capuchin missionaries, for they taught the people of Ambaca ; 
and ever since the expulsion of the teachers by the Marquis of 
Pombal, the natives have continued to teach each other. These 
devoted men are still held in high estimation throughout the 
country to this day. All speak well of them (os padres Jesuitas), 
and now that they are gone from this lower sphere, I could not 
help wishing that these our Roman Catholic fellow-Christians had 
felt it to be their duty to give the people the Bible, to be a light 
to their feet when the good men themselves were gone. 

When sleeping in the house of the Commandant an insect, well 
known in the southern country by the name Tampan, bit my foot. 
It is a kind of tick, and chooses by preference the parts between 
the fingers or toes for inflicting its bite. It is seen from the size 



Chap. XIX. THE TAMPAN — CABINDA . 383 

of a pin's head to that of a pea, and is common in all the native 
huts in tins country. It sucks the blood until quite full, and is 
then of a dark-blue colour, and its skin so tough and yielding, that 
it is impossible to burst it by any amount of squeezing with the 
fingers. I had felt the effects of its bite in former years, and 
eschewed all native huts ever after, but as I was here again 
assailed in a European house, I shall detail the effects of the bite. 
These are, a tingling sensation of mingled pain and itching, 
which commences ascending the limb until the poison imbibed 
reaches the abdomen, where it soon causes violent vomiting and 
purging. Where these effects do not follow, as we found after- 
wards at Tete, fever sets in; and I was assured by intelligent 
Portuguese there, that death has sometimes been the result of 
this fever. The anxiety my friends at Tete manifested to keep 
my men out of the reach of the tampans of the village, made it 
evident that they had seen cause to dread this insignificant insect. 
The only inconvenience I afterwards suffered from this bite, was 
the continuance of the tingling sensation in the point bitten, for 
about a week. 

May 12th. — As we were about to start this morning, the Com- 
mandant, Senhor Arsenio, provided bread and meat most bounti- 
fully for my use on the way to the next station, and sent two 
militia soldiers as guides, instead of our Cassange corporal, who 
left us here. About mid-day we asked for shelter from the sun 
in the house of Senhor Mellot, at Zangu, and though I was unable 
to sit and engage in conversation, I found on rising from his 
couch that he had at once proceeded to cook a fowl for my use ; 
and at parting he gave me a glass of wine, which prevented the 
violent fit of shivering I expected that afternoon. The universal 
hospitality of the Portuguese was most gratifying, as it was quite 
unexpected. And even now, as I copy my journal, I remember 
it all with a glow of gratitude. 

We spent Sunday, the 14th of May, at Cabinda, which is one of 
the stations of the sub-commandants, who are placed at different 
points in each district of Angola, as assistants of the head-com- 
mandant, or chefe. It is situated in a beautiful glen, and sur- 
rounded by plantations of bananas and manioc. The country 
was gradually becoming more picturesque, the farther we pro- 
ceeded west. The ranges of lofty blue mountains of Libollo, 



384 DISTRICT OF GOLUNGO ALTO. Chap. XIX. 

which in coming towards Ambaca we had seen thirty or forty 
miles to our south, were now shut from our view by others nearer 
at hand, and the grey ranges of Cahenda and Kiwe, which, while 
we were in Ambaca, stood clearly defined eight or ten miles off to 
the north, were now close upon our right. As we looked back 
towards the open pastoral country of Ambaca, the broad green 
gently undulating plains seemed in a hollow surrounded on all 
sides by rugged mountains, and as we went westward we were 
entering upon quite a wild-looking mountainous district called 
Golungo Alto. 

We met numbers of Mambari on their way back to Bihe. 
Some of them had belonged to the parties which had penetrated 
as far as Linyanti, and foolishly showed their displeasure at the 
prospect of the Makololo preferring to go to the coast markets 
themselves, to intrusting them with their ivory. The Mambari 
repeated the tale of the mode in which the white men are said 
to trade. " The ivory is left on the shore in the evening, and 
next morning the seller finds a quantity of goods placed there 
in its stead by the white men who live in the sea." "Now," 
added they to my men, " how can you Makololo trade with 
these ' Mermen ' ? Can you enter into the sea, and tell them to 
come ashore ? " It was remarkable to hear this idea repeated 
so near the sea as we now were. My men replied that they 
only wanted to see for themselves ; and as they were now getting 
some light on the nature of the trade carried on by the Mambari, 
they were highly amused on perceiving the reasons why the 
Mambari would rather have met them on the Zambesi, than so 
near the sea-coast. 

There is something so exhilarating to one of Highland blood in 
being near or on high mountains, that I forgot my fever as we 
wended our way among the lofty tree-covered masses of mica 
schist, which form the highlands around the romantic residence 
of the Chefe of Golungo Alto. (Lat. 9° 8' 30" S., long. 15° 
2' E.) The whole district is extremely beautiful. The hills are 
all bedecked with trees of various hues of foliage, and among 
them towers the graceful palm, which yields the oil of commerce 
for making our soaps, and the intoxicating toddy. Some clusters 
of hills look like the waves of the sea driven into a narrow 
open bay, and have assumed the same form as if, when all 



Chap. XIX. CARRIERS. 385 

were chopping up perpendicularly, they had suddenly been con- 
gealed. The cottages of the natives, perched on the tops of 
many of the hillocks, looked as if the owners possessed an eye 
for the romantic, but they were probably influenced more by 
the desire to overlook their gardens, and keep their families out 
of the reach of the malaria, which is supposed to prevail most on 
the banks of the numerous little streams which run among the 
hills. 

We were most kindly received by the Commandant, Lieutenant 
Antonio Canto e Castro, a young gentleman whose whole sub- 
sequent conduct will ever make me regard him with great 
affection. Like every other person of intelligence whom I had 
met, he lamented deeply the neglect with which this fine country 
has been treated. This district contained, by the last census, 
26,000 hearths, or fires ; and if to each hearth we reckon four 
souls, we have a population of 104,000. The number of carre- 
gadores (carriers) who may be ordered out at the pleasure of 
Government to convey merchandise to the coast is in this dis- 
trict alone about 6000, yet there is no good road in existence. 
This system of compulsory carriage of merchandise, was adopted 
in consequence of the increase in numbers and activity of 
our cruisers, which took place in 1845. Each trader who went, 
previous to that year, into the interior, in the pursuit of his 
calling, proceeded on the plan of purchasing ivory and bees'- 
wax, and a sufficient number of slaves to carry these commo- 
dities. The whole were intended for exportation as soon as 
the trader reached the coast. But when the more stringent 
measures of 1845 came into operation, and rendered the exporta- 
tion of slaves almost impossible, there being no roads proper for 
the employment of wheel conveyances, this new system of com- 
pulsory carriage of ivory and bees'-wax to the coast was resorted 
to by the Government of Loanda. A trader who requires two 
or three hundred carriers to convey his merchandise to the coast, 
now applies to the General Government for aid. An order is 
sent to the Commandant of a district to furnish the number 
required. Each head-man of the villages to whom the order is 
transmitted, must furnish from five to twenty or thirty men, 
according to the proportion that his people bear to the entire 
population of the district. For this accommodation the trader 

2 c 



386 GOLUNGO ALTO. Chap. XIX. 

must pay a tax to the Government of 1000 reis, or about three 
shillings per load carried. The trader is obliged to pay the 
carrier also the sum of 50 reis, or about twopence a day, for his 
sustenance. And as a day's journey is never more than from 
eight to ten miles, the expense which must be incurred for this 
compulsory labour is felt to be heavy by those who were accus- 
stomed to employ slave labour alone. Yet no effort has been 
made to form a great line of road for wheel carriages. The first 
great want of a country has not been attended to, and no develop- 
ment of its vast resources has taken place. The fact, however, 
of a change from one system of carriage to another, taken in con- 
nection with the great depreciation in the prices of slaves near 
this coast, proves the effectiveness of our efforts at repressing the 
slave-trade on the ocean. 

The latitude of Golungo Alto, as observed at the residence 
of the Commandant, was 9° 8' 30" S., longitude 15° 2' E. A 
few days' rest with this excellent young man, enabled me to 
regain much of my strength, and I could look with pleasure on 
the luxuriant scenery before his door. We were quite shut in 
among green hills, many of which were cultivated up to their tops 
with manioc, coffee, cotton, ground-nuts, bananas, pine-apples, 
guavas, papaws, custard-apples, pitangas, and jambos, fruits 
brought from South America by the former missionaries. The 
high hills all around, with towering palms on many points, made 
this spot appear more like the Bay of Kio de Janeiro in miniature 
than any scene I ever saw ; and all who have seen that, confess 
it to be unequalled in the world beside. The fertility evident 
in every spot of this district was quite marvellous to behold, but 
I shall reserve further notices of this region till our return from 
Loanda. 

We left Golungo Alto on the 24th of May, the winter in these 
parts. Every evening, clouds come rolling in great masses over 
the mountains in the west, and pealing thunder accompanies the 
fall of rain during the night or early in the morning. The clouds 
generally remain on the hills till the morning is well spent, so 
that we become familiar with morning mists, a thing we never 
once saw at Kolobeng. The thermometer stands at 80° by day, 
but sinks as low as 76° by night. 

In going westward we crossed several fine little gushing streams 



Chap. XIX. COFFEE ESTATE. 387 

which never dry. They unite in the Luinha (pronounced Lu- 
eenya) and Lucalla. As they flow over many little cascades, 
they might easily be turned to good account, but they are all 
allowed to run on idly to the ocean. We passed through forests 
of gigantic timber, and at an open space named Cambondo, about 
eight miles from Golungo Alto, found numbers of carpenters 
converting these lofty trees into planks, in exactly the same 
manner as was followed by the illustrious Eobinson Crusoe. A 
tree of three or four feet in diameter, and forty or fifty feet up to 
the nearest branches, was felled. It was then cut into lengths of 
a few feet, and split into thick junks, which again were reduced 
to planks an inch thick by persevering labour with the axe. The 
object of the carpenters was to make little chests, and they drive 
a constant- trade in them at Cambondo. When finished with 
hinges, lock, and key, all of their own manufacture, one costs 
only a shilling and eightpence. My men were so delighted with 
them that they carried several of them on their heads all the way 
to Linyanti. 

At Trombeta, we were pleased to observe a great deal of taste 
displayed by the Sub-Commandant, in the laying out of his 
ground, and adornment of his house with flowers. This trifling 
incident was the more pleasing, as it was the first attempt at 
neatness I had seen since leaving the establishment of Mozinkwa 
in Londa. Bows of trees had been planted along each side of 
the road, with pine-apples and flowers between. This arrange- 
ment I had an opportunity of seeing in several other districts of 
this country, for there is no difficulty in raising any plant or tree, 
if it is only kept from being choked by weeds. 

This gentleman had now a fine estate which but a few years 
ago was a forest, and cost him only 161. He had planted about 
900 coffee-trees upon it, and as these begin to yield in three 
years from being planted, and in six attain their maximum, I 
have no doubt but that ere now his 161. yields him sixty fold. 
All sorts of fruit-trees and grape-vines yield their fruit twice 
in each year, without any labour or irrigation being bestowed on 
them. All grains and vegetables if only sown do the same, and if 
advantage is taken of the mists of winter, even three crops of pulse 
may be raised. Cotton was now standing in the pods in his fields, 
and he did not seem to care about it. I understood him to say 

2 c 2 



388 FEARS OF THE MAKOLOLO. Chap. XIX. 

that this last plant flourishes, but the wet of one of the two rainy 
seasons with which this country is favoured, sometimes proves 
troublesome to the grower. I am not aware whether wheat has 
ever been tried, but I saw both figs and grapes bearing well. The 
great complaint of all cultivators is the want of a good road to 
carry their produce to market. Here all kinds of food are re- 
markably cheap. 

Farther on we left the mountainous country, and, as we de- 
scended towards the west coast, saw the lands assuming a more 
sterile uninviting aspect. On our right ran the river Senza, which 
nearer the sea takes the name of Bengo. It is about fifty yards 
broad, and navigable for canoes. The low plains adjacent to its 
banks are protected from inundation by embankments, and the 
population is entirely occupied in raising food and fruits for ex- 
portation to Loanda by means of canoes. The banks are infested 
by myriads of the most ferocious mosquitoes I ever met. Not 
one of our party could get a snatch of sleep. I was taken into 
the house of a Portuguese, but was soon glad to make my escape 
and lie across the path on the lee side of the fire, where the 
smoke blew over my body. My host wondered at my want of 
taste, and I at his want of feeling, for, to our astonishment, he, 
and the other inhabitants, had actually become used to what was 
at least equal to a nail through the heel of one's boot, or the 
tooth-ache. 

As we were now drawing near to the sea, my companions were 
looking at everything in a serious light. One of them asked me 
if we should all have an opportunity of watching each other at 
Loanda. " Suppose one went for water, would the others see if he 
were kidnapped ? " I replied, " I see what you are driving at ; 
and if you suspect me, you may return, for I am as ignorant of 
Loanda as you are : but nothing will happen to you but what 
happens to myself. We have stood by each other hitherto, and 
will do so to the last." The plains adjacent to Loanda are some- 
what elevated and comparatively sterile. On coming across these 
we first beheld the sea : my companions looked upon the bound- 
less ocean with awe. On describing their feelings afterwards, they 
remarked that " we marched along with our father, believing that 
what the ancients had always told us was true, that the world has 
no end ; but all at once the world said to us, ' I am finished ; 



Chap. XIX. WELCOME TO LOANDA. 389 

there is no more of me !' " They had always imagined that the 
world was one extended plain without limit. 

They were now somewhat apprehensive of suffering want, and 
I was unable to allay their fears with any promise of supply, for 
my own mind was depressed by disease and care. The fever had 
induced a state of chronic dysentery, so troublesome that I could 
not remain on the ox more than ten minutes at a time ; and as 
we came down the declivity above the city of Loanda on the 31st 
of May, I was labouring under great depression of spirits, as I 
understood that, in a population of twelve thousand souls, there 
was but one genuine English gentleman. I naturally felt anxious 
to know whether he were possessed of good nature, or was one 
of those crusty mortals, one would rather not meet at all. 

This gentleman, Mr. Gabriel, our commissioner for the sup- 
pression of the slave-trade, had kindly forwarded an invitation, to 
meet me on the way from Cassange, but unfortunately it crossed 
me on the road. When we entered his porch, I was delighted to 
see a number of flowers cultivated carefully, and inferred from 
tins circumstance that he was, what I soon discovered him to be, 
a real whole-hearted Englishman. 

Seeing me ill, he benevolently offered me his bed. Never shall 
I forget the luxuriant pleasure I enjoyed in feeling myself again 
on a good English couch, after six months' sleeping on the ground. 
I was soon asleep ; and Mr. Gabriel, coming in almost immediately, 
rejoiced at the soundness of my repose.

In the hope that a short enjoyment of Mr. Gabriel's generous

than ever, even while enjoying rest. Several Portuguese gentle- 
men called on me shortly after my arrival ; and the Bishop of 
Angola, the Right Reverend Joaquim Moreira Reis, then the 
acting governor of the province, sent his secretary to do the same, 
and likewise to offer the services of the government physician. 

Some of her Majesty's cruisers soon came into the port, and, 
seeing the emaciated condition to which I was reduced, offered to 
convey me to St. Helena or homewards ; but though I had reached 
the coast, I had found that, in consequence of the great amount 
of forest, rivers, and marsh, there was no possibility of a highway 
for waggons, and I had brought a party of Sekeletu's people with 



Chap. XX. MAKOLOLO'S VISIT TO SHIPS. 391 

me, and found the tribes near the Portuguese settlement so very 
unfriendly, that it would be altogether impossible for my men to 
return alone. I therefore resolved to decline the tempting offers 
of my naval friends, and take back my Makololo companions to 
their chief, with a view of trying to make a path from his 
country to the east coast by means of the great river Zambesi 
or Leeambye. 

I however gladly availed myself of the medical assistance of Mr. 
Cockin, the surgeon of the " Polyphemus," at the suggestion of 
his commander, Captain Phillips. Mr. Cochin's treatment, aided 
by the exhilarating presence of the warm-hearted naval officers, 
and Mr. Gabriel's unwearied hospitality and care, soon brought 
me round again. On the 14th I was so far well as to call on the 
bishop, in company with my party, who were arrayed in new robes 
of striped cotton cloth and red caps, all presented to them by 
Mr. Gabriel. He received us, as head of the provisional govern- 
ment, in the grand hall of the palace. He put many intelligent 
questions respecting the Makololo ; and then gave them free per- 
mission to come to Loanda as often as they pleased. This inter- 
view pleased the Makololo extremely. 

Every one remarked the serious deportment of the Makololo. 
They viewed the large stone houses and churches in the vicinity 
of the great ocean with awe. A house with two stories was, until 
now, beyond their comprehension. In explanation of this strange 
thing, I had always been obliged to use the word for hut ; and as 
huts are constructed by the poles being let into the earth, they 
never could comprehend how the poles of one hut could be 
founded upon the roof of another, or how men could live in the 
upper story, with the conical roof of the lower one in the middle. 
Some Makololo, who had visited my little house at Kolobeng, 
in trying to describe it to their countrymen at Linyanti, said, 
" It is not a hut ; it is a mountain with several caves in it." 

Commander Bedingfeld and Captain Skene invited them to 
visit their vessels, the " Pluto " and " Philomel." Knowing their 
fears, I told them that no one need go if he entertained the least 
suspicion of foul play. Nearly the whole party went ; and when 
on deck, I pointed to the sailors, and said, " Now these are all 
my countrymen, sent by our Queen for the purpose of putting 
down the trade of those that buy and sell black men." They 



392 MAKOLOLO AT MASS. Chap. XX. 

replied, "Truly! they are just like you!" aud all their fears 
seemed to vanish at once, for they went forward amongst the men, 
and the jolly tars, acting much as the Makololo would have done 
in similar circumstances, handed them a share of the bread and 
beef which they had for dinner. The commander allowed them 
to fire off a cannon; and having the most exalted ideas of its 
power, they were greatly pleased when I told them, " That is 
what they put down the slave-trade with." The size of the brig- 
of-war amazed them. " It is not a canoe at all : it is a town !" 
The sailors' deck they named " the Kotla ;" and then, as a climax 
to their description of this great ark, added, " and what sort of 
a town is it that you must climb up into with a rope ?" 

The effect of the politeness of the officers and men on their 
minds was most beneficial. They had behaved with the greatest 
kindness to me all the way from Linyanti ; and I now rose rapidly 
in their estimation, for, whatever they may have surmised before, 
they now saw that I was respected among my own countrymen, 
and always afterwards treated me with the greatest deference. 

On the 15th there was a procession and service of the mass in 
the cathedral ; and wishing to show my men a place of worship, 
I took them to the church, which now serves as the chief one of 
the See of Angola and Congo. There is an impression on some 
minds, that a gorgeous ritual is better calculated to inspire devo- 
tional feelings, than the simple forms of the Protestant worship. 
But here the frequent genuflexions, changing of positions, burning 
of incense, with the priests' backs turned to the people, the laugh- 
ing, talking, and manifest irreverence of the singers, with firing 
of guns, &c, did not convey to the minds of my men the idea of 
adoration. I overheard them, in talking to each other, remark 
that " they had seen the white men charming their demons ;" a 
phrase identical with one they had used when seeing the Balonda 
beating drums before their idols. 

In the beginning of August I suffered a severe relapse, which 
reduced me to a mere skeleton. I was then unable to attend to 
my men for a considerable time ; but when in convalescence from 
this last attack, I was thankful to find that I was free from that 
lassitude, which, in my first recovery, showed the continuance of 
the malaria in the system. I found that my men, without prompt- 
ing, had established a brisk trade in firewood. They sallied forth 



Chap. XX. THEIR JUDGMENT RESPECTING G0013S. 393 

at cock-crowing in the mornings, and by daylight reached the 
uncultivated parts of the adjacent country, collected a bundle of 
firewood, and returned to the city. It was then divided into 
smaller fagots, and sold to the inhabitants ; and as they gave 
larger quantities than the regular wood-carriers, they found no 
difficulty in selling. A ship freighted with coal for the cruisers 
having arrived from England, Mr. Gabriel procured them employ- 
ment in unloading her at sixpence a-day. They continued at this 
work for upwards of a month, and nothing could exceed their 
astonishment at the vast amount of cargo one ship contained. 
As they themselves always afterwards expressed it, they had 
laboured every day from sunrise to sunset for a moon and a half, 
unloading, as quickly as they could, " stones that burn," and were 
tired out, still leaving plenty in her. With the money so obtained 
they purchased clothing, beads, and other articles to take back to 
their own country. Their ideas of the value of different kinds of 
goods, rather astonished those who had dealt only with natives on 
the coast. Hearing it stated with confidence that the Africans 
preferred the thinnest fabrics, provided they had gaudy colours 
and a large extent of surface, the idea was so new to my expe- 
rience in the interior, that I dissented, and, in order to show 
the superior good sense of the Makololo, took them to the shop 
of Mr. Schut. When he showed them the amount of general 
goods which they might procure at Loanda for a single tusk, 
I requested them, without assigning any reason, to point out the 
fabrics they prized most. They all, at once selected the strongest 
pieces of English calico and other cloths, showing that they had 
regard to strength without reference to colour. I believe that 
most of the Bechuana nation would have done the same. But I 
was assured that the people near the coast, with whom the Por- 
tuguese have to deal, have not so much regard to durability. 
Tins probably arises from calico being the chief circulating 
medium ; quantity being then of more importance than quality. 

During the period of my indisposition, the bishop sent fre- 
quently to make inquiries, and as soon as I was able to walk, I 
went to thank him for Ins civilities. His whole conversation and 
conduct showed him to be a man of great benevolence and kind- 
ness of heart. Alluding to my being a Protestant, he stated that 
he was a Catholic from conviction ; and though sorry to see others, 



394 ST. PAUL DE LOANDA. Chap. XX. 

like myself, following another path, he entertained no uncharitable 
feelings, nor would he ever sanction persecuting measures. He 
compared the various sects of Christians, in their way to heaven, 
to a number of individuals choosing to pass down the different 
streets of Loanda to one of the churches, — all would arrive at the 
same point at last. His good influence both in the city and the 
country is universally acknowledged : he was promoting the esta- 
blishment of schools, winch, though formed more on the monastic 
principle than Protestants might approve, will no doubt be a 
blessing. He was likewise successfully attempting to abolish the 
non-marriage custom of the country ; and several marriages had 
taken place in Loanda among those who but for his teaching 
would have been content with concubinage. 

St. Paul de Loanda has been a very considerable city, but is 
now in a state of decay. It contains about twelve thousand inha- 
bitants, most of whom are people of colour.* There are various 
evidences of its former magnificence, especially two cathedrals, 
one of which, once a Jesuit college, is now converted into a work- 
shop ; and in passing the other we saw with sorrow a number of 
oxen feeding within its stately walls. Three forts continue in a 
good state of repair. Many large stone houses are to be found. 
The palace of the governor and government offices are com- 
modious structures ; but nearly all the houses of the native inha- 
bitants are of wattle and daub. Trees are planted all over the 
town for the sake of shade ; and the city presents an imposing 
appearance from the sea. It is provided with an effective police ; 
and the custom-house department is extremely well managed. 
All parties agree in representing the Portuguese authorities as 
both polite and obliging ; and if ever any inconvenience is felt by 
strangers visiting the port, it must be considered the fault of the 
system, and not of the men. 

The harbour is formed by the low sandy island of Loanda, 
which is inhabited by about 1300 souls, upwards of 600 of whom 
are industrious native fishermen, who supply the city with abun- 

* From the census of 1850-51 we find the population of this city arranged 
thus : — 830 whites, only 160 of whom are females. This is the largest col- 
lection of whites in the country, for Angola itself contains only about 1000 
whites. There are 2400 half-castes in Loanda, and only 120 of them slaves ; 
and there are 9000 blacks, more than 5000 of whom are slaves. 



Ciiap. XX. CUSTOM-HOUSE ARRANGEMENTS. 395 

dance of good fish daily. The space between it and the main- 
land, on which the city is built, is the station for ships. When a 
high south-west wind blows, the waves of the ocean dash over 
part of the island, and, driving large quantities of sand before 
them, gradually fill up the harbour. Great quantities of soil are 
also washed in the rainy season from the heights above the city, 
so that the port, which once contained water sufficient to float the 
largest ships close to the custom-house, is now at low water dry. 
The ships are compelled to anchor about a mile north of their old 
station. Nearly all the water consumed in Loanda is brought from 
the river Bengo by means of launches, the only supply that the 
city affords being from some deep wells of slightly brackish water ; 
unsuccessful attempts have been made by different governors to 
finish a canal, which the Dutch, while in possession of Loanda 
during the seven years preceding 1648, had begun, to bring 
water from the river Coanza to the city. There is not a single 
English merchant at Loanda, and only two American. This is 
the more remarkable, as nearly all the commerce is carried on 
by means of English calico brought hither via Lisbon. Several 
English houses attempted to establish a trade about 1845, and 
accepted bills on Bio de Janeiro in payment for their goods, but 
the increased activity of our cruisers had such an effect upon the 
mercantile houses of that city, that most of them failed. The 
English merchants lost all, and Loanda got a bad name in the 
commercial world in consequence. 

One of the arrangements of the custom-house may have had 
some influence in preventing English trade. Ships coming here 
must be consigned to some one on the spot ; the consignee re- 
ceives one hundred dollars per mast, and he generally makes a 
great deal more for himself, by putting a percentage on boats and 
men hired for loading and unloading, and on every item that 
passes through his hands. The port charges are also rendered 
heavy by twenty dollars being charged as a perquisite of the Secre- 
tary of Government, with a fee for the chief physician, something 
for the hospital, custom-house officers, guards, &c. &c. But with 
all these drawbacks, the Americans carry on a brisk and profitable 
trade in calico, biscuit, flour, butter, &c. &c. 

The Portuguese home Government has not generally received 
the credit for sincerity in suppressing the slave-trade, winch I 



396 CONVICT SOLDIERS. Chap. XX. 

conceive to be its due. In 1839 my friend Mr. Gabriel saw 37 
slave-ships lying in this harbour, waiting for their cargoes, under 
the protection of the guns of the forts. At that time slavers had 
to wait many months at a time for a human freight, and a certain 
sum per head was paid to the Government for all that were ex- 
ported. The duties derived from the exportation of slaves far 
exceeded those from other commerce, and by agreeing to the 
suppression of this profitable traffic, the Government actually 
sacrificed the chief part of the export revenue. Since that period, 
however, the revenue from lawful commerce has very much ex- 
ceeded that on slaves. The intentions of the home Portuguese 
Government, however good, cannot be fully carried out under the 
present system. The pay of the officers is so very small, that 
they are nearly all obliged to engage in trade ; and owing to the 
lucrative nature of the slave-trade, the temptation to engage in it 
is so powerful, that the philanthropic statesmen of Lisbon need 
hardly expect to have their humane and enlightened views car- 
ried out. The law, for instance, lately promulgated for the 
abolition of the carrier system (carregadores) is but one of 
several equally humane enactments against this mode of com- 
pulsory labour, but there is very little probability of the benevo- 
lent intentions of the legislature being carried into effect. 

Loanda is regarded somewhat as a penal settlement, and those 
who leave their native land for this country do so with the hope 
of getting rich in a few years, and then returning home. They 
have thus no motive for seeking the permanent welfare of the 
country. The Portuguese law preventing the subjects of any 
other nation from holding landed property unless they become 
naturalized, the country has neither the advantage of native nor 
foreign enterprise, and remains very much in the same state as 
our allies found it in 1575. Nearly all the European soldiers 
sent out are convicts, and, contrary to what might be expected 
from men in their position, behave remarkably well. A few riots 
have occurred, but nothing at all so serious as have taken place 
in our own penal settlements. It is a remarkable fact that the 
whole of the arms of Loanda are every night in the hands of those 
who have been convicts. Various reasons for this mild behaviour 
are assigned by the officers, but none of these, when viewed in 
connection with our own experience in Australia, appear to be 



Chap. XX. PKESENTS FOR SEKELETU. 397 

valid. Eeligion seems to have no connexion with the change. 
Perhaps the climate may have some influence in subduing their 
turbulent disposition, for the inhabitants generally are a timid 
race ; they are not at all so brave as our Caffres. The people of 
Ambriz ran away like a flock of sheep, and allowed the Portu- 
guese to take possession of their copper-mines and country, 
without striking a blow. If we must have convict settlements, 
attention to the climate might be of advantage in the selection. 
Here even bulls are much tamer than with us. I never met with 
a ferocious one in this country, and the Portuguese use them 
generally for riding ; an ox is seldom seen. 

The objects which I had in view in opening up the country, as 
stated in a few notes of my journey, published in the news- 
papers of Angola, so commended themselves to the general 
government and merchants of Loanda, that, at the instance of 
his Excellency the Bishop, a handsome present for Sekeletu was 
granted by the Board of Public Works (Junta da Fazenda Pub- 
lica). It consisted of a colonel's complete uniform and a horse for 
the chief, and suits of clothing for all the men who accompanied 
me. The merchants also made a present, by public subscription, 
of handsome specimens of all their articles of trade, and two 
donkeys, for the purpose of introducing the breed into his country, 
as tsetse cannot kill this beast of burden. These presents were 
accompanied by letters from the Bishop and merchants ; and I 
was kindly favoured with letters of recommendation to the Por- 
tuguese authorities in Eastern Africa. 

I took with me a good stock of cotton-cloth, fresh supplies of 
ammunition and beads, and gave each of my men a musket. As 
my companions had amassed considerable quantities of goods, 
they were unable to carry mine, but the bishop furnished me 
with twenty carriers, and sent forward orders to all the com- 
mandants of the districts through which we were to pass, tp 
render me every assistance in their power. Being now supplied 
with a good new tent made by my friends on board the Philomel, 
we left Loanda on the 20th September, 1854, and passed round 
by sea to the mouth of the river Bengo. Ascending this river, 
we went through the district in which stand the ruins of the 
convent of St. Antonio ; thence into Icollo i Bengo, which con- 
tains a population of 6530 blacks, 172 mulattoes, and 11 whites,

and is so named from having been the residence of a former 
native king. The proportion of slaves is only 3*38 per cent, of 
the inhabitants. The commandant of this place, Laurence Jose 
Marquis, is a frank old soldier and a most hospitable man ; he is 
one of the few who secure the universal approbation of their fellow- 
men for stern unflinching honesty, and has risen from the ranks to 
be a major in the army. We were accompanied thus far by our 
generous host, Edmund Gabriel, Esq., who, by his unwearied 
attentions to myself, and liberality in supporting my men, had 
become endeared to all our hearts. My men were strongly im- 
pressed with a sense of his goodness, and often spoke of him. in 
terms of admiration all the way to Linyanti. 

While here we visited a large sugar manufactory belonging to 
a lady, Donna Anna da Sousa. The flat alluvial lands on the 
banks of the Senza or Bengo are well adapted for raising sugar- 
cane, and this lady had a surprising number of slaves, but some- 
how the establishment was far from being in a flourishing con- 
dition. It presented such a contrast to the free-labour establish- 
ments of the Mauritius which I have since seen, where, with not 
one tenth of the number of hands, or such good soil, a man of 
colour had, in one year, cleared 5000?. by a single crop, that I 
quote the fact in hopes it may meet the eye of Donna Anna. 

The water of the river is muddy, and it is observed that such 
rivers have many more mosquitoes than those which have clear 
water. It was remarked to us here that these insects are much 
more numerous at the period of new moon than at other times ; 
at any rate we were all thankful to get away from the Senza and 
its insect plagues. 

The whole of this part of the country is composed of marly 
tufa, containing the same kind of shells as those at present alive 
in the seas. As we advanced eastward and ascended the higher 
lands, we found eruptive trap, which had tilted up immense 
masses of mica and sandstone schists. The mica schist almost 
always dipped towards the interior of the country, forming those 
mountain-ranges of which we have already spoken as giving a 
highland character to the district of Golungo Alto. The trap 
has frequently run through the gorges made in the upheaved 
rocks, and at the points of junction between the igneous and 
older rocks, there are large quantities of strongly magnetic iron- 



Chap. XX. SPINNING AND WEAVING. 399 

ore. The clayey soil formed by the disintegration of the mica 
schist and trap, is the favourite soil for the coffee, and it is on 
these mountain sides, and others possessing a similar red clay soil, 
that this plant has propagated itself so widely. The meadow- 
lands adjacent to the Senza and Coanza being underlaid by that 
marly tufa which abounds towards the coast, and containing the 
same shells, show that previous to the elevation of that side of the 
country, this region possessed some deeply indented bays. 

28th September, Kalungwembo. — We were still on the same 
path by which we had come, and, there being no mosquitoes, we 
could now better enjoy the scenery. Kanges of hills occupy both 
sides of our path, and the fine level road is adorned with a beau- 
tiful red flower named Bolcamaria. The markets or sleeping- 
places are well supplied with provisions by great numbers of 
women, every one of whom is seen spinning cotton with a spindle 
and distaff, exactly like those which were in use amongst the 
ancient Egyptians. A woman is scarcely ever seen going to the 
fields, though with a pot on her head, a child on her back, and 
the hoe over her shoulder, but she is employed in this way. The 
cotton was brought to the market for sale, and I bought a pound 
for a penny. This was the price demanded, and probably double 
what they ask from each other. We saw the cotton growing 
luxuriantly all around the market-places from seeds dropped 
accidentally. It is seen also about the native huts, and, so far as 
I could learn, it was the American cotton so influenced by 
climate as to be perennial. We met in the road natives passing 
with bundles of cops, or spindles full of cotton thread, and these 
they were carrying to other parts to be woven into cloth. The 
women are the spinners, and the men perform the weaving. 
Each web is about 5 feet long, and 15 or 18 inches wide. The 
loom is of the simplest construction, being nothing but two beams 
placed one over the other, the web standing perpendicularly. 
The threads of the web are separated by means of a thin wooden 
lath, and the woof passed through, by means of the spindle on 
which it has been wound in spinning. 

The mode of spinning and weaving in Angola, and indeed 
throughout South Central Africa, is so very like the same occu- 
pations in the hands of the ancient Egyptians, that I introduce 
a woodcut from the interesting work of Sir Gardner Wilkinson.

Numbers of other articles are brought for sale to these sleeping- 
places. The native smiths there carry on their trade. I bought 
ten very good table-knives made of country iron for two pence 
each. 

Labour is extremely cheap, for I was assured that even car- 
penters, masons, smiths, &c, might be hired for fourpence a day, 
and agriculturists would gladly work for half that sum.*

COFFEE-PLANTATIONS.

Being anxious to obtain some more knowledge of tins inter- 
esting country, and its ancient missionary establishments, than the 
line of route by which we had come afforded, I resolved to visit 
the town of Massangano, which is situated to the south of Golungo 
Alto, and at the confluence of the rivers Lucalla and Coanza. 
Tins led me to pass through the district of Cazengo, which is 
rather famous for the abundance and excellence of its coffee. 
Extensive coffee plantations were found to exist on the sides of 
the several lofty mountains that compose tins district. They 
were not planted by the Portuguese. The Jesuit and other mis- 
sionaries are known to have brought some of the fine old Mocha 
seed, and these have propagated themselves far and wide ; hence 
the excellence of the Angola coffee. Some have asserted that, as 
new plantations were constantly discovered even during the period 
of our visit, the coffee-tree was indigenous ; but the fact that 
pine-apples, bananas, yams, orange-trees, custard apple-trees, 
pitangas, guavas, and other South American trees, were found by 
me in the same localities with the recently-discovered coffee, 
would seem to indicate that all foreign trees must have been

These people possess 300 idol-houses, 600 sheep, 5000 goats, 500 oxen, 398 
gardens, 25,120 hearths. The authorities find great difficulty in getting the 
people to furnish a correct account of their numbers. This census is quoted 
merely for the purpose of giving a general idea of the employments of the 
inhabitants. 

The following is taken from the census of Icollo i Bengo, and is added for 
a similar reason : —

those who have not been married

21 basket-makers. 



The cattle in the district are : 10 asses, 401 oxen, 492 cows, 3933 sheep, 
1699 goats, 909 swine ; and as an annual tax is levied of sixpence per head on 
all stock, it is probable that the returns are less than the reality.

introduced by the same agency. It is known that the Jesuits 
also introduced many other trees for the sake of their timber 
alone. Numbers of these have spread over the country, some 
have probably died out, and others failed to spread, like a lonely 
specimen winch stands in what was the Botanic Garden of Loanda, 
and, though most useful in yielding a substitute for frankincense, 
is the only one of the kind in Africa. 

A circumstance which would facilitate the extensive propagation 
of the coffee on the proper clay soil, is this. The seed, when buried 
beneath the soil, generally dies, while that which is sown broad- 
cast, with no covering except the shade of the trees, vegetates 
readily. The agent in sowing in this case is a bird, winch eats 
the outer rind, and throws the kernel on the ground. This plant 
cannot bear the direct rays of the sun, consequently, when a 
number of the trees are discovered in a forest, all that is necessary 
is to clear away the brushwood, and leave as many of the tall 
forest-trees as will afford good shade to the coffee-plants below. 
The fortunate discoverer has then a flourishing coffee plantation. 

This district, small though it be, having only a population of 
13,822, of whom ten only are white, nevertheless yields an annual 
tribute to the Government of thirteen hundred cotton cloths, each 
5 feet by 18 or 20 inches, of then own growth and manufacture. 

Accompanied by the Commandant of Cazengo, who was well 
acquainted with tins part of the country, I proceeded in a canoe 
down the river Lucalla to Massangano. This river is about 85 
yards wide, and navigable for canoes from its confluence with 
the Coanza, to about six miles above the point where it receives 
the Luinha. Near this latter point stand the strong massive 
ruins of an iron-foundry, erected in the times (1768), and by 
the order, of the famous Marquis of Pombal. The whole of 
the buildings were constructed of stone, cemented with oil and 
lime. The dam for water-power was made of the same materials, 
and 27 feet high. This had been broken through by a flood, and 
solid blocks, many yards in length, were carried down the stream, 
affording an instructive example of the transporting power of 
water. There was nothing in the appearance of the place to 
indicate unhealthiness ; but eight Spanish and Swedish workmen, 
being brought hither for the purpose of instructing the natives in 
the art of smelting iron, soon fell victims to disease and " irregu- 



Chap. XX. BANKS OF THE LUCALLA. 403 

larities." The effort of the Marquis to improve the mode of 
manufacturing iron was thus rendered abortive. Labour and 
subsistence are, however, so very cheap that almost any amount 
of work can be executed, at a cost that renders expensive esta- 
blishments unnecessary. 

A party of native miners and smiths is still kept in the employ- 
ment of the Government, who, working the rich black magnetic 
iron-ore, produce for the Government, from 480 to 500 bars of 
good malleable iron every month. They are supported by the 
appropriation of a few thousands of a small fresh-water fish, 
called " cacusu," a portion of the tax levied upon the fishermen 
of the Coanza. This fish is so much relished in the country, that 
those who do not wish to eat them can easily convert them into 
money. The Commandant of the district of Massangano, for 
instance, has a right to a dish of three hundred every morning, as 
part of his salary. Shell-fish are also found in the Coanza, and 
the " Peixemulher," or woman-fish, of the Portuguese, which is 
probably a Manatee. 

The banks of the Lucalla are very pretty, well planted with 
orange-trees, bananas, and the palm (JElceis Guineensis) which 
yields the oil of commerce. Large plantations of maize, manioc, 
and tobacco, are seen along both banks, which are enlivened by 
the frequent appearance of native houses embosomed in dense 
shady groves, with little boys and girls playing about them. The 
banks are steep, the water having cut out its bed in dark red 
alluvial soil. Before every cottage a small stage is erected, to 
which the inhabitants may descend to draw water without danger 
from the alligators. Some have a little palisade made in the 
water for safety from these reptiles, and others use the shell of 
the fruit of the baobab-tree attached to a pole about ten feet long, 
with which, while standing on the high bank, they may draw 
water without fear of accident. 

Many climbing plants run up the lofty silk, cotton, and baobab 
trees, and hang their beautiful flowers in gay festoons on the 
branches. As we approach Massangano, the land on both banks 
of the Lucalla becomes very level, and large portions are left 
marshy after the annual floods ; but all is very fertile. As an 
illustration of the strength of the soil, I may state, that we saw 
tobacco-plants in gardens near the confluence eight feet high, and 

2 d 2 



404 MASSANGANO. Chap. XX. 

each plant had thirty-six leaves, which were eighteen inches long 
by six or eight inches broad. But it is not a pastoral district. In 
our descent we observed the tsetse, and consequently the people 
had no domestic animals, save goats. 

We found the town of Massangano on a tongue of rather high 
land, formed by the left bank of the Lucalla, and right bank of 
the Coanza, and received true Portuguese hospitality from Senhor 
Lubata. The town has more than a thousand inhabitants ; the 
district has 28,063, with only 315 slaves. It stands on a mound 
of calcareous tufa, containing great numbers of fossil shells, the 
most recent of which, resemble those found in the marly tufa close 
to the coast. The fort stands on the south side of the town, on a 
high perpendicular bank overhanging the Coanza. This river 
is here a noble stream, about a hundred and fifty yards wide, 
admitting navigation in large canoes from the bar at its mouth to 
Cambambe, some thirty miles above this town. There, a fine 
waterfall hinders farther ascent. Ten or twelve large canoes laden 
with country produce pass Massangano every day. Four galleons 
were constructed here as long ago as 1650, which must have been 
of good size, for they crossed the ocean to Rio Janeiro. 

Massangano district is well adapted for sugar and rice, while 
Cambambe is a very superior field for cotton ; but the bar at the 
mouth of the Coanza would prevent the approach of a steamer into 
this desirable region, though a small one could ply on it with ease 
when once in. It is probable that the objects of those who 
attempted to make a canal from Calumbo to Loanda, were not 
merely to supply that city with fresh water, but to afford facilities 
for transportation. The remains of the canal show it to have been 
made on a scale suited for the Coanza canoes. The Portuguese 
began another on a smaller scale in 1811, and, after three years' 
labour, had finished only 6000 yards. Nothing great or useful 
will ever be effected here, so long as men come merely to get 
rich, and then return to Portugal. 

The latitude of the town and fort of Massangano, is 9° 37' 46" 
S., being nearly the same as that of Cassange. The country 
between Loanda and this point being comparatively flat, a rail- 
road might be constructed at small expense. The level country 
is prolonged along the north bank of the Coanza, to the edge of 
the Cassange basin, and a railway carried thither would be con- 



Chap. XX. RUINS— THE FORT. 405 

venient for the transport of the products of the rich districts of 
Cassange, Pungo Andongo, Ambaca, Cambambe, Golungo Alto, 
Cazengo, Muchima, and Calumbo ; in a word, the whole of Angola 
and independent tribes adjacent to tins kingdom. 

The Portuguese merchants generally look to foreign enter- 
prise; and to their own Government, for the means by which 
tins amelioration might be effected; but, as I always stated to 
them when conversing on the subject, foreign capitalists would 
never run the risk, unless they saw the Angolese doing something 
for themselves, and the laws so altered that the subjects of other 
nations should enjoy the same privileges in the country with 
themselves. The Government of Portugal has indeed shown a 
wise and liberal policy by its permission for the alienation of 
the crown lands in Angola ; but the law giving it effect is so 
fenced round with limitations, and so deluged with verbiage, 
that to plain people it seems anything but a straightforward 
licence to foreigners to become bond fide landholders and culti- 
vators of the soil. At present the tolls paid on the different lines 
of road for ferries and bridges, are equal to the interest of large 
sums of money, though but a small amount has been expended in 
making available roads. 

There are two churches and a hospital in ruins at Massangano ; 
and the remains of two convents are pointed out, one of winch is 
said to have been an establishment of black Benedictines, which, 
if successful, considering the materials the brethren had to work 
on, must have been a laborious undertaking. There is neither 
priest nor schoolmaster in the town, but I was pleased to observe 
a number of children taught by one of the inhabitants. The 
cultivated lands attached to all these conventual establishments 
in Angola, are now rented by the Government of Loanda, and 
thither the bishop lately removed all the gold and silver vessels 
belonging to them. 

The fort of Massangano is small, but in good repair : it contains 
some very ancient guns, winch were loaded from the breech, and 
must have been formidable weapons in their time. The natives 
of tins country entertain a remarkable dread of great guns, and 
this tends much to the permanence of the Portuguese authority. 
They dread a cannon greatly, though the carriage be so rotten 



406 FIEES— THE KISAMAS. Chap. XX. 

that it would fall to pieces at the first shot ; the fort of Pungo 
Andongo is kept securely by camion perched on cross sticks 
alone ! 

Massangano was a very important town at the time the Dutch 
held forcible possession of Loanda and part of Angola ; but when, 
in the year 1648, the Dutch were expelled from this country by 
a small body of Portuguese, under the Governor Salvador Correa 
de Sa Benevides, Massangano was left to sink into its present 
decay. Since it was partially abandoned by the Portuguese, 
several baobab-trees have sprung up and attained a diameter of 
eighteen or twenty inches, and are about twenty feet high. No 
certain conclusion can be drawn from these instances, as it is not 
known at what time after 1648 they began to grow ; but their 
present size shows that their growth is not unusually slow. 

Several fires occurred during our stay, by the thatch having, 
through long exposure to a torrid sun, become like tinder. The 
roofs became ignited without any visible cause except the intense 
solar ray|, and excited terror in the minds of the mhabitants, as 
the slightest spark carried by the wind would have set the whole 
town in a blaze. There is not a single inscription on stone visible 
in Massangano. If destroyed to-morrow, no one could tell where 
it, and most Portuguese interior villages, stood, any more than we 
can do those of the Balonda. 

During the occupation of this town, the Coanza was used for 
the purpose of navigation, but their vessels were so frequently 
plundered by their Dutch neighbours, that, when they regained 
the good port of Loanda, they no longer made use of the river. 
We remained here four days, in hopes of obtaining an observation 
for the longitude, but at this season of the year the sky is almost 
constantly overcast by a thick canojjy of clouds of a milk-and- 
water hue ; tins continues until the rainy season (which was now 
close at hand) commences. 

The lands on the north side of the Coanza belong to the 
Quisamas (Kisamas), an independent tribe, which the Portuguese 
have not been able to subdue. The few who came under my 
observation possessed much of the Bushman or Hottentot feature, 
and were dressed in strips of soft bark hanging from the waist to 
the knee. They deal largely in salt, which their country pro- 



Chap. XX. DOMESTIC FOWL. 407 

duces in great abundance. It is brought in crystals of about 
12 inches long and 1J in diameter. This is hawked about every- 
where in Angola, and, next to calico, is the most common medium 
of barter. The Kisama are brave ; and when the Portuguese 
army followed them into their forests, they reduced the invaders 
to extremity by tapping all the reservoirs of water, which were no 
other than the enormous baobabs of the country, hollowed into 
cisterns. As the Kisama country is ill supplied with water other- 
wise, the Portuguese were soon obliged to retreat. Their country 
lying near to Massangano is low and marshy, but becomes more 
elevated in the distance, and beyond them He the lofty dark 
mountain-ranges of the Libollo, another powerful and independent 
people. Near Massangano I observed what seemed to be an 
effort of nature to furnish a variety of domestic fowls, more 
capable than the common kind, of bearing the heat of the sun. 
This was a hen and chickens, with * all then feathers curled 
upwards ; thus giving shade to the body without increasing 
the heat. They are here named " kisafu " by the native 
population, who pay a high price for them when they wish 
to offer them as a sacrifice, and by the Portuguese they are 
termed " arripiada," or shivering. There seems to be a tendency 
in nature to afford varieties adapted to the convenience of man. 
A khid of very short-legged fowl among the Boers was obtained, 
in consequence of observing that such were more easily caught 
for transportation, in then* frequent removals in search of pasture. 
A similar instance of securing a variety, occurred with the short- 
limbed sheep in America. 

Returning by ascending the Lucalla into Cazengo, we had an 
opportunity of visiting several flourishing coffee plantations, and 
observed that several men, who had begun with no capital but 
honest industry, had in the course of a few years acquired a com- 
fortable subsistence. One of these, Mr. Pinto, generously furnished 
me with a good supply of his excellent coffee, and my men with a 
breed of rabbits to carry to their own country. Their lands, 
granted by Government, yielded, without much labour, coffee 
sufficient for all the necessaries of life. 

The fact of other avenues of wealth opening up so readily, seems 
like a providential invitation to forsake the slave-trade and engage

in lawful commerce. We saw the female population occupied, as 
usual, in the spinning of cotton and cultivation of their lands. 
Their only instrument for culture is a double-handled hoe, which 
is worked with a sort of dragging motion. Many of the men 
were employed in weaving. The latter appear to be less indus- 
trious than the former, for they require a month to finish a single 
web. There is, however, not much inducement to industry, for, 
notwithstanding the time consumed in its manufacture, each web 
is sold for only two shillings. 

On returning to Golungo Alto, I found several of my men laid 
up with fever. One of the reasons for my leaving them there 
was, that they might recover from the fatigue of the journey from 
Loanda, which had much more effect upon their feet than hun- 
dreds of miles had on our way westwards. They had always been 
accustomed to moisture in their own well-watered land, and we 
certainly had a superabundance of that in Loanda. The roads, 
however, from Loanda to Golungo Alto were both hard and dry, 
and they suffered severely in consequence ; yet they were com- 
posing songs to be sung when they should reach home. The 
Argonauts were nothing to them ; and they remarked very im- 
pressively to me, " It was well you came with Makololo, for no 
tribe could have done what we have accomplished in coming to 
the white man's country : we are the true ancients who can tell 
wonderful things." Two of them now had fever in the continued 
form, and became jaundiced, the whites or conjunctival membrane

of their eyes becoming as yellow as saffron ; and a third suffered 
from an attack of mania. He came to his companions one day, 
and said, " Kemain well. I am called away by the gods ! " and 
set off at the top of his speed. The young men caught him be- 
fore he had gone a mile, and bound him. By gentle treatment 
and watching for a few days he recovered. I have observed 
several instances of this kind in the country, but very few cases 
of idiocy, and I believe that continued insanity is rare.

While waiting for the recovery of my men, I visited, in com- 
pany with my friend Mr. Canto, the deserted convent of St. 
Hilarion, at Bango, a few miles north-west of Golungo Alto. It 
is situated in a magnificent valley, containing a population num- 
bering 4000 hearths. This is the abode of the Sova, or Chief 
Bango, who still holds a place of authority under the Portuguese. 
The garden of the convent, the church, and dormitories of the 
brethren, are still kept in a good state of repair. I looked at the 
furniture, couches, and large chests for holding the provisions of 
the brotherhood with interest, and would fain have learned some- 
thing of the former occupants ; but all the books and sacred 
vessels had lately been removed to Loanda, and even the graves of 
the good men stand without any record : their resting-places are, 
however, carefully tended. All speak well of the Jesuits and 
other missionaries, as the Capuchins, &c, for having attended 
diligently to the instruction of the children. They were sup- 
posed to have a tendency to take the part of the people against 
the Government, and were supplanted by priests, concerning whom 
no regret is expressed that they were allowed to die out. In 



Chap. XXI. GRADATIONS OF SOCIETY. 411 

viewing the present fruits of former missions, it is impossible not 
to feel assured that, if the Jesuit teaching has been so permanent, 
that of Protestants, who leave the Bible in the hands of their con- 
verts, will not be less abiding. The chief Bango has built a large 
two-story house close by the ^convent, but superstitious fears pre- 
vent him from sleeping in it. The Portuguese take advantage 
of all the gradations into which native society has divided itself. 
This man, for instance, is still a sova or chief, has his councillors, 
and maintains the same state, as when the country was indepen- 
dent. When any of his people are guilty of theft, he pays down 
the amount of goods stolen at once, and reimburses himself out of 
the property of the thief so effectually, as to be benefited by the 
transaction. The people under him are divided into a number of 
classes. There are his councillors, as the highest, who are generally 
head-men of several villages, and the carriers, the lowest free men. 
One class above the last, obtains the privilege of wearing shoes 
from the chief, by paying for it ; another, the soldiers or militia, 
pay for the privilege of serving, the advantage behig, that they are 
not afterwards liable to be made carriers. They are also divided 
into gentlemen and little gentlemen, and, though quite black, speak 
of themselves as white men, and of the others, who may not wear 
shoes, as " blacks." The men of all these classes trust to their 
wives for food, and spend most of their time in drinking the palm- 
toddy. This toddy is the juice of the palm-oil tree (JSlceis Giui- 
neensis), which, when tapped, yields a sweet clear liquid, not at 
all. intoxicating while fresh, but, when allowed to stand till the 
afternoon, causes inebriation and many crimes. This toddy, called 
malova, is the bane of the country. Culprits are continually 
brought before the commandants for assaults, committed through 
its influence. Men come up with deep gashes on their heads, and 
one, who had burned his father's house, I saw making a profound 
bow to Mr. Canto, and volunteering to explain why he did the 
deed. 

There is also a sort of fraternity of freemasons, named Em- 
pacasseiros, into which no one is admitted unless he is an expert 
hunter, and can shoot well with the gun. They are distinguished 
by a fillet of buffalo-hide around their heads, and are employed 
as messengers in all cases requiring express. They are very trust- 
worthy, and, when on active service, form the best native troops

the Portuguese possess. The militia are of no value as soldiers, 
but cost the country nothing, being supported by then* wives. 
Their duties are chiefly to guard the residences of commandants, 
and to act as police. 

The chief recreations of the natives of Angola are marriages 
and funerals. When a young woman is about to be married, she 
is placed in a hut alone and anointed with various unguents, and 
many incantations are employed, in order to secure good fortune 
and fruitfulness. Here, as almost everywhere in the south, the 
height of good fortune is to bear sons. They often leave a hus- 
band altogether, if they have daughters only. In their dances, 
when any one may wish to deride another, in the accompanying 
song a line is introduced, " So and so has no children, and never 
will get any." She feels the insult so keenly, that it is not un- 
common for her to rush away and commit suicide. After some 
days, the bride elect is taken to another hut, and adorned with all 
the richest clothing and ornaments that the relatives can either 
lend or borrow. She is then placed in a public situation, saluted 
as a lady, and presents made by all her acquaintances are placed 
around her. After tins she is taken to the residence of her hus- 
band, where she has a hut for herself, and becomes one of several 
wives, for polygamy is general. Dancing, feasting, and drinking 
on such occasions are prolonged for several days. In case of 
separation, the woman returns to her father's family, and the hus- 
band receives back what he gave for her. In nearly all cases a 
man gives a price for the wife, and, in cases of mulattoes, as much 
as 601. is often given to the parents of the bride. This is one of 
the evils the Bishop was trying to remedy. 

In cases of death the body is kept several days, and there is a 
grand concourse of both sexes, with beating of drums, dances, 
and debauchery, kept up with feasting, &c, according to the 
means of the relatives. The great ambition of many of the blacks 
of Angola is to give their friends an expensive funeral. Often 
when one is asked to sell a pig, he replies, " I am keeping it in 
case of the death of any of my friends." A pig is usually slaugh- 
tered and eaten on the last day of the ceremonies, and its head 
thrown into the nearest stream or river. A native will sometimes 
appear intoxicated on these occasions, and, if blamed for his in- 
temperance, will reply, " Why ! my mother is dead !" as if he

thought it a sufficient justification. The expenses of funerals 
are so heavy, that often years elapse before they can defray 
them. 

These people are said to be very litigious and obstinate : constant 
disputes are taking place respecting their lands. A case came 
before the weekly court of the Commandant, involving property 
in a palm-tree worth two pence. The judge advised the pursuer 
to withdraw the case, as the mere expenses of entering it would 
be much more than the cost of the tree. " no," said he ; "I 
have a piece of calico with me for the clerk, and money for 
yourself. It's my right, I will not forego it." The calico itself 
cost three or four shillings. They rejoice if they can say of an 
enemy, " I took him before the court." 

My friend Mr. Canto, the Commandant, being seized with fever 
in a severe form, it afforded me much pleasure to attend him in 
his sickness, who had been so kind to me in mine. He was for 
some time in a state of insensibility, and I, having the charge of 
Ins establishment, had thus an opportunity of observing the 
workings of slavery. When a master is ill, the slaves run riot 
among the eatables. I did not know this, until I observed that 
every time the sugar-basin came to the table it was empty. On 
visiting my patient by night, I passed along a corridor, and un- 
expectedly came upon the washerwoman, eating pine-apples and 
sugar. All the sweetmeats were devoured, and it was difficult 
for me to get even bread and butter, until I took the precaution 
of locking the pantry door. Probably the slaves thought, that, as 
both they and the luxuries were the master's property, there was 
no good reason why they should be kept apart. 

Debarred by my precaution from these sources of enjoyment, 
they took to killing the fowls and goats, and, when the animal 
was dead, brought it to me saying, " We found this tiling lying 
out there." They then enjoyed a feast of flesh. A feeling of in- 
security prevails throughout tins country. It is quite common to 
furnish visitors with the keys of their rooms. When called on to 
come to breakfast or dinner, each locks his door and puts the 
key in his pocket. At Kolobeng we never locked our doors by 
night or by day for months together ; but there slavery is unknown. 
The Portuguese do not seem at all bigoted in their attachment to 
slavery, nor yet in their prejudices against colour. Mr. Canto 



414 LOSS OF COTTON-SEED. Chap. XXI. 

gave an entertainment in order to draw all classes together and 
promote general good wall. Two sovas or native chiefs were 
present, and took their places without the least appearance of 
embarrassment. The sova of Kilombo appeared in the dress of 
a general, and the sova of Bango was gaily attired in a red coat, 
profusely ornamented with tinsel. The latter had a band of 
musicians with him consisting of six trumpeters and four drummers, 
who performed very well. These men are fond of titles, and the 
Portuguese Government humours them by conferring honorary 
captaincies, &c. : the sova of Bango was at present anxious to 
obtain the title of " Major of all the Sovas." At the tables of 
other gentlemen I observed the same thing constantly occurring. 
At this meeting Mr. Canto communicated some ideas which I had 
written out on the dignity of labour, and the superiority of free 
over slave labour. The Portuguese gentlemen present were 
anxiously expecting an arrival of American cotton-seed from Mr. 
Gabriel. They are now in the transition state from unlawful to 
lawful trade, and turn eagerly to cotton, coffee, and sugar, as new 
sources of wealth. Mr. Canto had been commissioned by them 
to purchase three sugar-mills. Our cruisers have been the prin- 
cipal agents in compelling them to abandon the slave-trade ; and 
our Government, in furmsliing them with a supply of cotton-seed, 
showed a generous intention to aid them in commencing a more 
honourable course. It can scarcely be believed, however, that 
after Lord Clarendon had been at the trouble of procuring fresh 
cotton-seed through our minister at Washington, and had sent it 
out to the care of H. M. Commissioner at Loanda, probably 
from having fallen into the hands of a few incorrigible slave- 
traders, it never reached its destination. It was most likely cast 
into the sea off Ambriz, and my friends at Golungo Alto were 
left without the means of commencing a new enterprise. 

Mr. Canto mentioned that there is now much more cotton in 
the country than can be consumed ; and if he had possession of a 
few hundred pounds, he would buy up all the oil and cotton at a 
fair price, and thereby bring about a revolution in the agricul- 
ture of the country. These commodities are not produced in 
greater quantity, because the people have no market for those, 
which now spring up almost spontaneously around them. The 
above was put down in my journal, when I had no idea that 



Chap. XXI. ILLNESS OF SEKELETU'S HOESE. 415 

enlarged supplies of cotton from new sources were so niucli 
needed at home. 

It is common to cut down cotton-trees as a nuisance, and culti- 
vate beans, potatoes, and manioc, sufficient only for their own 
consumption. I have the impression that cotton, which is decidu- 
ous in America, is perennial here ; for the plants I saw in winter 
were not dead, though going by the name Algodao Americana, 
or American cotton. The rents paid for gardens belonging to the 
old convents are merely nominal, varying from one shilling to 
three pounds per annum. The higher rents being realized from 
those in the immediate vicinity of Loanda, none but Portuguese 
or half-castes can pay them. 

When about to start, the horse winch the Governor had kindly 
presented for Sekeletu was seized with inflammation, which de- 
layed us some time longer, and we ultimately lost it. We had 
been careful to watch it when coming through the district of 
Matamba, where we had discovered the tsetse, that no insect 
might light upon it. The change of diet here, may have had some 
influence m producing the disease ; for I was informed by Dr. 
Welweitsch, an able German naturalist, whom we found pursuing 
his arduous labours here, and whose life we hope may be spared 
to give his researches to the world, that, of fifty-eight kinds of 
grasses found at Loanda, only three or four species exist here, 
and these of the most diminutive kinds. The twenty-four dif- 
ferent species of grass of Golungo Alto are nearly all gigantic. 
Indeed, gigantic grasses, climbers, shrubs, and trees, with but few 
plants, constitute the vegetation of this region. 

November 20th. — An eclipse of the sun, which I had anxiously 
hoped to observe with a view of determining the longitude, hap- 
pened this morning, and, as often took place in tins cloudy climate, 
the sun was covered four minutes before it began. When it shone 
forth, the eclipse was in progress, and a few minutes before it 
should (according to my calculations) have ended, the sun was 
again completely obscured. The greatest patience and perse- 
verance are required, if one wishes to ascertain Ins position when 
it is the rainy season. 

Before leaving, I had an opportunity of observing a curious 
insect, which inhabits trees of the fig family (Ficus), upwards of 
twenty species of which are found here. Seven or eight of them 



416 INSECTS WHICH DISTIL WATER. Chap.. XXI. 

cluster round a spot on one of the smaller branches, and there 
keep up a constant distillation of a clear fluid, which, dropping to 
the ground, forms a little puddle below. If a vessel is placed 
under them in the evening, it contains three or four pints of fluid 
in the morning. The natives say that, if a drop falls into the eyes, 
it causes inflammation of these organs. To the question whence 
is this fluid derived, the people reply that the insects suck it out 
of the tree, and our own naturalists give the same answer. I have 
never seen an orifice, and it is scarcely possible that the tree can 
yield so much. A similar but much smaller homopterous insect, 
of the family Cercopidce, is known in England as the frog-hopper 
{Aphrophora spumaria), when full grown and furnished with 
wings ; but while still in the pupa state it is called " cuckoo-spit" 
from the mass of froth in which it envelops itself. The circulation 
of sap in plants in our climate, especially of the graminaceae, is 
not quick enough to yield much moisture. The African species 
is five or six times the size of the English. In the case of branches 
of the fig-tree, the point the insects congregate on is soon marked 
by a number of incipient roots, such as are thrown out when a 
cutting is inserted in the ground, for the purpose of starting 
another tree. I believe that both the English and African in- 
sects belong to the same family, and differ only in size, and that 
the chief part of the moisture is derived from the atmosphere. 
I leave it for naturalists to explain how these little creatures 
distil both by night and day as much water as they please, and 
are more independent than her Majesty's steam-ships, with their 
apparatus for condensing steam, for, without coal, their abun- 
dant supplies of sea-water are of no avail. I tried the following 
experiment : — Finding a colony of these insects busily distilling 
on a branch of the Ricinus communis, or castor-oil plant, I denuded 
about 20 inches of the bark on the tree side of the insects, and 
scraped away the inner bark, so as to destroy all the ascending 
vessels. I also cut a hole in the side of the branch, reaching to 
the middle, and then cut out the pith and internal vessels. The 
distillation was then going on at the rate of one drop each 67 
seconds, or about 2 ounces 5t drams in 24 hours. Next morning 
the distillation, so far from being affected by the attempt to stop 
the supplies, supposing they had come up through the branch 
from the tree, was increased to a drop every 5 seconds, or 12 drops 



Chap. XXI. EXPERIMENTS. 417 

per minute, making 1 pint (16 ounces) in every 24 hours. I then 
cut the branch so much, that during the day it broke ; but they 
still went on at the rate of a drop every 5 seconds, while another 
colony on a branch of the same tree gave a drop every 17 seconds 
only, or at the rate of about 10 ounces 4^ drams in 24 hours. I 
finally cut off the branch ; but this was too much for their patience, 
for they immediately decamped, as insects will do from either a 
dead branch or a dead animal, which Indian hunters soon know, 
when they sit down on a recently killed bear. The presence of 
greater moisture in the air increased the power of these distillers : 
the period of greatest activity was in the morning, when the air 
and everything else was charged with dew. 

Having but one day left for experiment, I found again that 
another colony on a branch, denuded in the same way, yielded a 
drop every 2 seconds, or 4 pints 10 ounces in 24 hours, while a 
colony on a branch untouched, yielded a drop every 11 seconds, 
or 16 ounces 2i§ drams in 24 hours. I regretted somewhat the 
want of time to institute another experiment, namely, to cut a 
branch and place it in water, so as to keep it in life, and then 
observe if there was any diminution of the quantity of water 
in the vessel. This alone was wanting to make it certain that 
they draw water from the atmosphere. I imagine that they have 
some power of winch we are not aware, besides that nervous 
influence which causes constant motion to our own involuntary 
muscles, the power of life-long action without fatigue. The reader 
will remember, in connection with this insect, the case of the 
ants already mentioned. 

December 14£A. — Both myself and men having recovered from 
severe attacks of fever, we left the hospitable residence of Mr. 
Canto with a deep sense of his kindness to us all, and proceeded 
on our way to Ambaca. (Lat. 9° 16' 35" S., long. 15° 23' E.) 

Frequent rains had fallen in October and November, which 
were nearly always accompanied with thunder. Occasionally the 
quantity of moisture in the atmosphere is greatly increased without 
any visible cause : this imparts a sensation of considerable cold, 
though the thermometer exhibits no fall of the mercury. The 
greater humidity in the air, affording a better conducting medium 
for the radiation of heat from the body, is as dangerous as a sudden 
fall of the thermometer : it causes considerable disease among the 

2 E 



418 OFFICIAL DELINQUENTS. Chap. XXI. 

natives, and this season is denominated " carneirado," as if by the 
disease they were slaughtered like sheep. The season of these 
changes, which is the most favourable for Europeans, is the most 
unhealthy for the native population; and tins is by no means 
a climate, in wliich either natives or Europeans can indulge in 
irregularities with impunity. 

Owing to the weakness of the men who had been sick, we were 
able to march but short distances. Three hours and a half 
brought us to the banks of the Caloi, a small stream which flows 
into the Senza. This is one of the parts of the country reputed 
to yield petroleum, but the geological formation, being mica 
schist dipping towards the eastward, did not promise much for 
our finding it. Our hospitable Mend Mr. Mellot accompanied us 
to another little river, called the Quango, where I saw two fine 
boys, the sons of the sub-commandant, Mr. Feltao, who, though 
only from six to eight years old, were subject to fever. We then 
passed on in the bright sunlight, the whole country looking so 
fresh and green after the rains, and everything so cheering, one 
could not but wonder to find it so feverish. 

We found on reaching Ambaca that the gallant old soldier 
Laurence Jose Marquis, had, since our passing Icollo i Bengo, 
been promoted, on account of his stern integrity, to the govern- 
ment of this important district. The office of commandant is 
much coveted by the officers of the line who come to Angola, not 
so much for the salary as for the perquisites, which, when managed 
skilfully, in the course of a few years make one rich. An idea 
may be formed of the conduct of some of these officials from the 
following extract from the Boletim of Loanda of the 28th of 
October, 1854. 

" The acting governor-general of the province of Angola and 
its dependencies determines as follows. 

" Having instituted an investigation (Syndecancia) against the 
commandant of the fort of , a captain of the army of Por- 
tugal in commisssion in this province, , on account of nume- 
rous complaints, which have come before this Government, of 
violences and extortions practised by the said commandant, and 
those complaints appearing by the result of the investigation to 
be well founded, it will be convenient to exonerate the captain 
referred to, from the command of the fort of , to which he 



Chap. XXI. PUNGO ANDONGO. 419 

had been nominated by the Portfolio of this general Government, 
No. 41, of 27th December of the past year ; and if not otherwise 
determined, the same official shall be judged by a council of war 
for the criminal acts, which are to him attributed." 

Even this public mention of his crimes, attaches no stigma to the 
man's character. The council of war, by which these delinquents 
always prefer to be judged, is composed of men who eagerly ex- 
pect to occupy the post of commandant themselves, and anticipate 
their own trial for similar acts at some future time. The severest 
sentence a council of war awards, is a few weeks' suspension from 
office in his regiment. 

This want of official integrity, which is not at all attributable 
to the Home Government of Portugal, would prove a serious im- 
pediment in the way of foreign enterprise developing the resources 
of this rich province. And to this cause indeed, may be ascribed 
the failure of the Portuguese laws for the entire suppression of 
the slave-trade. The officers ought to receive higher pay, if 
integrity is expected from them. At present, a captain's pay for 
a year, will only keep him in good uniform. The high pay our 
own officers receive, has manifest advantages. 

Before leaving Ambaca, we received a present of ten head of 
cattle from Mr. Schut of Loanda, and, as it shows the cheapness 
of provisions here, I may mention that the cost was only about a 
guinea per head. 

On crossing the Lucalla, we made a detour to the south, in 
order to visit the famous rocks of Pungo Andongo. As soon as 
we crossed the rivulet Lotete, a change in the vegetation of the 
country was apparent. We found trees identical with those to be 
seen south of the Chobe. The grass too stands in tufts, and is of 
that kind which the natives consider to be best adapted for cattle. 
Two species of grape-bearing vines abound everywhere in this 
district, and the influence of the good pasturage is seen in the 
plump condition of the cattle. In all my previous inquiries 
respecting the vegetable products of Angola I was invariably 
directed to Pungo Andongo. Do you grow wheat? " yes, 
in Pungo Andongo." — Grapes, figs, or peaches? " yes, in 
Pungo Andongo." — Do you make butter, cheese, &c. ? The 
uniform answer was, " O yes, there is abundance of all these in 
Pungo Andongo." But when we arrived here, we found that the

answers all referred to the activity of one man, Colonel Manuel 
Antonio Pires. The presence of the wild grape shows that 
vineyards might be cultivated with success; the wheat grows 
well without irrigation ; and any one who tasted the butter and 
cheese at the table of Colonel Pires would prefer them to the 
stale produce of the Irish dairy, in general use throughout that 
province. The cattle in this country are seldom milked, on 
account of the strong prejudice which the Portuguese entertain 
against the use of milk. They believe that it may be used with 
safety in the morning; but if taken after midday, that it will 
cause fever. It seemed to me that there was not much reason 
for carefully avoiding a few drops in their coffee, after having 
devoured ten times the amount in the shape of cheese at dinner. 

The fort of Pungo Andongo (lat, 9° 42' 14" S., long. 15° 30' E.) 
is situated in the midst of a group of curious columnar-shaped 
rocks, each of which is upwards of three hundred feet in 
height. They are composed of conglomerate, made up of a 
great variety of rounded pieces in a matrix of dark red sand- 
stone. They rest on a thick stratum of this last rock, with 
very few of the pebbles in its substance. On this a fossil 
palm has been found, and if of the same age as those on the 
eastern side of the continent, on winch similar palms now lie, 
there may be coal underneath tins, as well as under that at Tete. 
The asserted existence of petroleum-springs at Dande, and near 
Cambambe, would seem to indicate the presence of this useful 
mineral, though I am not aware of any one having actually seen 
a seam of coal tilted up to the surface in Angola, as we have at 
Tete. The gigantic pillars of Pungo Andongo, have been formed 
by a current of the sea coming from the S.S.E., for, seen from the 
top, they appear arranged in that direction, and must have with- 
stood the surges of the ocean at a period of our world's history, 
when the relations of land and sea were totally different from what 
they are now, and long before " the morning stars sang together, 
and all the sons of God shouted for joy, to see the abodes prepared 
which man was soon to fill." The embedded pieces in the conglo- 
merate are of gneiss, clay shale, mica and sandstone schists, trap, 
and porphyry, most of which are large enough to give the whole the 
appearance of being the only remaining vestiges of vast primaeval 
banks of shingle. Several little streams run amongst these rocks, 



422 THE QUEEN OF JINGA. Chap. XXI. 

and in the central part of the pillars stands the village, completely 
environed by well-nigh inaccessible rocks. The pathways into 
the village, might be defended by a small body of troops against 
an army ; and this place was long the stronghold of the tribe 
called Jinga, the original possessors of the country. 

We were shown a foot-print carved on one of these rocks. It is 
spoken of as that of a famous queen, who reigned over all this 
region. In looking at these rude attempts at commemoration, 
one feels the value of letters. In the history of Angola, we find 
that the famous Queen Donna Anna de Souza came from the 
vicinity, as Ambassadress from her brother Gola Bandy, king of 
the Jinga, to Loanda, in 1621, to sue for peace, and astonished the 
governor by the readiness of her answers. The governor proposed, 
as a condition of peace, the payment by the Jinga of an annual 
tribute. " People talk of tribute after they have conquered, and 
not before it : we come to talk of peace, not of subjection," was 
the ready answer. The governor was as much nonplussed as 
our Cape governors often are, when they tell the Caifres "to 
put it all down in writing, and they will then be able to answer 
them." She remained some time in Loanda, gained all she 
sought, and, after being taught by the missionaries, was baptized, 
and returned to her own country with honour. She succeeded 
to the kingdom on the death of her brother, whom it was supposed 
she poisoned, but in a subsequent war with the Portuguese, she 
lost nearly all her army in a great battle fought in 1627. She 
returned to the church after a long period of apostacy, and died 
in extreme old age ; and the Jinga still live as an independent 
people to the north of this their ancient country. No African 
tribe has ever been destroyed. 

In former times the Portuguese imagined that this place was 
particularly unhealthy, and banishment to the black rocks of 
Pungo Andongo, was thought by their judges to be a much 
severer sentence than transportation to any part of the coast ; but 
this district is now well known to be the most healthy part of 
Angola. The water is remarkably pure, the soil is light, and the 
country open and undulating, with a general slope down towards 
the river Coanza, a few miles distant. That river is the southern 
boundary of the Portuguese, and beyond, to the S. and S.W., we 
see the high mountains of the Libollo. On the S.E. we have also 



Chap. XXI. A MERCHANT-PRINCE. 423 

a mountainous country, inhabited by the Khnbonda or Ambonda, 
who are said by Colonel Pires to be a very brave and independent 
people, but hospitable and fair in their dealings. They are rich 
in cattle, and their country produces much bees'-wax, which is 
carefully collected, and brought to the Portuguese, with whom 
they have always been on good terms. 

The Ako (Haco), a branch of this family, inhabit the left bank 
of the Coanza above this village, who, instead of bringing slaves 
for sale, as formerly, now occasionally bring wax for the pur- 
chase of a slave from the Portuguese. I saw a boy sold for 
twelve shillings: he said that he belonged to the country of 
Matiamvo. Here I bought a pair of well-made boots of good 
tanned leather, which reached above the knee, for five shillings 
and eight pence, and that was just the price given for one pound 
of ivory by Mr. Pires ; consequently the boy was worth two pairs 
of boots, or two pounds of ivory. The Libollo on the S. have not 
so good a character, but the Coanza is always deep enough to 
form a line of defence. Colonel Pires is a good example of what 
an honest industrious man in this country may become. He came 
as a servant in a ship, and by a long course of persevering labour, 
has raised himself to be the richest merchant in Angola. He 
possesses some thousands of cattle ; and, on any emergency, can 
appear in the field with several hundred armed slaves. 

While enjoying the hospitality of this merchant prince in his 
commodious residence, which is outside the rocks, and commands 
a beautiful view of all the adjacent country, I learned that all my 
despatches, maps, and journal, had gone to the bottom of the sea 
in the mail packet, " Forerunner." I felt so glad that my friend 
Lieutenant Bedingfeld, to whose care I had committed them, 
though in the most imminent danger, had not shared a similar 
fate, that I was at once reconciled to the labour of rewriting. I 
availed myself of the kindness of Colonel Pires, and remained till 
the end of the year, reproducing my lost papers. 

Colonel Pires having another establishment on the banks of 
the Coanza, about six miles distant, I visited it with him about 
once a week for the purpose of recreation. The difference of 
temperature caused by the lower altitude, was seen in the cashew- 
trees, for while, near the rocks, these trees were but coming into 
flower, those at the lower station were ripening their, fruit. 



424 ANCIENT BURIAL-PLACE. ' Chap. XXI. 

Cocoa-nut trees and bananas bear well at the lower station, but 
yield little or no fruit at the upper. The difference indicated by 
the thermometer was 7°. The general range near the rocks was 
67° at 7 A.M., 74° at midday, and 72° in the evening. 

A slave-boy belonging to Colonel Pires, having stolen and eaten 
some lemons in the evening, went to the river to wash his mouth, 
so as not to be detected by the flavour. An alligator seized him 
and carried him to an island in the middle of the stream ; there 
the boy grasped hold of the reeds, and baffled all the efforts of 
the reptile to dislodge him, till his companions, attracted by his 
cries, came in a canoe to his assistance. The alligator at once 
let go his hold, for when out of his own element he is cowardly. 
The boy had many marks of the teeth in his abdomen and thigh, 
and those of the claws on his legs and arms. 

The slaves in Colonel Pires' establishments, appeared more 
like free servants than any I had elsewhere seen. Everything 
was neat and clean, while generally, where slaves are the only 
domestics, there is an aspect of slovenliness, as if they went 
on the principle of always doing as little for their masters as 
possible. 

In the country near to this station were a large number 
of the ancient burial-places of the Jinga. These are simply 
large mounds of stones, with drinking and cooking vessels of 
rude pottery on them. Some are arranged in a circular form, 
two or three yards in diameter, and shaped like a haycock. 
There is not a single vestige of any inscription. The natives of 
Angola generally have a strange predilection for bringing their 
dead to the sides of the most frequented paths. They have a 
particular anxiety to secure the point where cross roads meet. 
On and around the graves, are planted tree euphorbias and other 
species of that family. On the grave itself, they also place water- 
bottles, broken pipes, cooking vessels, and sometimes a little bow 
and arrow. 

The Portuguese Government, wishing to prevent this custom, 
affixed a penalty on any one burying in the roads, and appointed 
places of public sepulture in every district in the country. The 
people persist, however, in spite of the most stringent enforcement 
of the law, to follow their ancient custom. 

The country between the Coanza and Pungo Andongo is 



Chap. XXI. MANIOC THE CHIEF PRODUCT. 425 

covered with low trees, bushes, and fine pasturage. In the latter, 
we were pleased to see our old acquaintances the gaudy gladiolus, 
Amaryllis toxicaria, hymanthus, and other bulbs in as flourishing 
a condition as at the Cape. 

It is surprising that so little has been done in the way of 
agriculture in Angola. Eaising wheat by means of irrigation has 
never been tried ; no plough is ever used ; and the only instru- 
ment is the native hoe, in the hands of slaves. The chief object 
of agriculture is the manioc, which does not contain nutriment 
sufficient to give proper stamina to the people. The half-caste 
Portuguese have not so much energy as their fathers. They 
subsist chiefly on the manioc, and, as that can be eaten either 
raw, roasted, or boiled, as it comes from the ground ; or fermented 
in water, and then roasted or dried after fermentation, and baked 
or pounded into fine meal ; or rasped into meal and cooked as 
farina ; or made into confectionery with butter and sugar, it 
does not so soon pall upon the palate as one might imagine, when 
told that it constitutes their principal food. The leaves boiled 
make an excellent vegetable for the table ; and, when eaten by 
goats, their milk is much increased. The wood is a good fuel, 
and yields a large quantity of potash. If planted in a dry soil, 
it takes two years to come to perfection, requiring, during that 
time, one weeding only. It bears drought well, and never shrivels 
up, like other plants, when deprived of rain. When planted in 
low alluvial soils, and either well supplied with rain or annually 
flooded, twelve, or even ten months, are sufficient to bring it 
to maturity. The root rasped while raw, placed upon a cloth, 
and rubbed with the hands while water is poured upon it, parts 
with its starchy glutinous matter, and this, when it settles at the 
bottom of the vessel, and the water poured off, is placed in the sun 
till nearly dry, to form tapioca. The process of drying is com- 
pleted on an iron plate over a slow fire, the mass being stirred 
meanwhile with a stick, and when quite dry it appears aggluti- 
nated into little globules, and is in the form we see the tapioca of 
commerce. This is never eaten by weevils, and so little labour is 
required in its cultivation, that on the spot it is extremely cheap. 
Throughout the interior parts of Angola, fine manioc-meal, which 
could with ease have been converted either into superior starch or 
tapioca, is commonly sold at the rate of about ten pounds for a 



426

Chap. XXI. 



penny. All this region, however, has no means of transport to 
Loanda, other than the shoulders of the carriers and slaves, 
over a footpath. 

Cambambe, to which the navigation of the Coanza reaches, is 
reported to be thirty leagues below Pungo Andongo. A large 
waterfall is the limit on that side ; and another exists higher up, 
at the confluence of the Lombe (lat. 9° 41' 26" S., and about 
long. 16° E.), over which hippopotami and elephants are some- 
times drawn and killed. The river between is rapid, and generally 
rushes over a rocky bottom. Its source is pointed out as S.E. or 
S.S.E. of its confluence with the Lombe, and near Bihe. The 
situation of Bihe is not well known. When at Sanza, we were 
assured that it lies nearly south of that point, and eight days 
distant. This statement seemed to be corroborated by our 
meeting many people going to Matiamvo and to Loanda from 
Bihe. Both parties had come to Sanza, and then branched off, 
one to the east, the other to the west. The source of the 
Coanza is thus probably not far from Sanza. 

I had the happiness of doing a little good in the way of admi- 
nistering to the sick, for there are no doctors in the interior of 
Angola. Notwithstanding the general healthiness of this fine dis- 
trict, and its pleasant temperature, I was attacked by fever myself. 
While confined to my room, a gentleman of colour, a canon of the 
church, kindly paid me a visit. He was on a tour of visitation in 
the different interior districts, for the purpose of baptizing and 
marrying. He had lately been on a visit to Lisbon, in company 
with the Prince of Congo, and had been invested with an order 
of honour by the King of Portugal as an acknowledgment of 
his services. He had all the appearance of a true negro, but 
commanded the respect of the people, and Colonel P., who had 
known him for thirty years, pronounced him to be a good man. 
There are only three or four priests in Loanda, all men of 
colour, but educated for the office. About the time of my 
journey in Angola, an offer was made to any young men of 
ability who might wish to devote themselves to the service of 
the Church, to afford them the requisite education at the Uni- 
versity of Coimbra in Portugal. I was informed, on what seemed 
good authority, that the Prince of Congo is professedly a Chris- 
tian, and that there are no fewer than twelve churches in that 



Chap. XXL THE KING OF CONGO. 427 

kingdom, the fruits of the mission established in former times 
at San Salvador, the capital. These churches are kept in partial 
repair by the people, who also keep up the ceremonies of the 
Church, pronouncing some gibberish over the dead, in imitation 
of the Latin prayers which they had formerly heard. Many of 
them can read and write. When a King of Congo dies, the body 
is wrapped up in a great many folds of cloth, until a priest can 
come from Loanda to consecrate his successor. The King of 
Congo still retains the title of Lord of Angola, which he had 
when the Jinga, the original possessors of the soil, owed him 
allegiance ; and, when he writes to the Governor of Angola, he 
places his own name first, as if addressing his vassal. The Jinga 
paid him tribute annually in cowries, which were found on the 
island that shelters Loanda harbour, and, on refusing to continue 
payment, the King of Congo gave over the island to the Portu- 
guese, and thus their dominion commenced in this quarter. 

There is not much knowledge of the Christian religion in either 
Congo or Angola, yet it is looked upon with a certain degree of 
favour. The prevalence of fever, is probably the reason why no 
priest occupies a post in any part of the interior. They come 
on tours of visitation like that mentioned, and it is said that no 
expense is incurred, for all the people are ready not only to pay 
for their services, but also to furnish every article in their power, 
gratuitously. In view of the desolate condition of tins fine mis- 
sionary field, it is more than probable that the presence of a few 
Protestants would soon provoke the priests, if not to love, to good 
works.

January 1, 1855. — Having, through the kindness of Colonel 
Pires, reproduced some of my lost papers, I left Pungo Andongo 
the first day of tins year ; and at Candumba, slept in one of the 
dairy establishments of my friend, who had sent forward orders 
for an ample supply of butter, cheese, and milk. Our path lay 
along the right bank of the Coanza. This is composed of the 
same sandstone rock, with pebbles, which forms the flooring of the 
country. The land is level, has much open forest, and is well 
adapted for pasturage. 

On reaching the confluence of the Lombe, we left the river, and 
proceeded in a north-easterly direction, through a fine open green 
country, to the village of Malange, where we struck into our 
former path. A few miles to the west of this, a path branches off 
to a new district named the Duke Braganza. This path crosses 
the Lucalla, and several of its feeders. The whole of the country 
drained by these, is described as extremely fertile. The territory 



Chap. XXII. GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE. 429 

west of Braganza is reported to be mountainous, well wooded and 
watered ; wild coffee is abundant, and the people even make their 
huts of coffee-trees. The rivers Dande, Senza, and Lucalla, are 
said to rise in one mountain-range. Numerous tribes inhabit the 
country to the north, who are all independent. The Portuguese 
power extends chiefly over the tribes through whose lands we 
have passed. It may be said to be firmly seated only between 
the rivers Dande and Coanza. It extends inland about three 
hundred miles to the river Quango ; and the population, according 
to the imperfect data afforded by the census, given annually by 
the commandants of the fifteen or sixteen districts into which it is 
divided, cannot be under 600,000 souls. 

Leaving Malange, we passed quickly, without deviation, along 
the path by which we had come. At Sanza (lat. 9° 37' 46" S., 
long. 16° 59' E.) we expected to get a little seed-wheat, but this 
was not now to be found in Angola. The underlying rock of 
the whole of this section, is that same sandstone which we have 
before noticed, but it gradually becomes finer in the grain, with 
the addition of a little mica, the further we go eastward ; we enter 
upon clay-shale at Tala Mungongo (lat. 9° 42' 37" S., long. 17° 
27' E.), and find it dipping a little to the west. The general 
geological structure, is a broad fringe of mica and sandstone schist 
(about 15° E.), dipping in towards the centre of the country, 
beneath these horizontal and sedimentary rocks of more recent 
date, which form an inland basin. The fringe is not, however, the 
highest in altitude, though the oldest in age. 

While at this latter place, we met a native of Bihe who has 
visited the country of Shinte three times, for the purposes of trade. 
He gave us some of the news of that distant part, but not a word 
of the Makololo, who have always been represented in the coun- 
tries to the north as a desperately savage race, whom no trader 
could visit with safety. The half-caste traders whom we met at 
Shinte's, had returned to Angola with sixty-six slaves and upwards 
of fifty tusks of ivory. As we came along the path, we daily met 
long lines of carriers bearing large square masses of bees'-wax, 
each about a hundred pounds weight, and numbers of elephants' 
tusks, the property of Angolese merchants. Many natives were 
proceeding to the coast also on their own account, carrying bees'- 
wax, ivory, and sweet oil. They appeared to travel in perfect 



430 RED ANTS. Chap. XXII. 

security ; and at different parts of the road, we purchased fowls 
from them at a penny each. My men took care to celebrate their 
own daring in having actually entered ships, while the natives of 
these parts, who had endeavoured to frighten them on their way 
down, had only seen them at a distance. Poor fellows ! they were 
more than ever attentive to me ; and, as they were not obliged 
to erect sheds for themselves, in consequence of finding them 
already built at the different sleeping-places, all their care was 
bestowed in making me comfortable. Mashauana, as usual, made 
his bed with his head close to my feet, and never during the 
entire journey did I have to call him twice, for anything I needed. 
During our stay at Tala Mungongo, our attention was attracted 
to a species of red ant, which infests different parts of this country. 
It is remarkably fond of animal food. The commandant of the 
village having slaughtered a cow, slaves were obliged to sit up 
the whole night, burning fires of straw around the meat, to 
prevent them from devouring most of it. These ants are fre- 
quently met with in numbers, like a small army. At a little 
distance, they appear as a brownish-red band, two or three inches 
wide, stretched across the path, all eagerly pressing on in one 
direction. If a person happens to tread upon them, they rush 
up his legs and bite with surprising vigour. The first time I 
encountered tins, by no means contemptible enemy, was near 
Cassange. My attention being taken up in viewing the distant 
landscape, I accidentally stepped upon one of their nests. Not 
an instant seemed to elapse, before a simultaneous attack was 
made on various unprotected parts, up the trousers from below, 
and on my neck and breast above. The bites of these furies were 
like sparks of fire, and there was no retreat. I jumped about for 
a second or two, then in desperation tore off all my clothing, and 
rubbed and picked them off seriatim as quickly as possible. Ugh ! 
they would make the most lethargic mortal look alive. For- 
tunately no one observed this rencontre, or word might have 
been taken back to the village that I had become mad. I was 
once assaulted in a similar way, when sound asleep at night in my 
tent, and it was only by holding my blanket over the fire that I 
could get rid of them. It is really astonishing, how such small 
bodies can contain so large an amoimt of ill-nature. They not 
only bite, but twist themselves round after the mandibles are 



Chap. XXII. FRUIT-TREES. 431 

inserted, to produce laceration and pain, more than would be 
effected by the single wound. Frequently while sitting on the 
ox, as he happened to tread near a band, they would rush up 
his legs to the rider, and soon let him know that he had dis- 
turbed their march. They possess no fear, attacking with equal 
ferocity the largest as well as the smallest animals. When any 
person has leaped over the band, numbers of them leave the 
ranks and rush along the path, seemingly anxious for a fight. 
They are very useful in ridding the country of dead animal 
matter, and, when they visit a human habitation, clear it entirely 
of the destructive white ants and other vermin. They destroy 
many noxious insects and reptiles. The severity of their attack 
is greatly increased by their vast numbers, and rats, mice, lizards, 
and even the python natalensis, when in a state of surfeit from 
recent feeding, fall victims to their fierce onslaught. These ants 
never make hills like the white ant. Their nests are but a short 
distance beneath the soil, which has the soft appearance of the 
abodes of ants in England. Occasionally they construct galleries 
over their path to the cells of the white ant, in order to secure 
themselves from the heat of the sun during their marauding 
expeditions. 

January 15th, 1855. — We descended, in one hour, from the 
heights of Tala Mungongo. I counted the number of paces 
made on the slope downward, and found them to be sixteen 
hundred, which may give a perpendicular height of from twelve 
to fifteen hundred feet. Water boiled at 206° at Tala Mungongo 
above, and at 208° at the bottom of the declivity, the air being 
as 72° in the shade in the former case, and 94° in the latter. 
The temperature generally throughout the day was from 94° to 
97° in the coolest shade we could find. 

The rivulets which cut up the valley of Cassange were now 
dry ; but the Lui and Luare contained abundance of rather 
brackish water. The banks are lined with palm, wild date-trees, 
and many guavas, the fruit of which was now becoming ripe. A 
tree much like the mango abounds, but it does not yield fruit. In 
these rivers a kind of edible muscle is plentiful, the shells of which 
exist in all the alluvial beds of the ancient rivers, as far as the 
Kuruman. The brackish nature of the water, probably enables it 
to exist here. On the open grassy lawns, great numbers of a

species of lark are seen. They are black, with yellow shoulders. 
Another black bird, with a long tail (Centrojms Senegalensis), floats 
awkwardly, with its tail in a perpendicular position, over the long 
grass. It always chooses the highest points, and is caught on 
them with bird-lime, the long black tail-feathers being highly 
esteemed by the natives for plumes. We saw here also the 
" Lehututu " (Tragopan Leadbeaterii), a large bird strongly resem- 
bling a turkey ; it is black on the ground, but when it flies, the 
outer half of the wings are white. It kills serpents, striking 
them dexterously behind the head. It derives its native name 
from the noise it makes, and it is found as far as Kolobeng. 
Another species like it, is called the Abyssinian hornbill. 

Before we reached Cassange, we were overtaken by the Com- 
mandant, Senhor Carvalho, who was returning, with a detachment 
of fifty men and a field-piece, from an unsuccessful search after 
some rebels. The rebels had fled, and all he could do was to 
burn their huts. He kindly invited me to take up my residence 
with him, but, not wishing to pass by the gentleman, (Captain 
Neves) who had so kindly received me on my first arrival in the 
Portuguese possessions, I declined. Senhor Rego had been super- 
seded in Ins command, because the Governor Amaral, who had 
come into office since my departure from Loanda, had determined 
that the law winch requires the office of commandant to be ex- 
clusively occupied by military officers of the line, should once more 
come into operation. I was again most kindly welcomed by my 
friend Captain Neves, whom I found labouring under a violent 
inflammation and abscess of the hand. There is nothing in the 
situation of this village to indicate unhealthiness, except perhaps 
the rank luxuriance of the vegetation. Nearly all the Portu- 
guese inhabitants suffer from enlargement of the spleen, the 
effects of frequent intermittents, and have generally a sickly 
appearance. Thinking that this affection of the hand, was simply 
an effort of nature to get rid of malarious matter from the system, 
I recommended the use of quinine. He himself applied the leaf 
of a plant called cathory, famed among the natives as an excellent 
remedy for ulcers. The cathory-leaves, when boiled, exude a 
gummy juice, which effectually shuts out the external air. Each 
remedy of course claimed the merit of the cure. 

Many of the children are cut off by fever. A fine boy of 



Chap. XXII. A DIVINER THRASHED. 433 

Captain Neves' had since my passage westward shared a similar 
fate. Another child died during the period of my visit. During 
his sickness, Ins mother, a woman of colour, sent for a diviner in 
order to ascertain what ought to be done. The diviner, after 
throwing his dice, worked himself into the state of ecstacy in 
which they pretend to be in communication . with the Barimo. 
He then gave the oracular response, that the child was being 
killed by the spirit of a Portuguese trader, who once lived at 
Cassange. The case was this : — On the death of the trader, the 
other Portuguese merchants in the village came together, and sold 
the goods of the departed to each other, each man accounting for 
the portion received, to the creditors of the deceased at Loanda. 
The natives, looking on, and not understanding the nature of 
written mercantile transactions, concluded that the merchants of 
Cassange had simply stolen the dead man's goods, and that now 
the spirit was killing the child of Captain Neves for the part he 
had taken in the affair. The diviner in his response revealed the 
impression made on his own mind by the sale, and likewise the 
native ideas of departed souls. As they give the whites credit for 
greater stupidity than themselves in all these matters, the mother 
of the child came, and told the father that he ought to give a 
slave to the diviner, as a fee to make a sacrifice to appease the 
spirit and save the life of the child. The father quietly sent for 
a neighbour, and, though the diviner pretended to remain in his 
state of ecstacy, the brisk application of two sticks to his back 
suddenly reduced him to Ins senses, and a most undignified flight. 
The mother of tins child seemed to have no confidence in 
European wisdom ; and though I desired her to keep the child 
out of currents of wind, she preferred to follow her own custom, 
and even got it cupped on the cheeks. The consequence was 
that the child was soon in a dying state, and the father, wishing 
it to be baptized, I commended its soul to the care and compas- 
sion of Him who said, " Of such is the kingdom of heaven." The 
mother at once rushed away, and commenced that doleful wail 
which is so affecting, as it indicates sorrow without hope. She 
continued it without intermission until the child was buried. In 
the evening her female companions used a small musical instru- 
ment, which produced a kind of screeching sound, as an accom- 
paniment of the death wail.

434 THE ORDEAL. Chap. XXII. 

In the construction of this instrument they make use of 
caoutchouc, which, with a variety of other gums, is found in 
different parts of tins country. 

The intercourse which the natives have had with white men, 
does not seem to have much ameliorated then* condition. A 
great number of persons are reported to lose their lives annually 
in different districts of Angola, by the cruel superstitions to which 
they are addicted, and the Portuguese authorities either know 
nothing of them, or are unable to prevent their occurrence. The 
natives are bound to secrecy by those who administer the ordeal, 
which generally causes the death of the victim. A person, when 
accused of witchcraft, will often travel from distant districts in 
order to assert her innocency and brave the test. They come 
to a river on the Cassange called Dua, drink the infusion of 
a poisonous tree, and perish unknown. 

A woman was accused by a brother-in-law of being the cause 
of Ins sickness while we were at Cassange. She offered to take 
the ordeal, as she had the idea that it would but prove her con- 
scious innocence. Captain Neves refused his consent to her going, 
and thus saved her life, which would have been sacrificed, for the 
poison is very virulent. When a strong stomach rejects it, the 
accuser reiterates his charge ; the dose is repeated, and the 
person dies. Hundreds perish thus every year in the valley of 
Cassange. 

The same superstitious ideas being prevalent through the 
whole of the country north of the Zambesi, seems to indicate 
that the people must originally have been one. All believe that 
the souls of the departed still mingle among the living, and par- 
take in some way of the food they consume. In sickness, sacrifices 
of fowls and goats are made to appease the spirits. It is imagined 
that they wish to take the living away from earth and all its 
enjoyments. When one man has killed another, a sacrifice is 
made, as if to lay the spirit of the victim. A sect is reported to 
exist, who kill men in order to take their hearts and offer them 
to the Barimo. 

The chieftainship is elective from certain families. Among the 
Bangalas of the Cassange valley, the chief is chosen from three 
families in rotation. A chief's brother inherits in preference to 
his son. The sons of a sister belong to her brother ; and he often 



Chap. XXII. TRADING POMBEIBOS. 435 

sells his nephews to pay his debts. By this and other unnatural 
customs, more than by war, is the slave-market supplied. 

The prejudices in favour of these practices are very deeply 
rooted in the native mind. Even at Loanda they retire out of 
the city hi order to perform their heathenish rites without the 
cognizance of the authorities. Their religion, if such it may be 
called, is one of dread. Numbers of charms are employed to 
avert the evils with which they feel themselves to be encompassed. 
Occasionally you meet a man, more cautious or more timid than 
the rest, with twenty or thirty charms hung round his neck. He 
seems to act upon the principle of Proclus, in his prayer to all 
the gods and goddesses. Among so many he surely must have 
the right one. The disrespect which Europeans pay to the objects 
of their fear, is to their minds only an evidence of great folly. 

While here, I reproduced the last of my lost papers and maps ; 
and as there is a post twice a-month from Loanda, I had the 
happiness to receive a packet of the t Times,' and, among other 
news, an account of the Eussian war up to the terrible charge of 
the light cavalry. The intense anxiety I felt to hear more, may 
be imagined by every true patriot ; but I was forced to brood on in 
silent thought, and utter my poor prayers for friends who perchance 
were now no more, until I reached the other side of the continent. 

A considerable trade is carried on by the Cassange merchants 
with all the surrounding territory by means of native traders, 
whom they term "Pombeiros." Two of these, called in the 
history of Angola " the trading blacks " (os feirantes pretos), 
Pedro Joao Baptista and Antonio Jose, having been sent by the 
first Portuguese trader that lived at Cassange, actually returned 
from some of the Portuguese possessions in the East with letters 
from the governor of Mozambique in the year 1815, proving, as 
is remarked, " the possibility of so important a communication 
between Mozambique and Loanda." This is the only instance of 
native Portuguese subjects crossing the continent. No European 
ever accomplished it, though this fact has lately been quoted as if 
the men had been " Portuguese." • 

Captain Neves was now actively engaged in preparing a present, 
worth about fifty pounds, to be sent by Pombeiros to Matiamvo. 
It consisted of great quantities of cotton cloth, a large carpet, an 
arm-chair with a canopy and curtains of crimson calico, an iron 

2 F 2 



436 FEVER AFTER WESTERLY WINDS. Chap. XXII. 

bedstead, mosquito curtains, beads, &c, and a number of pictures 
rudely painted in oil by an embryo black painter at Cassange. 

Matiamvo, like most of the natives in the interior of the 
country, has a strong desire to possess a cannon, and had sent 
ten large tusks to purchase one ; but being government property, 
it could not be sold : he was now furnished with a blunderbuss, 
mounted as a cannon, which would probably please him as well. 

Senhor Graca and some other Portuguese have visited this chiex 
at different times ; but no European resides beyond the Quango ; 
indeed, it is contrary to the policy of the government of Angola, 
to allow their subjects to penetrate further into the interior. The 
present would have been a good opportunity for me to have visited 
that chief, and I felt strongly inclined to do so, as he had expressed 
dissatisfaction respecting my treatment by the Chiboque, and even 
threatened to punish them. As it would be improper to force my 
men to go thither, I resolved to wait and see whether the propo- 
sition might not emanate from themselves. When I can get the 
natives to agree in the propriety of any step, they go to the end of 
the affair without a murmur. I speak to them and treat them as 
rational beings, and generally get on well with them in consequence. 

I have already remarked on the unhealthiness of Cassange ; and 
Captain Neves, who possesses an observing turn of mind, had 
noticed that always when the west wind blows, much fever imme- 
diately follows. As long as easterly winds prevail, all enjoy good 
health ; but in January, February, March, and April, the winds 
are variable, and sickness is general. The unhealthiness of the 
westerly winds probably results from malaria, appearing to be 
heavier than common air, and sweeping down into the valley of 
Cassange from the western plateau, somewhat in the same way as 
the carbonic acid gas from bean-fields is supposed by colliers to do 
into coalpits. In the west of Scotland, strong objections are made, 
by that body of men, to farmers planting beans in their vicinity, 
from the belief that they render the mines unhealthy. The gravita- 
tion of the malaria from the more elevated land of Tala Mungongo 
towards Cassange, is the only way the unhealthiness of this spot on 
the prevalence of the westerly winds can be accounted for. The 
banks of the Quango, though much more marshy, and covered 
with ranker vegetation, are comparatively healthy ; but thither 
the westerly wind does not seem to convey the noxious agent.

EXPORTS FROM LOANDA.

Feb. 20th. — On the day of starting from Cassange, the westerly- 
wind blew strongly, and on the day following we were brought to 
a stand, by several of our party being laid up with fever. This 
complaint is the only serious drawback Angola possesses. It is hi 
every other respect an agreeable land, and admirably adapted for 
yielding a rich abundance of tropical produce for the rest of the 
world. Indeed I have no hesitation in asserting, that, had it been 
in the possession of England, it would now have been yielding as 
much or more of the raw material for her manufactures, as an 
equal extent of territory in the cotton-growing States of America. 
A railway from Loanda to tins valley, would secure the trade of 
most of the interior of South Central Africa.* 



* The following statistics may be of interest to mercantile men. They show 
that since the repression of the slave-trade in Angola the value of the exports 
in lawful commerce has steadily augmented. We have no returns since 1850, 
but the prosperity of legitimate trade has suffered no check. The duties are 
noted in Portuguese money, " milreis," each of which is about three shillings 
in value.

As soon as we could move towards the Quango we did so, 
meeting in our course several trading parties, both native and 
Portuguese. We met two of the latter carrying a tusk weighing 
126 lbs. The owner afterwards informed us that its fellow on 
the left side of the same elephant was 130 lbs. It was 8 feet 
6 J inches long, and 21 inches hi circumference at the part on 
which the lip of the animal rests. The elephant was rather a

The above account exhibits the total revenue and charges of the government 
of St. Paul de Loanda in each year, from 1844-45 to 1848-49, both included. 
The above three tables are copied from the appendix to a despatch sent by 
Mr. Gabriel to Viscount Palmerston, dated 5th August, 1850, and, among 
other facts of interest, show a very satisfactory diminution in the duties upon 
slaves. 

The returns from 1818 to 1844 have been obtained from different sources as 
the average revenue; those from 1844 to 1849 arc from the Custom-house 
records.

small one, as is common in this hot central region. Some idea 
may be formed of the strength of his neck, when it is recollected 
that he bore a weight of 256 lbs. The ivory which comes from 
the east and north-east of Cassange, is very much larger than any 
to be found further south. Captain Neves had one weighing 
120 lbs. ; and tins weight is by no means uncommon. They have 
been found weighing even 158 lbs. 

Before reaching the Quango we were again brought to a stand 
by fever in two of my companions, close to the residence of a 
Portuguese who rejoiced in the name of William Tell, and who 
lived here, in spite of the prohibition of the government. We 
were using the water of a pond, and this gentleman having come 
to invite me to dinner, drank a little of it, and caught fever in 
consequence. If malarious matter existed in water, it would have 
been a wonder had we escaped ; for, travelling in the sun, with 
the thermometer from 96° to 98° in the shade, the evaporation 
from our bodies causing much thirst, we generally partook of 
every water we came to. We had probably thus more disease 
than others might suffer who had better shelter. 

Mr. Tell remarked that Ins garden was rather barren, being 
still, as he said, wild ; but when more worked it would become 
better, though no manure be applied. My men were busy col- 
lecting a better breed of fowls and pigeons than those in then* 
own country. Mr. Tell presented them with some large speci- 
mens from Eio Janeiro. Of these they were wonderfully proud, 
and bore the cock in triumph through the country of the Ba- 
londa, as evidence of having been to the sea. But when at the 
village of Shinte, a hyaena came into our midst when we were 
all sound asleep, and picked out the giant in his basket from 
eighty-four others, and he was lost, to the great grief of my men. 
The anxiety these people have always shown to improve the 
breed of their domestic animals, is, I think, a favourable point 
in their character. On looking at the common breeds in the 
possession of the Portuguese, which are merely native cattle, and 
seeing them slaughter both heifer-calves and cows, which they 
themselves never do, and likewise making no use of the milk, 
they concluded that the Portuguese must be an inferior race of 
white men. They never ceased remarking on the fine ground for 
gardens over winch we were passing ; and when I happened to 



440 SUPERSTITIOUS FEARS. Chap. XXII. 

mention that most of the flour which the Portuguese consumed, 
came from another country, they exclaimed, " Are they ignorant 
of tillage ?" " They know nothing but buying and selling : they 
are not men !" I hope it may reach the ears of my Angolese 
friends, and that they may be stirred up to develop the resources 
of then fine country. 

On coming back to Cypriano's village on the 28th, we found 
that Ins step-father had died after we had passed, and, accord- 
ing to the custom of the country, he had spent more than Ins 
patrimony in funeral orgies. He acted with Ins wonted kind- 
ness, though, unfortunately, drinking has got him so deeply into 
debt, that he now keeps out of the way of his creditors. He 
informed us that the source of the Quango is eight days, or one 
hundred miles, to the south of tins, and hi a range called Mo- 
samba, in the country of the Basongo. We can see from this, a 
sort of break in the high land which stretches away round to 
Tala Mongongo, through which the river comes. 

A death had occurred in a village about a mile off, and the 
people were busy beating drums and firing guns. The funeral 
rites are half festive, half mourning, partaking somewhat of the 
character of an Irish wake. There is nothing more heartrending 
than their death wails. When the natives turn their eyes to the 
future world, they have a view cheerless enough of their own 
utter helplessness and hopelessness. They fancy themselves com- 
pletely in the power of the disembodied sj)irits, and look upon the 
prospect of following them, as the greatest of misfortunes. Hence 
they are constantly deprecating the wrath of departed souls, 
believing that, if they are appeased, there is no other cause of 
death but witchcraft, winch may be averted by charms. The 
whole of the coloured population of Angola are sunk in these 
gross superstitions, but have the opinion, notwithstanding, that 
they are wiser in these matters than their white neighbours. 
Each tribe has a consciousness of following its own best interests 
in the best way. They are by no means destitute of that self- 
esteem which is so common in other nations ; yet they fear all 
manner of phantoms, and have half-developed ideas and traditions 
of something or other, they know not what. The pleasures of 
animal life are ever present to their minds as the supreme good ; 
and, but for the innumerable invisibilities, they might enjoy their 



Chap. XXII. CKOSSING THE QUANGO 441 

luxurious climate as much as it is possible for man to do. I have 
often thought, in travelling through their land, that it presents 
pictures of beauty which angels might enjoy. How often have I 
beheld, in still mornings, scenes the very essence of beauty, and all 
bathed hi a quiet air of delicious warmth ! yet the occasional soft 
motion imparted a pleasing sensation of coolness as of a fan. 
Green grassy meadows, the cattle feeding, the goats browsing, 
the kids skipping, the groups of herdboys with miniature bows, 
arrows, and spears ; the women wending their way to the river 
with watering-pots poised jauntily on their heads; men sewing 
under the shady banians ; and old grey-headed fathers sitting on 
the ground, with staff in hand, listening to the morning gossip, 
while others carry trees or branches to repair their hedges ; and 
all tins, flooded with the bright African sunshine, and the birds 
singing among the branches before the heat of the day has 
become intense, form pictures which can never be forgotten. 

We were informed that a chief named Gando, living on the 
other side of the river, having been accused of witchcraft, was 
killed by the ordeal, and his body thrown into the Quango. 

The ferrymen demanded thirty yards of calico, but received six 
thankfully. The canoes were wretched, carrying only two persons 
at a time ; but my men being well acquainted with the water, we 
all got over in about two hours and a half. They excited the 
admiration of the inhabitants by the manner in which they 
managed the cattle and donkeys in crossing. The most stubborn 
of beasts found himself powerless in their hands. Five or six, 
seizing hold on one, bundled him at once into the stream, and, in 
this predicament, he always thought it best policy to give in and 
swim. The men sometimes swam along with the cattle, and forced 
them to go on by dashing water at their heads. The difference 
between my men and those of the native traders who accompanied 
us, was never more apparent than now ; for while my men felt an 
interest in everything we possessed in common, theirs were rather 
glad when the oxen refused to cross, for, being obliged to slaughter 
them on such occasions, the loss to their masters was a welcome 
feast to themselves. 

On the eastern side of the Quango we passed on, without visiting 
our friend of the conical head-dress, to the residence of some 
Ambakistas who had crossed the river in order to secure the first 



442 AMBAKISTAS — BASHINJE. Chap. XXII. 

chances of trade in wax. I have before remarked on the know- 
ledge of reading and writing that these Ambakistas possess ; they 
are famed for their love of all sorts of learning within then reach, 
a knowledge of the history of Portugal, Portuguese law, &c. &c. 
They are remarkably keen in trade, and are sometimes called the 
Jews of Angola. They are employed as clerks and writers, their 
feminine delicacy of constitution enabling them to write a fine 
lady's hand, a kind of writing much esteemed amongst the Portu- 
guese. They are not physically equal to the European Portuguese, 
but possess considerable ability ; and it is said that half-castes, in 
the course of a few generations, return to the black colour of the 
maternal ancestor. The black population of Angola has become 
much deteriorated. They are not so strongly formed as the inde- 
pendent tribes. A large quantity of aguardente, an inferior kind 
of spirit, is imported into the country, winch is most injurious in 
its effects. We saw many parties carrying casks of this baneful 
liquor to the independent chiefs beyond ; and were informed that 
it is difficult for any trader to convey it far, carriers being in the 
habit of helping themselves by means of a straw, and then inject- 
ing an equal amount of water, when near the point of delivery. 
To prevent this, it is common to see large demijohns with padlocks 
on the corks. These are frequently stolen. In fact, the carriers 
are much addicted to both lying and thieving, as might be ex- 
pected from the lowest class of a people, on whom the debasing 
slave system has acted for two centuries. 

The Bashinje, in whose country we now are, seem to possess 
more of the low negro character and physiognomy, than either 
the Balonda or Basongo ; their colour is generally dirty black, 
foreheads low and compressed, noses flat and much expanded 
laterally, though tins is partly owing to the alse spreading over 
the cheeks, by the custom of inserting bits of sticks or reeds in 
the septum ; their teeth are deformed by being filed to points ; 
their lips are large. They make a nearer approach to a general 
negro appearance than any tribes I met ; but I did not notice 
this on my way down. They cultivate pretty largely, and rely 
upon their agricultural products for then supplies of salt, flesh, 
tobacco, &c, from Bangalas. Their clothing consists of pieces of 
skin, hung loosely from the girdle in front and behind. They 
plait then hair fantastically. We saw some women coming with 



Chap. XXII. SANSAWE'S IDEA OF DIGNITY. 443 

their hair woven into the form of a European hat, and it was only 
by a closer inspection that its nature was detected. Others had it 
arranged in tufts, with a threefold cord along the ridge of each 
tuft ; while others, again, follow the ancient Egyptian fashion, 
having the whole mass of wool plaited into cords, all hanging 
down as far as the shoulders. This mode, with the somewhat 
Egyptian cast of countenance in other parts of Londa, reminded 
me strongly of the paintings of that nation in the British Museum. 

We had now ram every day, and the sky seldom presented 
that cloudless aspect and clear blue, so common in the dry lands 
of the south. The heavens are often overcast by large white 
motionless masses, which stand for hours in the same position, 
and the intervening spaces are filled with a milk-and-water-looking 
haze. Notwithstanding these unfavourable circumstances, I ob- 
tained good observations for the longitude of tins important pomt 
on both sides of the Quango, and found the river running in 
9° 50' S. lat., 18° 33' E. long. 

On proceeding to our former station near Sansawe's village, he 
ran to meet us with wonderful urbanity, asking if we had seen 
Moene Put, king of the white men (or Portuguese) ; and added, 
on parting, that he would come to receive his dues in the evening. 
I replied that, as he had treated us so scurvily, even forbidding his 
people to sell us any food, if he did not bring a fowl and some eggs, 
as part of his duty as a chief, he should receive no present from 
me. When he came, it was in the usual Londa way of showing 
the exalted position he occupies, mounted on the shoulders of his 
spokesman, as schoolboys sometimes do in England, and as was 
represented to have been the case in the southern islands when 
Captain Cook visited them. My companions, amused at his idea 
of dignity, greeted him with a hearty laugh. He visited the 
native traders first, and then came to me with two cocks as a 
present. I spoke to him about the impolicy of the treatment we 
had received at his hands, and quoted the example of the Bangalas, 
who had been conquered by the Portuguese, for then extortionate 
demands of payment for firewood, grass, water, &c. ; and concluded 
by denying his right to any payment for simply passing through 
uncultivated land. To all this he agreed ; and then I gave him, 
as a token of friendship, a pannikin of coarse powder, two iron 
spoons, and two yards of coarse printed calico. He looked rather 



444 LONG DETENTION. Chap. XXII. 

saucily at these articles, for he had just received a barrel con- 
taining 18 lbs. of powder, 24 yards of calico, and two bottles of 
brandy, from Senhor Pascoal the Pombeiro. Other presents were 
added the next day, but we gave nothing more ; and the Pombeiros 
informed me that it was necessary to give largely, because they 
are accompanied by slaves and carriers who are no great friends 
to their masters ; and if they did not secure the friendship of these 
petty chiefs, many slaves and their loads might be stolen while 
passing through the forests. It is thus a sort of black-mail that 
these insignificant chiefs levy ; and the native traders, in paying, 
do so simply as a bribe to keep them honest. This chief was a 
man of no power ; but in our former ignorance of this, he plagued 
us a whole day in passing. 

Finding the progress of Senhor Pascoal and the other Pom- 
beiros excessively slow, I resolved to forego his company to 
Cabango, after I had delivered to him. some letters to be sent 
back to Cassange. I went forward with the intention of finishing 
my writing, and leaving a packet for him at some village. We 
ascended the eastern acclivity that bounds the Cassange valley, 
which has rather a gradual ascent up from the Quango, and we 
found that the last ascent, though apparently not quite so high 
as that at Tala Mungongo, is actually much higher. The top is 
about 5000 feet above the level of the sea, and the bottom 3500 
feet ; water boiling on the heights at 202°, the thermometer in 
the air showing 96° ; and at the bottom at 205°, the air being 
75°. We had now gained the summit of the western subtending 
ridge, and began to descend towards the centre of the country, 
hoping soon to get out of the Chiboque territory, which, when we 
ascended from the Cassange valley, we had entered, but on the 
19th of April the intermittent, which had begun on the 16th of 
March, was changed into an extremely severe attack of rheumatic 
fever. This was brought on by being obliged to sleep on an ex- 
tensive plain covered with water. The rain poured down inces- 
santly, but we formed our beds by dragging up the earth into 
oblong mounds, somewhat like graves in a country churchyard, 
and then placing grass upon them. The rain continuing to deluge 
us, we were unable to leave for two days, but as soon as it became 
fair we continued our march. The heavy dew upon the high 
grass was so cold, as to cause shivering, and I was forced to lie by 



Chap. XXII. A BLOW ON THE BEARD. 445 

for eight days, tossing and groaning with violent pain in the head. 
This was the most severe attack I had endured. It made me quite 
unfit to move, or even know what was passing outside my little 
tent. Senlior Pascoal, who had been detained by the severe rain 
at a better spot, at last came up, and, knowing that leeches abounded 
in the rivulets, procured a number, and applied some dozens to 
the nape of the neck and the loins. This partially relieved the 
pain. He was then obliged to move forward, in order to purchase 
food for his large party. After many days I began to recover, 
and wished to move on, but my men objected to the attempt on 
account of my weakness. When Senhor Pascoal had been some 
time at the village in front, as he had received instructions from 
his employer Captain Neves to aid me as much as possible, and 
being himself a kindly-disposed person, he sent back two mes- 
sengers to invite me to come on, if practicable. 

It happened that the head-man of the village where I had lain 
twenty-two days, while bargaining and quarrelling in my camp 
for a piece of meat, had been struck on the mouth by one of my 
men. My principal men paid five pieces of cloth and a gun as 
an atonement ; but the more they yielded, the more exorbitant 
he became, and he sent word to all the surrounding villages to 
aid him in avenging the affront of a blow on the beard. As their 
courage usually rises with success, I resolved to yield no more, and 
departed. In passing tlirough a forest in the country beyond, we 
were startled by a body of men rushing after us. They began by 
knocking down the burdens of the hindermost of my men, and 
several shots were fired, each party spreading out on both sides 
of the path. I fortunately had a six-barrelled revolver, which my 
friend Captain Henry Need, of her Majesty's brig " Linnet," had 
considerately sent to Golungo Alto after my departure from Lo- 
anda. Taking this in my hand, and forgetting fever, I staggered 
quickly along the path with two or three of my men, and fortu- 
nately encountered the chief. The sight of the six barrels gaping 
into his stomach, with my own ghastly visage looking daggers at 
his face, seemed to produce an instant revolution in his martial 
feelings, for he cried out, " Oh ! I have only come to speak to 
you, and wish peace only." Mashauana had hold of him by the 
hand, and found him shaking. We examined his gun, and found 
that it had been discharged. Both parties crowded up to their 



446 SKIRMISH IN A FOREST. Chap. XXH. 

chiefs. One of the opposite party coming too near, one of mine 
drove him back with a battle-axe. The enemy protested their 
amicable intentions, and my men asserted the fact of having the 
goods knocked down as evidence of the contrary. Without waiting 
long, I requested all to sit down, and Pitsane, placing his hand 
upon the revolver, somewhat allayed their fears. I then said to 
the chief, " If you have come with peaceable intentions, we have 
no other ; go away home to your village." He replied, " I am 
afraid lest you shoot me in the back." I rejoined, " If I wanted 
to kill you, I could shoot you in the face as well." Mosantu 
called out to me, " That's only a Makalaka trick ; don't give him 
your back." But I said, "Tell him to observe that I am not 
afraid of him ;" and, turning, mounted my ox. There was not 
much danger in the fire that was opened at first, there being so 
many trees. The enemy probably expected that the sudden 
attack would make us forsake our goods, and allow them to 
plunder with ease. The villagers were no doubt pleased with 
being allowed to retire unscathed, and we were also glad to get 
away without having shed a drop of blood, or having compro- 
mised ourselves for any future visit. My men were delighted with 
their own bravery, and made the woods ring with telling each 
other how "brilliant their conduct before the enemy" would 
have been, had hostilities not been brought to a sudden close. 

I do not mention this little skirmish as a very frightful affair. 
The negro character in these parts, and in Angola, is essentially 
cowardly, except when influenced by success. A partial triumph 
over any body of men would induce the whole country to rise in 
arms, and this is the chief danger to be feared. These petty 
chiefs have mdividually but little power, and with my men, now 
armed with guns, I could have easily beaten them off singly ; but, 
being of the same family, they would readily unite in vast 
numbers, if incited by prospects of successful plunder. They are 
by no means equal to the Cape Caffres in any respect whatever. 

In the evening we came to Moena Kikanje, and found him a 
sensible man. He is the last of the Chiboque chiefs in this 
direction, and is in alliance with Matiamvo, whose territory com- 
mences a short distance beyond. His village is placed on the 
east bank of the Quilo, winch is here twenty yards wide, and 
breast deep. 



Chap. XXII. MODE OF ADDRESSING SLAVES. 447 

The country was generally covered with forest, and we slept 
every night at some village. I was so weak, and had become so 
deaf from the effects of the fever, that I was glad to avail myself 
of the company of Senhor Pascoal and the other native traders. 
Our rate of travelling was only two geographical miles per hour, 
and the average number of hours three and a half per day, or 
seven miles. Two-thirds of the month was spent in stoppages, 
there being only ten travelling days in each month. The stop- 
pages were caused by sickness, and the necessity of remaining in 
different parts to purchase food; and also because, when one 
carrier was sick, the rest refused to carry Iris load. 

One of the Pombeiros had eight good-looking women in a 
chain, whom he was taking to the country of Matiamvo to sell for 
ivory. They always looked ashamed when I happened to come 
near them, and must have felt keenly their forlorn and degraded 
position. I believe they were captives taken from the rebel 
Cassanges. The way in which slaves are spoken of in Angola 
and eastern Africa, must sound strangely even to the owners, when 
they first come from Europe. In Angola the common appellation 
is " o cliabo," or " brutu ;" and it is quite usual to hear gentlemen 
call out " diabo ! bring fire." In eastern Africa, on the con- 
trary, they apply the term " bicho " (an animal), and you hear 
the phrase, " Call the animal to do this or that." In fact, slave- 
owners come to regard their slaves as not human, and will curse 
them as the " race of a dog." Most of the carriers of my travel- 
ling companions were hired Basongo, and required constant vigi- 
lance to prevent them stealing the goods they carried. Salt, which 
is one of the chief articles conveyed into the country, became 
considerably lighter as we went along, but the carriers shielded 
themselves, by saying that it had been melted by the rain. Their 
burdens were taken from them every evening, and placed in 
security under the guardianship of Senhor Pascoal's own slaves. 
It was pitiable to observe the worrying life he led. There was 
the greatest contrast possible between the conduct of his people, 
and that of my faithful Makololo. 

We crossed the Loange, a deep but narrow stream, by a bridge. 
It becomes much larger, and contains hippopotami, lower down. 
It is the boundary of Londa on the west. We slept also on the 
banks of the Pezo, now flooded, and could not but admire their 



448 FEEDERS OF THE CONGO. Chap. XXII. 

capabilities for easy irrigation. On reaching the river Chikapa 
(lat. 10° 10' S., long. 19° 42' E.), the 25th of March, we found 
it fifty or sixty yards wide, and flowing E.N.E. into the Kasai. 
The adjacent country is of the same level nature as that part of 
Londa formerly described ; but, having come further to the east- 
ward than our previous course, we found that all the rivers had 
worn for themselves much deeper valleys than at the points we 
had formerly crossed them. 

Surrounded on all sides by large gloomy forests, the people of 
these parts have a much more indistinct idea of the geography 
of their country, than those who live in hilly regions. It was only 
after long and patient inquiry, that I became fully persuaded that 
the Quilo runs into the Chikapa. As we now crossed them both 
considerably further down, and were greatly to the eastward of our 
first route, there can be no doubt that these rivers take the same 
course as the others, into the Kasai, and that I had been led into 
a mistake in saying that any of them flowed to the westward. 
Indeed it was only at tins time, that I began to perceive that all 
the western feeders of the Kasai, except the Quango, flow first 
from the western side towards the centre of the country, then 
gradually turn, with the Kasai itself, to the north ; and, after the 
confluence of the Kasai with the Quango, an immense body of 
water, collected from all these branches, finds its way out of the 
country by means of the river Congo or Zaire on the west coast. 

The people living along the path we are now following were 
quite accustomed to the visits of native traders, and did not feel 
in any way bound to make presents of food, except for the purpose 
of cheating : thus, a man gave me a fowl and some meal, and, 
after a short time, returned. I offered him a handsome present 
of beads ; but these he declined, and demanded a cloth instead, 
which was far more than the value of Ins gift. They did the 
same with my men, until we had to refuse presents altogether. 
Others made high demands because I slept in a " house of cloth," 
and must be rich. They seemed to think that they had a perfect 
right to payment, for simply passing through the country. 

Beyond the Chikapa, we crossed the Kamaue, a small deep 
stream, proceeding from the S.S.W., and flowing into the Chikapa. 

On the 30th of April we reached the Loajima, where we had 
to form a bridge to effect our passage. Tins was not so difficult 



Chap. XXII. 



MODES OF DRESSING THE HAIR. 



449 



an operation as some might imagine ; for a tree was growing in a 
horizontal position across part of the stream, and, there bemg no 
want of the tough climbing plants which admit of being knitted 
like ropes, Senhor P. soon constructed a bridge. The Loajima 
was here about twenty-five yards wide, but very much deeper 
than where I had crossed before on the shoulders of Mashauana. 
The last rain of this season had fallen on the 28th, and had sud-

shoulders, together with their general features, again reminded 
me of the ancient Egyptians. Several were seen with the upward 
inclination of the outer angles of the eyes, but this was not 
general. A few of the ladies adopt a curious custom of attaching 
the hair to a hoop which encircles the head, giving it somewhat 
the appearance of the glory round the head, of the Virgin (wood- 
cut No. 1). Some have a small hoop behind that represented in 
the woodcut. Others wear an ornament of woven hair and hide 
adorned with beads. The hair of the tails of buffaloes, which 
are to be found further east, is sometimes added. Tins is

We made a little detour to the southward, in order to get pro- 
visions in a cheaper market. This led us along the rivulet called 
Tamba, where we found the people, who had not been visited so 
frequently by the slave-traders as the rest, rather timid and very 
civil. It was agreeable to get again among the uncontaminated, 
and to see the natives look at us without that air of supercilious- 
ness, which is so unpleasant and common in the beaten track. 
The same olive colour prevailed. They file then teeth to a point, 
which makes the smile of the women frightful, as it reminds one 
of the grin of an alligator. The inhabitants throughout this 
country, exhibit as great a variety of taste, as appears on the 
surface of society amongst ourselves. Many of the men are 
dandies ; their shoulders are always wet with the oil dropping 
from their lubricated hair, and everything about them is orna- 
mented hi one way or another. Some thrum a musical instrument 
the livelong day, and, when they wake at night, proceed at once 
to their musical performance. Many of these musicians are too 
poor to have iron keys to their instrument, but make them of 



Chap. XXIII. SCARCITY OF ANIMALS — FORESTS. 453 

bamboo, and persevere, though no one hears the music but them- 
selves. Others try to appear warlike by never going out of their 
huts, except with a load of bows and arrows, or a gun ornamented 
with a strip of hide for every animal they have shot ; and others 
never go anywhere without a' canary in a cage. Ladies may be 
seen carefully tending little lapdogs, which are intended to be 
eaten. Their villages are generally in forests, and composed of 
groups of irregularly planted brown huts, with banana and cotton 
trees, and tobacco growing around. There is also at every hut a 
high stage erected for drying manioc roots and meal, and elevated 
cages to hold domestic fowls. Round baskets are laid on the 
thatch of the huts, for the hens to lay in, and on the arrival of 
strangers, men, women, and children ply their calling as hucksters, 
with a great deal of noisy haggling ; all then- transactions are 
conducted with civil banter and good temper. 

My men, having the meat of the oxen which we slaughtered 
from time to time for sale, were entreated to exchange it for 
meal ; no matter how small the pieces offered were, it gave them 
pleasure to deal. 

The landscape around is green, with a tint of yellow, the grass 
long, the paths about a foot wide, and generally worn deeply in 
the middle. The tall overhanging grass, when brushed against 
by the feet and legs, disturbed the lizards and mice, and occasion- 
ally a serpent, causing a rustling amongst the herbage. There 
are not many birds ; every animal is entrapped and eaten. Gins 
are seen on both sides of the path every ten or fifteen yards, for 
miles together. The time and labour required to dig up moles 
and mice from their burrows, would, if applied to cultivation, 
afford food for any amount of fowls or swine, but the latter are 
seldom met with. 

We passed on through forests abounding in climbing-plants, 
many of which are so extremely tough, that a man is required to 
go in front with a hatchet ; and when the burdens of the carriers 
are caught, they are obliged to cut the climbers with their teeth, 
for no amount of tugging will make them break. The paths in 
all these forests are so zigzag, that a person may imagine he has 
travelled a distance of thirty miles, which, when reckoned as the 
crow flies, may not be fifteen. 

We reached the river Moamba (lat. 9° 38' S., long. 20° 13' 34" 



454 GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE. Chap. XXIII. 

E.) on the 7th May. This is a stream of thirty yards wide, and, 
like the Quilo, Loange, Cliikapa, and Loajima, contains both alli- 
gators and hippopotami. We crossed it by means of canoes. 
Here, as on the slopes down to the Quilo and Chikapa, we had an 
opportunity of viewing the geological structure of the country, — 
a capping of ferruginous conglomerate, which in many parts looks 
as if it had been melted, for the rounded nodules resemble masses 
of slag, and they have a smooth scale on the surface ; but in all 
probability it is an aqueous deposit, for it contains water-worn 
pebbles of all sorts, and generally small. Below this mass, lies a 
pale-red hardened sandstone, and beneath that, a trap-like whin- 
stone. Lowest of all lies a coarse-grained sandstone containing a 
few pebbles, and in connection with it, a white calcareous rock is 
occasionally met with, and so are banks of loose round quartz 
pebbles. The slopes are longer from the level country above, the 
further we go eastward, and everywhere we meet with circumscribed 
bogs on them, surrounded by clumps of straight, lofty, evergreen 
trees, which look extremely graceful on a ground of yellowish 
grass. Several of these bogs pour forth a solution of iron, which 
exhibits on its surface the prismatic colours. The level plateaus 
between the rivers, both east and west of the Moamba, across 
winch we travelled, were less woody than the river glens. The 
trees on them are scraggy and wide apart. There are also large 
open grass-covered spaces, with scarcely even a bush. On these 
rather dreary intervals between the rivers, it was impossible not 
to be painfully struck with the absence of all animal life. Not a 
bird was to be seen, except occasionally a tomtit, some of the 
Sylviadce and Drymoica, also a black bird (Dicrurus Ludwigii, 
Smith), common throughout the country. We were gladdened 
by the voice of birds only near the rivers, and there they are 
neither numerous nor varied. The Senegal longclaw, however, 
maintains its place, and is the largest bird seen. We saw a 
butcher-bird in a trap as we passed. There are remarkably few 
small animals, they having been hunted almost to extermination, 
and few insects except ants, which abound in considerable number 
and variety. There are scarcely any common flies to be seen, 
nor are we ever troubled by mosquitoes. 

The air is still, hot, and oppressive ; the intensely bright sun- 
light glances peacefully on the evergreen forest leaves, and all 



Chap. XXIII. CHEAPNESS OF FOOD. 455 

feel glad when the path comes into the shade. The want of life 
in the scenery made me long to tread again the banks of the 
Zambesi, and see the graceful antelopes feeding beside the dark 
buffaloes and sleek elands. Here hippopotami are known to 
exist only by their footprints on the banks. Not one is ever seen 
to blow or put his head up at all ; they have learned to breathe 
in silence, and keep out of sight. We never heard one uttering 
the snorting sound so common on the Zambesi. 

We crossed two small streams, the Kanesi and Fombeji, before 
reaching Cabango, a village situated on the banks of the Chi- 
hombo. The country was becoming more densely peopled as we 
proceeded, but it bears no population compared to what it might 
easily sustain. Provisions were to be had in great abundance ; a 
fowl and basket of meal weighing 20 lbs. were sold for a yard and 
a half of very inferior cotton-cloth, worth not more than three 
pence. An idea of the cheapness of food may be formed from 
the fact, that Captain Neves purchased 380 lbs. of tobacco from 
the Bangalas, for about two pounds sterling. This, when carried 
into central Londa, might purchase seven thousand five hundred 
fowls, or feed with meal and fowls seven thousand persons for one 
clay, giving each a fowl and 5 lbs. of meal. When food is pur- 
chased here with either salt or coarse calico, four persons can be 
well fed with animal and vegetable food at the rate of one penny 
a day. The chief vegetable food is the manioc and lotsa meal. 
These contain a very large proportion of starch, and when eaten 
alone for any length of time, produce most distressing heartburn. 
As we ourselves experienced in coming north, they also cause a 
weakness of vision, which occurs in the case of animals fed on 
pure gluten or amyllaceous matter only. I now discovered that 
when these starchy substances are eaten along with a proportion 
of ground-nuts, which contain a considerable quantity of oil, no 
injurious effects follow. 

While on the way tc Cabango, we saw fresh tracks of elands, 
the first we had observed in this country. A poor little slave- 
girl, being ill, turned aside in the path, and, though we waited 
all the next day making search for her, she was lost. She was 
tall and slender for her age, as if of too quick growth, and pro- 
bably, unable to bear the fatigue of the march, lay down and slept 
in the forest, ther, waking in the dark, went farther and farther 



456 FUNERAL OBSEQUIES. Chap. XXIII. 

astray. The treatment of the slaves witnessed by my men, cer- 
tainly did not raise slaveholders in their estimation. Their usual 
exclamation was, " Ga ba na pelu " (They have no heart) ; and 
they added, with reference to the slaves, "Why do they let 
them ?" as if they thought that the slaves had the natural right 
to rid the world of such heartless creatures, and ought to do it. 
The uneasiness of the trader was continually showing itself, and, 
upon the whole, he had reason to be on the alert both day and 
night. The carriers perpetually stole the goods intrusted to their 
care, and he could not openly accuse them, lest they should 
plunder him of all, and leave him quite in the lurch. He could 
only hope to manage them after getting all the remaining goods 
safely into a house in Cabango ; he might then deduct something 
from their pay, for what they had purloined on the way. 

Cabango (lat. 9° 31' S., long. 20° 31' or 32' E.) is the dwelling- 
place of Muanzanza, one of Matiamvo's subordinate chiefs. His 
village consists of about two hundred huts, and ten or twelve 
square houses, constructed of poles with grass interwoven. The 
latter are occupied by half-caste Portuguese from Ambaca, agents 
for the Cassange traders. The cold in the mornings was now 
severe to the feelings, the thermometer ranging from 58° to 60°, 
though, when protected, sometimes standing as high as 64° at 
six A.M. When the sun is well up, the thermometer in the shade 
rises to 80°, and in the evenings it is about 78°. 

A person having died in this village, we could transact no 
business with the chief, until the funeral obsequies were finished. 
These occupy about four days, during which there is a constant 
succession of dancing, wailing, and feasting. Guns are fired by 
day, and drums beaten by night, and all the relatives, dressed in 
fantastic caps, keep up the ceremonies with spirit proportionate 
to the amount of beer and beef expended. When there is a large 
expenditure, the remark is often made afterwards, " What a fine 
funeral that was ! " A figure, consisting chiefly of feathers and 
beads, is paraded on these occasions, and seems to be regarded as 
an idol. 

Having met with an accident to one of my eyes, by a blow 
from a branch in passing tlirough a forest, I remained some days 
here, endeavouring, though with much pain, to draw a sketch of 
the country thus far, to be sent back to Mr. Gabriel at Loanda. 



Chap. XXIII. THE KASAI AND QUANGO. 457 

I was always anxious to transmit an account of my discoveries on 
every possible occasion, lest, anything happening in the country 
to winch I was going, they should be entirely lost. I also fondly 
expected a packet of letters and papers which my good angel at 
Loanda would be sure to send, if they came to hand, but I after- 
wards found that, though he had offered a large sum to any one 
who would return with an assurance of having delivered the last 
packet he sent, no one followed me with it to Cabango. The 
unwearied attentions of this good Englishman, from his first 
welcome to me when, a weary, dejected, and worn-down stranger, 
I arrived at Ins residence, and Ins whole subsequent conduct, will 
be held in lively remembrance by me to my dying day. 

Several of the native traders here having visited the country of 
Luba, lying far to the north of this, and there being some visitors 
also from the town of Mai, which is situated far down the Kasai, 
I picked up some information respectmg those distant parts. In 
going to the town of Mai the traders crossed only two large rivers, 
the Loajima and Chihombo. The Kasai flows a little to the east 
of the town of Mai, and near it there is a large waterfall. They 
describe the Kasai as being there of very great size, and that it 
thence bends round to the west. On asking an old man, who was 
about to return to his chief Mai, to imagine himself standing 
at his home, and point to the confluence of the Quango and 
Kasai, he immediately turned, and, pointing to the westward, said, 
"When we travel frve days (thirty-five or forty miles) in that 
direction, we come to it." He stated also that the Kasai received 
another river, named the Lubilash. There is but one opinion 
among the Balonda respectmg the Kasai and Quango. They inva- 
riably describe the Kasai as receiving the Quango, and, beyond 
the confluence, assuming the name of Zaire or Zerezere. And 
the Kasai, even previous to the junction, is much larger than the 
Quango, from the numerous branches it receives. Besides those 
we have already crossed, there is the Chihombo at Cabango; 
and, forty-two miles beyond this, eastward, runs the Kasai itself; 
fourteen miles beyond that the Kaunguesi ; then, forty-two miles 
further east, flows the Lolua ; besides numbers of little streams, 
all of which contribute to swell the Kasai. 

About thirty-four miles east of the Lolua, or a hundred and 
thirty-two miles E.N.E. of Cabango, stands the town of Matiamvo, 



458 DRAINAGE OF LONDA. Chap. XXIII. 

the paramount chief of all the Balonda. The town of Mai is 
pointed out as to the N.N.W. of Cabango, and thirty-two days or 
two hundred and twenty-four miles distant, or about lat. S. 5° 45'. 
The chief town of Luba, another independent chief, is eight days 
farther in the same direction, or lat. S. 4° 50'. Judging from the 
appearance of the people who had come for the purposes of 
trade from Mai, those in the north are in quite as uncivilised a 
condition as the Balonda. They are clad in a kind of cloth made 
of the inner bark of a tree. Neither guns nor native traders are 
admitted into the country, the chief of Luba entertaining a dread 
of innovation. If a native trader goes thither, he must dress like 
the common people in Angola, in a loose robe resembling a kilt. 
The chief trades in shells and beads only. His people kill the 
elephants by means of spears, poisoned arrows, and traps. All 
assert that elephants' tusks from that country, are heavier, and 
of greater length, than any others. 

It is evident, from all the information I could collect both here 
and elsewhere, that the drainage of Londa falls to the north and 
then runs westward. The countries of Luba and Mai are evidently 
lower than this, and yet this is of no great altitude — probably not 
much more than 3500 feet above the level of the sea. Having 
here received pretty certain information on a point in which I felt 
much interest, namely, that the Kasai is not navigable from the 
coast, owing to the large waterfall near the town of Mai, and that 
no great kingdom exists in the region beyond, between this and 
the equator, I would fain have visited Matiamvo. This seemed a 
very desirable step, as it is good policy as well as right, to acknow- 
ledge the sovereign of a country ; and I was assured, both by 
Balonda and native traders, that a considerable branch of the 
Zambesi rises in the country east of his town, and flows away to 
the south. The whole of this branch, extending down even to 
where it turns westward to Masiko, is probably placed too far 
eastwards on the map. It was put down when I believed 
Matiamvo and Cazembe to be further east than I have since 
seen reason to believe them. All, being derived from native 
testimony, is offered to the reader with diffidence, as needing 
verification by actual explorers. The people of that part, named 
Kanyika and Kanyoka, living on its banks, are represented as 
both nnmerous and friendly, but Matiamvo will on no account 



Chap. XX1H. MATIAMVO'S COUNTRY AND GOVERNMENT. 459 

permit any white person to visit them, as his principal supplies of 
ivory are drawn from them. Thinking that we might descend this 
branch of the Zambesi to Masiko, and thence to the Barotse, I felt 
a strong inclination to make the attempt. The goods, however, we 
had brought with us to pay our way, had, by the long detention 
from fever and weakness in both myself and men, dwindled to a 
mere fragment ; and, being but slightly acquainted with the 
Balonda dialect, I felt that I could neither use persuasion nor 
presents to effect my object. From all I could hear of Matiamvo, 
there was no chance of my being allowed to proceed through his 
country to the southward. If I had gone merely to visit him, all 
the goods would have been expended by the time I returned to 
Cabango ; and we had not found mendicity so pleasant on our 
way to the north, as to induce us to desire to return to it. 

The country of Matiamvo is said to be well peopled, but they 
have little or no trade. They receive calico, salt, gunpowder, 
coarse earthenware, and beads, and give in return ivory and 
slaves. They possess no cattle, Matiamvo alone having a single 
herd, which he keeps entirely for the sake of the flesh. The 
present chief is said to be mild in his government, and will depose 
an under-chief for unjust conduct. He occasionally sends the 
distance of a hundred miles or more, to behead an offending 
officer. But though I was informed by the Portuguese that he 
possesses absolute power, his name had less influence over Ins 
subjects with whom I. came in contact, than that of Sekeletu has, 
over his people living at a much greater distance from the capital. 

As we thought it best to strike away to the S.E. from Cabango 
to our old friend Katema, I asked a guide from Muanzanza as 
soon as the funeral proceedings were over. He agreed to furnish 
one, and also accepted a smaller present from me than usual, 
when it was represented to him by Pascoal and Faria that I was 
not a trader. He seemed to regard these presents as his proper 
dues ; and as a cargo of goods had come by Senhor Pascoal, he 
entered the house for the purpose of receiving his share, when 
Senhor Faria gravely presented him with the commonest earthen- 
ware vessel, of which great numbers are brought for this trade. 
The chief received it with expressions of abundant gratitude, as 
these vessels are highly valued because from their depth they can 
hold so much food or beer. The association of ideas is some- 



460 A FAITHLESS GUIDE. Chap. XXIII. 

times so very ludicrous, that it is difficult to maintain one's 
gravity. 

Several of the children of the late Matiamvo came to beg from 
me, but never to offer any food. Having spoken to one young man 
named Liula (Heavens) about their stinginess, he soon brought 
bananas and manioc. I liked his appearance and conversation ; 
and believe that the Balonda would not be difficult to teach, but 
their mode of life would be a drawback. The Balonda in this 
quarter are much more agreeable-looking than any of the inha- 
bitants nearer the coast. The women allow their teeth to remain 
in then beautifully white state, and would be comely, but for the 
custom of inserting pieces of reed into the cartilage of the nose. 
They seem generally to be in good spirits, and spend their time 
in everlasting talk, funeral ceremonies, and marriages. This flow 
of animal spirits must be one reason why they are such an inde- 
structible race. The habitual influence on their minds of the 
agency of unseen spirits, may have a tendency in the same direc- 
tion, by preserving the mental quietude of a kind of fatalism. 

We were forced to prej)ay our guide and his father too, and he 
went but one day, although he promised to go with us to Katema. 
He was not in the least ashamed at breaking his engagements, 
and probably no disgrace will be attached to the deed by Muan- 
zanza. Among the Bakwains he would have been punished. My 
men would have stripped him of the wages which he wore on his 
person, but thought that, as we had always acted on the mildest 
principles, they would let him move off with his unearned gains. 

They frequently lamented the want of knowledge in these 
people, saying in their own tongue, " Ah ! they don't know that 
we are men as well as they, and that we are only bearing with 
their insolence with patience because we are men." Then would 
follow a hearty curse, showing that the patience was nearly ex- 
pended ; but they seldom quarrelled in the language of the 
Balonda. The only one who ever lost his temper, was the man 
who struck a head-man of one of the villages on the mouth, and 
he was the most abject individual in our company. 

The reason why we needed a guide at all, was, to secure the 
convenience of a path, which, though generally no better than a 
sheep-walk, is much easier than going straight in one direction, 
through tangled forests and tropical vegetation. We knew the 



Chap. XXIII. CIVILITY OF A FEMALE CHIEF. 461 

general direction we ought to follow, and also if any deviation 
occurred from our proper route ; but to avoid impassable forests 
and untreadable bogs, and to get to the proper fords of the rivers, 
we always tried to procure a guide, and he always followed the 
common path from one village to another when that lay in the 
direction we were going. 

After leaving Cabango on the 21st, we crossed several little 
streams running into the Chiliombo on our left, and in one of 
them I saw tree ferns ( Cyathea dregei) for the first time in Africa. 
The trunk was about four feet high and ten inches in diameter. 
We saw also grass trees of two varieties, which in damp localities 
had attained a height of forty feet. On crossing the Chihombo, 
winch we did about twelve miles above Cabango, we found it 
waist-deep and rapid. We were delighted to see the evidences of 
buffalo and hippopotami on its banks. As soon as we got away 
from the track of the slave-traders, the more kindly spirit of the 
southern Balonda appeared, for an old man brought a large 
present of food from one of the villages, and volunteered to go as 
guide himself. The people, however, of the numerous villages 
which we passed, always made efforts to detain us, that they 
might have a little trade in the way of furnishing our suppers. 
At one village, indeed, they would not show us the path at all, 
unless we remained at least a day with them. Having refused, 
we took a path in the direction we ought to go, but it led us 
into an inextricable thicket. Eeturning to the village again, we 
tried another footpath in a similar direction ; but this led us into 
an equally impassable and trackless forest. We were thus forced 
to come back and remain. In the following morning they put 
us in the proper path, which in a few hours led us through a 
forest, that would otherwise have taken us days to penetrate. 

Beyond this forest we found the village of Nyakalonga, a sister 
of the late Matiamvo, who treated us handsomely. She wished 
her people to guide us to the next village, but this they declined 
unless we engaged in trade. She then requested us to wait an 
hour or two till she could get ready a present of meal, manioc- 
roots, ground-nuts, and a fowl. It was truly pleasant to meet 
with people possessing some civility, after the hauteur we had 
experienced on the slave-path. She sent her son to the next 
village without requiring payment. The stream winch ran past 



4G2 DESIRE TO POSSESS A VILLAGE. Chap. XXIII. 

her village was quite impassable there, and for a distance of about 
a mile on either side, the bog being soft and shaky, and, when the 
crust was broken through, about six feet deep. 

On the 28th we reached the village of the chief Bango (lat. 
12° 22' 53" S., long. 20° 58' E.), who brought us a handsome 
present of meal, and the meat of an entire pallah. We here 
slaughtered the last of the cows presented to us by Mr. Schut, 
winch I had kept milked, until it gave only a teaspoonful at a 
time. My men enjoyed a hearty laugh when they found that I 
had given up all hope of more, for they had been talking among 
themselves about my perseverance. We offered a leg of the cow 
to Bango ; but he informed us that neither he nor Ins people ever 
partook of beef, as they looked upon cattle as human, and living 
at home like men. None of Ins people purchased any of the 
meat, which was always eagerly done everywhere else. There 
are several other tribes who refuse to keep cattle, though not to 
eat them when offered by others, because, say they, oxen bring 
enemies and war ; but this is the first instance I have met with in 
which they have been refused as food. The fact of killing the 
pallahs for food, shows that the objection does not extend to 
meat in general. 

The little streams in this part of the country did not flow in 
deep dells, nor were we troubled with the gigantic grasses, which 
annoyed our eyes on the slopes of the streams before we came to 
Cabango. The country was quite flat, and the people cultivated 
manioc very extensively. There is no large collection of the 
inhabitants in any one spot. The ambition of each seems to be 
to have his own little village ; and we see many coming from 
distant parts with the flesh of buffaloes and antelopes as the tri- 
bute claimed by Bango. We have now entered again the country 
of the game ; but they are so exceedingly shy that we have not 
yet seen a single animal. The arrangement into many villages, 
pleases the Africans vastly, for every one who has a few huts under 
him, feels himself in some measure to be a chief. The country at 
this time is covered with yellowish grass quite dry. Some of the 
bushes and trees are green ; others are shedding their leaves, the 
young buds pushing off the old foliage. Trees, which in the south 
stand bare during the whiter months, have here but a short period 
of leaflessness. Occasionally, however, a cold north wind comes 



Chap. XXIII. SPRING AT KOLOBENG. 463 

up even as far as Cabango, and spreads a wintry aspect on all the 
exposed vegetation. The tender shoots of the evergreen trees 
on the south side become as if scorched ; the leaves of manioc, 
pumpkins, and other tender plants, are killed ; while the same 
kinds, in spots sheltered by forests, continue green through the 
whole year. All the interior of South Africa has a distinct winter 
of cold, varying in intensity with the latitudes. In the central 
parts of the Cape colony, the cold in the winter is often severe, 
and the ground is covered with snow. At Kuruman snow seldom 
falls, but the frost is keen. There is frost even as far as the 
Chobe, and a partial winter in the Barotse valley ; but beyond 
the Orange River we never have cold and damp combined. 
Indeed a shower of rain seldom or never falls during winter, 
and hence the healthiness of the Bechuana climate. From 
the Barotse valley northwards, it is questionable if it ever 
freezes ; but during the prevalence of the south wind, the 
thermometer sinks as low as 42°, and conveys the impression of 
bitter cold. 

Nothing can exceed the beauty of the change from the wintry 
appearance to that of spring, at Kolobeng. Previous to the com- 
mencement of the rains, an easterly wind blows strongly by day, 
but dies away at night. The clouds collect in increasing masses, 
and relieve in some measure the bright glare of the southern sun. 
The wind dries up everything ; and when at its greatest strength 
is hot, and raises clouds of dust. The general temperature during 
the day rises above 96° : then showers begin to fall ; and if the 
ground is but once well soaked with a good day's rain, the change 
produced is marvellous. In a day or two a tinge of green is 
apparent all over the landscape ; and in five or six days, the fresh 
leaves sprouting forth, and the young grass shooting up, give an 
appearance of spring which it requires weeks of a colder climate 
to produce. The birds, which in the hot dry windy season had 
been silent, now burst forth into merry twittering songs, and are 
busy building then nests. Some of them, indeed, hatch several 
times a-year. The lowering of the temperature, by rains or other 
causes, has much the same effect as the increasing mildness of our 
own spring. The earth teems with myriads of young insects ; in 
some parts of the country hundreds of centipedes, myriapedes, 
and beetles, emerge from their hiding-places, somewhat as our 



464 . WHITE ANTS. Chap. XXIII. 

snails at home do ; and in the evenings the white ants swarm by 
thousands. A stream of them is seen to rush out of a hole, and, 
after flying one or two hundred yards, they descend ; and if they 
light upon a piece of soil proper for the commencement of a new 
colony, they bend up their tans, unhook their wings, and, leaving 
them on the surface, quickly begin then mining operations. If an 
attempt is made to separate the wings from the body by drawing 
them away backwards, they seem as if hooked into the body, and 
tear away large portions of the insect ; but if turned forward, as 
the ant itself does, they snap off with the greatest ease. Indeed 
they seem formed only to serve the insect in its short flight to a 
new habitation, and then to be thrown aside. Nothing can exceed 
the eagerness with winch at the proper time they rush out from 
their birthplace. Occasionally this occurs in a house, and then, 
in order to prevent every corner from being filled with them, 
I have seen a fire placed over the orifice ; but they hesitate not 
even to pass through the fire. While swarming they appear like 
snow-flakes floating about in the air, and dogs, cats, hawks, and 
almost every bird, may be seen busily devouring them. The 
natives, too, profit by the occasion, and actively collect them for 
food, they being about half an inch long, as thick as a crowquill, 
and very fat. When roasted they are said to be good, and some- 
what resemble grains of boiled rice. An idea may be formed of 
this dish by what once occurred on the banks of the Zouga. The 
Bayeiye chief Palani visiting us while eating, I gave him a piece 
of bread and preserved apricots ; and as he seemed to relish it 
much, I asked him if he had any food equal to that in his country. 
" Ah," said he, " did you ever taste white ants ?" As I never had, 
he replied, " Well, if you had, you never could have desired to eat 
anything better." The general way of catching them is to dig 
into the ant-hill, and wait till all the builders come forth to repair 
the damage ; then brush them off quickly into a vessel, as the 
ant-eater does into his mouth. 

The fall of the rain makes all the cattle look fresh and clean, 
and both men and women proceed cheerily to their already hoed 
gardens, and sow the seed. The large animals in the country 
leave the spots where they had been compelled to congregate for 
the sake of water, and become much wilder. Occasionally a herd 
of buffaloes or antelopes smell rain from afar, and set off in a 



Chap. XXTEI. VALLEY OF THE LOEMBWE. 465 

straight line towards the place. Sometimes they make mistakes, 
and are obliged to return to the water they had left. 

Very large tracts of country are denuded of old grass during 
the winter, by means of fire, in order to attract the game to that 
winch there springs up unmixed with the older crop. This new 
herbage has a renovating tendency, for as long as they feed on 
the dry grass of the former season they continue in good condi- 
tion ; but no sooner are they able to indulge their appetites on the 
fresh herbage, than even the marrow in then- bones becomes dis- 
solved, and a red soft uneatable mass is left behind. After this, 
commences the work of regaining their former plumpness. 

May 30th. — We left Bango, and proceeded to the river 
Loembwe, which flows to the N.N.E., and abounds in hippo- 
potami. It is about sixty yards wide and four feet deep, but 
usually contains much less water than this, for there are fishing- 
weirs placed right across it. Like all the African rivers in tins 
quarter, it has morasses on each bank, yet the valley in which it 
winds, when seen from the high lands above, is extremely beau- 
tiful. This valley is about the fourth of a mile wide, and it was 
easy to fancy the similarity of many spots on it to the goodly 
manors in our own country, and feel assured that there was still 
ample territory left for an indefinite increase of the world's popula- 
tion. The villages are widely apart, and difficult of access, from 
the paths being so covered with tall grass, that even an ox can 
scarcely follow the track. The grass cuts the feet of the men ; yet 
we met a woman with a little child, and a girl, wending their way 
home with loads of manioc. The sight of a white man always 
infuses a tremor into their dark bosoms, and in every case of the 
kind, they appeared immensely relieved when I had fairly passed, 
without having sprung upon them. In the villages, the dogs run 
away with their tails between their legs, as if they had seen a 
lion. The women peer from behind the walls till he comes near 
them, and then hastily dash into the house. When a little child, 
unconscious of danger, meets you in the street, he sets up a scream 
at the apparition, and conveys the impression that he is not far 
from going into fits. Among the Bechuanas, I have been obliged 
to reprove the women for making a hobgoblin of the white man, 
and telling their children that they would send for him to bite 
them.

466 SPECIMEN OF QUARRELLING. Chap. XXIII. 

Having passed the Loembwe, we were in a more open country, 
with every few hours a small valley, through winch ran a little 
rill in the middle of a bog. These were always difficult to pass, 
and being numerous, kept the lower part of the person constantly 
wet. At different points in our course we came upon votive 
offerings to the Barimo. These usually consisted of food ; and 
every deserted village still contained the idols and little sheds 
with pots of medicine in them. One afternoon we passed a 
small frame house, with the head of an ox in it as an object of 
worship. The dreary uniformity of gloomy forests and open flats, 
must have a depressing influence on the minds of the people. 
Some villages appear more superstitious than others, if we may 
judge from the greater number of idols they contain. 

Only on one occasion did we witness a specimen of quarrelling. 
An old woman, standing by our camp, continued to belabour a 
good-looking young man for hours with her tongue. Irritated at 
last, he uttered some words of impatience, when another man 
sprang at him, exclaiming, " How dare you curse my ' Mama ' ? " 
They caught each other, and a sort of pushing, dragging, wrest- 
ling-match ensued. The old woman who had been the cause of 
the affray, wished us to interfere, and the combatants themselves 
hoped as much, but we, preferring to remain neutral, allowed 
them to fight it out. It ended by one falling under the other, 
both, from their scuffling, being in a state of nudity. They 
picked up their clothing, and ran off in different directions, each 
threatening to bring his gun and settle the dispute in mortal 
combat. Only one, however, returned, and the old woman con- 
tinued her scolding till my men, fairly tired of her tongue, ordered 
her to be gone. This trifling incident was one of interest to me, 
for, during the whole period of my residence in the Bechuana 
country, I never saw unarmed men strike each other. Their 
disputes are usually conducted with great volubility and noisy 
swearing, but they generally terminate by both parties bursting 
into a laugh. 

At every village attempts were made to induce us to remain a 
night. Sometimes large pots of beer were offered to us as a 
temptation. Occasionally the head-man would peremptorily order 
us to halt under a tree which he pointed out. At other times 
young men volunteered to guide us to the impassable part of the 



Chap. XXIH. FUNERAL OBSERVANCES. 467 

next bog, in the hope of bringing us to a stand, for all are exces- 
sively eager to trade ; but food was so very cheap that we sometimes 
preferred paying them to keep it, and let us part in good humour. 
A good-sized fowl could be had for a single charge of gunpowder. 
Each native who owns a gun, carries about with him a measure 
capable of holding but one charge, in which he receives his 
powder. Throughout this region the women are almost entirely 
naked, their gowns being a patch of cloth frightfully narrow, 
with no flounces ; and nothing could exceed the eagerness with 
winch they offered to purchase strips of calico of an inferior 
description. They were delighted with the larger pieces Ave 
gave, though only about two feet long, for a fowl, and a basket 
of upwards of 20 lbs. of meal. As we had now only a small 
remnant of our stock, we were obliged to withstand their impor- 
tunity, and then many of the women, with true maternal feelings, 
held up their little naked babies, entreating us to sell only a little 
rag for them. The fire, they say, is their only clothing by night, 
and the little ones derive heat by clinging closely to their parents. 
Instead of a skin or cloth to carry their babies in, the women 
plait a belt about four inches broad, of the inner bark of a tree, 
and this, hung from the one shoulder to the opposite side, like a 
soldier's belt, enables them to support the child by placing it on 
their side in a sitting position. Their land is very fertile, 
and they can raise ground-nuts and manioc in abundance. Here 
I observed no cotton, nor any domestic animals except fowls and 
little dogs. The chief possessed a few goats, and I never could get 
any satisfactory reason, why the people also did not rear them. 

On the evening of the 2nd of June we reached the village of 
Kawawa, rather an important personage in these parts. This 
village consists of forty or fifty huts, and is surrounded by forest. 
Drums were beating over the body of a man who had died the 
preceding day, and some women were making a clamorous wail 
at the door of his hut, and addressing the deceased as if alive. 
The drums' continued beating the whole night, with as much 
regularity as a steam-engine thumps, on board ship. We observed 
that a person dressed fantastically with a great number of feathers, 
left the people at the dance and wailing, and went away into the 
deep forest in the morning, to return again to the obsequies in 
the evening ; he is intended to represent one of the Barimo.

468 KAWAWA'S DEMAND. Chap. XXIII. 

In the morning we had agreeable intercourse with Kawawa ; 
he visited us, and we sat and talked nearly the whole day with 
him and his people. When we visited liim in return, we found 
him in his large court-house, winch, though of a beehive shape, 
was remarkably well built. As I had shown him a number of 
curiosities, he now produced a jug, of English ware, shaped like 
an old man holding a can of beer in his hand, as the greatest 
curiosity he had to exhibit. 

We had now an opportunity of hearing a case brought before 
him for judgment. A poor man and his wife were accused of 
having bewitched the man, whose wake was now held in the 
village. Before Kawawa even heard the defence, he said, " You 
have killed one of my children. Bring all yours before me, that 
I may choose which of them shall be mine instead." The wife 
eloquently defended herself, but this availed little, for these 
accusations are the means resorted to by some chiefs, to secure 
subjects for the slave-market. He probably thought that I had 
come to purchase slaves, though I had already given a pretty full 
explanation of my pursuits both to himself and his people. We 
exhibited the pictures of the magic-lantern in the evening, and 
all were delighted except Kawawa himself. He showed symptoms 
of dread, and several times started up as if to run away, but was 
prevented by the crowd behind. Some of the more intelligent 
understood the explanations well, and expatiated eloquently on 
them to the more obtuse. Nothing could exceed the civilities 
which had passed between us during this day ; but Kawawa had 
heard that the Chiboque had forced us to pay an ox, and now 
thought he might do the same. When therefore I sent next 
morning to let him know that we were ready to start, he replied 
in his figurative way, "If an ox came in the way of a man, 
ought he not to eat it ? I had given one to the Chiboque, and 
must give him the same, together with a gun, gunpowder, and a 
black robe, like that he had seen spread out to dry the day before ; 
that, if I refused an ox, I must give one of my men, and a book 
by winch he might see the state of Matiamvo's heart towards him, 
and which would forewarn him, should Matiamvo ever resolve to 
cut off his head." Kawawa came in the coolest manner possible 
to our encampment after sending this message, and told me he 
had seen all our goods, and must have all he asked, as he had 



Chap. XXIH. UNPLEASANT PARTING. 469 

command of the Kasai in our front, and would prevent us from 
passing it, unless we paid this tribute. I replied that the goods 
were my property and not his ; that I would never have it said 
that a white man had paid tribute to a black ; and that I should 
cross the Kasai in spite of him. He ordered his people to arm 
themselves, and when some of my men saw them rushing for 
their bows, arrows, and spears, they became somewhat panic- 
stricken. I ordered them to move away, and not to fire unless 
Kawawa's people struck the first blow. I took the lead, and 
expected them all to follow, as they usually had done, but many 
of my men remained behind. When I knew this, I jumped 
off the ox, and made a rush to them with the revolver in my 
hand. Kawawa ran away amongst his people, and they turned 
their backs too. I shouted to my men to take up their luggage 
and march ; some did so with alacrity, feeling that they had 
disobeyed orders by remaining, but one of them refused, and was 
preparing to fire at Kawawa, until I gave him a punch on the 
head with the pistol, and made him go too. I felt here, as else- 
where, that subordination must be maintained at all risks. We 
all moved into the forest, the people of Kawawa standing about 
a hundred yards off, gazing, but not firing a shot or an arrow. 
It is extremely unpleasant to part with these chieftains thus, 
after spending a day or two in the most amicable intercourse, and 
in a part where the people are generally civil. This Kawawa, 
however, is not a good specimen of the Balonda chiefs, and is 
rather notorious in the neighbourhood for his folly. We were 
told, that he has good reason to believe that Matiamvo will some 
day cut off his head, for his disregard of the rights of strangers. 

Kawawa was not to be balked of his supposed rights by the 
unceremonious way in which we had left him, for, when we had 
reached the ford of the Kasai, about ten miles distant, we found 
that he had sent four of his men, with orders to the ferrymen to 
refuse us passage. We were here duly informed that we must 
deliver up all the articles mentioned, and one of our men besides. 
This demand for one of our number always nettled every heart. 
The canoes were taken away before our eyes, and we were sup- 
posed to be quite helpless without them, at a river a good hundred 
yards broad, and very deep. Pitsane stood on the bank, gazing 
with apparent indifference on the stream, and made an accurate 



470 



A STRATAGEM. 



Chap. XXIII. 



observation of where the canoes were hidden among the reeds. 
The ferrymen casually asked one of my Batoka if they had rivers 
in his country, and he answered with truth, " No, we have none." 
Kawawa's people then felt sure we could not cross. I thought of 
swimming when they were gone ; but after it was dark, by the 
unasked loan of one of the hidden canoes, we soon were snug in 
our bivouac on the southern bank of the Kasai. I left some beads, 
as payment for some meal, which had been presented by the 
ferrymen ; and, the canoe having been left on their own side of 
the river, Pitsane and his companions laughed uproariously at 
the disgust our enemies would feel, and then perplexity as to 
who had been our paddler across. They were quite sure that 
Kawawa would imagine that we had been ferried over by his own 
people, and would be divming to find out who had done the deed. 
When ready to depart hi the mornmg, Kawawa's people appeared 
on the opposite heights, and could scarcely believe their eyes 
when they saw us prepared to start away to the south. At last 
one of them called out, " Ah ! ye are bad." To which Pitsane 
and his companions retorted, " Ah ! ye are good ; and we thank 
you for the loan of your canoe." We were careful to explain the 
whole of the circumstances to Katema and the other chiefs, and 
they all agreed that we were perfectly justifiable under the cir- 
cumstances, and that Matiamvo would approve our conduct. 
When anything that might bear an unfavourable construction 
happens among themselves, they send explanations to each other. 
The mere fact of doing so, prevents them from losing their cha- 
racter, for there is public opinion even amongst them,

After leaving the Kasai, we entered upon the extensive level 
plains which we had formerly found in a flooded condition. The 
water on them was not yet dried up, as it still remained in certain 
hollow spots. Vultures were seen floating in the air, showing 
that carrion was to be found ; and, indeed, we saw several of the 
large game, but so exceedingly wild as to be unapproachable. 
Numbers of caterpillars mounted the stalks of grass, and many 
dragonflies and butterflies appeared, though tins was winter. The 
caprimulgus or goat-sucker, swifts, and different kinds of swallows, 
with a fiery-red bee-eater in flocks, showed that the lowest tem- 
perature here, does not destroy the insects on which they feed. 
Jet-black larks, with yellow shoulders, enliven the mornings with 
their songs, but they do not continue so long on the wing as ours, 
nor soar so high. We saw many of the pretty white ardea, and 



472 . FLOWERS — SUNDEW. Chap. XXIV. 

other water-birds, flying over the spots not yet dried up ; and 
occasionally wild ducks, but these only in numbers sufficient to 
remind us that we were approaching the Zambesi, where every 
water-fowl has a home. 

While passing across these interminable-looking plains, the eye 
rests with pleasure on a small flower, winch exists in such num- 
bers as to give its own hue to the ground. One broad band of 
yellow stretches across our path. On looking at the flowers which 
formed tins golden carpet, we saw every variety of that colour, 
from the palest lemon to the richest orange. Crossing a hundred 
yards of tins, we came upon another broad band of the same 
flower, but blue, and this colour is varied from the lightest tint, 
to dark blue and even purple. I had before observed the same 
flower possessing different colours in different parts of the country, 
and once, a great number of liver-coloured flowers, which else- 
where were yellow. Even the colour of the birds changed with 
the district we passed through ; but never before did I see such a 
marked change, as from yellow to blue, repeated again and again 
on the same plain. Another beautiful plant attracted my atten- 
tion so strongly on these plains, that I dismounted to examine it ; 
to my great delight I found it to be an old home acquaintance, 
a species of Drosera, closely resembling our own sundew (Drosera 
Anglia) ; the flower-stalk never attains a height of more than 
two or three inches, and the leaves are covered with reddish 
hairs, each of which has a drop of clammy fluid at its tip, making 
the whole appear as if spangled over with small diamonds. I 
noticed it first in the morning, and imagined the appearance was 
caused by the sun shining on drops of dew, but, as it continued 
to maintain its brilliancy during the heat of the day, I proceeded 
to investigate the cause of its beauty, and found that the points 
of the hairs exuded pure liquid, in, apparently, capsules of clear 
glutinous matter. They were thus like dewdrops preserved from 
evaporation. The clammy fluid is intended to entrap insects, 
which, dying on the leaf, probably yield nutriment to the plant. 

During our second day on this extensive plain, I suffered from 
my twenty-seventh attack of fever, at a part where no surface- 
water was to be found. We never thought it necessary to carry 
water with us in this region ; and now, when I was quite unable 
to move on, my men soon found water to allay my burning thirst 



Chap. XXIV. PHENOMENON OF THE LOTEMBWA. 473 

by digging with sticks a few feet beneath the surface. We had 
thus an opportunity of observing the state of these remarkable 
plains at different seasons of the year. Next day we pursued our 
way, and on the 8th of June, we forded the Lotembwa to the 
N.W. of Dilolo, and regained our former path. 

The Lotembwa here is about a mile wide, about three feet deep, 
and full of the lotus, papyrus, arum, mat-rushes, and other aquatic 
plants. I did not observe the course in which the water flowed, 
while crossing ; but, having noticed before that the Lotembwa on 
the other side of the lake Dilolo flowed in a southerly direction, 
I supposed that tins was simply a prolongation of the same river 
beyond Dilolo, and that it rose in this large marsh, which we had 
not seen in our progress to the N.W. But when we came to the 
Southern Lotembwa, we were informed by Shakatwala that the 
river we had crossed flowed in an opposite direction, — not into 
Dilolo, but into the Kasai. This phenomenon of a river running 
in opposite directions struck even his mind as strange ; and, 
though I did not observe the current, simply from taking it for 
granted that it was towards the lake, I have no doubt that his 
assertion, corroborated as it was by others, is correct, and that the 
Dilolo is actually the watershed between the river systems that 
flow to the east and west. 

I would have returned, in order to examine more carefully this 
most interesting point, but, having had my lower extremities 
chilled in crossing the Northern Lotembwa, I was seized with 
vomiting of blood, and, besides, saw no reason to doubt the native 
testimony. The distance between Dilolo and the valleys leading 
to that of the Kasai is not more than fifteen miles, and the plains 
between are perfectly level ; and, had I returned, I should only 
have found that tins little lake Dilolo, by giving a portion to the 
Kasai and another to the Zambesi, distributes its waters to the 
Atlantic and Indian Oceans. I state the fact exactly as it opened 
to my own mind ; for it was only now, that I apprehended the 
true form of the river systems and continent. I had seen the 
various rivers of this country on the western side flowing from 
the subtending ridges into the centre, and had received informa- 
tion from natives and Arabs, that most of the rivers on the eastern 
side of the same great region, took a somewhat similar course 
from an elevated ridge there, and that all united in two main 



474 POSITION OF ROCKS. Chap. XXIV. 

drains, the one flowing to the N. and the other to the S., and that 
the northern drain found its way out by the Congo to the W., 
and the southern by the Zambesi to the E. I was thus on the 
watershed, or highest point, of these two great systems, but still 
not more than 4000 feet above the level of the sea, and 1000 feet 
lower than the top of the western ridge we had already crossed ; 
yet, instead of lofty snow-clad mountains appearing to verify the 
conjectures of the speculative, we had extensive plains, over which 
one may travel a month without seeing anything higher than an 
ant-hill or a tree. I was not then aware that any one else had 
discovered the elevated trough form of the centre of Africa. 

I had observed that the old schistose rocks on the sides, dipped 
in towards the centre of the country, and their strike nearly corre- 
sponded with the major axis of the continent ; and also that where 
the later erupted trap-rocks had been spread out in tabular masses 
over the central plateau, they had borne angular fragments of the 
older rocks in their substance ; but the partial generalization 
which the observations led to, was, that great volcanic action had 
taken place in ancient times, somewhat in the same way it does 
now, at distances of not more than three hundred miles from the 
sea, and that tins igneous action, extending along both sides of 
the continent, had tilted up the lateral rocks in the manner they 
are now seen to he. The greater energy, and more extended 
range of igneous action, in those very remote periods when Africa 
was formed, embracing all the flanks, imparted to it its present 
very simple literal outline. This was the length to which I had 
come. 

The trap-rocks, which now constitute the " filling-up " of the 
great valley, were always a puzzle to me, till favoured with Sir 
Roderick Murchison's explanation of the original form of the 
continent, for then I could see clearly why these trap-rocks, 
which still lie in a perfectly horizontal position on extensive areas, 
held in their substance angular fragments, containing algae of the 
old schists, which form the bottom of the original lacustrine basin : 
the traps, in bursting through, had broken them off and preserved 
them. There are, besides, ranges of hills in the central parts, 
composed of clay and sandstone schists, with the ripple mark dis- 
tinct, in which no fossils appear ; but as they are usually tilted 
away from the masses of horizontal trap, it is probable that they 



Chap. XXIV. SIR B. MURCHISON'S EXPLANATION. 475 

too were a portion of the original bottom, and fossils may yet be 
found in them.* 

The characteristics of the rainy season in this wonderfully 
humid region, may account in some measure for the periodical 
floods of the Zambesi, and perhaps the Nile. The rains seem to 
follow the course of the sun, for they fall in October and Novem- 
ber, when the sun passes over this zone on his way south. On 
reaching the tropic of Capricorn in December, it is dry ; and 
December and January are the months in which injurious droughts 
are most dreaded near that tropic (from Kolobeng to Linyanti). 
As he returns again to the north, in February, March, and April, 
we have the great rains of the year ; and the plains, which in 
October and November were well moistened, and imbibed rain 
like sponges, now become supersaturated, and pour forth those 
floods of clear water which inundate the banks of the Zambesi. 
Somewhat the same phenomenon probably, causes the periodical 
inundations of the Nile. The two rivers rise in the same region ; 
but there is a difference in the period of flood, possibly from their 

* After dwelling upon the geological structure of the Cape Colony as 
developed by Mr. A. Bain, and the existence in very remote periods of lacus- 
trine conditions in the central part of South Africa, as proved by freshwater 
and terrestrial fossils, Sir Roderick Murchison thus writes : — 

" Such as South Africa is now, such have been her main features during 
countless past ages, anterior to the creation of the human race. For the old 
rocks which form her outer fringe, unquestionably circled round an interior 
marshy or lacustrine country, in which the Dicynodon flourished, at a time 
when not a single animal was similar to any living thing which now inhabits 
the surface of our globe. The present central and meridian zone of waters, 
whether lakes or marshes, extending from Lake Tchad to Lake 'Ngami, with 
hippopotami on their banks, are therefore but the great modern residual geo- 
graphical phenomena of those of a mesozoic age. The differences, however, 
between the geological past of Africa and her present state, are enormous. 
Since that primeval time, the lands have been much elevated above the sea- 
level — eruptive rocks piercing in parts through them ; deep rents and defiles 
have been suddenly formed in the subtending ridges through which some 
rivers escape outwards. 

" Travellers will eventually ascertain whether the basin-shaped structure, 
which is here announc-jd as having been the great feature of the most«,ncient, 
as it is of the actual geography of South Africa (i.e. from primeval times to 
the present day), does, or does not, extend into Northern Africa. Looking at 
that much broader portion of the continent, we have some reason to surmise 
that the higher mountains also form, in a general sense, its flanks only." —

being on opposite sides of the equator. The waters of the Nile 
are said to become turbid in June ; and the flood attains its 
greatest height in August, or the period when we may suppose 
the supersaturation to occur. The subject is worthy the inves- 
tigation of those who may examine the region between the 
equator and 10° S. ; for the Nile does not show much increase 
when the sun is at its furthest point north, or tropic of Cancer, 
but at the time of its returning to the equator, exactly as in the 
other case when he is on Capricorn, and the Zambesi is affected.* 

From information derived from Arabs of Zanzibar, whom I met 
at Naliele in the middle of the country, the region to the east of 
the parts of Londa over which we have travelled, resembles them 
in its conformation. They report swampy steppes, some of winch 
have no trees, where the inhabitants use grass, and stalks of 
native corn, for fuel. A large shallow lake is also pointed out in 
that direction, named Tanganyenka, which requires three days 
for crossing in canoes. It is connected with another named 
Kalagwe (Garague ?), farther north, and may be the Nyanja of 
the Maravim. From this lake is derived, by numerous small 
streams, the river Loapula, the eastern branch of the Zambesi, 
which, coming from the N.E., flows past the town of Cazembe. 

The southern end of tins lake is ten days north-east of the town 
of Cazembe ; and as that is probably more than five days from 
Shinte, we cannot have been nearer to it than 150 miles. Probably 
this lake is the watershed between the Zambesi and the Nile, as 
Lake Dilolo is that between the Leeba and Kasai. But however 

* The above is from my own observation, together with information derived 
from the Portuguese in the interior of Angola ; and I may add that the result 
of many years' observation by Messrs. Gabriel and Brand at Loanda, on the 
west coast, is in accordance therewith. It rains there between the 1st and 
30th of November, but January and December are usually both warm and 
dry. The heavier rains commence about the 1st of February, and last until 
the 15th of May. Then no rain falls between the 20th of May and the 1st 
of November. The rain averages from 12 to 15 inches per annum. In 1852 
it was 12,034 inches; in 1853, 15,473 inches. Although I had no means of 
measuring the amount of rain which fell in Londa, I feel certain that the 
annual quantity exceeds very much that which falls on the coast, because for 
a long time we noticed that every dawn was marked by a deluging shower, 
which began without warning-drops or thunder. I observed that the rain 
ceased suddenly on the 28th of April, and the lesser rains commenced about a 
fortnight before the beginning of November, 



Chap. XXIV. CAUSES OF AKIDITY AND MOISTURE. 477 

this may be, the phenomena of the rainy season show that it is 
not necessary to assume the existence of high snowy mountains, 
until we get reliable information. This, it is to be hoped, will be 
one of the results of the researches of Captain Burton in his 
present journey. 

The original valley formation of the continent, determined the 
northern and southern course of the Zambesi in the centre, and 
also of that ancient river which once flowed from the Linyanti 
basin to the Orange river. It also gave direction to the southern 
and northern flow of the Kasai and the Nile. We find that be- 
tween the latitudes, say 6° and 12° S., from which, in all proba- 
bility, the head waters of these rivers diverge, there is a sort of 
elevated partition in the great longitudinal valley. Presuming 
on the correctness of the native information, which places the 
humid region to which the Nile and Zambesi probably owe their 
origin, within the latitudes indicated, why does so much more 
rain fall there than in the same latitudes north of the equator ? 
Why does Darfur not give rise to great rivers, like Londa and 
the country east of it? The prevailing winds in the ocean 
opposite the territory pointed out are said to be from the N.-E. 
and S.-E. during a great part of the year ; they extend their 
currents on one side at least of the equator, quite beyond the 
middle of the continent, and even until in Angola they meet the 
sea-breeze from the Atlantic. If the reader remembers the 
explanation, given at page 95,* that the comparative want of 

* Since the explanation in page 95 was printed I have been pleased to 
see the same explanation given by the popular astronomer and natural 
philosopher M. Babinet, in reference to the climate of France. It is quoted 
from a letter of a correspondent of the Times in Paris : — 

" In the normal meteorological state of France and Europe, the west 
wind, which is the counter-current of the trade-winds that constantly 
blow from the east under the tropics — the west wind, I say, after having 
touched France and Europe by the western shores, re-descends by Mar- 
seilles and the Mediterranean, Constantinople and the Archipelago, 
Astrakan and the Caspian Sea, in order to merge again into the great 
circuit of the general winds, and be thus carried again into the equatorial 
current. Whenever these masses of air, impregnated with humidity 
during their passage over the ocean, meet with an obstacle, such as a 
chain of mountains, for example, they slide up the acclivity, and, when 
they reach the crest, find themselves relieved from a portion of the column 
of air which pressed upon them. Thus, dilating by reason of their elas- 



478 CAUSES OF ARIDITY AND MOISTURE. Chap. XXIV. 

rain on the Kalahari Desert is caused by the mass of air losing 
its humidity as it passes up, and glides over the subtending 
ridge, and will turn to the map, he may perceive that the 
same cause is in operation in an intense degree by the moun- 
tains of Abyssinia to render the region about Darfur still 
more arid ; and that the flanking ranges mentioned, lie much 
nearer the equator than those which rob the Kalahari of hu- 
midity. The Nile, even while running through a part of that 
region, receives remarkably few branches. Observing also that 
there is no known abrupt lateral mountain-range between 6° 
and 12° S., but that there is an elevated partition there, and 
that the southing and northing of the south-easters and north- 
easters probably cause a confluence of the two great atmospheric 
currents, he will perceive an accumulation of humidity on 
the flanks and crown of the partition, instead of, as elsewhere, 
opposite the Kalahari and Darfur, a deposition of the atmos- 
pheric moisture on the eastern slopes of the subtending ridges. 
This explanation is offered with all deference to those who have 
made meteorology their special study, and as a hint to travellers 
who may have opportunity to examine the subject more fully. 

ticity, they cause a considerable degree of cold, and a precipitation of 
humidity in the form of fogs, clouds, rain, or snow. A similar effect 
occurs whatever be the obstacle they find in their way. Now, this is 
what had gradually taken place before 1856. By some cause or other 
connected with the currents of the atmosphere, the warm current from 
the west had annually ascended northward, so that, instead of passing 
through France, it came from the Baltic and the north of Germany, thus 
momentarily disturbing the ordinary law of the temperatures of Europe. 
But in 1856 a sudden change occurred. The western current again passed, 
as before, through the centre of France. It met with an obstacle in the 
air which had not yet found its usual outlet towards the west and south. 
Hence a stoppage, a rising, a cou sequent dilation and fall of temperature, 
extraordinary rains and inundations. But now that the natural state of 
things is restored, nothing appears to prognosticate the return of similar 
disasters. Were the western current found annually to move further 
north, we might again experience meteorological effects similar to those 
of 1856. Hence the regular seasons may be considered re-established in 
France for several years to come. The important meteorological com- 
munications which the Imperial Observatory is daily establishing with the 
other countries of Europe, and the introduction of apparatus for measuring 
the velocity of the aerial currents and prevailing winds, will soon afford 
prognostics sufficiently certain to enable an enlightened Government to 
provide in time against future evils." 



Chap. XXIV. LAKE DILOLO. 479 

I often observed, while on a portion of the partition, that the 
air by night was generally quite still, but as soon as the sun's 
rays began to shoot across the upper strata of the atmosphere 
in the early morning, a copious discharge came suddenly down 
from the accumulated clouds. It always reminded me of the 
experiment of putting a rod into a saturated solution of a certain 
salt, causing instant crystallization. This, too, was the period 
when I often observed the greatest amount of cold. 

After crossing the Northern Lotembwa, we met a party of the 
people of Kangenke, who had treated us kindly on our way to the 
north, and sent him a robe of striped calico, with an explanation 
of the reason for not returning through his village. We then 
went on to the Lake Dilolo. It is a fine sheet of water, six or 
eight miles long, and one or two broad, and somewhat of a trian- 
gular shape. A branch proceeds from one of the angles, and 
flows into the Southern Lotembwa. Though labouring under fever, 
the sight of the blue waters, and the waves lashing the shore, had 
a most soothing influence on the mind, after so much of lifeless, 
flat, and gloomy forest. The heart yearned for the vivid im- 
pressions, which are always created by the sight of the broad 
expanse of the grand old ocean. That has life in it ; but the flat 
uniformities over which we had roamed, made me feel as if buried 
alive. We found Moene Dilolo (Lord of the Lake) a fat jolly 
fellow, who lamented that when they had no strangers they had 
plenty of beer, and always none when they came. He gave us a 
handsome present of meal and putrid buffalo's flesh. Meat cannot 
be too far gone for them, as it is used only in small quantities as 
a sauce to their tasteless manioc. They were at this time hunting 
antelopes, in order to send the skins as a tribute to Matiamvo. 
Great quantities of fish are caught in the lake ; and numbers of 
young water-fowl are now found in the nests among the reeds. 

Our progress had always been slow, and I found that our rate 
of travelling could only be five hours a-day for five successive days. 
On the sixth, both men and oxen showed symptoms of knocking 
up. We never exceeded two and a half, or three miles an hour in a 
straight line, though all were anxious to get home. The difference 
in the rate of travelling between ourselves and the slave-traders, 
was our having a rather quicker step, a longer day's journey, and 
twenty travelling days a-month instead of their ten. When one of 



480 KATEMA'S HOSPITALITY AND DIGNITY. Chap. XXIV. 

my men became ill, but still could walk, others parted his luggage 
amoug them ; yet we had often to stop one day a-week, besides 
Sundays, simply for the sake of rest. The latitude of Lake Dilolo 
is 11° 32' 1" S., long. 22° 27' E. 

June 14:th. — We reached the collection of straggling villages 
over which Katema rules, and were thankful to see old familiar 
faces again. Shakatwala performed the part of a chief, by bring- 
ing forth abundant supplies of food in his master's name. He 
informed us that Katema too, was out, hunting skins for Matiamvo. 

In different parts of this country, we remarked that when old 
friends were inquired for, the reply was, " Ba hola — they are get- 
ting better ;" or if the people of a village were inquired for, the 
answer was, " They are recovering," as if sickness was quite a com- 
mon thing. Indeed, many with whom we had made acquaintance 
in going north, we now found were in their graves. On the 15th, 
Katema came home from his hunting, having heard of our arrival. 
He desired me to rest myself and eat abundantly, for, being a great 
man, I must feel tired ; and he took good care to give the means 
of doing so. All the people in these parts are extremely kind 
and liberal with their food, and Katema was not behindhand. 
When he visited our encampment, I presented him with a cloak 
of red baize, ornamented with gold tinsel, which cost thirty shillings, 
according to the promise I had made in going to Loanda ; also a 
cotton robe, both large and small beads, an iron spoon, and a tin 
pannikin containing a quarter of a pound of powder. He seemed 
greatly pleased with the liberality shown, and assured me that 
the way was mine, and that no one should molest me in it, if he 
could help it. We were informed by Shakatwala that the chief 
never used any part of a present, before making an offer of it to 
his mother, or the departed spirit to whom he prayed. Katema 
asked if I could not make a dress for him like the one I wore, so 
that he might appear as a white man when any stranger visited 
him. One of the councillors, imagining that he ought to second 
this by begging, Katema checked him by saying, " Whatever 
strangers give, be it little or much, I always receive it with thank- 
fulness, and never trouble them for more." On departing, he 
mounted on the shoulders of his spokesman, as the most dignified 
mode of retiring. The spokesman being a slender man, and the 
chief six feet high, and stout in proportion, there would have been

a breakdown, had he not been accustomed to it. We were very 
much pleased with Katema ; and' next day he presented us with 
a cow, that we might enjoy the abundant supplies of meal he had 
given with good animal food. He then departed for the hunting- 
ground, after assuring me that the town and everything in it were 
mine, and that his factotum, Shakatwala, would remain and attend 
to every want, and also conduct us to the Leeba. 




On attempting to slaughter the cow Katema had given, we 
found the herd as wild as buffaloes ; and one of my men having 
only wounded it, they fled many miles into the forest, and were 
with great difficulty brought back. Even the herdsman was afraid 
to go near them. The majority of them were white, and they 
were all beautiful animals. After hunting it for two days, it was 
despatched at last by another ball. Here we saw a flock of jack- 
daws, a rare sight in Londa, busy with the grubs in the valley, 
which are eaten by the people too.

482 PROJECT FOR A MAKOLOLO VILLAGE. Chap. XXIV. 

Leaving Katema's town on the 19th, and proceeding four miles 
to the eastward, we forded the southern branch of Lake Dilolo. 
We found it a mile and a quarter broad ; and as it flows into the 
Lotembwa, the lake would seem to be a drain of the surrounding 
flats, and to partake of the character of a fountain. The ford was 
waist-deep, and very difficult, from the masses of arum and rushes 
through which we waded. Going to the eastward about three 
miles, we came to the Southern Lotembwa itself, running in a 
valley two miles broad. It is here eighty or ninety yards wide, 
and contains numerous islands covered with dense sylvan vegeta- 
tion. In the rainy season the valley is flooded, and as the waters 
dry up, great multitudes of fish are caught. Tins happens very 
extensively over the country, and fishing-weirs are met with every- 
where. A species of small fish, about the size of the minnow, is 
caught in bagfuls, and dried in the sun. The taste is a pungent 
aromatic bitter, and it was partaken of freely by my people, 
although they had never met with it before. On many of the 
paths which had been flooded, a nasty sort of slime of decayed 
vegetable matter is left behind, and much sickness prevails during 
the drying up of the water. We did not find our friend Mozinkwa 
at Ins pleasant home on the Lokaloeje ; his wife was dead, and he 
had removed elsewhere. He followed us some distance, but our 
reappearance seemed to stir up his sorrows. We found the pontoon 
at the village in which we left it. It had been carefully preserved ; 
but a mouse had eaten a hole in it, and rendered it useless. 

We traversed the extended plain on the north bank of the 
Leeba, and crossed this river a little farther on at Kanyonke's 
village, which is about twenty miles west of the Peri hills, our 
former ford. The first stage beyond the Leeba, was at the rivulet 
Loambo, by the village of Chebende, nephew of Shinte ; and next 
day, we met Chebende himself, returning from the funeral of 
Samoana, his father. He was thin and haggard-looking, compared 
to what he had been before, the probable effect of the orgies in 
which he had been engaged. Pitsane and Mohorisi, having con- 
cocted the project of a Makololo village on the banks of the Leeba, 
as an approach to the white man's market, spoke to Chebende, 
as an influential man, on the subject, but he cautiously avoided 
expressing an opinion. The idea which had sprung up in their 
own minds of an establishment somewhere near the confluence of 



Chap. XXIV. WELCOME FROM SHINTE. 483 

the Leeba and Leeambye, commended itself to my judgment at 
the time, as a geographically suitable point for civilization and 
commerce. The right bank of the Leeba there, is never flooded ; 
and from that point there is communication by means of canoes 
to the country of the Kanyika, and also to Cazembe and beyond, 
with but one or two large waterfalls between. There is no 
obstruction down to the Barotse valley ; and there is probably 
canoe navigation down the Kafue or Bashukulompo river, though 
it is reported to contain many cataracts. It flows through a fertile 
country, well peopled with Bamasasa, who cultivate the native 
produce largely. 

As this was the middle of winter, it may be mentioned that the 
temperature of the water in the morning was 47°, and that of the 
air 50°, which, being loaded with moisture, was very cold to the 
feelings. Yet the sun was very hot by day, and the temperature in 
the coolest shade from 88° to 90° ; in the evenings, from 76° to 78°. 

Before reaching the town of Shinte, we passed through many 
large villages of the Balobale, who have fled from the chief 
Kangenke. The Mambari from Bihe come constantly to him for 
trade ; and as he sells Ins people, great numbers of them escape 
to Shinte and Katema, who refuse to give them up. 

We reached our friend Shinte, and received a hearty welcome 
from this friendly old man, and abundant provisions of the best 
he had. On hearing the report of the journey given by my 
companions, and receiving a piece of cotton cloth about two yards 
square, he said, " These Mambari cheat us by bringing little pieces 
only ; but the next time you pass I shall send men with you, to 
trade for me in Loanda." When I explained the use made of the 
slaves he sold, and that he was just destroying his own tribe by 
selling his people, and enlarging that of the Mambari for the sake 
of these small pieces of cloth, it seemed to him quite a new idea. 
He entered into a long detail of his troubles with Masiko, who 
had prevented him from cultivating that friendship with the 
Makololo which I had inculcated, and had even plundered the 
messengers he had sent with Kolimbota to the Barotse valley. 
Shinte was particularly anxious to explain, that Kolhnbota had 
remained after my departure of his own accord, and that he had 
engaged in the quarrels of the country without being invited ; 
that in attempting to capture one of the children of a Balobale 

2 I 2 



484 PLANTS AND TKEES FEOM ANGOLA. Chap. XXIV. 

man, who had offended the Balonda by taking honey from a hive 
which did not belong to him, Kolimbota had got wounded by a 
shot in the thigh ; but that he had cured the wound, given him a 
wife, and sent a present of cloth to Sekeletu, with a full account 
of the whole affair. From the statement of Shinte, we found that 
Kolimbota had learned, before we left Ins town, that the way we 
intended to take was so dangerous, that it would be better for him 
to leave us to our fate ; and as he had taken one of our canoes 
with him, it seemed evident that he did not expect us to return. 
Shinte, however, sent a recommendation to his sister Nyamoana, 
to furnish as many canoes as we should need for our descent of 
the Leeba and Leeambye. 

As I had been desirous of introducing some of the fruit-trees 
of Angola, both for my own sake and that of the inhabitants, we 
had carried a pot containing a little plantation of orange, cashew 
trees, custard-apple trees (anona), and a fig-tree, with coffee, aragas 
{Araqa pomifera), and papaws ( Carica papaya). Fearing that, if 
we took them further south at present, they might be killed by 
the cold, we planted them out in an enclosure of one of Sliinte's 
principal men, and, at his request, promised to give Shinte a share 
when grown. They know the value of fruits, but at present have 
none except wild ones. A wild fruit we frequently met with in 
Londa is eatable, and when boiled yields a large quantity of 
oil, winch is much used in anointing both head and body. He 
eagerly accepted some of the seeds of the palm-oil tree {Elms 
Gruineensis), when told that this would produce oil in much 
greater quantity than their native tree, winch is not a palm. 
There are very few palm-trees in tins country, but near Bango 
we saw a few of a peculiar palm, the ends of the leaf-stalks of 
which, remain attached to the trunk, giving it a triangular shape. 

It is pleasant to observe that all the tribes in Central Africa 
are fond of agriculture. My men had collected quantities of 
seeds in Angola, and now distributed them amongst their friends. 
Some even carried onions, garlic, and bird's-eye pepper, growing 
in pannikins. The courts of the Balonda, planted with tobacco, 
sugar-cane, and plants used as relishes, led me to the belief, that 
care would be taken of my little nursery. 

The thermometer early in the mornings ranged from 42° to 
52°, at noon 94° to 96°, and in the evening about 70°. It was 



Chap. XXIV. MASIKO AND LIMBOA'S QUARREL. 485 

placed in the shade of my tent, which was pitched under the 
thickest tree we could find. The sensation of cold, after the heat 
of the day, was very keen. The Balonda at this season never 
leave their fires till nine or ten in the morning. As the cold was 
so great here, it was probably frosty at Linyanti ; I therefore 
feared to expose my young trees there. The latitude of Shinte's 
town is 12° 37' 35" S., longitude 22° 47' E. 

We remained with Shinte till the 6th of July, he being unwill- 
ing to allow us to depart before hearing in a formal manner, in 
the presence of his greatest councillor Chebende, a message from 
Limb5a, the brother of Masiko. When Masiko fled from the 
Makololo country, in consequence of a dislike of being in a state 
of subjection to Sebituane, he came into the territory of Shinte, 
who received him kindly, and sent orders to all the villages in his 
vicinity to supply him with food. Limboa fled in a westerly 
direction with a number of people, and also became a chief. His 
country was sometimes called Nyenko, but by the Mambari and 
native Portuguese traders "Mboela" — the place where they 
" turned again," or back. As one of the fruits of polygamy, the 
children of different mothers are always in a state of variance. 
Each son endeavours to gain the ascendancy, by enticing away 
the followers of the others. The mother of Limboa, being of a 
high family, he felt aggrieved, because the situation chosen by 
Masiko was better than his. Masiko lived at a convenient dis- 
tance from the Saloisho hills, where there is abundance of iron- 
ore, with which the inhabitants manufacture hoes, knives, &c. 
They are also skilful in making wooden vessels. Limboa felt 
annoyed because he was obliged to apply for these articles through 
Ins brother, whom he regarded as his inferior, and accordingly 
resolved to come into the same district. As this was looked upon 
as an assertion of superiority, winch Masiko would resist, it was 
virtually a declaration of war. Both Masiko and Shinte pleaded 
my injunction to live in peace and friendship, but Limboa, con- 
fident of success, now sent the message whicli I was about to 
hear — " That he, too, highly approved of the ' word ' I had given, 
but would only for once transgress a little, and live at peace for 
ever afterwards." He now desired the aid of Shinte to subdue 
his brother. Messengers came from Masiko at the same time, 
desiring assistance to repel him. Shinte felt inclined to aid 



486 THE LEEBA. Chap. XXIV. 

Limboa, but, as lie had advised them both to wait till I came, I 
now urged him to let the quarrel alone, and he took my advice. 

We parted on the best possible terms with our friend Shinte, 
and proceeded by our former path to the village of his sister 
Nyamoana, who is now a widow. She received us with much 
apparent feeling, and said, " We had removed from our former 
abode to the place where you found us, and had no idea then that 
it was the spot where my husband was to die." She had come 
to the river Lofuje, as they never remain hi a place where death 
has once visited them. We received the loan of five small canoes 
from her, and also one of those we had left here before, to proceed 
down the Leeba. After viewing the Coanza at Massangano, I 
thought the Leeba at least a third larger, and upwards of two 
hundred yards wide. We saw evidence of its rise during its last 
flood having been upwards of forty feet in perpendicular height ; 
but this is probably more than usual, as the amount of rain was 
above the average. My companions purchased also a number of 
canoes from the Balonda. These are very small, and can carry 
only two persons. They are made quite thin and light, and as 
sharp as racing-skiffs, because they are used in hunting animals 
in the water. The price paid, was a string of beads equal to the 
length of the canoe. We advised them to bring canoes for 
sale to the Makololo, as they would gladly give them cows in 
exchange. 

In descending the Leeba we saw many herds of wild animals, 
especially the tahetsi (Aigoceros equina), one magnificent ante- 
lope, the putokuane (Antilope niger), and two fine lions. The 
Balobale, however, are getting well supplied with guns, and will 
soon thin out the large game. At one of the villages we were 
entreated to attack some buffaloes, which grazed hi the gardens 
every night, and destroyed the manioc. As we had had no 
success in shooting at the game we had seen, and we all longed 
to have a meal of meat, we followed the footprints of a number 
of old bulls. They showed a great amount of cunning, by selecting 
the densest parts of very closely-planted forests, to stand or recline 
in during the day. We came within six yards of them several 
times before we knew that they were so near. We only heard 
them rush away among the crashing branches, catching only a 
glimpse of them. It was somewhat exciting to feel, as we trod

on the dry leaves with stealthy steps, that, for anything we knew, 
we might next moment be charged by one of the most dangerous 
beasts of the forest. We threaded out their doublings for hours, 
drawn on by a keen craving for animal food, as we had been 
entirely without salt for upwards of two months, but never could 
get a shot. 

In passing along the side of water everywhere, except in 
Londa, green frogs spring out at your feet, and light in the 
water, as if taking a " header ;" and on the Leeambye and Chobe 
we have great numbers of small green frogs {liana fasciata, 
Boie), which light on blades of grass with remarkable precision ; 
but on coming along the Leeba, I was struck by the sight of a 
light green toad about an inch long. The leaf might be nearly 
perpendicular, but it stuck to it like a fly. It was of the same 
size as the Brachymerus bi-fasciatus (Smith),* which I saw only 
once in the Bakwain country. Though small, it was hideous, 
being coloured jet-black, with vermilion spots. 

Before reaching the Makondo rivulet, latitude 13° 23' 12" S., 
we came upon the tsetse in such numbers, that many bites were 
inflicted on my poor ox, in spite of a man with a branch warding 
them off. The bite of this insect does not affect the donkey as it 

* The discovery of this last species is thus mentioned by that accomplished 
naturalist, Dr. Smith : " On the banks of the Limpopo river, close to the 
tropic of Capricorn, a massive tree was cut down to obtain wood to repair a 
waggon. The workman, while sawing the trunk longitudinally nearly along 
its centre, remarked, on reaching a certain point, ' It is hollow, and will not 
answer the purpose for which it is wanted.' He persevered, however, and 
when a division into equal halves was effected, it was discovered that the saw 
in its course had crossed a large hole in which were five specimens of the 
species just described, each about an inch in length. Every exertion was 
made to discover a means of communication between the external air and the 
cavity, but without success. Every part of the latter was probed with the 
utmost care, and water was kept in each half for a considerable time, without 
any passing into the wood. The inner surface of the cavity was black, as if 
charred, and so was likewise the adjoining wood for half an inch from the 
cavity. The tree, at the part where the latter existed, was 19 inches in 
diameter, the length of the trunk was 18 feet. The age, which was observed 
at the time, I regret to say does not appear to be noted. When the Batrachia 
above mentioned were discovered, they appeared inanimate, but the influence 
of a warm sun to which they were subjected, soon imparted to them a moderate 
degree of vigour. In a few hours from the time they were liberated, they were 
tolerably active, and able to move from place to place apparently with great 
ease."

does cattle. The next morning, the spots on which my ox had 
been bitten, were marked by patches of hair, about half an inch 
broad, being wetted by exudation. Poor Sinbad had carried me 
all the way from the Leeba to Golungo Alto, and all the way 
back again, without losing any of his peculiarities, or ever be- 
coming reconciled to our perversity, in forcing him away each 
morning from the pleasant pasturage on which he had fed. I 
wished to give the climax to his usefulness, and allay our craving 
for animal food at the same time, but, my men having some com- 
punction, we carried him to end his days in peace at Naliele. 

Having despatched a message to our old friend Manenko, we 
waited a day opposite her village, which was about fifteen miles 
from the river. Her husband was instantly despatched to meet 
us, with liberal presents of food, she being unable to travel in 
consequence of a burn on the foot. Sambanza gave us a detailed 
account of the political affairs of the country, and of Kolimbota's 
evil doings, and next morning performed the ceremony called 
" Kasendi" for cementing our friendship. It is accomplished 
thus : — The hands of the parties are joined (in tins case Pitsane 
and Sambanza were the parties engaged) ; small incisions are 
made on the clasped hands ; on the pits of the stomach of each ; 
and on the right cheeks and foreheads. A small quantity of 
blood is taken off from these points in both parties by means 
of a stalk of grass. The blood from one person is put into one 
pot of beer, and that of the second into another ; each then drinks 
the other's blood, and they are supposed to become perpetual 
friends or relations. During the drinking of the beer, some of the 
party continue beating the ground with short clubs, and utter 
sentences by way of ratifying the treaty. The men belonging to 
each, then finish the beer. The principals in the performance of 
" Kasendi " are henceforth considered blood-relations, and are 
bound to disclose to each other any impending evil. If Sekeletu 
should resolve to attack the Balonda, Pitsane would be under 
obligation to give Sambanza warning to escape, and so on the 
other side. They now presented each other with the most valu- 
able presents they had to bestow. Sambanza walked off with 
Pitsane's suit of green-baize faced with red, which had been made 
in Loanda ; and Pitsane, besides abundant supplies of food, obtained 
two shells similar to that I had received from Shinte. 



Chap. XXIV. SOCIAL CONDITION OF TRIBES. 489 

On one occasion I became blood-relation to a young woman by 
accident. She had a large cartilaginous tumour between the 
bones of the fore-arm, winch, as it gradually enlarged, so dis- 
tended the muscles as to render her unable to work. She applied 
to me to excise it. I requested her to bring her husband, if he 
were willing to have the operation performed, and, while removing 
the tumour, 'one of the small arteries squirted some blood into my 
eye. She remarked, when I was wiping the blood out of it, " You 
were a friend before, now you are a blood-relation ; and when 
you pass tins way, always send me word, that I may cook food for 
you." In creating these friendships, my men had the full inten- 
tion of returning ; each one had his Molehane {friend) in every 
village of the friendly Balonda. Mohorisi even married a wife in 
the town of Katema, and Pitsane took another in the town of 
Shinte. These alliances were looked upon with great favour by 
the Balonda chiefs, as securing the goodwill of the Makololo. 

In order that the social condition of the tribes may be under- 
stood by the reader, I shall mention that, while waiting for Sam- 
banza, a party of Barotse came from Nyenko, the former residence 
of Limboa, who had lately crossed the Leeba on his way towards 
Masiko. The head-man of this party had brought Limboa's son 
to his father, because the Barotse at Nyenko had, since the de- 
parture of Limboa, elected Nananko, another son of Santuru, in 
his stead ; and our visitor, to whom the boy had been intrusted as 
a guardian, thinking him to be in danger, fled with him to his 
father. The Barotse, whom Limboa had left behind at Nyenko, 
on proceeding to elect Nananko, said, " No, it is quite too much 
for Limboa to rule over two places." I would have gone to visit 
Limboa and Masiko too, in order to prevent hostilities, but the 
state of my ox would not allow it. I therefore sent a message to 
Limboa by some of his men, protesting against war with Ins 
brother, and giving him formal notice that the path up the 
Leeba had been given to us by the Balonda, the owners of the 
country, and that no attempt must ever be made to obstruct free 
intercourse. 

On leaving this place we were deserted by one of our party, 
Mboenga, an Ambonda man, who had accompanied us all the 
way to Loanda and back. His father was living with Masiko, 
and it was natural for him to wish to join his own family again. 



490 WATER-TURTLES. Chap. XXIV. 

He went off honestly, with the exception of taking a fine " tari " 
skin given me by Nyamoana, but he left a parcel of gun-flints 
which he had carried for me all the way from Loanda. I re- 
gretted parting with him thus, and sent notice to him that he 
need not have run away, and if he wished to come to Sekeletu 
again, he would be welcome. We subsequently met a large party 
of Barotse fleeing in the same direction, but when I represented 
to them that there was a probability of their being sold as slaves 
in Londa, and none in the country of Sekeletu, they concluded 
to return. The grievance winch the Barotse most feel, is being 
obliged to live with Sekeletu at Linyanti, where there is neither 
fish nor fowl, nor any other kind of food, equal in quantity to 
what they enjoy in their own fat valley. 

A short distance below the confluence of the Leeba and Lee- 
ambye, we met a number of hunters belonging to the tribe called 
Mambowe, who live under Masiko. They had dried flesh of 
hippopotami, buffaloes, and alligators. They stalk the animals 
by using the stratagem of a cap made of the skin of a leche's or 
poku's head, having the horns still attached, and another made 
so as to represent the upper white part of the crane called jabiru 
(Mycteru Senegalensis), with its long neck and beak above. With 
these on, they crawl through the grass ; they can easily put up 
their heads so far as to see their prey without being recognised 
until they are within bowshot. They presented me with three 
fine water-turtles,* one of winch, when cooked, had upwards of 
forty eggs in its body. The shell of the egg is flexible, and it is 
of the same size at both ends, like those of the alligator. The 
flesh, and especially the liver, is excellent. The hunters informed 
us, that when the message inculcating peace among the tribes 
came to Masiko, the common people were so glad at the prospect 
of " binding up the spears," that they ran to the river, and 
bathed and plunged in it for joy. This party had been sent by 
Masiko to the Makololo for aid to repel their enemy, but, afraid 
to go thither, had spent the time in hunting. They have a dread 
of the Makololo, and hence the joy they expressed when peace was 

* It is probably a species allied to the Sternotherus sinuatus of Dr. Smith, 
as it has no disagreeable smell. This variety annually leaves the water with 
so much regularity for the deposit of its eggs, that the natives decide on the 
time of sowing their seed by its appearance. 



Chap. XXIV. CHAKGE OF A BUFFALO. 491 

proclaimed. Tlie Mambowe hunters were much alarmed until my 
name was mentioned. They then joined our party, and on the 
following day discovered a hippopotamus dead, which they had 
previously wounded. This was the first feast of flesh my men had 
enjoyed, for, though the game was wonderfully abundant, I had 
quite got out of the way of shooting, and missed perpetually. Once 
I went with the determination of getting so close that I should not 
miss a zebra. We went along one of the branches that stretch out 
from the river, in a small canoe, and two men, stooping down as 
low as they could, paddled it slowly along to an open space near 
to a herd of zebras and pokus. Peering over the edge of the 
canoe, the open space seemed like a patch of wet ground, such as 
is often seen on the banks of a river, made smooth as the resting- 
place of alligators. When we came within a few yards of it, we 
found by the precipitate plunging of the reptile, that this was a 
large alligator itself. Although I had been most careful to 
approach near enough, I unfortunately only broke the hind leg 
of a zebra. My two men pursued it, but the loss of a hind leg 
does not prevent this animal from a gallop. As I walked slowly 
after the men on an extensive plain covered with a great crop of 
grass, which was laid by its own weight, I observed that a solitary 
buffalo, disturbed by others of my own party, was coming to me 
at a gallop. I glanced around, but the only tree on the plain 
was a hundred yards off, and there was no escape elsewhere. I 
therefore cocked my rifle, with the intention of giving him a 
steady shot in the forehead, when he should come within three or 
four yards of me. The thought flashed across my mind, " What 
if your gun misses fire ?" I placed it to my shoulder as he came 
on at full speed, and that is tremendous, though generally he is 
a lumbering-looking animal in his paces. A small bush, and 
bunch of grass fifteen yards off, made him swerve a little, and 
exposed his shoulder. I just heard the ball crack there, as I fell 
flat on my face. The pain must have made him renounce his 
purpose, for he bounded close past me on to the water, where he 
was found dead. In expressing my thankfulness to God among 
my men, they were much offended with themselves for not being 
present to shield me from this danger. The tree near me was a 
camel-thorn, and reminded me that we had come back to the land 
of thorns again, for the country we had left is one of evergreens. 



492 RECEPTION AT LIBONTA. Chap. XXIV. 

July 27th. — We reached the town of Libonta, and were re- 
ceived with demonstrations of joy snch as I had never witnessed 
before. The women came forth to meet us, making their curious 
dancing gestures, and loud lulliloos. Some carried a mat and 
stick, in imitation of a spear and shield. Others rushed forward 
and kissed the hands and cheeks of the different persons of their 
acquaintance among us, raising such a dust that it was quite a 
relief to get to the men assembled and sitting with proper African 
decorum in the kotla. We were looked upon as men risen from 
the dead, for the most skilful of their diviners had pronounced us 
to have perished long ago. After many expressions of joy at 
meeting, I arose, and, thanking them, explained the causes of our 
long delay, but left the report to be made by their own country- 
men. Formerly I had been the chief speaker, now I would leave 
the task of speaking to them. Pitsane then delivered a speech 
of upwards of an hour in length, giving a highly nattering 
picture of the whole journey, of the kindness of the white men 
in general, and of Mr. Gabriel in particular. He concluded by 
saying that I had done more for them than they expected ; that 
I had not only opened up a path for them to the other white 
men, but conciliated all the chiefs along the route. The oldest 
man present, rose and answered this speech, and, among other 
things, alluded to the disgust I felt at the Makololo for engaging 
in marauding expeditions against Lechulatebe and Sebolamak- 
waia, of which we had heard from the first persons we met, 
and which my companions most energetically denounced as 
"mashue hela," entirely bad. He entreated me not to lose 
heart, but to reprove Sekeletu as my child. Another old man 
followed with the same entreaties. The following day we ob- 
served as our thanksgiving to God for his goodness in bringing 
us all back in safety to our friends. My men decked themselves 
out in their best, and I found that, although their goods were 
finished, they had managed to save suits of European clothing, 
which, being white, with their red caps, gave them rather a 
dashing appearance. They tried to walk like the soldiers they 
had seen in Loanda, and called themselves my " braves " (batla- 
bani). During the service they all sat with their guns over their 
shoulders, and excited the unbounded admiration of the women 
and children. I addressed them all on the goodness of God in 



Chap. XXIV. KINDNESS OF THE PEOPLE. 493 

preserving us from all the dangers of strange tribes and disease. 
We had a similar service in the afternoon. The men gave us 
two fine oxen for slaughter, and the women supplied us abun- 
dantly with milk, meal, and butter. It was all quite gratuitous, 
and I felt ashamed that I could make no return. My men ex- 
plained the total expenditure of our means, and the Libontese 
answered gracefully, " It does not matter ; you have opened a 
path for us, and we shall have sleep." Strangers came flocking 
from a distance, and seldom empty-handed. Their presents I 
distributed amongst my men. 

Our progress down the Barotse valley was just like this. 
Every village gave us an ox, and sometimes two. The people 
were wonderfully kind. I felt, and still feel, most deeply 
grateful, and tried to benefit them in the only way I could, 
by imparting the knowledge of that Saviour, who can comfort 
and supply them in the time of need, and my prayer is, that 
he may send his good Spirit to instruct them and lead them into 
Ins kingdom. Even now, I earnestly long to return, and make 
some recompense to them for their kindness. In passing them 
on our way to the north, their liberality might have been sup- 
posed to be influenced by the hope of repayment on our return, 
for the white man's land is imagined to be the source of every 
ornament they prize most. But though we set out from Loanda 
with a considerable quantity of goods, hoping both to pay our 
way tlnough the stingy Chiboque, and to make presents to 
the kind Balonda, and still more generous Makololo, the many 
delays caused by sickness made us expend all my stock, and all 
the goods my men procured by their own labour at Loanda, and 
we returned to the Makololo as poor as when we set out. Yet 
no distrust was shown, and my poverty did not lessen my in- 
fluence. They saw that I had been exerting myself for their 
benefit alone, and even my men remarked, " Though we return 
as poor as we went, we have not gone in vain." They began 
immediately to collect tusks of hippopotami and other ivory for 
a second journey.

On the 31st of July we parted with our kind Libonta friends. 
We planted some of our palm-tree seeds in different villages of 
this valley. They began to sprout even while we were there, but, 
unfortunately, they were always destroyed by the mice which 
swarm in every hut. 

At Chitlane's village, we collected the young of a colony of 
the linkololo (Anastomus lamalligerus), a black, long-legged bird, 
somewhat larger than a crow, which lives on shellfish (Ampullar id) > 
and breeds in society at certain localities among the reeds. These 
places are well known, as they continue there from year to year, and 
belong to the chiefs, who at particular times of the year gather most 
of the young. The produce of this " harvest," as they call it, which 



Chap. XXV. CHITLANE'S VILLAGE. 495 

was presented to me, was a hundred and seventy-five unfledged 
birds. They had been rather late in collecting them, in conse- 
quence of waiting for the arrival of Mpololo, who acts the part 
of chief, but gave them to me, knowing that tins would be 
pleasing to him, otherwise this colony would have yielded double 
the amount. The old ones appear along the Leeambye in vast 
flocks, and look lean and scraggy. The young are very fat, and 
when roasted are esteemed one of the dainties of the Barotse 
valley. In presents of this kind, as well as of oxen, it is a sort 
of feast of joy, the person to whom they are presented having the 
honour of distributing the materials of the feast. We generally 
slaughtered every ox at the village where it was presented, and 
then our friends and we rejoiced together. 

The village of Chitlane is situated, like all others in the Barotse 
valley, on an eminence, over winch floods do not rise ; but this 
last year, the water approached nearer to an entire submergence 
of the whole valley, than has been known in the memory of man. 
Great numbers of people were now suffering from sickness, winch 
always prevails when the waters are drying up ; and I found much 
demand for the medicines I had brought from Loanda. The great 
variation of the temperature each day, must have a trying effect 
upon the health. At this village there is a real Indian banian- 
tree, which has spread itself over a considerable space by means 
of roots from its branches ; it has been termed in consequence 
" the tree with legs " (more oa maotu). It is curious that trees 
of this family are looked upon with veneration, and all the way 
from the Barotse to Loanda, are thought to be preservatives from 
evil. 

On reaching Naliele on the 1st of August, we found Mpololo 
in great affliction on account of the death of his daughter and 
her child. She had been lately confined ; and her father natu- 
rally remembered her when an ox was slaughtered, or when the 
tribute of other food, which he receives in lieu of Sekeletu, came 
in Iris way, and sent frequent presents to her. This moved the 
envy of one of the Makololo who hated Mpololo, and, wishing to 
vex him, he entered the daughter's hut by night, and strangled 
both her and her child. He then tried to make fire in the hut 
and burn it, so that the murder might not be known ; but the 
squeaking noise of rubbing the sticks awakened a servant, and 



496 MESSAGE FROM MASIKO. Chap. XXV. 

the murderer was detected. Both he and his wife were thrown 
into the river ; the latter having " known of her husband's 
intentions, and not revealing them." She declared she had dis- 
suaded him from the crime, and, had any one interposed a word, 
she might have been spared. 

Mpololo exerted himself in every way to supply us with other 
canoes, and we left Shinte's with him. The Mambowe were 
well received, and departed with friendly messages to their chief 
Masiko. My men were exceedingly delighted with the cordial 
reception we met with everywhere ; but a source of annoyance 
was found where it was not expected. Many of their wives had 
married other men during our two years' absence. Mashauana's 
wife, who had borne him two children, was among the number. 
He wished to appear not to feel it much, saying, " Why, wives 
are as plentiful as grass, and I can get another : she may go ;" 
but he would add, " If I had that fellow, I would open Ins ears 
for him." As most of them had more wives than one, I tried to 
console them by saying that they had still more than I had, and 
that they had enough yet ; but they felt the reflection to be 
galling, that while they were toiling, another had been devouring 
their corn. Some of their wives came with very young infants 
in their arms. This excited no discontent ; and for some, I had 
to speak to the chief, to order the men, who had married the 
only wives some of my companions ever had, to restore them. 

Sunday, August bth. — A large audience listened most attentively 
to my morning address. Surely some will remember the ideas 
conveyed, and pray to our merciful Father, who would never 
have thought of Him but for this visit. The invariably kind and 
respectful treatment I have received from these, and many other 
heathen tribes in tliis central country, together with the attentive 
observations of many years, have led me to the bebef that, if one 
exerts himself for their good, he will never be ill treated. There 
may be opposition to his doctrine, but none to the man himself. 

AVhile still at Naliele, a party which had been sent after me by 
Masiko arrived. He was much disappointed, because I had not 
visited him. They brought an elephant's tusk, two calabashes of 
honey, two baskets of maize, and one of ground-nuts, as a present. 
Masiko wished to say that he had followed the injunction winch 
I had given, as the will of God, and lived in peace until his 



Chap. XXV. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. 497 

brother Limboa came, captured his women as they went to their 
gardens, and then appeared before his stockade. Masiko offered 
to lead Ins men out ; but they objected, saying, " Let us servants 
be killed ; you must not be slain." Those who said this were young 
Barotse, who had been drilled to fighting by Sebituane, and used 
shields of ox-hide. They beat off the party of Limboa, ten being 
wounded, and ten slain in the engagement. Limboa subsequently 
sent three slaves, as a self-imposed fine to Masiko for attacking 
him. I succeeded in getting the Makololo to treat the messengers 
of Masiko well, though, as they regarded them as rebels, it was 
somewhat against the grain at first to speak civilly to them. 

Mpololo, attempting to justify an opposite line of conduct, told 
me how they had fled from Sebituane, even though he had given 
them numbers of cattle after their subjection by his arms, and 
was rather surprised to find that I was disposed to think more 
highly of them for having asserted their independence, even at 
the loss of milk. For this food, all who have been accustomed to 
it from infancy in Africa, have an excessive longing. I pointed 
out how they might be mutually beneficial to each other by the 
exchange of canoes and cattle. 

There are some very old Barotse living here, who were the 
companions of the old chief Santuru. These men, protected by 
their age, were very free in then comments on the " upstart " 
Makololo. One of them, for instance, interrupted my conversation 
one day with some Makololo gentlemen, with the advice " not to 
believe them, for they were only a set of thieves ;" and it was taken 
in quite a good-natured way. It is remarkable that none of the 
ancients here had any tradition of an earthquake having occurred 
in this region. Their quick perception of events recognisable by 
the senses, and retentiveness of memory, render it probable, that 
no perceptible movement of the earth has taken place between 7° 
and 27° S. in the centre of the continent, during the last two cen- 
turies at least. There is no appearance of recent fracture or dis- 
turbance of rocks to be seen in the central country, except the falls 
of Gronye. Nor is there any evidence, or tradition of hurricanes. 

I left Naliele on the 13th of August, and when proceeding 
along the shore at mid-day, a hippopotamus struck the canoe with 
her forehead, lifting one half of it quite out of the water, so as 
nearly to overturn it. The force of the butt she gave, tilted

Mashauana out into the river : tlie rest of us sprang to the shore, 
winch was only about ten yards off. Glancing back, I saw her 
come to the surface a short way off, and look to the canoe, as if 
to see if she had done much mischief. It was a female, whose 
young one had been speared the day before. No damage was 
done, except wetting person and goods. This is so unusual an 
occurrence, when the precaution is taken to coast along the shore, 
that my men exclaimed, " Is the beast mad ?" There were eight 
of us in the canoe at the time, and the shake it received, shows 
the immense power of this animal in the water. 

On reaching Gonye, Mokwala the head-man having presented 
me with a tusk, I gave it to Pitsane, as he was eagerly collecting 
ivory for the Loanda market. The rocks of Gonye are reddish 
grey sandstone, nearly horizontal, and perforated by madrepores, 
the holes showing the course of the insect in different directions. 
The rock itself has been impregnated with iron, and that hardened, 
forms a glaze on the surface — an appearance common to many of 
the rocks of this country. 

August 22nd. — This is the end of winter. The trees which line 
the banks begin to bud and blossom ; and there is some show of 
the influence of the new sap, which will soon end in buds that 
push off the old foliage by assuming a very bright orange colour. 
This orange is so bright that I mistook it for masses of yellow 
blossom. There is every variety of shade in the leaves, yellow, 
purple, copper, liver-colour, and even inky black. 

Having got the loan of other canoes from Mpololo, and three 
oxen as provision for the way, winch made the number we had 
been presented with in the Barotse valley amount to thirteen, we 
proceeded down the river towards Sesheke, and were as much 
struck as formerly with the noble river. The whole scenery is 
lovely, though the atmosphere is murky in consequence of the 
continuance of the smoky tinge of winter. 

This peculiar tinge of the atmosphere was observed every 
winter at Kolobeng, but it was not so observable in Londa as in 
the south, though I had always considered that it was owing to 
the extensive burnings of the grass, in which hundreds of miles of 
pasturage are annually consumed. As the quantity burnt in the 
north is very much greater than in the south, and the smoky 
tinge of winter was not observed, some other explanation than 



Chap. XXV. HORNETS. 499 

these burnings must be sought for. I have sometimes imagined 
that the lowering of the temperature in the winter, rendered the 
vapour in the upper current of air visible, and imparted this hazy- 
appearance. 

The amount of organic life is surprising. At the time the 
river begins to rise, the Ibis religiosa comes down in flocks of 
fifties, with prodigious numbers of other water-fowl. Some of the 
sandbanks appear whitened during the day with flocks of peli- 
cans — I once counted three hundred ; others are brown with 
ducks {Anas histrimica) — I got fourteen of these by one shot 
( Querquedula Hottentota, Smith), and other kinds. Great numbers 
of gulls (Procellaria turtur, Smith), and several others, float over 
the surface. The vast quantity of small birds, which feed on 
insects, show that the river teems also with specimens of minute 
organic life. In walking among bushes on the banks, we are 
occasionally stung by a hornet which makes its nest in form like 
that of our own wasp, and hangs it on the branches of trees. The 
breeding (jro^yn is so strong in this insect, that it pursues any one 
twenty or thirty yards who happens to brush too closely past its 
nest. The sting, which it tries to inflict near the eye, is more 
like a discharge of electricity from a powerful machine, or a 
violent blow, than aught else. It produces momentary insen- 
sibility, and is followed by the most pungent pain. Yet this 
insect is quite timid when away from its nest. It is named Muro- 
tuani by the Bechuanas. 

We have tsetse between Nameta and Sekhosi. An insect of 
prey, about an inch in length, long-legged and gaunt-looking, may 
be observed flying about and lighting upon the bare ground. It 
is a tiger in its way, for it springs upon tsetse and other flies, and, 
sucking out their blood, throws the bodies aside. 

Long before reaching Sesheke, we had been informed that a 
party of Matebele, the people of Mosilekatse, had brought some 
packages of goods for me to the south bank of the river, near 
the Victoria Falls, and though they declared that they had been 
sent by Mr. Moffat, the Makololo had refused to credit the state- 
ment of their sworn enemies. They imagined that the parcels 
were directed to me as a mere trick, whereby to place witch- 
craft-medicine into the hands of the Makololo. When the Mate- 
bele on the south bank called to the Makololo on the north to 

2 K 2 



500 DISCOVERY FORESTALLED. Chap. XXV. 

come over in canoes, and receive the goods sent by Moffat to 
"Nake," the Makololo replied, "Go along with you, we know 
better than that; how could he tell Moffat to send his things 
here, he having gone away to the north?" The Matebele 
answered, " Here are the goods ; we place them now before you, 
and if you leave them to perish, the guilt will be yours." When 
they had departed, the Makololo thought better of it, and, after 
much divination, went over with fear and trembling, and carried 
the packages carefully to an island in the middle of the stream ; 
then, building a hut over them to protect them from the weather, 
they left them; and there I found they had remained from 
September, 1854, till September, 1855, in perfect safety. Here, 
as I had often experienced before, I found the news was very 
old, and had lost much of its interest by keeping, but there 
were some good eatables from Mrs. Moffat. Amongst other 
things, I discovered that my friend, Sir Roderick Murchison, 
while in his study in London, had arrived at the same conclusion 
respecting the form of the African continent as I had lately come 
to, on the spot (see note p. 475) ; and that, from the attentive 
study of the geological map of Mr. Bain and other materials, 
some of which were furnished by the discoveries of Mr. Oswell 
and myself, he had not only clearly enunciated the peculiar 
configuration as an hypothesis in his discourse before the 
Geographical Society in 1852, but had even the assurance to 
send me out a copy for my information ! There was not much 
use in nursing my chagrin at being thus fairly " cut out," by the 
man who had foretold the existence of the Australian gold before 
its discovery, for here it was, in black and white. In his easy- 
chair he had forestalled me by three years, though I had been 
working hard through jungle, marsh, and fever, and, since the 
light dawned on my mind at Dilolo, had been cherishing the 
pleasing delusion that I should be the first to suggest the idea, 
that the interior of Africa was a watery plateau of less elevation 
than flanking hilly ranges. 

Having waited a few days at Sesheke till the horses which we 
had left at Linyanti should arrive, we proceeded to that town, 
and found the waggon and everything we had left in November, 
1853, perfectly safe. A grand meeting of all the people was 
called to receive our report, and the articles which had been sent 



Chap. XXV. TRADING PARTY TO LOANDA. 501 

by the governor and merchants of Loanda. I explained that 
none of these were my property, but that they were sent to show 
the friendly feelings of the white men, and their eagerness to 
enter into commercial relations with the Makololo. I then 
requested my companions to give a true account of what they 
had seen. The wonderful things lost nothing in the telling, the 
climax always being that they had finished the whole world, and 
had turned only when there was no more land. One glib old 
gentleman asked — " Then you reached Ma Robert (Mrs. L.) ? " 
They were obliged to confess that she lived a little beyond the 
world! The presents were received with expressions of great 
satisfaction and delight; and on Sunday, when Sekeletu made 
his appearance at church in Ins uniform, it attracted more atten- 
tion than the sermon ; and the kind expressions they made use 
of respecting myself were so very flattering, that I felt inclined 
to shut my eyes. Their private opinion must have tallied with 
their public report, for I very soon received offers from volun- 
teers to accompany me to the east coast. They said they wished 
to be able to return and relate strange things like my recent 
companions ; and Sekeletu immediately made arrangements with 
the Arab Ben-Habib to conduct a fresh party with a load of 
ivory to Loanda. These, he said, must go with him and learn to 
trade : they were not to have anything to do in the disposal of 
the ivory, but simply look and learn. My companions were to 
remain and rest themselves, and then return to Loanda when the 
others had come home. Sekeletu consulted me as to sending 
presents back to the governor and merchants of Loanda, but, not 
possessing much confidence in this Arab, I advised him to send 
a present by Pitsane, as he knew who ought to receive it. 

Since my arrival in England, information has been received 
from Mr. Gabriel that this party had arrived on the west coast, 
but that the ivory had been disposed of to some Portuguese mer- 
chants in the interior, and the men had been obliged to carry it 
down to Loanda. They had not been introduced to Mr. Gabriel, 
but that gentleman, having learnt that they were in the city, 
went to them, and pronounced the names Pitsane, Mashauana, 
when all started up and crowded round him. When Mr. G. 
obtained an interpreter, he learned that they had been ordered 
by Sekeletu to be sure and go to my brother, as he termed him, 



502 DIFFICULTIES IN TRADING. Chap. XXV. 

Mr. G. behaved in the same liberal manner as he had done to 
my companions, and they departed for their distant home, after 
bidding him a formal and affectionate adieu. 

It was to be expected that they would be imposed upon in 
their first attempt at trading, but I believe that this could not be 
so easily repeated. It is, however, unfortunate that in dealing with 
the natives in the interior, there is no attempt made at the esta- 
blishment of fair prices. The trader shows a quantity of goods, 
the native asks for more, and more is given. The native, being 
ignorant of the value of the goods or of his ivory, tries what 
another demand will bring. After some haggling, an addition is 
made, and that bargain is concluded to the satisfaction of both 
parties. Another trader comes, and perhaps offers more than the 
first; the customary demand for an addition is made, and he 
yields. The natives by this time are beginning to believe that 
the more they ask, the more they will get : they continue to 
urge, the trader bursts into a rage, and the trade is stopped, to 
be renewed next day by a higher offer. The natives naturally 
conclude that they were right the day before, and a most dis- 
agreeable commercial intercourse is established. A great amount 
of time is spent in concluding these bargains. In other parts, it 
is quite common to see the natives going from one trader to 
another, till they have finished the whole village ; and some give 
presents of brandy to tempt their custom. Much of this unpleasant 
state of feeling between natives and Europeans, results from the 
commencements made by those who were ignorant of the language? 
and from the want of education being given at the same time. 

During the time of our absence at Loanda, the Makololo had 
made two forays, and captured large herds of cattle. One, to the 
lake, was in order to punish Lechulatebe for the insolence he 
had manifested after procuring some fire-arms ; and the other to 
Sebola Makwaia, a chief living far to the N.E. This was most 
unjustifiable, and had been condemned by all the influential 
Makololo. Ben-Habib, however, had, in coming from Zanzibar, 
visited Sebola Makwaia, and found that the chief town was go- 
verned by an old woman of that name. She received him kindly, 
and gave him a large quantity of magnificent ivory, sufficient to 
set lnm up as a trader, at a very small cost ; but, his party having 
discharged their guns, Ben-Habib observed that the female chief 



Chap. XXV. DEATH OF INFLUENTIAL MEN. 503 

and her people were extremely alarmed, and would have fled and 
left their cattle in a panic, had he not calmed their fears. Ben- 
Habib informed the uncle of Sekeletu that he could easily guide 
him thither, and he might get a large number of cattle without 
any difficulty. Tins uncle advised Sekeletu to go ; and, as the 
only greatness he knew, was imitation of his father's deeds, he 
went, but was not so successful as was anticipated. Sebola 
Makwaia had fled on hearing of the approach of the Makololo ; 
and, as the country is marshy and intersected in every direction 
by rivers, they could not easily pursue her. They captured 
canoes, and, pursuing up different streams, came to a small lake 
called "Shuia." Having entered the Loangwa, flowing to the 
eastward, they found it advisable to return, as the natives in those 
parts became more warlike the further they went in that direc- 
tion. Before turning, the Arab pointed out an elevated ridge in 
the distance, and said to the Makololo, " When we see that, we 
always know that we are only ten or fifteen days from the sea." 
On seeing him afterwards, he informed me that on the same ridge, 
but much further to the north, the Banyassa lived, and that the 
rivers flowed from it towards the S.W. He also confirmed the 
other Arab's account that the Loapula, which he had crossed at 
the town of Cazembe, flowed in the same direction, and into the 
Leeambye. 

Several of the influential Makololo who had engaged in these 
marauding expeditions, had died before our arrival, and Nokwane 
had succumbed to his strange disease. Kamosantane had perished 
through vomiting blood from over-fatigue in the march, and 
Lerhno was affected by a leprosy peculiar to the Barotse valley. 
In accordance with the advice of my Libonta friends, I did not 
fail to reprove " my child Sekeletu " for his marauding. This 
was not done in an angry manner, for no good is ever achieved 
by fierce denunciations. Motibe, Ins father-in-law, said to me, 
" Scold him much, but don't let others hear you." 

The Makololo expressed great satisfaction with the route we 
had opened up to the west, and soon after our arrival a " picho " 
was called, in order to discuss the question of removal to the 
Barotse valley, so that they might be nearer the market. Some 
of the older men objected to abandoning the line of defence 
afforded by the rivers Chobe and Zambesi, against then southern 



504 CLIMATE — DISEASES. Chap. XXV. 

enemies the Matebele. The Makololo generally have an aversion 
to the Barotse valley, on account of the fevers which are annually 
engendered in it as the waters dry up. They prefer it only as 
a cattle station, for, though the herds are frequently thinned by 
an epidemic disease {peripneumonia), they breed so fast, that the 
losses are soon made good. Wherever else the Makololo go, they 
always leave a portion of their stock in the charge of herdsmen 
in that prolific valley. Some of the younger men objected to 
removal, because the rankness of the grass at the Barotse did not 
allow of their running fast, and because there " it never becomes 
cool." 

Sekeletu at last stood up, and, addressing me, said, "I am 
perfectly satisfied as to the great advantages for trade of the 
path which you have opened, and think that we ought to go to 
the Barotse, in order to make the way from us to Loanda shorter ; 
but with whom am I to live there ? If you were coming with us, I 
would remove to-morrow, but now you are going to the white 
man's country to bring Ma Robert, and when you return, you 
will find me near to the spot on which you wish to dwell." I 
had then no idea that any healthy spot existed in the country, 
and thought only of a convenient central situation, adapted for 
intercourse with the adjacent tribes and with the coast, such as 
that near to the confluence of the Leeba and Leeambye. 

The fever is certainly a drawback to this otherwise important 
missionary field. The great humidity produced by heavy rains 
and inundations, the exuberant vegetation caused by fervid heat 
in rich moist soil, and the prodigious amount of decaying vegetable 
matter, annually exposed after the inundations to the rays of a 
torrid sun, with a flat surface often covered by forest through 
which the winds cannot pass, all combine to render the climate 
far from salubrious for any portion of the human family. But 
the fever, thus caused and rendered virulent, is almost the only 
disease prevalent in it. There is no consumption or scrofula, 
and but little insanity. Smallpox and measles visited the country 
some thirty years ago and cut off many, but they have 
since made no return, although the former has been almost 
constantly in one part or another of the coast. Singularly 
enough, the people used inoculation for this disease; and in 
one village, where they seem to have chosen a malignant case 



Chap. XXV. .FIELD FOR THE PHILANTHROPIST. 505 

from which to inoculate the rest, nearly the whole village was 
cut off. I have seen but one case of hydrocephalus, a few of 
epilepsy, none of cholera or cancer, and many diseases common 
in England, are here quite unknown. It is true that I suffered 
severely from fever, but my experience cannot be taken as a fair 
criterion in the matter. Compelled to sleep on the damp ground 
month after month, exposed to drenching showers, and getting 
the lower extremities wetted two or three times every day, living 
on native food (with the exception of sugarless coffee, during the 
journey to the north and the latter half of the return journey), 
and that food the manioc-roots and meal, which contain so much 
uncombined starch that the eyes become affected (as in the case 
of animals fed for experiment on pure gluten or starch), and 
being exposed during many hours each day in comparative 
inaction to the direct rays of the sun, the thermometer standing 
above 96° in the shade — these constitute a more pitiful hygiene 
than any missionaries who may follow will ever have to endure. 
I do not mention these privations as if I considered them to be 
" sacrifices" for I think that the word ought never to be applied 
to anything we can do for Him, who came down from heaven and 
died for us ; but I suppose it is necessary to notice them, in order 
that no unfavourable opinion may be formed from my experience 
as to what that of others might be, if less exposed to the 
vicissitudes of the weather and change of diet. 

I believe that the interior of this country presents a much 
more inviting field for the philanthropist than does the west coast, 
where missionaries of the Church Missionary, United Presbyterian, 
and other societies, have long laboured with most astonishing 
devotedness and never-flagging zeal. There the fevers are much 
more virulent and more speedily fatal than here ; for from 8° south 
they almost invariably take the intermittent or least fatal type ; 
and their effect being to enlarge the spleen, a complaint winch is 
best treated by change of climate, we have the remedy at hand by 
passing the 20th parallel on our way south. But I am not to be 
understood as intimating that any of the numerous tribes are 
anxious for instruction : they are not the inquiring spirits we read 
of in other countries ; they do not desire the gospel, because they 
know nothing about either it, or its benefits; but there is no 
impediment in the way of instruction. Every head-man would be 



506 PATH TO THE EAST COAST. Chap. XXV. 

proud of a European visitor or resident in his territory, and there 
is perfect security for life and property all over the interior 
country. The great barriers which have kept Africa shut are 
the unhealtliiness of the coast, and the exclusive, illiberal disposi- 
tion of the border tribes. It has not within the historic period 
been cut into, by deep arms of the sea, and only a small fringe 
of its population have come into contact with the rest of 
mankind. Race has much to do in the present circumstances 
of nations ; yet it is probable that the unhealthy coast-climate 
has reacted on the people, and aided both in perpetuating their 
own degradation, and preventing those more inland from having 
intercourse with the rest of the world. It is to be hoped that 
these obstacles will be overcome by the more rapid means of 
locomotion possessed in the present age, if a good highway can 
become available from the coast into the interior. 

Having found it impracticable to open up a carriage-path to 
the west, it became a question as to winch part of the east coast 
we should direct our steps. The Arabs had come from Zanzibar 
through a peaceful country. They assured me that the powerful 
chiefs beyond the Cazembe on the N.E., viz. Moatutu, Moaroro, 
and Mogogo, chiefs of the tribes Batutu, Baroro, and Bagogo, 
would have no objection to my passing through their country. They 
described the population there, as located in small villages like 
the Balonda, and that no difficulty is experienced in travelling 
amongst them. They mentioned also that, at a distance of ten 
days beyond Cazembe, then path winds round the end of Lake 
Tanganyenka. But when they reach tins lake a little to the 
north-west of its southern extremity, they find no difficulty in 
obtaining canoes to carry them over. They sleep on islands, for 
it is said to require three days in crossing, and may thus be forty 
or fifty miles broad. Here they punt the canoes the whole way, 
showmg that it is shallow. There are many small streams in the 
path, and three large rivers. This then appeared to me to be 
the safest ; but my present object being a path admitting of water 
rather than land carriage, this route did not promise so much as 
that by way of the Zambesi or Leeambye. The Makololo knew 
all the country eastwards as far as the Kafue, from having lived 
in former times near the confluence of that river with the Zambesi, 
and they all advised this path in preference to that by the way of 



Chap. XXV. PATH TO THE EAST COAST. 507 

Zanzibar. The only difficulty that they assured me of was that in 
the falls of Victoria. Some recommended my going to Sesheke, 
and crossing over in a N.E. direction to the Kafue, which is only 
six days distant, and descending that river to the Zambesi. Others 
recommended me to go on the south bank of the Zambesi until 
I had passed the falls, then get canoes and proceed further down 
the river. All spoke strongly of the difficulties of travelling on 
the north bank, on account of the excessively broken and rocky 
nature of the country near the river on that side. And when 
Ponuane, who had lately headed a foray there, proposed that I 
should carry canoes along that side, till we reached the spot where 
the Leeambye becomes broad and placid again ; others declared 
that, from the difficulties he himself had experienced in forcing 
the men of his expedition to do this, they believed that mine 
would be sure to desert me, if I attempted to impose such a task 
upon them. Another objection to travelling on either bank of 
the river, was the prevalence of the tsetse, which is so abundant, 
that the inhabitants can keep no domestic animals except goats. 

While pondering over these different paths, I could not help 
regretting my being alone. If I had enjoyed the company of my 
former companion, Mr. Oswell, one of us might have taken the 
Zambesi, and the other gone by way of Zanzibar. The latter 
route was decidedly the easiest, because all the inland tribes were 
friendly, while the tribes in the direction of the Zambesi were 
inimical, and I should now be obliged to lead a party, which the 
Batoka of that country view as hostile invaders, through an 
enemy's land ; but as the prospect of permanent Avater conveyance 
was good, I decided on going down the Zambesi, and keeping on 
the north bank, because, in the map given by Bowdich, Tete, the 
farthest inland station of the Portuguese, is erroneously placed 
on that side. Being near the end of September, the rains were 
expected daily ; the clouds were collecting, and the wind blew 
strongly from the east, but it was excessively hot. All the 
Makololo urged me strongly to remain till the ground should be 
cooled by the rains ; and as it was probable that I should get fever 
if I commenced my journey now, I resolved to wait. The parts 
of the country about 17° and 18° suffer from drought and become 
dusty. It is but the commencement of the humid region to the 
north, and partakes occasionally of the character of both the wet 



508 BEN HABIB'S PKOPOSAL. Chap. XXV. 

and dry regions. Some idea may be formed of the heat in 
October by the fact, that the thermometer (protected) stood, in 
the shade of my waggon, at 100° through the day. It rose to 110° 
if unprotected from the wind, at dark it showed 89°, at 10 o'clock 
80°, and then gradually sunk till sunrise, when it was 70°. That 
is usually the period of greatest cold in each twenty-four hours, in 
this region. The natives during the period of greatest heat keep 
in their huts, which are always pleasantly cool by day, but 
close and suffocating by night. Those who are able to aiford 
it, sit guzzling beer or boyaloa; the perspiration produced by 
copious draughts seems to give enjoyment, the evaporation causing 
a feeling of coolness. The attendants of the chief, on these occa- 
sions, keep up a continuous roar of bantering, raillery, laughing, 
and swearing. The dance is kept up, in the moonlight, till past 
midnight. The women stand clapping their hands continu- 
ously, and the old men sit admiringly, and say, "It is really 
very fine ! " As crowds came to see me, I employed much of my 
time in conversation, that being a good mode of conveying in- 
struction. In the public meetings for worship the people listened 
very attentively, and behaved with more decorum than formerly. 
They really form a very inviting field for a missionary. Surely 
the oft-told tale of the goodness and love of our Heavenly Father, 
in giving up His own Son to death for us sinners, will, by the power 
of His Holy Spirit, beget love in some of these heathen hearts. 

1st October. — Before Ben Habib started for Loanda, he asked 
the daughter of Sebituane in marriage. This is the plan the Arabs 
adopt for gaming influence in a tribe, and they have been known 
to proceed thus cautiously to form connections, and gradually gain 
so much influence, as to draw all the tribe over to their religion. 
I never heard of any persecution, although the Arabs with whom I 
came in contact seemed much attached to their religion. This 
daughter of Sebituane, named Manchunyane, was about twelve 
years of age. As I was the bosom friend of her father, I was sup- 
posed to have a voice in her disposal, and, on being asked, objected 
to her being taken away, we knew not whither, and where we 
might never see her again. As her name implies, she was only a 
little black, and, besides being as fair as any of the Arabs, had 
quite the Arab features ; but I have no doubt that Ben Habib 
will renew his suit more successful lv on some other occasion. In 



Chap. XXV. A MAIDEN'S CHOICE. 509 

these cases of marriage, the consent of the young women is seldom 
asked. A maidservant of Sekeletu, however, pronounced by 
the Makololo to be goodlooking, was at this time sought in mar- 
riage by five young men. Sekeletu, happening to be at my 
waggon when one of these preferred his suit, very coolly ordered 
all five to stand in a row before the young woman, that she might 
make her choice. Two refused to stand, apparently, because they 
could not brook the idea of a repulse, although willing enough to 
take her, if Sekeletu had acceded to their petition without refer- 
ence to her will. Three dandified fellows stood forth, and she 
unhesitatingly decided on taking one who was really the best 
looking. It was amusing to see the mortification exhibited on 
the black faces of the unsuccessful candidates, while the spec- 
tators greeted them with a hearty laugh. 

During the whole of my stay with the Makololo, Sekeletu 
supplied my wants abundantly, appointing some cows to furnish 
me with milk, and, when he went out to hunt, sent home orders 
for slaughtered oxen to be given. That the food was not given in 
a niggardly spirit, may be inferred from the fact, that, when I pro- 
posed to depart on the 20th of October, he protested against my 
going off in such a hot sun. " Only wait," said he, " for the first 
shower, and then I will let you go." This was reasonable, for 
the thermometer, placed upon a deal box in the sun, rose to 138°. 
It stood at 108° in the shade by day, and 96° at sunset. If 
my experiments were correct, the blood of a European is of a 
higher temperature than that of an African. The bulb, held 
under my tongue, stood at 100°, under that of the natives, at 98°. 
There was much sickness in the town, and no wonder, for part of 
the water left by the inundation, still formed a large pond in the 
centre. Even the plains between Linyanti and Sesheke had not 
yet been freed from the waters of the inundation. They had 
risen higher than usual, and for a long time, canoes passed from 
the one place to the other, a distance of upwards of 120 miles, in 
nearly a straight line. We found many patches of stagnant water, 
which, when disturbed by our passing through them, evolved 
strong effluvia of sulphuretted hydrogen. At other times these 
spots exhibit an efflorescence of the nitrate of "soda ; they also con- 
tain abundance of lime, probably from decaying vegetable matter, 
and from these may have emanated the malaria which caused 



510 CONVERSATIONS WITH MAKOLOLO. Chap. XXV. 

the present sickness. I have often remarked this effluvium in 
sickly spots, and cannot help believing but that it has some con- 
nection with fever, though I am quite aware of Dr. Mac Williams's 
unsuccessful efforts to discover sulphuretted hydrogen by the 
most delicate tests, in the Niger expedition. 

I had plenty of employment, for, besides attending to the severer 
cases, I had perpetual calls on my attention. The town contained, 
at least, 7000 inhabitants, and every one thought that he might 
come, and at least look at me. In talking with some of the more 
intelligent in the evenings, the conversation having turned from 
inquiries respecting eclipses of the sun and moon to that other 
world where Jesus reigns, they let me know that my attempts to 
enlighten them had not been without some small effect. " Many 
of the children," said tliey, " talk about the strange things you 
bring to their ears, but the old men show a little opposition by 
saying, ' Do we know what he is talking about ? ' Ntlaria and 
others, complain of treacherous memories, and say, " When we 
hear words about other tilings, we hold them fast ; but when we 
hear you tell much more wonderful things than any we have ever 
heard before, we don't know how it is, they run away from our 
hearts." These are the more intelligent of my Makololo friends. 
On the majority, the teaching produces no appreciable effect ; 
they assent to the truth with the most perplexing indifference, 
addiug, " But we don't know," or, " We do not understand." My 
medical intercourse with them enabled me to ascertain then moral 
status, better than a mere religious teacher could do. They do 
not attempt to hide the evil, as men often do, from then spiritual 
instructors ; but I have found it difficult to come to a conclusion 
on their character. They sometimes perform actions remarkably 
good, and sometimes as strangely the opposite. I have been 
unable to ascertain the motive for the good, or account for the 
callousness of conscience with which they perpetrate the bad. 
After long observation, I came to the conclusion that they are just 
such a strange mixture of good and evil, as men are everywhere 
else. There is not among them an approach to that constant 
stream of benevolence flowing from the rich to the poor which we 
have in England, nor yet the unostentatious attentions which we 
have among our own poor to each other. Yet there are frequent 
instances of genuine kindness and liberality, as well as actions of 



Chap. XXV. THEIR MORAL CHARACTER AND CONDUCT. 511 

an opposite character. The rich show kindness to the poor, in 
expectation of services, and a poor person who has no relatives, 
will seldom be supplied even with water in illness, and, when dead, 
will be dragged out to be devoured by the hyaenas, instead of being 
buried. Relatives alone will condescend to touch a dead body. 
It would be easy to enumerate instances of inhumanity winch I 
have witnessed. An interesting-looking girl came to my waggon 
one day, in a state of nudity, and almost a skeleton. She was a 
captive from another tribe, and had been neglected by the man 
who claimed her. Having supplied her wants, I made inquiry for 
him, and found that he had been unsuccessful in raising a crop of 
corn, and had no food to give her. I volunteered to take her ; 
but he said he would allow me to feed her and make her fat, and 
then take her away. I protested against this heartlessness ; and 
as he said he could " not part with his child," I was precluded 
from attending to her wants. In a day or two she was lost sight 
of. She had gone out a little way from the town, and, being too 
weak to return, had been cruelly left to perish. Another day I 
saw a poor boy going to the water to drink, apparently in a 
starving condition. Tins case I brought before the chief in 
council, and found that Ins emaciation was ascribed to disease and 
want combined. He was not one of the Makololo, but a member 
of a subdued tribe. I showed them that any one professing to 
claim a child, and refusing proper nutriment, would be guilty 
of Ins death. Sekeletu decided that the owner of this boy should 
give up his alleged right, rather than destroy the child. When I 
took him, he was so far gone as to be in the cold stage of starva- 
tion, but was soon brought round by a little milk given three or 
four times a day. On leaving Linyanti, I handed him over to the 
charge of Ins chief Sekeletu, who feeds his servants very well. 
On the other hand, I have seen instances in which both men and 
women have taken up little orphans, and carefully reared them 
as their own children. By a selection of cases of either kind, it 
would not be difficult to make these people appear excessively 
good or uncommonly bad. 

I still possessed some of the coffee which I had brought from 
Angola, and some of the sugar winch I had left in my waggon. 
So long as the sugar lasted, Sekeletu favoured me with Ins com- 
pany at meals ; but the sugar soon came to a close. The 



512 SEKELETU'S COMMISSIONS. Chap. XXV. 

Makololo, as formerly mentioned, were well acquainted with the 
sugar-cane, as it is cultivated by the Barotse, but never knew 
that sugar could be got from it. When I explained the process 
by which it was produced, Sekeletu asked if I could not buy 
him an apparatus for the purpose of making sugar. He said 
that he would plant the cane largely, if he only had the means 
of making the sugar from it. I replied, that I was unable to 
purchase a mill, when he instantly rejoined, " Why not take 
ivory to buy it ? " As I had been living at his expense, I was 
glad of the opportunity to show my gratitude by serving him ; 
and when he and his principal men understood that I was willing 
to execute a commission, Sekeletu gave me an order for a sugar- 
mill, and for all the different varieties of clothing that he had 
ever seen, especially a mohair coat, a good rifle, beads, brass- 
wire, &c. &c, and wound up by saying, " and any other beau- 
tiful thing you may see in your own country." As to the 
quantity of ivory required to execute the commission, I said I 
feared that a large amount would be necessary. Both he and his 
councillors replied, " The ivory is all your own ; if you leave any 
in the country it will be your own fault." He was also anxious 
for horses. The two I had left with him when I went to Loanda, 
were still living, and had been of great use to him in hunting the 
giraffe and eland, and he was now anxious to have a breed. This, 
I thought might be obtained at the Portuguese settlements. All 
were very much delighted with the donkeys we had brought from 
Loanda. As we found that they were not affected by the bite of 
the tsetse, and there was a prospect of the breed being continued, 
it was gratifying to see the experiment of their introduction so far 
successful. The donkeys came as frisky as kids all the way from 
Loanda, until we began to descend the Leeambye. There we 
came upon so many interlacing branches of the river, and were 
obliged to drag them through such masses of tangled aquatic 
plants, that we half drowned them, and were at last obliged to 
leave them somewhat exhausted at Naliele. They excited the 
unbounded admiration of my men by their knowledge of the dif- 
ferent kinds of plants, which, as they remarked, " the animals had 
never before seen in their own country ;" and when the donkeys 
indulged in their music, they startled the inhabitants more than if 
they had been lions. We never rode them, nor yet the horse 



Chap. XXV. AUTHOR'S INFLUENCE WITH NATIVES. 513 

which had been given by the Bishop, for fear of hurting them by 
any work. 

Although the Makololo were so confiding, the reader must not 
imagine that they would be so to every individual who might visit 
them. Much of my influence depended upon the good name given 
me by the Bakwains, and that I secured only through a long 
course of tolerably good conduct. No one ever gains much in- 
fluence in this country without purity and uprightness. The acts 
of a stranger are keenly scrutinized by both young and old, and 
seldom is the judgment pronounced, even by the heathen, unfair 
or uncharitable. I have heard women speaking in admiration of 
a white man, because he was pure, and never was guilty of any 
secret immorality. Had he been, they would have known it, and, 
untutored heathen though they be, would have despised him in 
consequence. Secret vice becomes known throughout the tribe ; 
and while one unacquainted with the language may imagine a 
peccadillo to be hidden, it is as patent to all as it would be in 
London, had he a placard on his back. 

27th October, 1855. The first continuous rain of the season 
commenced during the night, the wind being from the N.E., as it 
always was on like occasions at Kolobeng. The rainy season was 
thus begun, and I made ready to go. The mother of Sekeletu 
prepared a bag of ground-nuts, by frying them in cream with a 
little salt, as a sort of sandwiches for my journey. This is con- 
sidered food fit for a chief. Others ground the maize from my 
own garden into meal, and Sekeletu pointed out Sekwebu and 
Kanyata, as the persons who should head the party intended 
to form my company. Sekwebu had been captured by the 
Matebele when a little boy, and the tribe in which he was a 
captive, had migrated to the country near Tete : he had travelled 
along both banks of the Zambesi several times, and was intimately 
acquainted with the dialects spoken there. I found him to be a 
person of great prudence and sound judgment, and his subsequent 
loss at the Mauritius has been, ever since, a source of sincere 
regret. He at once recommended our keeping well away from 
the river, on account of the tsetse and rocky country, assigning 
also as a reason for it, that the Leeambye beyond the falls turns 
round to the N.N.E. Mamire, who had married the mother of 
Sekeletu, on coming to bid me farewell before starting, said, " You 

2 L 



514 MOTIBE'S EXCUSES. Chap. XXV. 

are now going among people who cannot be trusted, because we 
have used them badly, but you go with a different message from 
any they ever heard before, and Jesus will be with you, and help 
you, though among enemies; and if he carries you safely and brings 
you and Ma Robert back again, I shall say he has bestowed a 
great favour upon me. May we obtain a path whereby we may 
visit and be visited by other tribes, and by white men ! " On telling 
him my fears that he was still inclined to follow the old maraud- 
ing system, which prevented intercourse, and that he, from his 
influential position, was especially guilty in the late forays, he 
acknowledged all rather too freely for my taste, but seemed quite 
aware that the old system was far from right. Mentioning my 
inability to pay the men who were to accompany me, he replied, 
" A man wishes, of course, to appear among his friends after a 
long absence with something of his own to show : the whole of the 
ivory in the country is yours, so you must take as much as you 
can, and Sekeletu will furnish men to carry it." These remarks 
of Mamire are quoted literally, in order to show the state of mind 
of the most influential in the tribe. And as I wish to give the 
reader a fair idea of the other side of the question as well, it may 
be mentioned, that Motibe parried the imputation of the guilt of 
marauding by every possible subterfuge. He would not admit 
that they had done wrong, and laid the guilt of the wars in which 
the Makololo had engaged, on the Boers, the Matebele, and 
every other tribe except his own. When quite a youth, Motibe's 
family had been attacked by a party of Boers : he hid himself in 
an anteater's hole, but was drawn out and thrashed with a whip 
of hippopotamus-hide. When enjoined to live in peace, he would 
reply, "Teach the Boers to lay down their arms first." Yet 
Motibe on other occasions seemed to feel the difference between 
those who are Christians indeed, and those who are so only in 
name. In all our discussions we parted good friends.

On the 3rd of November we bade adieu to our friends at 
Linyanti, accompanied by Sekeletu and about 200 followers. 
We were all fed at his expense, and he took cattle for this 
purpose from every station we came to. The principal men of 
the Makololo ; Lebeole, Ntlarie, Nkwatlele, &c, were also of the 
party. We passed through the patch of the tsetse, which exists 
between Linyanti and Sesheke, by night. The majority of the com- 
pany went on by daylight, in order to prepare our beds. Sekeletu 
and I, with about forty young men, waited outside the tsetse till 
dark. We then went forward, and about ten o'clock it became 
so pitchy dark, that both horses and men were completely blinded. 
The Hghtning spread over the sky, forming eight or ten branches 
at a time, in shape exactly like those of a tree. This, with great 
volumes of sheet-hghtning, enabled us at times to see the whole 
country. The intervals between the flashes were so densely dark, 
as to convey the idea of stone-blindness. The horses trembled, 
cried out, and turned round, as if searching for each other, and 
every new flash revealed the men taking different directions, 
laughing, and stumbling against each other. The thunder was of 

2 L 2 



516 KINDNESS OF MAKOLOLO. Chap. XXVI. 

that tremendously loud kind only to be heard in tropical countries, 
and which, friends from India have assured me, is louder in Africa 
than any they have ever heard elsewhere. Then came a pelting 
rain, which completed our confusion. After the intense heat of 
the day, we soon felt miserably cold, and turned aside to a fire 
we saw in the distance. Tins had been made by some people on 
then march ; for this path is seldom without numbers of strangers 
passing to and from the capital. My clothing having gone on, I 
lay down on the cold ground, expecting to spend a miserable 
night, but Sekeletu kindly covered me with his own blanket and 
lay uncovered himself. I was much affected by this little act of 
genuine kindness. If such men must perish by the advance of 
civilization, as certain races of animals do before others, it is a 
pity. God grant that ere tins time comes, they may receive that 
gospel, which is a solace for the soul in death ! 

While at Sesheke, Sekeletu supplied me with twelve oxen — 
three of which were accustomed to being ridden upon — hoes, and 
beads to purchase a canoe, when we should strike the Leeambye 
beyond the falls. He likewise presented abundance of good fresh 
butter and honey, and did everything in his power to make me 
comfortable for the journey. I was entirely dependent on Ins- 
generosity, for the goods I originally brought from the Cape, were 
all expended by the time I set off from Linyanti to the west 
coast. I there drew 70?. of my salary, paid my men with it, and 
purchased goods for the return journey to Linyanti. These being 
now all expended, the Makololo again fitted me out, and sent me 
on to the east coast. I was thus dependent on their bounty, 
and that of other Africans, for the means of going from Linyanti 
to Loanda, and again from Linyanti to the east coast ; and I feel 
deeply grateful to them. Coin would have been of no benefit, 
for gold and silver are quite unknown. We were here joined by 
Moriantsane, uncle of Sekeletu, and head-man of Sesheke, and, 
entering canoes on the 13th, some sailed down the river to the 
confluence of the Chobe, while others drove the cattle along the 
banks, spending one night at Mparia, the island at the confluence of 
the Chobe, which is composed of trap, having crystals of quartz in 
it, coated with a pellicle of green copper ore. Attempting to 
proceed down the river next day, we were detained some hours by 
a strong east wind, raising waves so large as to threaten to swamp 



Chap. XXVI. SEKOTE'S ISLAND. 517 

the canoes. The river is here very large and deep, and contains 
two considerable islands, which from either bank seem to be joined 
to the opposite shore. While waiting for the wind to moderate, 
my friends related the traditions of these islands, and, as usual, 
praised the wisdom of Sebituane in balking the Batoka, who for- 
merly enticed wandering tribes to them, and starved them, by 
compelling the chiefs to remain by his side till all Ins cattle and 
people were ferried over. The Barotse believe that at certain 
parts of the river a tremendous monster lies hid, and that it will 
catch a canoe and hold it fast and motionless, in spite of the 
utmost exertions of the paddlers. While near Nameta, they even 
objected to pass a spot supposed to be haunted, and proceeded along 
a branch instead of the main stream. They believe that some of 
them possess a knowledge of the proper prayer to lay the monster. 
It is strange to find fables similar to those of the more northern 
nations even in the heart of Africa. Can they be the vestiges of 
traditions of animals which no longer exist ? The fossil bones 
which lie in the calcareous tufa of this region will yet, we hope, 
reveal the ancient fauna. 

Having descended about ten miles, we came to the island 
of Nampene, at the beginning of the rapids, where we were 
obliged to leave the canoes and proceed along the banks on 
foot. The next evening we slept opposite the island of Chondo, 
and, then crossing the Lekone or Lekwine, early the following 
morning were at the island of Sekote, called Kalai. This Sekote 
was the last of the Batoka chiefs whom Sebituane rooted out. 
The island is surrounded by a rocky shore and deep channels, 
through which the river rushes with great force. Sekote, feeling 
secure in Ins island home, ventured to ferry over the Matebele 
enemies of Sebituane. When they had retired, Sebituane made 
one of those rapid marches which he always adopted in every 
enterprise. He came down the Leeambye from Naliele, sailing 
by day along the banks, and during the night in the middle of the 
stream, to avoid the hippopotami. When he reached Kalai, 
Sekote took advantage of the larger canoes they employ in the 
rapids, and fled during the night to the opposite bank. Most of 
his people were slain or taken captive, and the island has ever 
since been under the Makololo. It is large enough to contain a 
considerable town. On the northern side I found the kotla of the 



518 VICTORIA FALLS. Chap. XXVI. 

elder Sekote, garnished with numbers of human skulls mounted 
on poles : a large heap of the crania of hippopotami, the tusks 
untouched except by time, stood on one side. At a short distance, 
under some trees, we saw the grave of Sekote, ornamented with 
seventy large elephants' tusks, planted round it with the points 
turned inwards, and there were thirty more placed over the resting- 
places of his relatives. These were all decaying from the effects 
of the sun and weather ; but a few, which had enjoyed the shade, 
were in a pretty good condition. I felt inclined to take a speci- 
men of the tusks of the hippopotami, as they were the largest I 
had ever seen ; but feared that the people would look upon me as 
a " resurrectionist " if I did, and regard any unfavourable event 
which might afterwards occur, as a punishment for the sacrilege. 
The Batoka believe that Sekote had a pot of medicine buried here, 
which, when opened, would cause an epidemic in the country. 
These tyrants acted much on the fears of their people. 

As tins was the point from which we intended to strike off to 
the north-east, I resolved on the following day to visit the falls of 
Victoria, called by the natives Mosioatunya, or more anciently 
Shongwe. Of these we had often heard since we came into the 
country: indeed one of the questions asked by Sebituane was, 
" Have you smoke that sounds in your country ? " They did 
not go near enough to examine them, but, viewing them with 
awe at a distance, said, in reference to the vapour and noise, 
" Mosi oa tunya" (smoke does sound there). It was pre- 
viously called Shongwe, the meaning of which I could not 
ascertain. The word for a " pot " resembles this, and it may mean 
a seething caldron ; but I am not certain of it. Being persuaded 
that Mr. Oswell and myself were the very first Europeans who 
ever visited the Zambesi in the centre of the country, and that 
this is the connecting link between the known and unknown 
portions of that river, I decided to use the same liberty as the 
Makololo did, and gave the only English name I have affixed to 
any part of the country. No better proof of previous ignorance 
of this river could be desired, than that an untravelled gentleman, 
who had spent a great part of his life in the study of the geo- 
graphy of Africa, and knew everything written on the subject 
from the time of Ptolemy downwards, actually asserted in the 
* Athenaeum/ while I was coming up the Ked Sea, that this 



Chap. XXVI. VICTOKIA FALLS. 519 

magnificent river, the Leeambye, had "no connection with the 
Zambesi, but flowed under the Kalahari Desert, and became lost ;" 
and " that, as all the old maps asserted, the Zambesi took its rise 
in the very lulls to which we have now come." This modest as- 
sertion smacks exactly as if a native of Timbuctu should declare, 
that the " Thames " and the " Pool " were different rivers, he 
having seen neither the one nor the other. Leeambye and Zam- 
besi mean the very same thing, viz. the Rivee. 

Sekeletu intended to accompany me, but, one canoe only having 
come instead of the two he had ordered, he resigned it to me. 
After twenty minutes' sail from Kalai, we came in sight, for the 
first time, of the columns of vapour, appropriately called " smoke," 
rising at a distance of five or six miles, exactly as when large tracts 
of grass are burned in Africa. Five columns now arose, and 
bending in the direction of the wind, they seemed placed against 
a low ridge covered with trees ; the tops of the columns at this 
distance appeared to mingle with the clouds. They were white 
below, and higher up became dark, so as to simulate smoke very 
closely. The whole scene was extremely beautiful ; the banks 
and islands dotted over the river are adorned with sylvan vegeta- 
tion of great variety of colour and form. At the period of our 
visit several trees were spangled over with blossoms. Trees have 
each their own physiognomy. There, towering over all, stands 
the great burly baobab, each of whose enormous arms would form 
the trunk of a large tree, beside groups of graceful palms, which, 
with their feathery-shaped leaves depicted on the sky, lend their 
beauty to the scene. As a hieroglyphic they always mean " far 
from home," for one can never get over their foreign air in a pic- 
ture or landscape. The silvery mohonono, winch in the tropics is 
in form like the cedar of Lebanon, stands in pleasing contrast with 
the dark colour of the motsouri, whose cypress-form is dotted over 
at present with its pleasant scarlet fruit. Some trees resemble the 
great spreading oak, others assume the character of our own elms 
and chestnuts ; but no one can imagine the beauty of the view 
from anything witnessed in England. It had never been seen 
before by European eyes ; but scenes so lovely must have been 
gazed upon by angels in their flight. The only want felt, is 
that of mountains in the background. The falls are bounded on 
three sides by ridges 300 or 400 feet hi height, which are covered 



520 VICTORIA FALLS. Chap. XXVI. 

with forest, with the red soil appearing among the trees. When 
about half a mile from the falls, I left the canoe by which we had 
come down thus far, and embarked in a lighter one, with men well 
acquainted with the rapids, who, by passing down the centre of 
the stream in the eddies and still places caused by many jutting 
rocks, brought me to an island situated in the middle of the river, 
and on the edge of the lip over which the water rolls. In coming 
hither, there was danger of being swept down by the streams 
winch rushed along on each side of the island ; but the river was 
now low, and we sailed where it is totally impossible to go when 
the water is high. But though we had reached the island, and 
were within a few yards of the spot, a view from which would solve 
the whole problem, I believe that no one could perceive where 
the vast body of water went ; it seemed to lose itself in the 
earth, the opposite lip of the fissure into which it disappeared, 
being only 80 feet distant. At least I did not comprehend it until, 
creeping with awe to the verge, I peered down into a large rent 
winch had been made from bank to bank of the broad Zambesi, 
and saw that a stream of a thousand yards broad, leaped down a 
hundred feet, and then became suddenly compressed into a space of 
fifteen or twenty yards. The entire falls are simply a crack made 
in a hard basaltic rock from the right to the left bank of the Zam- 
besi, and then prolonged from the left bank away through thirty or 
forty miles of hills. If one imagines the Thames filled with low 
tree-covered hills immediately beyond the tunnel, extending as far 
as Gravesend ; the bed of black basaltic rock instead of London 
mud ; and a fissure made therein from one end of the tunnel to the 
other, down through the keystones of the arch, and prolonged 
from the left end of the tunnel through thirty miles of hills ; the 
pathway being 100 feet down from the bed of the river instead of 
what it is, with the lips of the fissure from 80 to 100 feet apart ; 
then fancy the Thames leaping bodily into the gulf; and forced 
there to change its direction, and flow from the right to the left 
bank ; and then rush boiling and roaring through the hills, — he may 
have some idea of what takes place at this, the most wonderful 
sight I had witnessed in Africa. In looking down into the fissure on 
the right of the island, one sees nothing but a dense white cloud, 
which, at the time we visited the spot, had two bright rainbows on 
it. (The sun was on the meridian, and the declination about equal 



Chap. XXVI. GIGANTIC FISSURE. 521 

to the latitude of the place.) From this cloud rushed up a great 
jet of vapour exactly like steam, and it mounted 200 or 300 
feet high ; there condensing, it changed its hue to that of dark 
smoke, and came back in a constant shower, which soon wetted us 
to the skin. Tins shower falls chiefly on the opposite side of the 
fissure, and a few yards back from the lip, there stands a straight 
hedge of evergreen trees, whose leaves are always wet. From 
their roots a number of little rills run back into the gulf ; but 
as they flow down the steep wall there, the column of vapour, 
in its ascent, licks them up clean oif the rock, and away they 
mount again. They are constantly running down, but never 
reach the bottom. 

On the left of the island we see the water at the bottom, a white 
rolling mass moving away to the prolongation of the fissure, which 
branches off near the left bank of the river. A piece of the rock 
has fallen oif a sj)ot on the left of the island, and juts out from the 
water below, and from it, I judged the distance which the water 
falls to be about 100 feet. The walls of this gigantic crack are 
perpendicular, and composed of one homogeneous mass of rock. 
The edge of that side over winch the water falls, is worn off two or 
three feet, and pieces have fallen away, so as to give it somewhat 
of a serrated appearance. That over which the .water does not 
fall, is quite straight, except at the left corner, where a rent 
appears, and a piece seems inclined to fall off. Upon the whole, 
it is nearly in the state in which it was left at the period of its 
formation. The rock is dark brown in colour, except about ten 
feet from the bottom, which is discoloured by the annual rise of 
the water to that or a greater height. On the left side of the 
island we have a good view of the mass of water which causes one 
of the columns of vapour to ascend, as it leaps quite clear of the 
rock, and forms a thick unbroken fleece all the way to the bottom. 
Its whiteness gave the idea of snow, a sight I had not seen for 
many a day. As it broke into (if I may use the term) pieces of 
water, all rushing on in the same direction, each gave off several 
rays of foam, exactly as bits of steel, when burnt in oxygen gas, 
give off rays of sparks. The snow-white sheet seemed like myriads 
of small comets rushing on in one direction, each of which left 
behind its nucleus rays of foam. I never saw the appearance 
referred to, noticed elsewhere. It seemed to be the effect of the 



522 THE LEEAMBYE. Chap. XXVI. 

mass of water leaping at once clear of the rock, and but slowly 
breaking up into spray. 

I have mentioned that we saw five columns of vapour ascending 
from this strange abyss. They are evidently formed by the com- 
pression suffered by the force of the water's own fall, into an 
unyielding wedge-shaped space. Of the &ve columns, two on the 
right, and one on the left of the island were the largest, and the 
streams which formed them seemed each to exceed in size the falls 
of the Clyde at Stonebyres, when that river is in flood. Tins was the 
period of low water in the Leeambye, but, as far as I could guess, 
there was a flow of five or six hundred yards of water, which, at the 
edge of the fall, seemed at least three feet deep. I write in the 
hope that others more capable of judging distances than myself 
will visit this scene, and I state simply the impressions made on 
my mind at the time. I thought, and do still think, the river 
above the falls to be one thousand yards broad ; but I am a poor 
judge of distances on water, for I showed a naval friend what I 
supposed to be four hundred yards in the bay of Loanda, and, to 
my surprise, he pronounced it to be nine hundred. I tried to 
measure the Leeambye with a strong thread, the only line I had 
in my possession, but when the men had gone two or three 
hundred yards, they got into conversation, and did not hear us 
shouting that the line had become entangled. By still going on 
they broke it, and, being carried away down the stream, it was 
lost on a snag. In vain I tried to bring to my recollection the 
way I had been taught to measure a river, by taking an angle 
with the sextant. That I once knew it, and that it was easy, 
were all the lost ideas I could recall, and they only increased my 
vexation. However, I measured the river farther down by another 
plan, and then I discovered that the Portuguese had measured it 
at Tete, and found it a little over one thousand yards. At the 
falls it is as broad as at Tete, if not more so. Whoever may come 
after me will not, I trust, find reason to say I have indulged hi 
exaggeration. With respect to the drawing, it must be borne in 
mind, that it was composed from a rude sketch as viewed from 
the island, winch exhibited the columns of vapour only, and a 
ground plan. The artist has given a good idea of the scene, but, 
by way of explanation, he has shown more of the depth of the 
fissure than is visible, except by going close to the edge. The 



Chap. XXVI. WEAR OF THE ROCKS. 523 

left-hand column, and that farthest off, are the smallest, and all 
ought to have been a little more tapering at the tops. 

The fissure is said by the Makololo to be very much deeper 
farther to the eastward; there is one part at which the walls 
are so sloping, that people accustomed to it, can go down by 
descending in a sitting position. The Makololo on one occasion, 
pursuing some fugitive Batoka, saw them, unable to stop the im- 
petus of their flight at the edge, literally dashed to pieces at the 
bottom. They beheld the stream like a " white cord " at the 
bottom, and so far down (probably 300 feet) that they became 
giddy, and were fain to go away, holding on to the ground. 

Now, though the edge of the rock over which the river falls, does 
not show wearing more than three feet, and there is no appearance 
of the opposite wall being worn out at the bottom in the parts 
exposed to view, yet it is probable that, where it has flowed 
beyond the falls, the sides of the fissure may have given way, 
and the parts out of sight may be broader than the " white cord " 
on the surface. There may even be some ramifications of the 
fissure, which take a portion of the stream quite beneath the 
rocks ; but this I did not learn. 

If we take the want of much wear on the lip of hard basaltic 
rock as of any value, the period when this rock was riven, is 
not geologically very remote. I regretted the want of proper 
means of measuring and marking its width at the falls, in order 
that, at some future time, the question whether it is progressive 
or not, might be tested. It seemed as if a palm-tree could be 
laid across it from the island. And if it is progressive, as it would 
mark a great natural drainage being effected, it might furnish a 
hope that Africa will one day become a healthy continent. It is 
at any rate very much changed in respect to its lakes, within a 
comparatively recent period. 

At three spots near these falls, one of them the island in the 
middle on winch we were, three Batoka chiefs offered up prayers 
and sacrifices to the Barimo. They chose their places of prayer 
within the sound of the roar of the cataract, and in sight of the 
bright bows in the cloud. They must have looked upon the 
scene with awe. Fear may have induced the selection. The 
river itself is, to them, mysterious. The words of the canoe-song 
are — 



524 ISLAND GARDEN. Chap. XXVI. 

" The Leeambye ! Nobody knows, 
Whence it comes and whither it goes." 

The play of colours of the double iris on the cloud, seen by them 
elsewhere only as the rainbow, may have led them to the idea 
that this was the abode of Deity. Some of the Makololo who 
went with me near to Gonye, looked upon the same sign with 
awe. When seen in the heavens it is named " motse oa barimo " 
— the pestle of the gods. Here they could aj:>proach the emblem, 
and see it stand steadily above the blustering uproar below — a type 
of Him who sits supreme — alone unchangeable, though ruling over 
all changing things. But not aware of His true character, they 
had no admiration of the beautiful and good in their bosoms. 
They did not imitate His benevolence, for they were a bloody 
imperious crew, and Sebituane performed a noble service, in the 
expulsion from then fastnesses of these cruel " Lords of the Isles." 

Having feasted my eyes long on the beautiful sight, I returned 
to my friends at Kalai, and, saying to Sekeletu that he had nothing 
else worth showing in his country, his curiosity was excited to 
visit it the next day. I returned with the intention of taking a 
lunar observation from the island itself, but the clouds were 
unfavourable, consequently all my determinations of position refer 
to Kalai. (Lat. 17° 51' 54" S., long. 25° 41' E.) Sekeletu 
acknowledged to feeling a little nervous at the probability of 
being sucked into the gulf before reaching the island. His 
companions amused themselves by throwing stones down, and 
wondered to see them diminishing in size, and even disappearing, 
before they reached the water at the bottom. 

I had another object in view in my return to the island. I 
observed that it was covered with trees, the seeds of which had 
probably come down with the stream from the distant north, and 
several of which I had seen nowhere else, and every now and then 
the wind wafted a little of the condensed vapour over it, and kept 
the soil in a state of moisture, winch caused a sward of grass, 
growing as green as on an English, lawn. I selected a spot — not 
too near the chasm, for there the constant deposition of the 
moisture nourished numbers of polypi of a mushroom shape and 
fleshy consistence — but somewhat back, and made a little garden. 
I there planted about a hundred peach and apricot stones, and a 
quantity of coffee-seeds. I had attempted fruit-trees before, but, 



Chap. XXVI. DIVINEES, NATIVE AND EUROPEAN. 525 

when left in charge of my Makololo friends, they were always 
allowed to wither, after having vegetated, by being forgotten. I 
bargained for a hedge with one of the Makololo, and if he is 
faithful, I have great hopes of Mosioatunya's abilities as a nur- 
seryman. My only source of fear is the hippopotami, whose foot- 
prints I saw on the island. When the garden was prepared, I cut 
my initials on a tree, and the date 1855. This was the only in- 
stance in which I indulged in this piece of vanity. The garden 
stands in front, and were there no hippopotami, I have no doubt 
but this will be the parent of all the gardens, which may yet be 
in this new country. We then went up to Kalai again. 

On passing up we had a view of the hut on the island, where 
my goods had lain so long in safety. It was under a group of 
palm-trees, and Sekeletu informed me that, so fully persuaded 
were most of the Makololo of the presence of dangerous charms 
in the packages, that, had I not returned to tell them the con- 
trary, they never would have been touched. Some of the diviners 
had been so positive in their decisions on the pomt, that the men 
who lifted a bag thought they felt a live kid in it. The diviners 
always quote their predictions when thay happen to tally with 
the event. They declared that the whole party which went to 
Loanda had perished ; and as I always quoted the instances in 
which they failed, many of them refused to throw the " bola " (in- 
struments of divination) when I was near. This was a noted instance 
of failure. It would have afforded me equal if not greater pleasure 
to have exposed the failure, if such it had been, of the European 
diviner whose paper lay a whole year on tins island, but I was 
obliged to confess that he had been successful with his " bola," 
and could only comfort myself with the idea that, though Sir 
Roderick Murchison's discourse had lain so long within sight and 
sound of the magnificent falls, I had been " cut out " by no one 
in their discovery. 

I saw the falls at low water, and the columns of vapour, when 
five or six miles distant. When the river is full, or in flood, the 
columns, it is said, can be seen ten miles off, and the sound is 
quite distinct somewhat beyond Kalai, or about an equal distance. 
No one can then go to the island in the middle. The next 
visitor must bear these points in mind in comparing his descrip- 
tion with mine. 



526 « LIFTING," NOT "STEALING." Chap. XXVI. 

We here got information of a foray, which had been made by a 
Makololo man in the direction we were going. This instance of 
marauding was so much in accordance with the system which has 
been pursued in this country, that I did not wonder at it. But 
the man had used Sekeletu's name as having sent him, and, the 
proof being convincing, he would undoubtedly be fined. As that 
would be the first instance of a fine being levied for marauding, 
I looked upon it as the beginning of a better state of things. 
In tribes which have been accustomed to cattle-stealing, the act is 
not considered immoral, in the way that theft is. Before I knew 
the language well, I said to a chief, " You stole the cattle of so 
and so." " No, I did not steal them," was the reply, " I only 
lifted them." The word " gapa " is identical with the Highland 
term for the same deed. 

Another point came to our notice here. Some Mambari had 
come down thus far, and induced the Batoka to sell a very large 
tusk which belonged to Sekeletu, for a few bits of cloth. They 
had gone among the Batoka who need hoes, and, having purchased 
some of these from the people near Sesheke, induced the others 
living farther east, to sell both ivory and children. They would 
not part with children for clothing or beads, but agriculture with 
wooden hoes is so laborious, that the sight of the hoes prevailed. 
The Makololo proposed to knock the Mambari on the head as 
the remedy, the next time they came ; but on my proposing that 
they should send hoes themselves, and thereby secure the ivory 
in a quiet way, all approved highly of the idea, and Pitsane and 
Mohorisi expatiated on the value of the ivory, their own willing- 
ness to go and sell it at Loanda, and the disgust with which the 
Mambari whom we met in Angola, had looked upon their attempt 
to reach the proper market. If nothing untoward happens, I 
think there is a fair prospect of the trade in slaves being abolished 
in a natural way in this quarter ; Pitsane and Mohorisi having 
again expressed their willingness to go away back to Loanda if 
Sekeletu would give them orders. Tins was the more remarkable, 
as both have plenty of food and leisure at home. 

20th November. — Sekeletu and his large party having conveyed 
me thus far, and furnished me with a company of 114 men to 
carry the tusks to the coast, we bade adieu to the Makololo, and 
proceeded northwards to the Lekone. The country around is 



Chap. XXYI. ANCIENT LAKES. 527 

very beautiful, and was once well peopled with Batoka, who 
possessed enormous herds of cattle. When Sebituane came in 
former times, with his small but warlike party of Makololo, to this 
spot, a general rising took place of the Batoka through the whole 
country, in order to " eat him up ;" but his usual success fol- 
lowed him, and, dispersing them, the Makololo obtained so many 
cattle, that they could not take any note of the herds of sheep 
and goats. The tsetse has been brought by buffaloes into some 
districts where formerly cattle abounded. This obliged us to 
travel the first few stages by night. We could not well detect 
the nature of the country in the dim moonlight ; the path, however, 
seemed to lead along the high bank of what may have been the 
ancient bed of the Zambesi, before the fissure was made. The 
Lekone now winds in it, in an opposite direction to that in winch 
the ancient river must have flowed. 

Both the Lekone and Unguesi flow back towards the centre 
of the country, and in an opposite direction to that of the 
main stream. It was plain, then, that we were ascending, the 
further we went eastward. The level of the lower portion of the 
Lekone is about 200 feet above that of the Zambesi at the 
falls, and considerably more than the altitude of Linyanti ; con- 
sequently, when the river flowed along this ancient bed, instead 
of through the rent, the whole country between tins, and the 
ridge beyond Libebe westwards; Lake Ngami and the Zouga 
southwards ; and eastwards beyond Nchokotsa, was one large 
fresh-water lake. There is abundant evidence of the exist- 
ence and extent of this vast lake in the longitudes indicated, 
and stretching from 17° to 21° S. latitude. The whole of this 
space is paved with a bed of tufa, more or less soft, according as 
it is covered with soil, or left exposed to atmospheric influences. 
Wherever ant-eaters make deep holes hi this ancient bottom, 
fresh-water shells are thrown out, identical with those now 
existing, in the Lake Ngami and the Zambesi. The Barotse 
valley was another lake of a similar nature, and one existed be- 
yond Masiko, and a fourth near the Orange Kiver. The whole 
of these lakes were let out by means of cracks or fissures made 
in the subtending sides, by the upheaval of the country. The 
fissure made at the Victoria Falls let out the water of this great 
valley, and left a small patch in what was probably its deepest 



528 TRADITIONS. Chap. XXVI. 

portion, and is now called Lake Ngami. The Falls of Gonye 
furnished an outlet to the lake of the Barotse valley, and so of 
the other great lakes of remote times. The Congo also finds its 
way to the sea through a narrow fissure, and so does the Orange 
River in the west ; while other rents made in the eastern ridge, 
as the Victoria Falls and those to the east of Tanganyenka, allowed 
the central waters to drain eastward. All the African lakes 
liitherto discovered are shallow, in consequence of being the mere 
residua of very much larger ancient bodies of water. There can 
be no doubt that this continent was, in former times, very much 
more copiously supplied with water than at present, but a natural 
process of drainage has been going on for ages. Deep fissures 
are made, probably by the elevation of the land, proofs of which 
are seen in modern shells embedded in marly tufa, all round 
the coast-line. Whether this process of desiccation is as rapid 
throughout the continent, as in a letter to the late Dean Buck- 
land, in 1843, I showed to have been the case in the Bechuana 
country, it is not for me to say ; but though there is a slight 
tradition of the waters having burst through the low hills south 
of the Barotse, there is none of a sudden upheaval accom- 
panied by an earthquake. The formation of the crack of Mo- 
sioatunya is perhaps too ancient for that; yet, although in- 
formation of any remarkable event is often transmitted in the 
native names, and they even retain a tradition Avhich looks 
like the story of Solomon and the harlots, there is not a name 
like Tom Earthquake, or Sam Shake-the-ground, in the whole 
country. They have a tradition which may refer to the build- 
ing of the Tower of Babel, but it ends in the bold builders 
getting their crowns cracked by the fall of the scaffolding ; and 
that they came out of a cave called " Loey " (Noe ?), in company 
with the beasts, and all point to it in one direction, viz. the 
N.N.E. Loey, too, is an exception in the language, as they use 
masculine instead of neuter pronouns to it. 

If we take a glance back at the great valley, the form the 
rivers have taken imparts the idea of a lake slowly drained out, 
for they have cut out for themselves beds exactly like what we 
may see, in the soft mud of a shallow pool of rain-water, when 
that is let off by a furrow. This idea would probably not strike 
a person on coming first into the country, but more extensive 



Chap. XXVI. DRAINAGE OF THE GREAT VALLEY. 529 

acquaintance with the river-system, certainly would convey the im- 
pression. None of the rivers in the valley of the Leeambye have 
slopes down to their beds. Indeed, many parts are much like 
the Thames at the Isle of Dogs, only the Leeambye has to rise 
twenty or thirty feet before it can overflow some of its meadows. 
The rivers have each a bed of low water ; a simple furrow cut 
sharply out of the calcareous tufa, which lined the channel of 
the ancient lake ; and another of inundation. When the beds of 
inundation are filled, they assume the appearance of chains of 
lakes. When the Clyde fills the holms (" haughs ") above Both- 
well Bridge and retires again into its channel, it resembles the river 
we are speaking of, only here, there are no high lands sloping 
down towards the bed of inundation, for the greater part of the 
region is not elevated fifty feet above them. Even the rocky 
banks of the Leeambye below Gonye, and the ridges bounding 
the Barotse valley, are not more than two or three hundred feet 
in altitude over the general dead level. Many of the rivers are 
very tortuous in their course, the Ohobe and Simah particularly 
so; and if we may receive the testimony of the natives, they 
form what anatomists call anastamosis, or a network of rivers. 
Thus, for instance, they assured me that, if they go up the Simah 
in a canoe, they can enter the Chobe and descend that river to 
the Leeambye ; or they may go up the Kama and come down 
the Simah. And so in the case of the Kafue. It is reputed to 
be connected in this way with the Leeambye in the north, and to 
part with the Loangwa ; and the Makololo went from the one, 
into the other, in canoes. And even though the interlacing may 
not be quite to the extent believed by the natives, the country is 
so level and the rivers so tortuous, that I see no improbability 
in the conclusion, that here is a network of waters of a very 
peculiar nature. The reason why I am disposed to place a certain 
amount of confidence in the native reports is this, — when Mr. 
Oswell and I discovered the Zambesi in the centre of the con- 
tinent in 1851, being unable to ascend it at the time ourselves, 
we employed the natives to draw a map embodying their ideas of 
that river. We then sent the native map home with the same 
view that I now mention their ideas of the river system — namely, 
in order to be an aid to others in farther investigations. When I 
was able to ascend the Leeambye to 14° south, and subsequently 

2 M 



530 SAVAGE CUSTOMS OF BATOKA. Chap. XXVI. 

descend it, I found, after all the care I could bestow, that the 
alterations I was able to make in the original native plan, were 
very trifling. The general idea their map gave was wonder- 
fully accurate ; and now I give, in the larger map appended, 
their views of the other rivers, in the hope that they may 
prove helpful to any traveller who may pursue the investigation 
farther. 

24:th. — We remained a day at the village of Moyara. Here 
the valley in which the Lekone flows, trends away to the east- 
ward, while our course is more to the N.E. The country is 
rocky and rough, the soil being red sand, which is covered with 
beautiful green trees, yielding abundance of wild fruits. The 
father of Moyara was a powerful chief, but the son now sits among 
the ruins of the town, with four or five wives and very few 
people. At his hamlet a number of stakes are planted in the 
ground, and I counted fifty-four human skulls hung on their 
points. These were Matebele, who, unable to approach Sebituane 
on the island of Loyela, had returned sick and famishing. 
Moyara's father took advantage of their reduced condition, and, 
after putting them to death, mounted their heads in the Batoka 
fashion. The old man who perpetrated this deed now lies in the 
middle of his son's huts, with a lot of rotten ivory over liis grave. 
One cannot help feeling thankful that the reign of such wretches 
is over. They inhabited the whole of this side of the country, 
and were probably the barrier to the extension of the Portuguese 
commerce in this direction. When looking at these skulls, I 
remarked to Moyara, that many of them were those of mere 
boys. He assented readily and pointed them out as such. I 
asked why his father had lolled boys. " To show his fierceness," 
was the answer. " Is it fierceness to kill boys ? " " Yes, they 
had no business here." When I told him that this probably 
would ensure his own death if the Matebele came again, he 
replied, " When I hear of their coming I shall hide the bones." 
He was evidently proud of these trophies of his father's ferocity, 
and I was assured by other Batoka, that few strangers ever 
returned from a visit to this quarter. If a man wished to curry 
favour with a Batoka chief, he ascertained when a stranger was 
about to leave, and waylaid him at a distance from the town, and 
when he brought the head back to the chief, it was mounted as a 






Chap. XXVI. KEMEDY AGAINST TSETSE. 531 

trophy ; the different chiefs vieing with each other as to which 
should mount the greatest number of skulls in Ins village. 

If, as has been asserted, the Portuguese ever had a chain of 
trading stations across the country from Caconda to Tete, it must 
have passed through these people, but the total ignorance of the 
Zambesi flowing from north to south in the centre of the country, 
and the want of knowledge of the astonishing falls of Victoria 
which excite the wonder of even the natives, together with the 
absence of any tradition of such a chain of stations, compel me 
to believe, that they existed only on paper. This conviction is 
strengthened by the fact that, when a late attempt was made 
to claim the honour of crossing the continent for the Portu- 
guese, the only proof advanced was the journey of two black 
traders formerly mentioned, adorned with the name of " Portu- 
guese" If a chain of stations had existed, a few hundred names 
of the same sort might easily have been brought forward ; and 
such is the love of barter among all the central Africans that, 
had there existed a market for ivory, its value would have become 
known, and even that on the graves of the chiefs, would not have 
been safe. 

When about to leave Moyara on the 25th, he brought a root 
which, when pounded and sprinkled over the oxen, is believed to 
disgust the tsetse, so that it flies off without sucking the blood. 
He promised to show me the plant or tree if I would give him 
an ox ; but as we were travelling, and could not afford the time 
required for the experiment, so as not to be cheated (as I had too 
often been by my medical friends), I deferred the investigation 
till I returned. It is probably but an evanescent remedy, and 
capable of rendering the cattle safe during one night only. 
Moyara is now quite a dependant of the Makololo, and my new 
party, not being thoroughly drilled, forced him to carry a tusk 
for them. When I relieved him, he poured forth a shower of 
thanks, at being allowed to go back to sleep beneath his skulls. 

Next day we came to Namilanga, or " The Well of Joy." It 
is a small well dug beneath a very large fig-tree, the shade of 
which renders the water dehghtfully cool. The temperature 
through the day was 104° in the shade and 94° after sunset, but 
the air was not at all oppressive. Tins well received its name 
from the fact, that in former times marauding parties, in returning 

2 m 2 



532 KNOCKING OUT FRONT TEETH. Chap. XXVI. 

with cattle, sat down here and were regaled with boyaloa, music, 
and the lullilooing of the women from the adjacent towns. 

All the surrounding country was formerly densely peopled, 
though now desolate and still. The old head-man of this place 
told us that his father once went to Bambala, where white traders 
lived, when our informant was a child, and returned when he 
had become a boy of about ten years. He went again, and 
returned when it was time to knock out Ins son's teeth. As that 
takes place at the age of puberty, he must have spent at least 
five years in each journey. He added that many who went there 
never returned, because they liked that country better than this. 
They had even forsaken their wives and children ; and children 
had been so enticed and flattered by the finery bestowed upon 
them there, that they had disowned their parents and adopted 
others. The place to which they had gone, which they named 
Bambala, was probably Dambarari, which was situated close to 
Zumbo. This was the first intimation we had of intercourse with 
the whites. The Barotse, and all the other tribes in the central 
valley, have no such tradition as tins ; nor have either the one or 
the other any account of a trader's visit to them in ancient times. 

All the Batoka tribes follow the curious custom of knocking 
out the upper front teeth at the age of puberty. This is done by 
both sexes, and though the under teeth, being relieved from the 
attrition of the upper, grow long and somewhat bent out, and 
thereby cause the under lip to protrude in a most unsightly way, 
no young woman thinks herself accomplished until she has got 
rid of the upper incisors. This custom gives all the Batoka an 
uncouth, old-man like appearance. Their laugh is hideous, yet 
they are so attached to it, that even Sebituane was unable to 
eradicate the practice. He issued orders, that none of the children 
living under him should be subjected to the custom by their 
parents, and disobedience to his mandates was usually punished 
with severity ; but notwithstanding this, the children would appear 
in the streets without their incisors, and no one would confess to 
the deed. When questioned respecting the origin of this practice, 
the Batoka reply, that their object is to be like oxen, and those 
who retain their teeth they consider to resemble zebras. Whether 
this is the true reason or not, it is difficult to say ; but it is notice- 
able that the veneration for oxen which prevails in many tribes 



Chap. XXVI. THE TRAVELLING PARTY. 533 

should here be associated with hatred to the zebra, as among the 
Bakwains ; that this operation is performed at the same age that 
circumcision is in other tribes ; and that here that ceremony is 
unknown. The custom is so universal, that a person who has his 
teeth is considered ugly, and occasionally, when the Batoka 
borrowed my looking-glass, the disparaging remark would be 
made respecting boys or girls who still retained their teeth, " Look 
at the great teeth ! " Some of the Makololo give a more 
facetious explanation of the custom ; they say that the wife of 
a chief having in a quarrel bitten her husband's hand, he, in 
revenge, ordered her front teeth to be knocked out, and all the 
men in the tribe followed his example ; but this does not explain 
why they afterwards knocked out their own. 

The Batoka of the Zambesi are generally very dark in colour, 
and very degraded and negro-like in appearance, while those 
who live on the high lands we are now ascending, are frequently 
of the colour of coffee and milk. We had a large number of the 
Batoka of Mokwine in our party, sent by Sekeletu to carry his 
tusks. Their greater degradation was probably caused by the 
treatment of their chiefs — the barbarians of the islands. I found 
them more difficult to manage than any of the rest of my compa- 
nions, being much less reasonable and impressible than the others. 
My party consisted of the head-men afore-mentioned, Sekwebu, 
and Kanyata. We were joined at the falls by another head-man 
of the Makololo, named Monahin, in command of the Batoka. 
We had also some of the Banajoa under Mosisinyane, and last of 
all, a small party of Bashubia and Barotse under Tuba Mokoro, 
which had been furnished by Sekeletu because of their ability to 
swim. They carried their paddles with them, and, as the Makololo 
suggested, were able to swim over the rivers by night and steal 
canoes, if the inhabitants should be so unreasonable as to refuse 
to lend them. These different parties assorted together into 
messes ; any orders were given through their head-man, and 
when food was obtained he distributed it to the mess. Each 
party knew its own spot in the encampment ; and as this was 
always placed so that our backs should be to the east, the direction 
from whence the prevailing winds came, no time was lost in 
fixing the sheds of our encampment. They each took it in turn 
to pull grass to make my bed, so I lay luxuriously. 



534 PRODUCTIONS OF THE SOIL. Chap. XXVI. 

November 26th. — As the oxen could only move at night, in con- 
sequence of a fear that the buffaloes in this quarter might have 
introduced the tsetse, I usually performed the march by day on 
foot, while some of the men brought on the oxen by night. On 
coming to the villages under Marimba, an old man, we crossed the 
Unguesi, a rivulet winch, like the Lekone, runs backward. It 
falls into the Leeambye a little above the commencement of the 
rapids. The stratified gneiss, which is the underlying rock of 
much of this part of the country, dips towards the centre of the 
continent, but the strata are often so much elevated as to appear 
nearly on their edges. Kocks of augitic trap are found in various 
positions on it ; the general strike is north and south, but when 
the gneiss was first seen, near to the basalt of the falls, it was 
easterly and westerly, and the dip towards the north, as if the 
eruptive force of the basalt had placed it in that position. 

We passed the remains of a very large town, which, from the 
only evidence of antiquity afforded by ruins in this country, must 
have been inhabited for a long period ; the millstones of gneiss, 
trap, and quartz, were worn down, two and a half inches per- 
pendicularly. The ivory gravestones soon rot away. Those of 
Moyara's father, who must have died not more than a dozen years 
ago, were crumbling into powder ; and we found this to be generally 
the case all over the Batoka country. The region around is pretty 
well covered with forest ; but there is abundance of open pasturage, 
and as we are ascending in altitude we find the grass to be short, 
and altogether unlike the tangled herbage of the Barotse valley. 

It is remarkable that we now meet with the same trees we saw 
in descending towards the west coast. A kind of sterculia, winch 
is the most common tree at Loanda, and the baobab, flourish here ; 
and the tree called moshuka, which we found near Tala Mungongo, 
was now yielding its fruit, which resembles small apples. The 
people brought it to us in large quantities : it tastes like a pear, 
but has a harsh rind, and four large seeds within. We found pro- 
digious quantities of this fruit as we weno along. The tree attains 
the height of 15 or 20 feet, and has leaves, hard and glossy, as large 
as one's hand. The tree itself is never found on the lowlands, but 
is mentioned with approbation at the end of the work of Bowdich. 
My men almost lived upon the fruit for many days. 

The rains had fallen only partially : in many parts the soil was 



Chap. XXVI. ABUNDANCE OF FRUIT. 535 

quite dry and the leaves drooped mournfully, but the fruit-trees 
are unaffected by a drought, except when it happens at the time 
of their blossoming. The Batoka of my party declared that no 
one ever dies of hunger here. We obtained baskets of maneko, 
a curious fruit, with a horny rind, split into five pieces : these 
sections, when chewed, are full of a fine glutinous matter, and 
sweet like sugar. The seeds are covered with a yellow silky 
down, and are not eaten : the entire fruit is about the size of a 
walnut. We got also abundance of the motsouri and mamosho. 
We saw the Batoka eating the beans called nju, winch are con- 
tained in a large square pod ; also the pulp between the seeds of 
nux vomica, and the motsintsela. Other fruits become ripe at 
other seasons, as the motsikiri, which yields an oil, and is a magni- 
ficent tree, bearing masses of dark evergreen leaves ; so that, from 
the general plenty, one can readily believe the statement made by 
the Batoka. We here saw trees allowed to stand in gardens, and 
some of the Batoka even plant them — a practice seen nowhere 
else among natives. A species of leucodendron abounds. When 
we meet with it on a spot on which no rain has yet fallen, 
we see that the young ones twist their leaves round during the 
heat of the day, so that the edge only is exposed to the rays of the 
sun ; they have then a half twist on the petiole. The acacias in 
the same circumstances, and also the mopane (Bauhinia), fold their 
leaves together, and, by presenting the smallest possible surface to 
the sun, simulate the eucalypti of Australia.

November 27th. — Still at Marimba's. In the adjacent country 
palms abound, but none of that species which yields the oil ; 
indeed that is met with only near the coast. There are numbers 
of flowers and bulbs just shooting up from the soil. The surface is 
rough and broken into gullies ; and though the country is parched, 
it has not that appearance, so many trees having put forth their 
fresh green leaves at the time the rains ought to have come. 
Among the rest, stands the mola, with its dark brownish-green 
colour and spreading oak-like form. In the distance there are 
ranges of low hills. On the north we have one called Kanjele, 
and to the east that of Kaonka, to which we proceed to-morrow. 
We have made a considerable de'tour to the north, both on account 
of our wish to avoid the tsetse, and to visit the people. Those 
of Kaonka are the last Batoka we shall meet, in friendship with 
the Makololo. 

Walking down to the forest, after telling these poor people, for 
the first time in their lives, that the Son of God had so loved them 
as to come down from heaven to save them, I observed many 



Chap. XXVH. BLACK SOLDIER-ANTS. 537 

regiments of black soldier-ants, returning from their marauding 
expeditions. These I have often noticed before in different parts 
of the country ; and as we had even at Kolobeng an opportunity 
of observing their habits, I may give a short account of them here. 
They are black, with a slight tinge of grey, about half an inch in 
length, and on the line of march appear three or four abreast ; 
when disturbed, they utter a distinct hissing or chirping sound. 
They follow a few leaders who never carry anything, and they 
seem to be guided by a scent left on the path by the leaders ; for 
happening once to throw the water from my basin behind a bush 
where I was dressing, it lighted on the path by which a regiment 
had passed before I began my toilette, and when they returned 
they were totally at a loss to find the way home, though they 
continued searching for it nearly half an hour. It was found only 
by one making a long circuit round the wetted spot. The scent 
may have indicated also, the propriety of their going in one 
direction only. If a handful of earth is thrown on the path, 
at the middle of the regiment, either on its way home or abroad, 
those behind it are completely at a loss as to their further 
progress. Whatever it may be that guides them, they seem only 
to know that they are not to return, for they come up to the 
handful of earth, but will not cross it, though not a quarter of an 
inch high. They wheel round and regain their path again, but 
never think of retreating to the nest, or to the place where they 
have been stealing. After a quarter of an hour's confusion and 
hissing, one may make a circuit of a foot round the earth, and soon 
all follow in that roundabout way. When on their way to attack 
the abode of the white ants, the latter may be observed rushing 
about in a state of great perturbation. The black leaders, dis- 
tinguished from the rest by their greater size, especially in the 
region of the sting, then seize the white ants one by one, and 
inflict a sting, winch seems to inject a portion of fluid similar in 
effect to chloroform, as it renders them insensible but not dead, 
and only able to move one or two front legs. As the leaders toss 
them on one side, the rank and file seize them and carry them off. 
One morning I saw a party going forth on what has been sup- 
posed to be a slave-hunting expedition. They came to a stick, which, 
being enclosed in a white-ant gallery, I knew contained numbers 
of this insect ; but I was surprised to see the black soldiers passing 



538 BLACK SOLDIER-ANTS. Chap. XXVII. 

without touching it. I lifted up the stick and broke a portion of 
the gallery, and then laid it across the path in the middle of the 
black regiment. The white ants, when uncovered, scampered 
about with great celerity, hiding themselves under the leaves, but 
attracted little attention from the black marauders, till one of the 
leaders caught them, and applying his sting, laid them in an 
instant on one side in a state of coma ; the others then promptly 
seized them and rushed off. On first observing these marauding 
insects at Kolobeng, I had the idea, imbibed from a work of no less 
authority than Brougham's Paley, that they seized the white ants 
in order to make them slaves ; but having rescued a number of 
captives, I placed them aside, and found that they never recovered 
from the state of insensibility into winch they had been thrown by 
the leaders. I supposed then that the insensibility had been caused 
by the soldiers holding the necks of the white ants too tightly 
with then* mandibles, as that is the way they seize them ; but even 
the pupae which I took from the soldier ants, though placed in a 
favourable temperature, never became developed. In addition to 
this, if any one examines the orifice by which the black ant enters 
his barracks, he will always find a little heap of hard heads and 
legs of the white ants, showing that these black ruffians are a grade 
lower than slave-stealers, being actually cannibals. Elsewhere, I 
have seen a body of them removing their eggs from a place in 
which they were likely to be flooded by the rains ; I calculated 
their numbers to be 1260 ; they carried then- eggs a certain 
distance, then laid them down, when others took them and carried 
them further on. Every ant in the colony seemed to be employed 
in this laborious occupation, yet there was not a white slave-ant 
among them. One cold morning, I observed a band of another 
species of black ant, returning each with a captive : there could be 
no doubt of their cannibal propensities, for the " brutal soldiery " 
had already deprived the white ants of their legs. The fluid in 
the stings of this species, is of an intensely acid taste. 

I had often noticed the stupefaction produced by the injection 
of a fluid from the sting of certain insects before. It is particu- 
larly observable in a hymenopterous insect called the "plasterer" 
(Pelopceus Ecklcmi), which in its habits resembles somewhat the 
mason-bee. It is about an inch and a quarter in length, jet black 
in colour, and may be observed coming into houses, carrying in 



Chap. XXVII. WHITE ANTS. 539 

its fore-legs a pellet of soft plaster about the size of a pea. When 
it has fixed upon a convenient spot for its dwelling, it forms a cell 
about the same length as its body, plastering the walls, so as to 
be quite thin and smooth inside. When tins is finished, all except 
a round hole, it brings seven or eight caterpillars or spiders, each 
of which is rendered insensible, but not killed, by the fluid from 
its sting. These it deposits in the cell, and then one of its own 
larvae, which, as it grows, finds food quite fresh. The insects are 
in a state of coma, but the presence of vitality prevents putridity, 
or that drying up, which would otherwise take place in this 
climate. By the time the young insect is full grown and its wings 
completely developed, the food is done. It then pierces the wall 
of its cell at the former door, or place last filled up by its parent, 
flies off, and begins life for itself. The plasterer is a most useful 
insect, as it acts as a check on the inordinate increase of cater- 
pillars and spiders. It may often be seen with a caterpillar or 
even a cricket much larger than itself, but they lie perfectly still 
after the injection of chloroform, and the plasterer, placing a row 
of legs on each side of the body, uses both legs and wings in 
trailing the victim along. The fluid in each case is, I suppose, 
designed to cause insensibility and likewise act as an antiseptic, 
the death of the victims being without pain. 

Without these black soldier-ants, the country would be overrun 
by the white ants ; they are so extremely prolific, and nothing can 
exceed the energy with which they work. They perform a most 
important part in the economy of nature, by burying vegetable 
matter as quickly beneath the soil, as the ferocious red ant does 
dead animal substances. The white ant keeps generally out of 
sight, and works under galleries constructed by night, to screen 
them from the observation of birds. At some given signal, how- 
ever, I never could ascertain what, they rush out by hundreds, 
and the sound of their mandibles cutting grass into lengths, may 
be heard like a gentle wind murmuring through the leaves of the 
trees. They drag these pieces to the doors of their abodes, and 
after some hours' toil leave off work, and many of the bits 
of grass may be seen collected around the orifice. They con- 
tinue out of sight for perhaps a month, but they are never idle. 
On one occasion, a good bundle of grass was laid down for my bed, 
on a spot which was quite smooth and destitute of plants. The 



540 EFFECTS OF SMOKING MUTOKWANE. Chap. XXVII. 

ants at once sounded the call to a good supply of grass. I heard 
them incessantly nibbling and carrying away all that night ; 
and they continued all next day (Sunday) and all that night too 
with unabated energy. They had thus been thirty-six hours at 
it, and seemed as fresh as ever. In some situations, if we re- 
mained a day, they devoured the grass beneath my mat, and 
would have eaten that too, had we not laid down more grass. 
At some of their operations, they beat time in a curious manner. 
Hundreds of them are engaged in building a large tube, and they 
wish to beat it smooth. At a signal, they all give three or four 
energetic beats on the plaster in unison. It produces a sound 
like the dropping of rain off a bush when touched. These insects 
are the chief agents employed in forming a fertile soil. But for 
their labours, the tropical forests, bad as they are now with fallen 
trees, would be a thousand times worse. They would be impass- 
able on account of the heaps of dead vegetation lying on the 
surface, and emitting worse effluvia than the comparatively small 
unburied collections do now. When one looks at the wonderful 
adaptations throughout creation, and the varied operations carried 
on with such wisdom and skill, the idea of second causes looks 
clumsy. We are viewing the direct handiworks of Him who is 
the one and only Power in the universe ; wonderful in counsel ; 
in whom we all live and move and have our being. 

The Batoka of these parts are very degraded in their appear- 
ance, and are not likely to improve, either physically or mentally, 
while so much addicted to smoking the mutokwane (Cannabis 
sativa). They like its narcotic effects, though the violent fit of 
coughing, which follows a couple of puffs of smoke, appears dis- 
tressing, and causes a feeling of disgust in the spectator. Tins is 
not diminished on seeing the usual practice of taking a mouthful 
of water, and squirting it out together with the smoke, then 
uttering a string of half-incoherent sentences, usually in self- 
praise. Tins pernicious weed is extensively used in all the tribes 
of the interior. It causes a species of frenzy, and Sebituane's 
soldiers, on coming in sight of their enemies, sat down and smoked 
it, in order that they might make an effective onslaught. I was 
unable to prevail on Sekeletu and the young Makololo to forego 
its use, although they cannot point to an old man in the tribe 
who has been addicted to this indulgence. I believe it was the 



Chap. XXVII. BORDER TERRITORY. * 541 

proximate cause of Sebituane's last illness, for it sometimes occa- 
sions pneumonia. Never having tried it, I cannot describe the 
pleasurable effects it is said to produce, but the hachshish in use 
among the Turks is simply an extract of the same plant, and 
that, like opium, produces different effects on different indivi- 
duals. Some view everything as if looking in through the wide 
end of a telescope, and others, in passing over a straw, lift up 
their feet as if about to cross the trunk of a tree. The Portuguese 
in Angola have such a belief in its deleterious effects that the use 
of it by a slave is considered a crime. 

November 28^. — The inhabitants of the last of Kaonka's 
villages, complained of being plundered by the independent 
Batoka. The tribes in front of this are regarded by the Makololo 
as in a state of rebellion. I promised to speak to the rebels on 
the subject, and enjoined on Kaonka the duty of giving them no 
offence. According to Sekeletu's order, Kaonka gave us the 
tribute of maize-corn and ground-nuts, which would otherwise 
have gone to Linyanti. This had been done at every village, and 
we thereby saved the people the trouble of a journey to the 
capital. My own Batoka had brought away such loads of pro- 
visions from their homes that we were in no want of food. 

After leaving Kaonka we travelled over an uninhabited, gently 
undulating, and most beautiful district, the border territory be- 
tween those who accept, and those who reject, the sway of the 
Makololo. The face of the country appears as if in long waves, 
running north and south. There are no rivers, though water 
stands in pools in the hollows. We were now come into the 
country which my people all magnify as a perfect paradise. 
Sebituane was driven from it by the Matebele. It suited him 
exactly for cattle, corn, and health. The soil is dry, and often 
a reddish sand ; there are few trees, but fine large shady ones 
stand dotted here and there over the country where towns 
formerly stood. One of the Hg family I measured, and found to 
be forty feet in circumference ; the heart had been burned out, 
and some one had made a lodging in it, for we saw the remains of 
a bed and a fire. The sight of the open country, with the in- 
creased altitude we were attaining, was most refreshing to the 
spirits. Large game abound. We see in the distance buffaloes, 
elands, hartebeest, gnus, and elephants, all very tame, as no one 



542 THE KALOMO. Chap. XXYII. 

disturbs them. Lions, which always accompany other large ani- 
mals, roared about us, but as it was moonlight there was no 
danger. In the evening, while standing on a mass of granite, 
one began to roar at me, though it was still light. The tem- 
perature was pleasant, as the rains, though not universal, had 
fallen in many places. It was very cloudy, preventing observa- 
tions. The temperature at 6 a.m. was 70°, at midday 90°, in 
the evening 84°. This is very pleasant on the high lands, with 
but little moisture in the air. 

The different rocks to the westward of Kaonka's, talcose gneiss, 
and white mica schist, generally dip towards the west, but at 
Kaonka's, large rounded masses of granite, containing black mica, 
began to appear. The outer rind of it inclines to peel off, and 
large crystals project on the exposed surface. 

In passing through some parts where a good shower of rain 
has fallen, the stridulous piercing notes of the cicadse are perfectly 
deafening ; a drab-coloured cricket joins the chorus with a sharp 
sound, which has as little modulation as the drone of a Scottish 
bagpipe. I could not conceive how so small a thing could raise 
such a sound ; it seemed to make the ground over it thrill. When 
cicada?, crickets, and frogs unite, their music may be heard at the 
distance of a quarter of a mile. 

A tree attracted my attention as new, the leaves being like 
those of an acacia, but the ends of the branches from winch they 
grew resembled closely oblong fir-cones. The corn poppy was 
abundant, and many of the trees, flowering bulbs and plants, 
were identical with those in Pungo Andongo. A flower, as white 
as the snowdrop, now begins to appear, and farther on, it spots 
the whole sward with its beautiful pure white, A fresh crop 
appears every morning, and if the day is cloudy they do not 
expand till the afternoon. In an hour or so they droop and die. 
They are named by the natives, from their shape, "Tlaku ea 
pitse," hoof of zebra. I carried several of the somewhat bulbous 
roots of this pretty flower till I reached the Mauritius. 

On the 30th we crossed the river Kalomo, which is about 50 
yards broad, and is the only stream that never dries up on this 
ridge. The current is rapid, and its course is towards the south, 
as it joins the Zambesi at some distance below the falls. The 
Unguesi and Lekone, with their feeders, flow westward, this river 



Chap. XXVII. CONFOEMATION OF COUNTRY. 543 

to the south, and all those to which we are about to come, take 
an easterly direction. We were thus at the apex of the ridge, 
and found that, as water boiled at 202", our altitude above the 
level of the sea was over 5000 feet. Here the granite crops out 
again in great rounded masses which change the dip of the gneiss 
and mica schist rocks from the westward to the eastward. In 
crossing the western ridge, I mentioned the clay-shale or keele 
formation, a section of which we have in the valley of the 
Quango : the strata there lie nearly horizontal, but on this ridge 
the granite seems to have been the active agent of elevation, for 
the rocks, both on its east and west, abut against it. Both 
eastern and western ridges are known to be comparatively 
salubrious, and in this respect, as well as in the general aspect 
of the country, they resemble that most healthy of all healthy 
climates, the interior of South Africa, near and adjacent to the 
Desert. Tins ridge has neither fountain nor marsh upon it, 
and east of the Kalomo we look upon treeless undulating plains 
covered with short grass. From a point somewhat near to 
the great falls, this ridge or oblong mound trends away to the 
N.E., and there treeless elevated plains again appear. Then 
again the ridge is said to bend away from the falls to the 
S.E., the Mashona country, or rather their mountains, appearing, 
according to Mr. Moffat, about four days east of Matlokotloko, the 
present residence of Mosilikatse. In reference to this ridge 
he makes the interesting remark, " I observed a number of the 
Angora goat, most of them being white ; and their long soft hair 
covermg then entire bodies to the ground made them look like 
animals moving along without feet." * 

It is impossible to say how much farther to the N. these 
subtending ridges may stretch. There is reason to believe that, 
though the same general form of country obtains, they are 
not flanked by abrupt hills between the latitude 12° S. and the 
equator. The inquiry is worthy the attention of travellers. 
As they are known to be favourable to health, the Makololo, 
who have been nearly all cut off by fevers in the valley, declar- 
ing that here they never had a headache, they may even be 
recommended as a sanatorium for those whose enterprise leads

544 CONFORMATION OF COUNTRY. Chap. XXVH. 

them into Africa, either for the advancement of scientific know- 
ledge, or for the purposes of trade or benevolence. In the case of 
the eastern ridge, we have water-carriage, with only one short rapid 
as an obstruction, right up to its base ; and if a quick passage 
can be effected during the healthy part of the year, there would 
be no danger of loss of health during a long stay on these high 
lands afterwards. How much further do these high ridges extend ? 
The eastern one seems to bend in considerably towards the great 
falls ; and the strike of the rocks indicating that, further to 
the N.N.E. than my investigations extend, it may not, at a few 
degrees of latitude beyond, be more than 300 or 350 miles from 
the coast. They at least merit inquiry, for they afford a prospect 
to Europeans, of situations superior in point of salubrity to any of 
those on the coast : and so on the western side of the continent ; 
for it is a fact that many parts in the interior of Angola, which 
were formerly thought to be unhealthy on account of their distance 
inland, have been found, as population advanced, to be the most 
healthy spots in the country. Did the great Niger expedition 
turn back when near such a desirable position for its stricken 
and prostrate members ? 

The distances from top to top of the ridges may be about 
10° of longitude, or 600 geographical miles. I cannot hear of a 
lull on either ridge, and there are scarcely any in the space 
enclosed by them. The Monakadze is the highest, but that is 
not more than a thousand feet above the flat valley. On account 
of this want of hills in the part of the countiy winch, by gentle 
undulations, leads one insensibly up to an altitude of 5000 feet 
above the level of the sea, I have adopted the agricultural term 
ridges, for they partake very much of the character of the oblong 
mounds with which we are all familiar. And we shall yet see 
that the mountains which are met with outside these ridges, are 
only a low fringe, many of which are not of much greater altitude 
than even the bottom of the great central valley. If we leave out 
of view the greater breadth of the central basin at other parts, and 
speak only of the comparatively narrow part formed by the bend 
to the westward of the eastern ridge, we might say that the form of 
tins region is a broad furrow in the middle, with an elevated ridge 
about 200 miles broad on either side, the land sloping thence, 
on both sides, to the sea. If I am right in believing the granite 



Chap. XXVII. WOUNDED BUFFALO ASSISTED. 545 

to be the cause of the elevation of this ridge, the direction in 
which the strike of the rocks trends to the N.N.E. may indicate 
that the same geological structure prevails farther north, and 
two or three lakes which exist in that direction, may be of 
exactly the same nature with lake Ngami ; having been dimi- 
nished to their present size by the same kind of agency as that 
which formed the falls of Victoria. 

We met an elephant on the Kalomo which had no tusks. This 
is as rare a thing in Africa, as it is to find them with tusks in 
Ceylon. As soon as she saw us she made off. It is remarkable 
to see the fear of man operating even on this huge beast. Buffa- 
loes abound, and we see large herds of them feeding in all direc- 
tions by day. When much disturbed by man, they retire into the 
densest parts of the forest, and feed by night only. We secured 
a fine large bull by crawling close to a herd : when shot, he fell 
down, and the rest, not seeing their enemy, gazed about, won- 
dering where the danger lay. The others came back to it, and, 
when we showed ourselves, much to the amusement of my com- 
panions, they lifted him up with their horns, and, half supporting 
him in the crowd, bore him away. All these wild animals usually 
gore a wounded companion and expel him from the herd ; even 
zebras bite and kick an unfortunate or a diseased one. It is 
intended by this instinct, that none but the perfect and healthy 
ones should propagate the species. In this case they manifested 
their usual propensity to gore the wounded, but our appearance at 
that moment caused them to take flight, and tins, with the goring 
being continued a little, gave my men the impression that they 
were helping away their wounded companion. He was shot 
between the fourth and fifth ribs ; the ball passed through both 
lungs and a rib on the opposite side, and then lodged beneath the 
skin. But though it was eight ounces in weight, yet he ran off 
some distance, and was secured only by the people driving him 
into a pool of water and killing him there with their spears. 
The herd ran away in the direction of our camp, and then came 
bounding past us again. We took refuge on a large ant-hill, and 
as they rushed by us at full gallop, I had a good opportunity of 
seeing that the leader of a herd of about sixty, was an old cow ; all 
the others allowed her a full half-length in then front. On her 
withers sat about twenty buffalo-birds (Textor erythr&rliynchus, 

2 N 



546 BUFFALO AND RHINOCEROS BIRDS. Chap. XXVII. 

Smith), which act the part of guardian spirits to the animals. 
When the buffalo is quietly feeding, this bird may be seen hop- 
ping on the ground picking up food, or sitting on its back ridding 
it of the insects with which their skins are sometimes infested. 
The sight of the bird being much more acute than that of the 
buffalo, it is soon alarmed by the approach of any danger, and, 
flying up, the buffaloes instantly raise their heads to discover the 
cause, which has led to the sudden flight of their guardian. They 
sometimes accompany the buffaloes in their flight on the wing, at 
other times they sit as above described. 

Another African bird, namely, the Bwphaga Africana, attends 
the rhinoceros for a similar purpose. It is called " kala " hi the 
language of the Bechuanas : when these people wish to express 
their dependence upon another, they address him as " my rhino- 
ceros," as if they were the birds. The satellites of a chief go by 
the same name. This bird cannot be said to depend entirely on 
the insects on that animal, for its hard hairless skin is a protection 
against all except a few spotted ticks ; but it seems to be attached 
to the beast, somewhat as the domestic dog is to man ; and while 
the buffalo is alarmed by the sudden flying up of its sentinel, the 
rhinoceros, not having keen sight, but an acute ear, is warned by 
the cry of its associate, the Bwphaga Africana. The rhinoceros 
feeds by night, and its sentinel is frequently heard in the morning 
uttering its well-known call, as it searches for its bulky companion. 
One species of this bird, observed in Angola, possesses a bill of a 
peculiar scoop or stone forceps form, as if intended only to tear off 
insects from the skin ; and its claws are as sharp as needles, enabling 
it to hang on to an animal's ear, while performing a useful service 
within it. This sharpness of the claws allows the bird to cling to 
the nearly insensible cuticle without irritating the nerves of pain 
on the true skin, exactly as a burr does to the human hand ; but 
in the case of the Buphaga Africana and erythrorhyncha, other 
food is partaken of, for we observed flocks of them roosting on 
the reeds, in spots where neither tame nor wild animals were to be 
found. 

The most wary animal in a herd is generally the " leader." 
When it is shot, the others often seem at a loss what to do, and stop 
in a state of bewilderment. I have seen them then attempt to 
follow each other and appear quite confused, no one knowing for 



Chap. XXVII. LEADEKS OF HERDS— HONEY-GUIDE. 547 

half a minute or more where to direct the flight. On one occasion I 
hapjDened to shoot the leader, a young zebra mare, winch at some 
former time had been bitten on the hind leg by a carnivorous 
animal, and, thereby made unusually wary, had in consequence 
become a leader. If they see either one of their own herd or any 
other animal taking to flight, wild animals invariably flee. The 
most timid thus naturally leads the rest. It is not any other 
peculiarity, but simply this provision, winch is given them for 
the preservation of the race. The great increase of wariness, 
which is seen to occur, when the females bring forth then young, 
causes all the leaders to be at that time females ; and there 
is a probability that the separation of sexes into distinct herds, 
which is annually observed in many antelopes, arises from the 
simple fact that the greater caution of the she antelopes is 
partaken of only by the young males, and their more frequent 
flights now, have the effect of leaving the old males behind. I 
am inclined to believe this, because, though the antelopes, as the 
pallahs, &c, are frequently in separate herds, they are never seen 
in the act of expelling the males. There may be some other 
reason in the case of the elephants ; but the male and female 
elephants are never seen in one herd. The young males remain 
with their dams only until they are full grown, and so constantly 
is the separation maintained, that any one familiar with them, on 
seeing a picture with the sexes mixed, would immediately con- 
clude that the artist had made it from his imagination, and not 
from sight. 

December 2, 1855. — We remained near a small hill, called 
Maundo, where we began to be frequently invited by the honey- 
guide (Cuculus indicator). Wishing to ascertain the truth of the 
native assertion that tins bird is a deceiver, and by its call some- 
times leads to a wild beast and not to honey, I inquired, if any of 
my men had ever been led by this friendly little bird to anything 
else, than what its name implies. Only one of the 114 could say 
he had been led to an elephant instead of a hive, like myself with 
the black rhinoceros mentioned before. I am quite convinced that 
the majority of people who commit themselves to its guidance are 
led to honey, and to it alone. 

On the 3rd we crossed the river Mozuma, or river of Dila, 
having travelled through a beautifully undulating pastoral country.

548 WHITE MOUNTAIN— THE MOZUMA. Chap. XXYII. 

To the south, and a little east of this, stands the hill Taba Cheu, 
or " White Mountain," from a mass of white rock, probably dolo- 
mite, on its top. But none of the hills are of any great altitude. 
When I heard this mountain described at Linyanti, I thought the 
ghstening substance might be snow, and my informants were so loud 
in their assertions of its exceeding great altitude, that I was startled 
with the idea; but I had quite forgotten that I was speaking 
with men who had been accustomed to plains, and knew nothing 
of very high mountains. When I inquired what the white sub- 
stance was, they at once replied it was a kind of rock. I expected 
to have come nearer to it, and would have ascended it ; but we 
were led to go to the north-east. Yet I doubt not that the native 
testimony of its being stone, is true. The distant ranges of hills 
which line the banks of the Zambesi on the south-east, and land- 
scapes which permit the eye to range over twenty or thirty 
miles at a time, with short grass under our feet, were especially 
refreshing sights to those who had travelled for months together, 
over the confined views of the flat forest, and among the tangled 
rank herbage of the great valley. 

The Mozuma, or river of Dila, was the first watercourse which 
indicated that we were now on the slopes towards the eastern coast. 
It contained no flowing water, but revealed in its banks what 
gave me great pleasure at the time ; pieces of lignite, possibly 
indicating the existence of a mineral, namely, coal, the want of 
which in the central country I had always deplored. Again and 
again we came to the ruins of large towns, containing the only 
hieroglyphics of this country, worn millstones, with the round ball 
of quartz with which the grinding was effected. Great numbers 
of these balls were lying about, showing that the depopulation had 
been the result of war, for, had the people removed in peace, they 
would have taken the balls with them. 

At the river of Dila, we saw the spot where Sebituane lived, 
and Sekwebu pointed out the heaps of bones of cattle, which 
the Makololo had been obliged to slaughter, after performing 
a march with great herds captured from the Batoka, through 
a patch of the fatal tsetse. When Sebituano saw the symptoms 
of the poison, he gave orders to his people to eat the cattle. He 
still had vast numbers; and when the Matebele, crossing the 
Zambesi opposite this part, came to attack him, he invited the 



Chap. XXVH. PROPHETIC FRENZY. 549 

Batoka to take repossession of their herds, he having so many as to 
be unable to guide them in their flight. The country was at that 
time exceedingly rich in cattle, and, besides pasturage, it is all 
well adapted for the cultivation of native produce. Being on the 
eastern slope of the ridge, it receives more rain than any part of 
the westward. Sekwebu had been instructed to point out to me 
the advantages of this position for a settlement, as that which all 
the Makololo had never ceased to regret. It needed no eulogy 
from Sekwebu ; I admired it myself, and the enjoyment of good 
health in line open scenery, had an exhilarating effect on my spirits. 
The great want was population, the Batoka having all taken 
refuge in the hills. We were now in the vicinity of those whom 
the Makololo deem rebels, and felt some anxiety as to how we 
should be received. 

On the 4th we reached their first village. Kemaining at a 
distance of a quarter of a mile, we sent two men to inform them 
who we were, and that our purposes were peaceful. The head-man 
came and spoke civilly, but when nearly dark, the people of 
another village arrived and behaved very differently. They began 
by trying to spear a young man who had gone for water. Then 
they approached us, and one came forward howling at the top of 
Iris voice in the most hideous mamier ; Iris eyes were shot out, his 
lips covered with foam, and every muscle of his frame quivered. 
He came near to me, and, having a small battle-axe in Iris hand, 
alarmed my men lest he might do violence ; but they were afraid 
to disobey my previous orders, and to follow their own inclination 
by knocking him on the head. I felt a little alarmed, too, but 
would not show fear before my own people or strangers, and kept 
a sharp look-out on the little battle-axe. It seemed to me a case 
of extacy or prophetic frenzy, voluntarily produced. I felt it would 
be a sorry way to leave the world, to get my head chopped 
by a mad savage, though that perhaps would be preferable to 
hydrophobia or delirium tremens. Sekwebu took a spear in Iris 
hand, as if to pierce a bit of leather, but in reality to plunge it into 
the man if he offered violence to me. After my courage had been 
sufficiently tested, I beckoned with the head to the civil head-man 
to remove him, and he did so by drawing him aside. This man 
pretended not to know what he was doing. I would fain have felt 
Iris pulse, to ascertain whether the violent trembling were not 



550 FOOD OF THE ELEPHANT. Chap. XXVH. 

feigned, but had not much inclination to go near the battle-axe 
again. There was, however, a flow of perspiration, and the ex- 
citement continued fully half an hour, then gradually ceased. 
This paroxysm is the direct opposite of hypnotism, and it is sin- 
gular that it has not been tried in Europe as well as clairvoyance. 
This second batch of visitors took no pains to conceal their 
contempt for our small party, saying to each other in a tone of 
triumph, "They are quite a God-send!" literally, "God has 
apportioned them to us." " They are lost among the tribes ! " 
" They have wandered in order to be destroyed, and what can they 
do without shields among so many?" Some of them asked if 
there were no other parties. Sekeletu had ordered my men not to 
take their shields, as in the case of my first company. We were 
looked upon as unarmed, and an easy prey. We prepared against 
a night attack by discharging and reloading our guns, which were 
exactly the same in number (five) as on the former occasion, as I 
allowed my late companions to retain those which I purchased at 
Loanda. We were not molested, but some of the enemy tried to lead 
us towards the Bashukulompo, who are considered to be the fiercest 
race in this quarter. As we knew our direction to the confluence 
of the Kafue and Zambesi, we declined their guidance, and the 
civil head-man of the evening before, then came along with us. 
Crowds of natives hovered round us in the forest ; but he ran for- 
ward and explained, and we were not molested. That night we 
slept by a little village under a low range of hills, which are called 
Chizamena. The country here is more woody than on the high 
lands we had left, but the trees are not in general large. Great 
numbers of them have been broken off by elephants, a foot or two 
from the ground : they thus seem pollarded from that point. This 
animal never seriously lessens the number of trees ; indeed I have 
often been struck by the very little damage he does in a forest. 
His food consists more of bulbs, tubers, roots, and branches, than 
anything else. Where they have been feeding, great numbers of 
trees, as thick as a man's body, are seen twisted down or broken 
off, in order that they may feed on the tender shoots at the tops. 
They are said sometimes to unite in wrenching down large trees. 
The natives in the interior believe that the elephant never touches 
grass, and I never saw evidence of his having grazed until we came 
near to Tete, and then he had fed on grass in seed only ; this 



Chap. XXVII. CLOTHING DESPISED. 551 

seed contains so much farinaceous matter, that the natives collect 
it for their own food. 

This part of the country abounds in ant-hills. In the open 
parts they are studded over the surface exactly as haycocks are in 
harvest, or heaps of manure in spring, rather disfiguring the land- 
scape. In the woods they are as large as round haystacks, 40 or 
50 feet in diameter at the base, and at least 20 feet high. These 
are more fertile than the rest of the land, and here they are the 
chief garden-ground for maize, pumpkins, and tobacco. 

When we had passed the outskirting villages, which alone con- 
sider themselves in a state of war with the Makololo, we found 
the Batoka, or Batonga, as they here call themselves, quite 
friendly. Great numbers of them came from all the surrounding 
villages, with presents of maize and masuka, and expressed great 
joy at the first appearance of a white man, and harbinger of 
peace. The women clothe themselves better than the Balonda, 
but the men go in puris naturalibus. They walk about without 
the smallest sense of shame. They have even lost the tradition of 
the " figleaf." I asked a fine large-bodied old man, if he did not 
think it would be better to adopt a little covering. He looked with 
a pitying leer, and laughed with surprise at my thinking him at all 
indecent : he evidently considered himself above such weak super- 
stition. I told them that on my return I should have my family 
with me, and no one must come near us in that state. " What 
shall we put on ? we have no clothing." It was considered a good 
joke when I told them that, if they had nothing else, they must 
put on a bunch of grass. 

The further we advanced, the more we found the country swarm- 
ing with inhabitants. Great numbers came to see the white man, a 
sight they had never beheld before. They always brought presents 
of maize and masuka. Their mode of salutation is quite singular. 
They throw themselves on their backs on the ground, and, rolling 
from side to side, slap the outside of their thighs as expressions of 
thankfulness and welcome, uttering the words, "Kina bomba." 
This method of salutation was to me very disagreeable, and I 
never could get reconciled to it. I called out " Stop, stop ! I don't 
want that ; " but they, imagining I was dissatisfied, only tumbled 
about more furiously, and slapped their thighs with greater 
vigour. The men being totally unclothed, tins performance 



552 EFFECTS OF THE GOSPEL. Chap. XXVII. 

imparted to my mind a painful sense of their extreme degrada- 
tion. My own Batoka were much more degraded than the 
Barotse, and more reckless. We had to keep a strict watch, so as 
not to be involved by their thieving from the inhabitants, in whose 
country and power we were. We had also to watch the use they 
made of their tongues, for some within hearing of the villagers 
would say, " I broke all the pots of that village," or, " I killed a 
man there." They were eager to recount their soldier deeds, 
when they were in company with the Makololo in former times, as 
a conquering army. They were thus placing us in danger by 
their remarks. I called them together, and spoke to them about 
their folly ; and gave them a pretty plain intimation that I 
meant to insist upon as complete subordination as I had secured 
in my former journey, as being necessary for the safety of the 
party. Happily it never was needful to resort to any other 
measure for their obedience, as they all believed that I would 
enforce it. 

In connection with the low state of the Batoka, I was led to 
think on the people of Kuruman, who were equally degraded and 
equally depraved. There a man scorned to shed a tear. It would 
have been " tlolo," or transgression. Weepmg, such as Dr. Kane 
describes among the Esquimaux, is therefore quite unknown in 
that country. But I have witnessed instances like tliis : Baba, a 
mighty hunter — the interpreter who accompanied Captain Harris, 
and who was ultimately killed by a rhinoceros — sat listening to 
the gospel in the church at Kuruman, and the gracious words 
of Christ, made to touch his heart, evidently by the Holy Spirit, 
melted liim into tears ; I have seen him and others sink down to 
the ground weeping. When Baba was lying mangled by the 
furious beast which tore him off his horse, he shed no tear, but 
quietly prayed as long as he was conscious. I had no hand in his 
instruction : if these Batoka ever become like him, and they may, 
the influence that effects it must be divine. 

A very large portion of this quarter is covered with masuka- 
trees, and the ground was so strewed with the pleasant fruit, that 
my men kept eating it constantly, as we marched along. We saw 
a smaller kind of the same tree named Molondo, the fruit of 
which is about the size of marbles, having a tender skin, and slight 
acidity of taste mingled with its sweetness. Another tree which 



Chap. XXVII. THE CAPTIVE RELEASED. 553 

is said to yield good fruit is named Sombo, but it was not ripe at 
this season. 

December 6th. — We passed the night near a series of villages. 
Before we came to a stand under our tree, a man came running 
to us with hands and arms firmly bound with cords behind his 
back, entreating me to release him. When I had dismounted, 
the head-man of the village advanced, and I inquired the pri- 
soner's offence. He stated that he had come from the Bashu- 
kulompo as a fugitive, and he had given him a wife and garden, 
and a supply of seed ; but on refusing a demand for more, the 
prisoner had threatened to kill him, and had been seen the 
night before, skulking about the village, apparently with that 
intention. I declined interceding, unless he would confess to 
his father-in-law, and promise amendment. He at first refused 
to promise to abstain from violence, but afterwards agreed. The 
father-in-law then said that he would take him to the village 
and release him, but the prisoner cried out bitterly, " He will 
kill me there ; don't leave me, white man." I ordered a knife, 
and one of the villagers released him on the spot. His arms 
were cut by the cords, and he was quite lame from the blows 
he had received. 

These villagers supplied us abundantly with ground-nuts, 
maize, and corn. All expressed great satisfaction on hearing my 
message, as I directed their attention to Jesus as their Saviour, 
whose word is " Peace on earth and good will to men." They 
called out, " We are tired of flight ; give us rest and sleep." They 
of course did not understand the full import of the message, but 
it was no wonder that they eagerly seized the idea of peace. 
Then country has been visited by successive scourges during the 
last half-century, and they are now " a nation scattered and 
peeled." When Sebituane came, the cattle were innumerable, and 
yet these were the remnants only, left by a chief called Pingola, 
who came from the north-east. He swept across the whole 
territory inhabited by his cattle-loving countrymen, devouring 
oxen, cows, and calves, without retaining a single head. He seems 
to have been actuated by a simple love of conquest, and is an 
instance of what has occurred two or three times in every century 
in this country, from time immemorial. A man of more energy 
or ambition than his fellows, rises up and conquers a large territory, 



554 MONZE'S VILLAGE. Chap. XXVli. 

but as soon as lie dies, the power he built up is gone, and his 
reign, having been one of terror, is not perpetuated. This, 
and the want of literature, have prevented the establishment of 
any great empire in the interior of Africa. Pingola effected his 
conquests, by carrying numbers of smith's bellows with him. The 
arrow-heads were heated before shooting into a town, and when 
a wound was inflicted on either man or beast, great confusion 
ensued. After Pingola, came Sebituane, and after him the 
Matebele of Mosilikatse; and these successive inroads have re- 
duced the Batoka to a state, in which they naturally rejoice at the 
prospect of deliverance and peace. 

We spent Sunday the 10th at Monze's village, who is con- 
sidered the chief of all the Batoka we have seen. He lives 
near the hill Kisekise, whence we have a view of at least thirty 
miles of open undulating country, covered with short grass, and 
having but few trees. These open lawns would in any other 
land, as well as this, be termed pastoral, but the people have 
now no cattle, and only a few goats and fowls. They are located 
all over the country in small villages, and cultivate large gardens. 
They are said to have adopted this wide-spread mode of habita- 
tion, in order to give alarm should any enemy appear. In former 
times they lived in large towns. In the distance (S.E.) we see 
ranges of dark mountains along the banks of the Zambesi, and 
are told of the existence there of the rapid named Kansala, 
which is said to impede the navigation. The river is reported 
to be placid above that as far as the territory of Sinamane, a 
Batoka chief, who is said to command it after it emerges smooth 
again below the falls. Kansala is the only rapid reported in the 
river until we come to Kebrabasa, twenty or thirty miles above 
Tete. On the north, we have mountains appearing above the 
horizon, which are said to be on the banks of the Kafue. 

The chief Monze came to us on Sunday morning, wrapped in 
a large cloth, and rolled himself about in the dust, screaming 
" Kina bomba," as they all do. The sight of great naked men 
wallowing on the ground, though intended to do me honour, was 
always very painful ; it made me feel thankful that my lot had 
been cast in such different circumstances from that of so many of 
my fellow-men. One of his wives accompanied liim ; she would 
have been comely if her teeth had been spared ; she had a little 



Kfvp; 



Chap. XXVII. FKIENDLY FEELINGS TOWARDS EUROPEANS. 555 

battle-axe in her hand, and helped her husband to scream. She 
was much excited, for she had never seen a white man before. 
We rather liked Monze, for he soon felt at home amongst us, and 
kept up conversation during much of the day. One head-man of 
a village after another arrived, and each of them supplied us 
liberally with maize, ground-nuts, and corn. Monze gave us a goat 
and a fowl, and appeared highly satisfied with a present of some 
handkerchiefs I had got in my supplies left at the island. Being 
of printed cotton, they excited great admiration ; and when I put 
a gaudy-coloured one as a shawl about Ins child, he said that he 
would send for all his people to make a dance about it. In 
telling them that my object was to open up a path, whereby they 
might, by getting merchandize for ivory, avoid the guilt of selling 
their children, I asked Monze, with about 150 of his men, if they 
would like a white man to live amongst them and teach them. 
All expressed high satisfaction at the prospect of the white man 
and his path : they would protect both him and Ins property. I 
asked the question, because it would be of great importance to 
have stations in this healthy region, whither agents oppressed 
by sickness might retire, and which would serve, moreover, as 
part of a chain of communication between the interior and the 
coast. The answer does not mean much more than what I know, 
by other means, to be the case, — that a white man of good 
sense would be welcome and safe in all these parts. By upright- 
ness, and laying himself out for the good of the people, he 
would be known all over the country as a benefactor of the race. 
None desire Christian instruction, for of it they have no idea. 
But the people are now humbled by the scourgings they have 
received, and seem to be in a favourable state for the reception 
of the Gospel. The gradual restoration of their former pros- 
perity in cattle, simultaneously with instruction, would operate 
beneficially upon their minds. The language is a dialect of the 
other negro languages in the great valley; and as many of 
the Batoka living under the Makololo understand both it and 
the Sichuana, missionaries could soon acquire it through that 
medium. 

Monze had never been visited by any white man, but had seen 
black native traders, who, he said, came for ivory, not for slaves. 
He had heard of white men passing far to the east of him to 



556 BASHUKULOMPO HAIR-DRESSING. Chap. XXVII. 

Cazembe, referring, no doubt, to Pereira, Lacerda, and others, 
who have visited that chief. 

The streams in this part are not perennial ; I did not observe 
one suitable for the purpose of irrigation. There is but little 
wood ; here and there you see large single trees, or small clumps 
of evergreens, but the abundance of maize and ground-nuts we met 
with, shows that more rain falls than in the Bechuana country, 
for there they never attempt to raise maize, except hi damp 
hollows on the banks of rivers. The pasturage is very fine for 
both cattle and sheep. My own men, who know the land 
thoroughly, declare that it is all garden-ground together, and 
that the more tender grains, winch require richer soil than the 
native corn, need no care here. It is seldom stony. 

The men of a village came to our encampment, and, as they 
followed the Bashukulompo mode of dressing their hair, we had 
an opportunity of examining it for the first time. A circle of 
hair at the top of the head, eight inches or more in diameter, is 
woven into a cone eight or ten inches high, with an obtuse apex, 
bent, in some cases, a little forward, giving it somewhat the 
appearance of a helmet. Some have only a cone, four or H\e 
inches in diameter at the base. It is said that the hair of ani- 
mals is added, but the sides of the cone are woven something like 
basket-work. The headman of tins village, instead of having 
Ins brought to a point, had it prolonged into a wand, winch 
extended a full yard from the crown of his head. The hair on 
the forehead, above the ears, and behind, is all shaven off, so 
they appear somewhat as if a cap of liberty were cocked upon the 
top of the head. After the weaving is performed it is said to be 
painful, as the scalp is drawn tightly up ; but they become used 
to it. Monze informed me that all Ins people were formerly 
ornamented in this way, but he discouraged it. I wished him to 
discourage the practice of knocking out the teeth, too, but he 
smiled, as if in that case the fashion would be too strong for him, 
as it was for Sebituane. 

Monze came on Monday morning, and, on parting, presented 
us with a piece of a buffalo which had been killed the day 
before by lions. We crossed the rivulet Makoe, which runs west- 
ward into the Kafue, and went northwards in order to visit 
Semalembue, an influential chief there. We slept at the village

of Monze's sister, who also passes by the same name. Both he 
and his sister are feminine in their appearance, but disfigured by 
the foolish custom of knocking out the upper front teeth. 

It is not often that jail-birds turn out well, but the first person 
who appeared to welcome us at the village of Monze's sister, was 
the prisoner we had released in the way. He came with a 
handsome present of com and meal, and, after praising our kind- 
ness to the villagers who had assembled around us, asked them, 
" What do you stand gazing at ? don't you know that they have 



558 DIP OF ROCKS. Chap. XXVII. 

mouths like other people ? " He then set off and brought large 
bundles of grass and wood for our comfort, and a pot to cook 
our food in. 

December 12th. — The morning presented the appearance of a 
continuous rain from the north, the first time we had seen it 
set in from that quarter in such a southern latitude. In the 
Bechuana country, continuous rains are always from the north- 
east or east, while in Londa and Angola they are from the north. 
At Pungo Andongo, for instance, the whitewash is all removed 
from the north side of the houses. It cleared up, however, about 
midday, and Monze's sister conducted us a mile or two upon the 
road. On parting, she said that she had forwarded orders to a 
distant village, to send food to the point where we should sleep. 
In expressing her joy at the prospect of living in peace, she said 
it would be so pleasant " to sleep without dreaming of any one 
pursuing them with a spear." 

In our front we had ranges of hills called Chamai, covered with 
trees. We crossed the rivulet Nakachinta, flowing eastwards 
into the Zambesi, and then passed over ridges of rocks of the 
same mica schist which we found so abundant in Golungo Alto ; 
here they were surmounted by reddish porphyry and finely lami- 
nated felspathic grit with trap. The dip, however, of these rocks, 
is not towards the centre of the continent as in Angola, for 
ever since we passed the masses of granite on the Kalomo, 
the rocks, chiefly of mica schist, dip away from them, taking an 
easterly direction. A decided change of dip occurs again when 
we come near the Zambesi, as will be noticed further on. The 
hills winch flank that river, now appeared on our right as a high 
dark range, while those near the Kafue, have the aspect of a low 
blue range, with openings between. We crossed two never-failing 
rivulets also flowing into the Kafue. The country is very fertile, 
but vegetation is nowhere rank. The boiling point of water 
being 204°, showed that we were not yet as low down as Linyanti ; 
but we had left the masuka-trees behind us, and many others 
with which we had become familiar. A feature common to the 
forests of Angola and Benguela, namely the presence of orchilla- 
weed and lichens on the trees, with mosses on the ground, began 
to appear ; but we never, on any part of the eastern slope, saw 
the abundant crops of ferns which are met with everywhere in 



Chap. XXVII. BIRDS AND RAIN. 559 

Angola. The orchilla-weed and mosses, too, were in but small 
quantities. 

As we passed along, the people continued to supply us with food 
in great abundance. They had by some means or other got a 
knowledge that I carried medicine, and somewhat to the disgust 
of my men, who wished to keep it all to themselves, brought 
their sick children for cure. Some of them I found had hooping- 
cough, which is one of the few epidemics that range through this 
country. 

In passing through the woods, I, for the first time, heard the 
bird called Mokwa reza, or "Son-in-law of God" (Micropogon 
sulphuratus ?), utter its cry, which is supposed by the natives to be 
" pula, pula " (rain, rain). It is said to do this only before heavy 
falls of rain. It may be a cuckoo, for it is said to throw out the eggs 
of the white-backed Senegal crow, and lay its own instead. This, 
combined with the cry for rain, causes the bird to be regarded 
with favour. The crow, on the other hand, has a bad repute, and 
when rain is withheld, its nest is sought for and destroyed, in 
order to dissolve the charm by which it is supposed to seal up 
the windows of heaven. All the other birds now join in full 
chorus in the mornings ; and two of them, at least, have fine loud 
notes.

13^. — The country is becoming very beautiful, and furrowed 
by deep valleys ; the underlying rocks, being igneous, have yielded 
fertile soil. There is great abundance of large game. The 
buffaloes select open spots, and often eminences, as standing- 
places through the day. We crossed the Mbai, and found in its 
bed, rocks of pink marble. Some little lulls near it are capped 
by marble of beautiful whiteness, the underlying rock being 
igneous. Violent showers occur frequently on the lulls, and cause 
such sudden sweeping floods in these rivulets, that five of our 
men, who had gone to the other side for firewood, were obliged to 
swim back. The temperature of the air is lowered considerably 
by the daily rains. Several times the thermometer at sunrise 
has been as low as 68°, and 74° at sunset Generally, how- 
ever, it stood at from 72° to 74° at sunrise, 90° to 96° at midday, 
and 80° to 84° at sunset. The sensation, however, as before 
remarked, was not disagreeable. 

Mth. — We entered a most beautiful valley, abounding in large 



.Chap. XXVIII. ELEPHANT-HUNTING. 561 

game. Finding a buffalo lying down, I went to secure him for 
our food. Three balls did not kill him, and, as he turned round 
as if for a charge, we ran for the shelter of some rocks. Before 
we gained them, we found that three elephants, probably attracted 
by the strange noise, had cut off our retreat on that side : they, 
however, turned short off, and allowed us to gain the rocks. We 
then saw that the buffalo was moving off quite briskly, and in 
order not to be entirely balked, I tried a long shot at the last of 
the elephants, and, to the great joy of my people, broke his fore- 
leg. The young men soon brought him to a stand, and one shot 
in the brain despatched him. I was right glad to see the joy 
manifested at such an abundant supply of meat. 

On the following day, while my men were cutting up the 
elephant, great numbers of the villagers came to enjoy the feast. 
We were on the side of a fine green valley, studded here and 
there with trees, and cut by numerous rivulets. I had retired 
from the noise, to take an observation among some rocks of 
laminated grit, when I beheld an elephant and her calf at the 
end of the valley, about two miles distant. The calf was rolling 
in the mud, and the dam was standing fanning herself with her 
great ears. As I looked at them through my glass, I saw a long 
string of my own men appearing on the other side of them, 
and Sekwebu came and told me that these had gone off, saying, 
" Our father will see to-day what sort of men he has got." I 
then went higher up the side of the valley, in order to have a dis- 
tinct view of their mode of hunting. The goodly beast, totally 
unconscious of the approach of an enemy, stood for some time 
suckling her young one, which seemed about two years old ; they 
then went into a pit containing mud, and smeared themselves 
all over with it, the little one frisking about his dam, napping his 
ears and tossing his trunk incessantly, in elephantine fashion. 
She kept flapping her ears and wagging her tail, as if in the 
height of enjoyment. Then began the piping of her enemies, 
which was performed by blowing into a tube, or the hands closed 
together, as boys do into a key. They call out to attract the 
animal's attention — 

" chief! chief! we have come to kill you. 
chief ! chief ! many more will die besides you, &c. 
The gods have said it," &c. &c. 

2 o

Both animals expanded their ears and listened, then left their 
bath as the crowd rushed towards them. The little one ran for- 
ward towards the end of the valley, but, seeing the men there, 
returned to his dam. She placed herself on the danger side of 
her calf, and passed her proboscis over it again and again, as if to 
assure it of safety. She frequently looked back to the men, who 
kept up an incessant shouting, singing, and piping ; then looked 
at her young one and ran after it, sometimes sideways, as if her 
feelings were divided between anxiety to protect her offspring, and 
desire to revenge the temerity of her persecutors. The men kept 
about a hundred yards in her rear, and some, that distance from 
her flanks, and continued thus until she was obliged to cross a 
rivulet. The time spent in descending and getting up the oppo- 
site bank, allowed of their coming up to the edge, and dis- 
charging their spears at about twenty yards distance. After the 
first discharge, she appeared with her sides red with blood, and, 
beginning to flee for her own life, seemed to think no more of her 
young. I had previously sent off Sekwebu with orders to spare 
the calf. It ran very fast, but neither young nor old ever enter 
into a gallop ; their quickest pace is only a sharp walk. Before 
Sekwebu could reach them, the calf had taken refuge in the water, 
and was killed. The pace of the dam gradually became slower. 
She turned with a shriek of rage, and made a furious charge back 
among the men. They vanished at right angles to her course, or 
sideways, and, as she ran straight on, she went through the whole 
party, but came near no one, except a man who wore a piece of 
cloth on his shoulders. Bright clothing is always dangerous in 
these cases. She charged three or four times, and, except in the 
first instance, never went farther than 100 yards. She often stood 
after she had crossed a rivulet, and faced the men, though she 
received fresh spears. It was by this process of spearing and loss 
of blood that she was killed, for at last, making a short charge, 
she staggered round and sank down dead in a kneeling posture. 
I did not see the whole hunt, having been tempted away by 
both sun and moon appearing unclouded. I turned from the 
spectacle of the destruction of noble animals, which might be made 
so useful in Africa, with a feeling of sickness, and it was not re- 
lieved by the recollection that the ivory was mine, though that 
was the case. I regretted to see them killed, and more especially 



Chap. XXYIII. MODE OF MEASURING ELEPHANTS. 563 

the young one, the meat not being at all necessary at that time ; 
but it is right to add, that I did not feel sick when my own blood 
was up the day before. We ought perhaps to judge those deeds 
more leniently in which we ourselves have no temptation to 
engage. Had I not been previously guilty of doing the very same 
thing, I might have prided myself on superior humanity, when 
I experienced the nausea in viewing my men kill these two. 

The elephant first killed was a male, not full grown ; his height 
at the withers 8 feet 4 inches; circumference of the fore foot 
44 inches X 2 = 7 feet 4 inches. The female was full grown, 
and measured in height 8 feet 8 inches ; circumference of the fore 
foot 48 inches x 2 = 8 feet (96 inches). We afterwards found, 
that full-grown male elephants of this region ranged in height at 
the withers from 9 feet 9 inches to 9 feet 10 inches ; and the cir- 
cumference of the fore foot to be 4 feet 9 J inches x 2 = 9 feet 
7 inches. These details are given because the general rule has 
been observed, that twice the circumference of the impression 
made by the fore foot on the ground, is the height of the animal. 
The print on the ground being a little larger than the foot itself, 
would thus seem to be an accurate mode of measuring the size 
of any elephant that has passed; but the above measurements 
show, that it is applicable only to full-grown animals. The 
greater size of the African elephant in the south, would at once 
distinguish it from the Indian one ; but here they approach 
more nearly to each other in bulk, a female being about as large 
as a common Indian male. But the ear of the African is an 
external mark which no one will mistake even in a picture. 
That of the female now killed, was 4 feet 5 inches in depth, and 
4 feet in horizontal breadth. I have seen a native creep under 
one so as to be quite covered from the rain. The ear of the 
Indian variety is not more than a third of this size. The repre- 
sentation of elephants on ancient coins shows that this important 
characteristic was distinctly recognised of old. Indeed, Cuvier 
remarked that it was better known by Aristotle than by Buffon. 

Having been anxious to learn whether the African elephant 
is capable of being tamed, through the kindness of my friend 
Admiral Smyth, I am enabled to give the reader conclusive evi- 
dence on this point. In the two medals furnished from his work, 
1 A descriptive Catalogue of his Cabinet of Roman and Imperial

564 WILD ANIMALS SMALLER Chap. XXYIII. 





large brass Medals,' the size of the ears will be at once noted as 
those of the true African elephant. They were even more docile 
than the Asiatic, and were taught various feats, as walking on ropes, 
dancing, &c. One of the coins is of Faustina senior, the other 
of Septimius Severus, and struck a.d. 197. These elephants 
were brought from Africa to Kome. The attempt to tame this 
most useful animal has never been made at the Cape, nor has 
one ever been exhibited in England. There is only one very 
young calf of the species in the British Museum. 

The abundance of food in this country, as compared with the 
south, would lead one to suppose that animals here must attain a 
much greater size; but actual measurement now confirms the 
impression made on my mind by the mere sight of the animals, 
that those in the districts north of 20° were smaller than 
the same races existing southward of that latitude. The first 
time that Mr. Oswell and myself saw full-grown male elephants 
on the river Zouga, they seemed no larger than the females, 
(winch are always smaller than males,) we had met on the 
Limpopo. There they attain a height of upwards of 12 feet. At 
the Zouga the height of one I measured was 11 feet 4 inches, and 
in this district 9 feet 10 inches. There is, however, an increase 
in the size of the tusks as we approach the equator. Unfortu- 
nately, I never made measurements of other animals in the south ; 
but the appearance of the animals themselves in the north, at once 
produced the impression on my mind referred to, as to their 
decrease in size. When we first saw koodoos, they were so much 
smaller than those we had been accustomed to in the south, that 
we doubted whether they were not a new kind of antelope ; and 
the leche, seen nowhere south of 20°, is succeeded by the poku as 
we go north. This is, in fact, only a smaller species of that ante- 



Chap. XXVIII. WHERE FOOD MOST ABUNDANT. 565 

lope, with a more reddish colour. A great difference in size 
prevails also among domestic animals ; but the influence of locality 
on them is not so well marked. The cattle of the Batoka, for 
instance, are exceedingly small and very beautiful, possessing 
generally great breadth between the eyes and a very playful 
disposition. They are much smaller than the aboriginal cattle 
in the south ; but it must be added that those of the Barotse 
valley, in the same latitudes as the Batoka, are large. The breed 
may have come from the west, as the cattle within the influence 
of the sea air, as at Little Fish Bay, Benguela, Ambriz, and along 
that coast, are very large. Those found at Lake Ngami, with large 
horns and standing 6 feet high, probably come from the same 
quarter. The goats are also small, and domestic fowls throughout 
tins country are of a very small size, and even dogs, except where 
the inhabitants have had an opportunity of improving the breed 
by importation from the Portuguese. As the Barotse cattle are an 
exception to this general rule, so are the Barotse dogs, for they 
are large savage-looking animals, though in reality very cowardly. 
It is a little remarkable, that a decrease in size should occur where 
food is the most abundant ; but tropical climates seem unfavourable 
for the full development of either animals or man. It is not from 
want of care in the breeding, for the natives always choose the 
larger and stronger males for stock, and the same arrangement 
prevails in nature, for it is only by overcoming their weaker rivals, 
that the wild males obtain possession of the herd. Invariably they 
show the scars received in battle. The elephant we killed yester- 
day had an umbilical hernia as large as a child's head, probably 
caused by the charge of a rival. The cow showed scars received 
from men ; two of the wounds in her side were still unhealed, and 
there was an orifice six inches long and open in her proboscis, and, 
as it was about a foot from the point, it must have interfered with 
her power of lifting water. 

In estimating the amount of food necessary for these and other 
large animals, sufficient attention has not been paid to the kinds 
chosen. The elephant, for instance, is a most dainty feeder, and 
particularly fond of certain sweet-tasted trees and fruits. He 
chooses the mohonono, the mimosa, and other trees which con- 
tain much saccharine matter, mucilage, and gum. He may be 
seen putting his head to a lofty palmyra, and swaying it to and fro 



566 GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE. Chap. XXVIII. 

to shake off the seeds ; he then picks them up singly and eats 
them. Or he may be seen standing by the masnka and other fruit 
trees, patiently picking off the sweet fruits one by one. He also 
digs up bulbs and tubers, but none of these are thoroughly digested. 
Bruce remarked upon the undigested bits of wood seen in their 
droppings, and he must have observed, too, that neither leaves nor 
seeds are changed, by passing through the alimentary canal. The 
woody fibre of roots and branches is dropped in the state of tow, 
the nutritious matter alone having been extracted. This capa- 
bility of removing all the nourishment, and the selection of those 
kinds of food which contain great quantities of mucilage and gum, 
accounts for the fact that herds of elephants produce but small 
effect upon the vegetation of a country — quality being more 
requisite than quantity. The amount of internal fat found in 
them makes them much prized by the inhabitants, who are all 
very fond of it, both for food and ointment. 

After leaving the elephant valley, we passed though a very 
beautiful country, but thinly inhabited by man. The underlying 
rock is trap, and dykes of talcose gneiss. The trap is often seen 
tilted on its edge, or dipping a little either to the north or 
south. The strike is generally to the N.E., the direction we are 
going. About Losito we found the trap had given place to 
hornblende schist, mica schist, and various schorly rocks. We 
had now come into the region, in which the appearance of the 
rocks, conveys the impression of a great force having acted along 
the bed of the Zambesi. Indeed I was led to the belief, from 
seeing the manner in which the rocks have been thrust away on 
both sides from its bed, that the power winch formed the crack of 
the falls, had given direction to the river below, and opened a bed 
for it all the way from the falls to beyond the gorge of Lupata. 

Passing the rivulet Losito, and through the ranges of hills, 
we reached the residence of Semalembue on the 18th. His 
village is situated at the bottom of ranges through which the 
Kafue finds a passage, and close to the bank of that river. The 
Kafue, sometimes called Kahowhe or Bashukulompo river, is 
upwards of 200 yards wide here, and full of hippopotami, the 
young of which may be seen perched on the necks of their 
dams. At this point we had reached about the same level as 
Linyanti. 



Chap. XXVHI. SEMALEMBUE AND HIS PEOPLE. 567 

Semalembue paid us a visit soon after our arrival, and said 
that he had often heard of me, and now that he had the pleasure 
of seeing me, he feared that I should sleep the first night at 
Ins village hungry. This was considered the handsome way of 
introducing a present, for he then handed Bye or six baskets 
of meal and maize, and an enormous one of ground-nuts. Next 
morning he gave about twenty baskets more of meal. I could 
make but a poor return for his kindness, but he accepted my 
apologies politely, saying that he knew there were no goods in 
the country from which I had come, and, in professing great joy 
at the words of peace I spoke, he said, " Now I shall cultivate 
largely, in the hope of eating and sleeping in peace." It is 
noticeable that all whom we have yet met, eagerly caught up the 
idea of living in peace as the probable effect of the gospel. They 
require no explanation of the existence of the Deity. Sekwebu 
makes use of the term " Eeza," and they appear to understand at 
once. Like negroes in general, they have a strong tendency to 
worship, and I heard that Semalembue gets a good deal of ivory 
from the surrounding tribes, on pretence of having some super- 
natural power. He transmits this to some other chiefs on the 
Zambesi, and receives in return English cotton goods which 
come from Mozambique by Babisa traders. My men here began 
to sell their beads and other ornaments for cotton cloth. Sema- 
lembue was accompanied by about forty people, all large men. 
They have much wool on their heads, which is sometimes drawn 
all together up to the crown, and tied there in a large tapering 
bunch. The forehead, and round by the ears, is shaven close to 
the base of this tuft. Others draw out the hair on one side, and 
twist it into little strings. The rest is taken over, and hangs 
above the ear, which gives the appearance of having a cap 
cocked jauntily on the side of the head. 

The mode of salutation is by clapping the hands. Various 
parties of women came from the surrounding villages to see the 
white man, but all seemed very much afraid. Their fear, which I 
seldom could allay, made them, when addressed, clap their hands 
with increasing vigour. Sekwebu was the only one of the 
Makololo who knew this part of the country ; and this was the 
region which to his mind was best adapted for the residence of a 
tribe. The natives generally have a good idea of the nature 



568 . THE KAFUE. Chap. XXVIII. 

of the soil and pasturage, and Sekwebu expatiated with great 
eloquence on the capabilities of this part for supplying the wants 
of the Makololo. There is certainly abundance of room at present 
in the country for thousands and thousands more of population. 

We passed near the Losito, a former encampment of the 
M atebele, with whom Sekwebu had lived. At the sight of the 
bones of the oxen they had devoured, and the spot where savage 
dances had taken place, though all deserted now, the poor fellow 
burst out into a wild Matebele song. He pointed out also a 
district about two days and a half west of Semalembue, where 
Sebituane had formerly dwelt. There is a hot fountain on the 
hills there, named "Nakalombo," which may be seen at a 
distance, emitting steam. "There," said Sekwebu, "had your 
Molekane (Sebituane) been alive, he would have brought you to 
live with him. You would be on the bank of the river, and by 
taking canoes you would at once sail down to the Zambesi and 
visit the white people at the sea." 

This part is a favourite one with the Makololo, and probably it 
would be a good one in which to form a centre of civilization. 
There is a large flat district of country to the north, said to be 
peopled by the Bashukulompo and other tribes, who cultivate the 
ground to a great extent, and raise vast quantities of grain, 
ground-nuts, sweet potatoes, &c. They also grow sugar-cane. If 
they were certain of a market, I believe they would not be unwill- 
ing to cultivate cotton too, but they have not been accustomed to 
the peaceful pursuits of commerce. All are fond of trade, but 
they have been taught none, save that in ivory and slaves. 

The Kafue enters a narrow gorge close by the village of 
Semalembue ; as the hill on the north is called Bolengwe, I apply 
that name to the gorge (lat. 15° 48' 19" S., long. 28° 22' E.). 
Semalembue said, that he ought to see us over the river, so he 
accompanied us to a pass about a mile south of his village, and 
when we entered among the hills, we found the ford of the 
Kafue. On parting with Semalembue I put on him a shirt, and 
he went away with it apparently much delighted. 

The ford was at least 250 yards broad, but rocky and shallow. 
After crossing it in a canoe we went along the left bank, and 
were completely shut in by high hills. Every available spot 
between the river and the hills is under cultivation; and the 
residence of the people here is intended to secure safety for

themselves and their gardens from their enemies; there is 
plenty of garden-ground outside the hills ; here they are obliged 
to make pitfalls, to protect the grain against the hippopotami. 
As these animals had not been disturbed by guns, they were 
remarkably tame, and took no notice of our passing. We again 
saw numbers of young ones, not much larger than terrier dogs, 
sitting on the necks of their dams, the little saucy-looking heads 
cocking up between the old one's ears; as they become a 
little older, they sit on the withers. Needing meat, we shot a 
full-grown cow, and found, as we had often done before, the flesh 
to be very much like pork. The height of this animal was 4 feet 
10 inches, and from the point of the nose to the root of the tail 
10 feet 6. They seem quarrelsome, for both males and females 
are found covered with scars, and young males are often killed by 
the elder ones : we met an instance of this near the falls. 

We came to a great many little villages among the hills, as if 
the inhabitants had reason to hide themselves from the observa- 
tion of their enemies. While detained cutting up the hippo- 
potamus, I ascended a hill called Mabue asula (stones smell badly), 
and though not the highest in sight, it was certainly not 100 feet 
lower than the most elevated. The boiling point of water showed 
it to be about 900 feet above the river, which was of the 
level of Linyanti. These hills seemed to my men of prodigious 
altitude, for they had been accustomed to ant-hills only. The 
mention of mountains that pierced the clouds, made them draw in 
their breath and hold their hands to their mouths. And when I 
told them that their previous description of Taba cheu had led 
me to expect something of the sort, I found that the idea of a 
cloud-capped mountain had never entered into their heads. The 
mountains certainly look high, from having abrupt sides. But 
I had recognised the fact by the point of ebullition of water, 
that they are of a considerably lower altitude than the top of the 
ridge we had left. They constitute in fact a sort of low fringe on 
the outside of the eastern ridge, exactly as the (apparently) high 
mountains of Angola (Golungo Alto) form an outer low fringe to 
the western ridge. I was much struck by the similarity of con- 
formation and nature of the rocks on both sides of the continent. 
But there is a difference in the structure of the subtending 
ridges, as may be understood by the annexed ideal geological 
section. 



570 GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Chap. XXVIII. 

We can see from this hill five distinct ranges, of which Bolengo 
is the most westerly, and Komanga is the most easterly. The 
second is named Sekonkamena, and the third Funze. Very many 
conical hills appear among them, and they are generally covered 
with trees. On then tops we have beautiful white quartz rocks, 
and some have a capping of dolomite. On the west of the 
second range we have great masses of kyanite or disthene, and 
on the flanks of the third and fourth a great deal of specular 
iron-ore which is magnetic, and rounded pieces of black iron- 
ore, also strongly magnetic, and containing a very large per- 
centage of the metal. The sides of these ranges are generally 
very precipitous, and there are rivulets between, which are 
not perennial. Many of the hills have been raised by granite, 
exactly like that of the Kalomo. Dykes of this granite, may 
be seen thrusting up immense masses of mica schist and quartz 
or sandstone schist, and making the strata fold over them on 
each side, as clothes hung upon a line. The uppermost stratum 
is always dolomite, or bright white quartz. Semalembue intended 
that we should go a little to the north-east, and pass through the 
people called Babimpe, and we saw some of that people, who 
invited us to come that way on account of its being smoother ; but 
feeling anxious to get back to the Zambesi again, we decided to 
cross the hills towards its confluence with the Kafue. The distance, 
which in a straight line is but small, occupied three days. The 
precipitous nature of the sides of this mass of hills, knocked up 
the oxen and forced us to slaughter two, one of which, a very large 
one and ornamented with upwards of thirty pieces of its own 
skin detached and hanging down, Sekeletu had wished us to take 
to the white people as a specimen of his cattle. We saw many 
elephants among the hills, and my men ran off and killed three. 
When we came to the top of the outer range of the hills, we had a 
glorious view. At a short distance below us we saw the Kafue, 
wending away over a forest-clad plain to the confluence, and on 
the other side of the Zambesi beyond that, lay a long range of dark 
hills. A line of fleecy clouds appeared lying along the course of 
that river at their base. The plain below us, at the left of the 
Kafue, had more large game on it than anywhere else I had seen 
in Africa. Hundreds of buffaloes and zebras grazed on the open 
spaces, and there stood lordly elephants feeding majestically,

nothing moving apparently but the proboscis. I wished that I 
had been able to take a photograph of a scene, so seldom beheld, 
and winch is destined, as guns increase, to pass away from earth. 
When we descended we found all the animals remarkably tame. 
The elephants stood beneath the trees, fanning themselves with 
their large ears, as if they did not see us at 200 or 300 yards 
distance. The number of animals was quite astonishing, and 
made me think, that here I could realize an image of that time, 
when Megatheria fed undisturbed in the primeval forests. We 
saw great numbers of red-coloured pigs (Potamochoerus), standing 
gazing at us in wonder. The people live on the hills, and, 
having no guns, seldom disturb the game. They have never 
been visited, even by half-castes ; but Babisa traders have come 
occasionally. Continuous rains kept us for some time on the 
banks of the Chiponga, and here we were unfortunate enough to 
come among the tsetse. Mr. I. E. Gray, of the British Museum, 
has kindly obliged me with a drawing of the insect, with the 
ravages of which I have unfortunately been too familiar. (For 
description see pp. 80-83.) No. 1 is the insect somewhat smaller

insect magnified ; and No. 3 shows the magnified proboscis and

We tried to leave one morning, but the rain coming on 
afresh brought us to a stand, and after waiting an hour, wet 
to the skin, we were fain to retrace our steps to our sheds. 
These rains were from the east, and the clouds might be seen 
on the hills, exactly as the " Table-cloth " on Table Mountain. 
This was the first wetting we had got since we left Sesheke, for I 
had gained some experience in travelling. In Londa we braved 
the rain, and as I despised being carried in our frequent passage 
through rumn'ug water, I was pretty constantly drenched; but 
now, when we saw a storm coming, we invariably halted. The 
men soon pulled grass sufficient to make a little shelter for them- 
selves by placing it on a bush, and having got my camp-stool and 
umbrella, with a little grass under my feet, I kept myself perfectly 
dry. We also lighted large fires, and the men were not chilled by 
streams of water running down their persons, and abstracting the 
heat, as they would have been had they been exposed to the rain. 
When it was over, they warmed themselves by the fires, and we 
travelled on comfortably. The effect of this care was, that we had 
much less sickness than with a smaller party in journeying to 
Loanda. Another improvement made from my experience, was 
avoiding an entire change of diet. In going to Loanda I took 
little or no European food, in order not to burden my men and 
make them lose spirit, but trusted entirely to what might be got 
by the gun, and the liberality of the Balonda ; but on this journey 
I took some flour which had been left in the waggon, with some 
got on the island, and baked my own bread all the way in an 
extemporaneous oven made by an inverted pot. With these 
precautions, aided, no doubt, by the greater healthiness of the 
district over which we passed, I enjoyed perfect health. 

When we left the Chiponga on the 30th we passed along the 
range of hills on our left, which are composed of mica and 
clay-slate. At the bottom we found a forest of large silicified 
trees, all lying as if the elevation of the range had made them 
fall away from it, and towards the river. An ordinary-sized tree, 
standing on end, measured 22 inches in diameter: there were 
12 laminae to the inch. These are easily counted, because there 
is usually a scale of pure silica between each, which has not been 



Chap. XXVIII. CHARGE OF AN ELEPHANT. 573 

so much affected by the weather as the rest of the ring itself: 
the edges of the rings thus stand out plainly. Mr. Quekett, hav- 
ing kindly examined some specimens, finds that it is " silicified 
coniferous wood of the Akaucakian type ; and the nearest allied 
wood that he knows of is that found, also in a fossil state, in 
New South Wales." The numbers of large game were quite 
astonishing. I never saw elephants so tame as those near the 
Chiponga : they stood close to our path without being the least 
afraid. This is different from their conduct where they have 
been accustomed to guns, for there they take alarm at the dis- 
tance of a mile, and begin to run if a shot is fired even at a 
longer distance. My men killed another here, and rewarded the 
villagers of the Chiponga for their liberality in meal, by loading 
them with flesh. We spent a night at a baobab, which was hollow 
and would hold twenty men inside. It had been used as a lodging- 
house by the Babisa. 

As we approached nearer the Zambesi, the country became 
covered with broad-leaved bushes, pretty thickly planted, and we 
had several times to shout to elephants to get out of our way. 
At an open space, a herd of buffaloes came trotting up to look at 
our oxen, and it was only by shooting one that I made them 
retreat. The meat is very much like that of an ox, and this one 
was very fine. The only danger we actually encountered was 
from a female elephant, with three young ones of different sizes. 
Charging through the centre of our extended line, and causing 
the men to throw down their burdens in a great hurry, she 
received a spear for her temerity. I never saw an elephant with 
more than one calf before. We knew that we were near our 
Zambesi again, even before the great river burst upon our sight, 
by the numbers of water-fowl we met. I killed four geese with 
two shots, and, had I followed the wishes of my men, could 
have secured a meal of water-fowl for the whole party. I never 
saw a river with so much animal life around and in it, and, as the 
Barotse say, " Its fish and fowl are always fat." When our eyes 
were gladdened by a view of its goodly broad waters, we found it 
very much larger than it is even above the falls. One might try 
to make his voice heard across it in vain. Its flow was more rapid 
than near Sesheke, being often four and a half miles an hour, and, 
what I never saw before, the water was discoloured and of a deep 



574 THE ZAMBESI— ISLAND OF MENYE. Chap. XXVIII. 

brownish red. In the great valley, the Leeambye never becomes 
of this colour. The adjacent country, so far north as is known, is 
all level, and the soil, being generally covered with dense herbage, 
is not abraded ; but on the eastern ridge the case is different ; 
the grass is short, and, the elevation being great, the soil is washed 
down by the streams, and hence the discoloration which we now 
view. The same thing was observed on the western ridge. We 
never saw discoloration till we reached the Quango; that ob- 
tained its matter from the western slope of the western ridge, 
just as this part of the Zambesi receives its soil from the eastern 
slope of the eastern ridge. It carried a considerable quantity of 
wreck of reeds, sticks, and trees. We struck upon the river 
about eight miles east of the confluence with the Kafue, and 
thereby missed a sight of that interesting point. The cloudiness 
of the weather was such, that but few observations could be made 
for determining our position, so, pursuing our course, we went 
down the left bank, and came opposite the island of Menye mak- 
aba. The Zambesi contains numerous islands ; this was about a 
mile and a half or two miles long, and upwards of a quarter of 
a mile broad. Besides human population, it has a herd of buffa- 
loes that never leave it. In the distance they seemed to be 
upwards of sixty. The human and brute inhabitants understand 
each other ; for when the former think they ought to avenge the 
liberties committed on their gardens, the leaders of the latter 
come out boldly to give battle. They told us that the only time 
in winch they can thin them, is when the river is full and part of 
the island flooded. They then attack them from their canoes. 
The comparatively small space to which they have confined 
themselves, shows how luxuriant the vegetation of this region is ; 
for were they in want of more pasture, as buffaloes can swim well 
and the distance from this bank to the island is not much more 
than 200 yards, they might easily remove hither. The opposite 
bank is much more distant. 

Kanges of hills appear now to run parallel with the Zambesi, 
and are about fifteen miles apart. Those on the north approach 
nearest to the river. The inhabitants on that side are the 
Batonga, those on the south bank are the Banyai. The lulls 
abound in buffaloes, and elephants are numerous, and many are 
killed by the people on both banks. They erect stages on 



Chap. XXVIII. DEVICES FOE KILLING GAME. 575 

high trees overhanging the paths by which the elephants come, 
and then use a large spear with a handle nearly as thick as a 
man's wrist, and four or five feet long. When the animal comes 
beneath they throw the spear, and if it enters between the ribs 
above, as the blade is at least twenty inches long by two broad, 
the motion of the handle, as it is aided by knocking against 
the trees, makes frightful gashes within, and soon causes death. 
They kill them also by means of a spear, inserted in a beam of 
wood, which, being suspended on the branch of a tree by a cord 
attached to a latch fastened in the path, and intended to be 
struck by the animal's foot, leads to the fall of the beam, and, 
the spear being poisoned, causes death in a few hours. 

We were detained by continuous rains several days at this 
island. The clouds rested upon the tops of the lulls as they came 
from the eastward, and then poured down plenteous showers on 
the valleys below. As soon as we could move, Tomba Nyama, 
the head-man of the island, volunteered the loan of a canoe to 
cross a small river, called the Chongwe, which we found to be 
about fifty or sixty yards broad and flooded. All this part of the 
country was well known to Sekwebu, and he informed us that, 
when he passed through it as a boy, the inhabitants possessed 
abundance of cattle, and there were no tsetse. The existence of 
the insect now, shows that it may return in company with the 
larger game. The vegetation along the bank was exceedingly 
rank, and the bushes so tangled that it was difficult to get on. 
The paths had been made by the wild animals alone, for the 
general pathway of the people is the river, in their canoes. We 
usually followed the footpaths of the game, and of these there 
was no lack. Buffaloes, zebras, pallahs, and waterbucks abound, 
and there is also a great abundance of wild pigs, koodoos, and 
the black antelope. We got one buffalo, as he was rolling him- 
self in a pool of mud. He had a large piece of skin torn off his 
flank, it was believed by an alhgator. 

We were struck by the fact that, as soon as we came between 
the ranges of hills which flank the Zambesi, the rains felt warm. 
At sunrise the thermometer stood at from 82° to 86° ; at midday, in 
the coolest shade, namely, in my little tent, under a shady tree, at 
96° to 98° ; and at sunset it was 86°. This is different from any- 
thing we experienced in the interior, for these rains always bring 



576 AN ALBINO MURDERED BY HIS MOTHER. Chap. XXVIII. 

down the mercury to 72° or even 68°. There, too, we found a 
small black coleopterous insect, which stung like the mosquito, 
but injected less poison ; it put us in mind of that insect, which 
does not exist in the high lands we had left. 

January 6th, 1856. — Each village we passed, furnished us with 
a couple of men to take us to the next. They were useful in 
showing us the parts lea-t covered with jungle. When we came 
near a village, we saw men, women, and children employed in 
weeding their gardens, they being great agriculturists. Most 
of the men are muscular, and have large ploughman hands. 
Their colour is the same admixture, from very dark, to light olive, 
that we saw in Londa. Though all have thick lips and flat noses, 
only the more degraded of the population possess the ugly negro 
physiognomy. They mark themselves by a line of little raised 
cicatrices, each of winch is a quarter of an inch long; they 
extend from the tip of the nose to the root of the hair on the 
forehead. It is remarkable that I never met with an Albino in 
crossing Africa, though, from accounts published by the Por- 
tuguese, I was led to expect that they were held in favour as 
doctors by certain chiefs. I saw several in the south : one at Kuru- 
man is a full-grown woman, and a man having this peculiarity 
of skin, was met with in the colony. Their bodies are always 
blistered on exposure to the sun, as the skin is more tender than 
that of the blacks. The Kuruman woman lived some time at 
Kolobeng, and generally had on her bosom and shoulders the 
remains of large blisters. She was most anxious to be made 
black, but nitrate of silver, taken internally, did not produce its 
usual effect. During the time I resided at Mabotsa, a woman 
came to the station with a fine boy, an Albino. The father had 
ordered her to throw him away, but she clung to her offspring 
for many years. He was remarkably intelligent for his age. The 
pupil of the eye was of a pink colour, and the eye itself was 
unsteady in vision. The hair, or rather wool, was yellow, and the 
features were those common among the Bechuanas. After I left 
the place, the mother is said to have become tired of living apart 
from the father, who refused to have her while she retained the 
son. She took him out one day, and killed him close to the 
village of Mabotsa, and nothing was done to her by the authorities. 
From having met with no Albinos in Londa, I suspect they are 



Chap. XXVTTT. "TLOLO"— IDEA OF FEMALE BEAUTY. 577 

there also put to death. We saw one dwarf only in Londa, and 
brands on him showed he had once been a slave ; and there is one 
dwarf woman at Linyanti. The general absence of deformed 
persons, is partly owing to their destruction in infancy, and partly 
to the mode of life being a natural one, so far as ventilation 
and food are concerned. They use but few unwholesome mix- 
tures as condiments, and, though their undress exposes them to 
the vicissitudes of the temperature, it does not harbour vomites. 
It was observed, that, when smallpox and measles visited the 
country, they were most severe on the half-castes who were 
clothed. In several tribes a child winch is said to "tlola," 
transgress, is put to death. " Tlolo," or transgression, is ascribed 
to several curious cases. A child who cut the upper front teeth 
before the under, was always put to death among the Bakaa, 
and, I believe, also among the Bakwains. In some tribes, a case 
of twins renders one of them liable to death ; and an ox, which, 
while lying in the pen, beats the ground with its tail, is treated in 
the same way. It is thought to be calling death to visit the 
tribe, When I was coming through Londa, my men carried a 
great number of fowls, of a larger breed than any they had at 
home. If one crowed before midnight, it had been guilty of 
" tlolo," and was killed. The men often carried them sitting on 
their guns, and, if one began to crow in a forest, the owner would 
give it a beating, by way of teaching it not to be guilty of crowing 
at unseasonable hours. 

The women here are in the habit of piercing the upper lip, and 
gradually enlarging the orifice until they can insert a shell. The 
lip then appears drawn out beyond the perpendicular of the nose, 
and gives them a most ungainly aspect. Sekwebu remarked, 
" These women want to make their mouths like those of ducks ;" 
and indeed it does appear as if they had the idea that female 
beauty of lip had been attained by the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus 
alone. This custom prevails throughout the country of the 
Maravi, and no one could see it without confessing, that fashion 
had never led women to a freak more mad. We had rains now 
every day, and considerable cloudiness, but the sun often burst 
through with scorching intensity. All call out against it then, 
saying, " O the sun ! that is rain again." It was worth noticing 
that my companions never complained of the heat while on the 

2 p 



578 SELOLE'S HOSTILITY. Chap. XXVIII. 

highlands, but when we descended into the lowlands of Angola, 
and here also, they began to fret on account of it. I myself felt 
an oppressive steaminess in the atmosphere, which I had not 
experienced on the higher lands. 

As the game was abundant and my party very large, I had 
still to supply their wants with the gun. We slaughtered the 
oxen only when unsuccessful in hunting. We always entered 
into friendly relations with the head-men of the different villages, 
and they presented grain and other food freely. One man gave a 
basinful of rice, the first we met with in the country. It is never 
seen in the interior. He said he knew it was "white man's 
corn," and when I wished to buy some more, he asked me to give 
him a slave. This was the first symptom of the slave-trade on 
this side of the country. The last of these friendly head-men 
was named Mobala ; and having passed him in peace, we had no 
anticipation of anything else ; but after a few hours we reached 
Selole or Chilole, and found that he not only considered us enemies, 
but had actually sent an express to raise the tribe of Mburuma 
against us. All the women of Selole had fled, and the few people 
we met, exhibited symptoms of terror. An armed party had 
come from Mburuma in obedience to the call, but the head-man 
of the company, being Mburuma's brother, suspecting that it was 
a hoax, came to our encampment and told us the whole. When 
we explained our objects, he told us that Mburuma, he had no 
doubt, would receive us well. The reason why Selole acted in 
this foolish manner, we afterwards found to be tins : an Italian 
named Simoens, and nicknamed Siriatomba (don't eat tobacco), 
had married the daughter of a chief called Sekokole, living north 
of Tete. He armed a party of fifty slaves with guns, and, 
ascending the river hi canoes some distance beyond the island 
Meya makaba, attacked several inhabited islands beyond, securing 
a large number of prisoners, and much ivory. On his return, the 
different chiefs, at the instigation of his father-in-law, who also did 
not wish him to set up as a chief, united, attacked and dispersed the 
party of Simoens, and killed him while trying to escape on foot. 
Selole imagined that I was another Italian, or, as he expressed it, 
" Siriatomba risen from the dead." In his message to Mburuma 
he even said that Mobala, and all the villages beyond, were 
utterly destroyed by our fire-arms, but the sight of Mobala him- 



Chap. XXVIII. ELEPHANTS' TENACITY OF LIFE. 579 

self, who had come to the village of Selole, led the brother of 
Mburunia to see at once that it was all a hoax. But for this, the 
foolish fellow Selole might have given us trouble. 

We saw many of the liberated captives of this Italian among 
the villages here, and Sekwebu found them to be Matebele. The 
brother of Mburuma had a gun, winch was the first we had seen 
in coming eastward. Before we reached Mburuma, my men 
went to attack a troop of elephants, as they were much in need 
of meat. When the troop began to run, one of them fell into a 
hole, and before he could extricate himself, an opportunity was 
afforded for all the men to throw their spears. When he rose 
he was like a huge porcupine, for each of the seventy or eighty 
men had discharged more than one spear at him. As they had 
no more, they sent for me to finish him. In order to put him 
at once out of pain, I went to within twenty yards, there being 
a bank between us which he could not readily climb. I rested 
the gun upon an anthill, so as to take a steady aim ; but though 
I fired twelve 2-ounce bullets, all I had, into different parts, 
I could not kill him. As it was becoming dark, I advised my 
men to let him stand, being sure of finding him dead in the 
morning; but though we searched all the next day, and went 
more than ten miles, we never saw him again. I mention 
this to young men who may think that they will be able to hunt 
elephants on foot, by adopting the Ceylon practice of killing them 
by one ball in the brain. I believe that in Africa the practice 
of standing before an elephant, expecting to kill hhn with one shot, 
would be certain death to the hunter ; and I would add, for the 
information of those who may think that, because I met with a 
great abundance of game here, they also might find rare sport, 
that the tsetse exists all along both banks of the Zambesi, and 
there can be no hunting by means of horses. Hunting on foot in 
this climate is such excessively hard work, that I feel certain the 
keenest sportsman would very soon turn away from it in disgust. 
I myself was rather glad, when furnished with the excuse that I 
had no longer any balls, to hand over all the hunting to my men, 
who had no more love for the sport than myself, as they never 
engaged in it, except when forced by hunger. 

Some of them gave me a hint to melt down my plate, by asking 
if it were not lead. I had two pewter plates and a piece of zinc, 

2 p 2 



580 MR. OSWELL'S NARROW ESCAPE. Chap. XXVIII. 

which I now melted into bullets. I also spent the remainder of 
my handkerchiefs in buying spears for them. My men frequently 
surrounded herds of buffaloes and killed numbers of the calves. 
I, too, exerted myself greatly ; but as I am now obliged to shoot 
with the left arm I am a bad shot, and this, with the lightness of 
the bullets, made me very unsuccessful. The more the hunger, 
the less my success, invariably. 

I may here add an adventure with an elephant of one who has 
had more narrow escapes than any man living, but whose modesty 
has always prevented him from publishing anything about himself. 
When we were on the banks of the Zouga in 1850, Mr. Oswell 
pursued one of these -animals into the dense, thick, thorny bushes 
met with on the margin of that river, and to winch the elephant 
usually flees for safety. He followed through a narrow pathway, 
by lifting up some of the branches and forcing his way through 
the rest ; but when he had just got over tins difficulty, he saw the 
elephant, whose tail he had but got glimpses of before, now rush- 
ing towards him. There was then no time to lift up branches, so 
he tried to force the horse through, them. He could not effect a 
passage ; and, as there was but an instant between the attempt 
and failure, the hunter tried to dismount, but in doing this one 
foot was caught by a branch, and the spur drawn along the ani- 
mal's flank ; this made hiin spring away and tlirow the rider on 
the ground with his face to the elephant, which, being in full 
chase, still went on. Mr. Oswell saw the huge fore foot about 
to descend on his legs, parted them, and drew in his breath as if 
to resist the pressure of the other foot, winch he expected would 
next descend on his body. He saw the whole length of the under 
part of the enormous brute pass over him ; the horse got away 
safely. I have heard of but one other authentic instance in which 
an elephant went over a man without injury, and, for any one who 
knows the nature of the bush in which this occurred, the very 
thought of an encounter in it with such a foe is appalling. As 
the thorns are placed in pans on opposite sides of the branches, and 
these turn round on being pressed against, one pair brings the 
other exactly hito the position in winch it must pierce the intruder. 
They cut like knives. Horses dread this bush extremely : indeed, 
most of them refuse to face its thorns. 

On reaching Mburuma's village, his brother came to meet us. 



Chap. XXVIII. MBURUMA'S VILLAGE AND PEOPLE. 581 

We explained the reason of onr delay, and he told us that we were 
looked upon with alarm. He said that Siriatomba had been killed 
near the village of Selole, and hence that man's fears. He added 
that the Italian had come talking of peace, as we did, but had 
kidnapped children and bought ivory with them, and that we were 
supposed to be following the same calling. I pointed to my men, 
and asked if any of these were slaves, and if we had any children 
among them, and I tlnnk we satisfied him that we were true men. 
Referring to our ill success in hunting the day before, he said, " The 
man at whose village you remained was in fault in allowing you 
to want meat, for had he only run across to Mburuma he would 
have given him a little meal, and, having sprinkled that on the 
ground as an offering to the gods, you would have found your 
elephant." The chiefs in these parts take upon themselves an 
office somewhat like the priesthood, and the people imagine that 
they can propitiate the Deity through them. In illustration of 
their ideas, it may be mentioned that, when we were among the 
tribes west of Semalembue, several of the people came forward 
and introduced themselves — one as a hunter of elephants, another 
as a hunter of hippopotami, a third as a digger of pitfalls — appa- 
rently wishing me to give them medicine for success in their avo- 
cations, as well as to cure the diseases of those to whom I was 
administering the drugs. I thought they attributed supernatural 
power to them, for, like all Africans, they have unbounded faith 
in the efficacy of charms ; but I took pains to let them know that 
they must pray and trust to another power than mine for aid. 
We never saw Mburuma himself, and the conduct of his people 
indicated very strong suspicions, though he gave us presents of 
meal, maize, and native corn. His people never came near us, 
except in large bodies and fully armed. We had to order them 
to place their bows, arrows, and spears at a distance before entering 
our encampment. We did not, however, care much for a little 
trouble now, as we hoped that, if we could pass tins time without 
much molestation, we might yet be able to return with ease, and 
without meeting sour, suspicious looks. 

The soil, glancing everywhere with mica, is very fertile, and 
all the valleys are cultivated, the maize being now in ear and 
eatable. Ranges of hills, which line both banks of the river 
above tins, now come close up to each bank, and form a narrow 



582 MA MBUKUMA'S VILLAGE AND PEOPLE. Chap. XXVIII. 

gorge, which, like all others of the same nature, is called Mpata. 
There is a narrow pathway by the side of the river, but we pre- 
ferred a more open one in a pass among the hills to the east, 
which is called Mohango. The lulls rise to a height of 800 or 
1000 feet, and are all covered with trees. The rocks were of 
various coloured mica schist ; and parallel with the Zambesi lay 
a broad band of gneiss with garnets in it. It stood on edge, and 
several dykes of basalt, with dolerite, had cut through it. 

Mburuma sent two men as guides to the Loangwa. These men 
tried to bring us to a stand, at a distance of about six miles from 
the village, by the notice, " Mburuma says you are to sleep under 
that tree." On declining to do this, we were told that we must 
wait at a certain village for a supply of com. As none appeared 
in an hour, I proceeded on the march. It is not quite certain 
that their intentions were hostile, but this seemed to disarrange 
their plans, and one of them was soon observed running back to 
Mburuma. They had first of all tried to separate our party, by 
volunteering the loan of a canoe to convey Sekwebu and me, 
together with our luggage, by way of the river, and, as it was 
pressed upon us, I thought that this was their design. The next 
attempt was to detain us in the pass, but, betraying no suspicion, 
we civilly declined to place ourselves in their power in an unfa- 
vourable position. We afterwards heard that a party of Babisa 
traders, who came from the north-east, bringing English goods 
from Mozambique, had been plundered by this same people. 

Elephants were still abundant, but more wild, as they fled with 
great speed as soon as we made our appearance. The country 
between Mburuma's and his mother's village was all hilly and 
very difficult, and prevented us from travelling more than ten 
miles a day. At the village of Ma Mburuma (mother of Mbu- 
ruma), the guides, who had again joined us, gave a favourable 
report, and the women and children did not flee. Here we found 
that traders, called Bazunga, have been in the habit of coming in 
canoes, and that I was named as one of them. These I supposed 
to be half-caste Portuguese, for they said that the hair of then- 
heads and the skin beneath their clothing were different from 
mine. Ma Mburuma promised us canoes to cross the Loangwa 
in our front. It was pleasant to see great numbers of men, 
women, and boys come, without suspicion, to look at the books, 



Chap. XXVIII. OPINIONS OF THE GUIDES. 583 

watch, looking-glass, revolver, &c. They are a strong, muscular 
race, and both men and women are seen cultivating the ground. 
The soil contains so much comminuted talc and mica from the 
adjacent hills, that it seems as if mixed with spermaceti. They 
generally eat their corn only after it has begun to sprout from 
steeping it in water. The deformed lips of the women make 
them look very ugly ; I never saw one smile. The people in 
this part seem to understand readily what is spoken about God, 
for they listen with great attention, and tell in return their own 
ideas of departed spirits. The position of the village of 
Mburuma's mother was one of great beauty, quite enclosed by 
high, steep lulls ; and the valleys are all occupied by gardens of 
native corn and maize, which grow luxuriantly. We were obliged 
to hurry along, for the oxen were bitten daily by the tsetse, 
which, as I have before remarked, now inhabits extensive tracts 
which once supported herds of cattle that were swept off by 
Mpakane and other marauders, whose devastations were well 
known to Sekwebu, for he himself had been an actor in the scenes. 
When he told me of them he always lowered Iris voice, in order 
that the guides might not hear that he had been one of their 
enemies. But that we were looked upon with suspicion, on 
account of having come in the footsteps of invaders, was evident 
from our guides remarking to men hi the gardens through winch 
we passed, " They have words of peace — all very fine ; but lies 
only, as the Bazunga are great bars." They thought we did not 
understand them, but Sekwebu knew every word perfectly, and, 
without paying any ostensible attention to these complimentary 
remarks, we always took care to explain ever afterwards that we 
were not Bazunga, but Makoa (English).

14:th. — We reached the confluence of the Loangwa and the 
Zambesi, most thankful to God for his great mercies in helping 
us thus far. Mburuma's people had behaved so suspiciously, that, 
though we had guides from him, we were by no means sure that 
we should not be attacked in crossing the Loangwa. We saw 
them here collecting in large numbers, and, though professing 
friendship, they kept at a distance from our camp. They refused 
to lend us more canoes than two, though they have many. They 
have no intercourse with Europeans, except through the Babisa. 
They tell us that this was formerly the residence of the Bazunga, 
and maintain silence as to the cause of their leaving it. I walked 
about some ruins I discovered, built of stone, and found the 
remains of a church, and on one side lay a broken bell, with 
the letters I. H. S. and a cross, but no date. There were no 



Chap. XXIX. CROSSING THE LOANGWA. 585 

inscriptions on stone, and the people could not tell what the 
Bazunga called their place. We fonnd afterwards it was Zumbo. 

I felt some turmoil of spirit in the evening, at the prospect of 
having all my efforts for the welfare of this great region and its 
teeming population, knocked on the head by savages to-morrow, 
who might be said to " know not what they do." It seemed such 
a pity that the important fact of the existence of the two healthy 
ridges winch I had discovered, should not become known in 
Christendom, for a confirmation would thereby have been given to 
the idea that Africa is not open to the Gospel. But I read that 
Jesus said, " All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth : 

go ye, therefore, and teach all nations and lo, I am with 

you ahvat/, even unto the end of the world" I took tins as His 
w r ord of honour, and then went out to take observations for lati- 
tude and longitude, which, I think, were very successful. (The 
church : lat. 15° 37' 22" S., long. 30° 32' E.) 

15th. The natives of the surrounding country collected around 
us this morning, all armed. The women and children were sent 
away, and one of Mburuma's wives, who lives in the vicinity, was 
not allowed to approach, though she had come from her village to 
pay me a visit. Only one canoe was lent to us, though we saw 
two others tied to the bank. The part we crossed was about a 
mile from the confluence, and, as it was now flooded, it seemed 
upwards of half a mile in breadth. We passed all our goods first 
on to an island in the middle, then the remaining cattle and men ; 
occupying the post of honour, I, as usual, was the last to enter 
the canoe. A number of the inhabitants stood armed all the 
time we were embarking. I showed them my watch, lens, and 
other things to keep them amused, until there only remained 
those who were to enter the canoe with me. I thanked them for 
then kindness, and wished them peace. After all, they may have 
been influenced only by the intention to be ready, in case I should 
play them some false trick, for they have reason to be distrustful 
of the whites. The guides came over to bid us adieu, and* we sat 
under a mango-tree, fifteen feet in circumference. We found 
them more communicative now. They said that the land on 
both sides belonged to the Bazunga, and that they had left of old, 
on the approach of Changamera, Ngaba, and Mpakane. Sekwebu 
was with the last named, but he maintained that they never 



586 EUINS OF STONE HOUSES. Chap. XXIX. 

came to the confluence, though they carried off all the cattle of 
Mburuma. The guides confirmed this by saying that the Bazunga 
were not attacked, but fled in alarm on the approach of the enemy. 
Tins mango-tree he knew by its proper name, and we found seven 
others and several tamarinds, and were informed that the chief 
Mburunia sends men annually to gather the fruit, but, like many 
Africans whom I have known, has not had patience to propagate 
more trees. I gave them some little presents for themselves, a 
handkerchief and a few beads, and they were highly pleased with 
a cloth of red baize for Mburuma, which Sekeletu had given me to 
purchase a canoe. We were thankful to part good friends. 

Next morning we passed along the bottom of the range, called 
Mazanzwe, and found the ruins of eight or ten stone houses. 
They all faced the river, and were high enough up the flanks 
of the lull Mazanzwe to command a pleasant view of the broad 
Zambesi. These establishments had all been built on one plan — 
a house on one side of a large court, surrounded by a wall ; both 
houses and walls had been built of soft gray sandstone cemented 
together with mud. The work had been performed by slaves 
ignorant of building, for the stones were not often placed so as to 
cover the seams below. Hence you frequently find the joinings 
forming one seam from the top to the bottom. Much mortar or 
clay had been used to cover defects, and now trees of the fig 
family grow upon the walls, and clasp them with their roots. 
When the clay is moistened, masses of the walls come down 
by wholesale. Some of the rafters and beams had fallen in, but 
were entire, and there were some trees in the middle of the 
houses as large as a man's body. On the ojmosite or south bank 
of the Zambesi, we saw the remains of a wall on a height which 
was probably a fort, and the church stood at a central point, 
formed by the right bank of the Loangwa and the left of the 
Zambesi. 

The situation of Zumbo was admirably well chosen as a site 
for commerce. Looking backwards we see a mass of high, dark 
mountains, covered with trees ; behind us rises the fine high 
hill Mazanzwe, which stretches away northwards along the left 
bank of the Loangwa; to the S.E. lies an open country with 
a small round hill in the distance called Tofulo. The mer- 
chants, as they sat beneath the verandahs in front of then 



Chap. XXIX. LACERDA'S VISIT TO CAZEMBE. 587 

houses, had a magnificent view of the two rivers at their conflu- 
ence ; of their church at the angle ; and of all the gardens winch 
they had on both sides of the rivers. In these they cultivated 
wheat without irrigation, and, as the Portuguese assert, of a grain 
twice the size of that at Tete. From the guides we learnt that 
the inhabitants had not imbibed much idea of Christianity, for 
they used the same term for the church bell which they did for 
a diviner's drum. From this point the merchants had water 
communication in three directions beyond — namely, from the 
Loangwa to the N.N.W., bytheKafue to the W., and by the Zam- 
besi to the S.W. Their attention, however, was chiefly attracted 
to the N. or Londa ; and the principal articles of trade were ivory 
and slaves. Private enterprise was always restrained, for the 
colonies of the Portuguese being strictly military, and the pay of 
the commandants being very small, the officers have always been 
obliged to engage in trade ; and had they not employed then- 
power to draw the trade to themselves, by preventing private 
traders from making bargains beyond the villages, and only at 
regulated prices, they would have had no trade, as they themselves 
were obliged to remain always at their posts. 

Several expeditions went to the north as far as to Cazembe, and 
Dr. Lacerda, himself Commandant of Tete, went to that chief's 
residence. Unfortunately he was cut off while there, and his 
papers, taken possession of by a Jesuit who accompanied him, were 
lost to the world. This Jesuit probably intended to act fairly and 
have them published; but soon after his return he was called 
away by death himself, and the papers were lost sight of. Dr. 
Lacerda had a strong desire to open up communication with 
Angola, winch would have been of importance then, as affording 
a speedier mode of communication with Portugal than by the way 
of the Cape ; but since the opening of the overland passage to 
India, a quicker transit is effected from Eastern Africa to Lisbon 
by way of the Eed Sea. Besides Lacerda, Cazembe was visited 
by Peirara, who gave a glowing account of that chiefs power, 
winch none of my inquiries have confirmed. The people of 
Matiamvo stated to me that Cazembe was a vassal of their chief; 
and, from all the native visitors whom I have seen, he appears to 
be exactly like Shinte and Katema, only a little more powerful. 
The term " Emperor," which has been applied to him, seems totally 



588 A MAN TOSSED BY A BUFFALO. Chap. XXIX. 

inappropriate. The statement of Peirara that twenty negroes were 
slaughtered in a day, was not confirmed by any one else, though 
numbers may have been killed on some particular occasion during 
the time of his visit, for we find throughout all the country north 
of 20°, which I consider to be real negro, the custom of slaugh- 
tering victims to accompany the departed soul of a chief, and 
human sacrifices are occasionally offered, and certain parts of 
the bodies are used as charms. It is on account of the exist- 
ence of such rites, with the similarity of the language, and the 
fact that the names of rivers are repeated again and again from 
north to south through all that region, that I consider them to 
have been originally one family. The last expedition to Cazembe 
was somewhat of the same nature as the others, and failed in esta- 
bHshing a commerce, because the people of Cazembe, who had 
come to Tete to invite the Portuguese to visit them, had not been 
allowed to trade with whom they might. As it had not been free- 
trade there, Cazembe did not see why it should be free-trade at 
his town ; he accordingly would not allow Ms people to furnish 
the party with food except at his price ; and the expedition, being 
half-starved in consequence, came away voting unanimously that 
Cazembe was a great bore. 

When we left the Loangwa we thought we had got rid of the 
lulls; but there are some behind Mazanzwe, though five or six 
miles off from the river. Tsetse and the hills had destroyed two 
riding oxen, and when the little one that I now rode knocked 
up, I was forced to march on foot. The bush being very dense 
and high, we were going along among the trees, when three buf- 
faloes, which we had unconsciously passed above the wind, thought 
that they were surrounded by men, and dashed through our line. 
My ox set off at a gallop, and when I could manage to glance 
back, I saw one of the men up in the air about five feet above a 
buffalo, which was tearing along with a stream of blood running 
down Ins flank. When I got back to the poor fellow, I found 
that he had lighted on his face, and, though he had been carried 
on the horns of the buffalo about twenty yards before getting the 
final toss, the skin was not pierced nor was a bone broken. When 
the beasts appeared, he had thrown down his load and stabbed one 
in the side. It turned suddenly upon him, and, before he could 
use a tree for defence, carried him off. We shampooed him well, 



Chap. XXIX. CAFFKE WAR. 589 

and then went on, and in about a week he was able to engage in 
the hunt again. 

At Zunibo we had entered upon old grey sandstone, with shingle 
in it, dipping generally towards the south, and forming the bed of 
the river. The Zambesi is very broad here, but contains many 
inhabited islands. We slept opposite one on the 16th, called Shi- 
banga. The nights are warm, the temperature never falling below 
80° ; it was 91° even at sunset. One cannot cool the water by a 
wet towel round the vessel, and we feel no pleasure in drinking 
warm water, though the heat makes us imbibe large quantities. 
We often noticed lumps of a froth-like substance on the bushes as 
large as cricket-balls, which we could not explain. 

On the morning of the 17th, we were pleased to see a person 
coming from the island of Shibanga, with jacket and hat on. He 
was quite black, but had come from the Portuguese settlement 
at Tete or Nyungwe ; and now for the first time we understood 
that the Portuguese settlement was on the other bank of the 
river, and that they had been fighting with the natives for the 
last two years. We had thus got into the midst of a Cafrre war, 
without any particular wish to be on either side. He advised 
us to cross the river at once, as Mpende lived on this side. We 
had been warned by the guides of Mburuma against him, for 
they said that if we could get past Mpende we might reach the 
white men, but that he was determined that no white man 
should pass him. Wishing to follow this man's advice, we pro- 
posed to borrow his canoes ; but being afraid to offend the 
lords of the river, he declined. The consequence was, we were 
obliged to remain on the enemy's side. The next island belonged 
to a man named Zungo, a fine frank fellow, who brought us at 
once a present of corn, bound hi a peculiar way in grass. He 
freely accepted our apology for having no present to give in return, 
as he knew that there were no goods hi the interior, and besides 
sent forward a recommendation to Ins brother-in-law Pangola. 
The country adjacent to the river is covered with dense bush, 
thorny and tangled, making one stoop or wait till the men broke 
or held the branches on one side. There is much rank grass, but 
it is not so high or rank as that of Angola. The maize, however, 
winch is grown here is equal in size to that which the Americans 
sell for seed at the Cape. There is usually a holm adjacent to 



590 DANCING FOE CORN. Chap. XXIX. 

the river, studded with villages and gardens. The holms are but 
partially cultivated, and on the other parts grows rank and reedy 
grass. There is then a second terrace, on which trees and bushes 
abound ; and I thought I could detect a third and higher steppe. 
But I never could discover terraces on the adjacent country, such 
as in other countries show ancient sea-beaches. The path runs 
sometimes on the one and sometimes on the other of these river 
terraces. Canoes are essentially necessary ; but I find that they 
here cost too much for my means, and higher up, where my hoes 
might have secured one, I was unwilling to enter into a canoe and 
part with my men, while there was danger of their being attacked. 
18th. — Yesterday we rested under a broad-spreading fig-tree. 
Large numbers of buffaloes and water-antelopes were feeding 
quietly in the meadows ; the people have either no guns or no 
ammunition, or they would not be so tame. Pangola visited us, 
and presented us with food. In few other countries would 114 
sturdy vagabonds be supported by the generosity of the head- 
men and villagers, and whatever they gave be presented with 
politeness. My men got pretty well supplied individually, for 
they went into the villages and commenced dancing. The young 
women were especially pleased with the new steps they had to 
show, though I suspect many of them were invented for the 
occasion, and would say, " Dance for me, and I will grind corn 
for you." At every fresh instance of liberality, Sekwebu said, 
" Did not I tell you that these people had hearts, while we were 
still at Linyanti ? " All agreed that the character he had given 
was true, and some remarked, " Look ! although we have been so 
long away from home, not one of us has become lean." It was a 
fact that we had been all well supplied either with meat by my 
gun or their own spears, or food from the great generosity of the 
inhabitants. Pangola promised to ferry us across the Zambesi, 
but failed to fulfil his promise. He seemed to wish to avoid 
offending his neighbour Mpende by aiding us to escape from his 
hands, so we proceeded along the bank. Although we were in 
doubt as to our reception by Mpende, I could not help admiring 
the beautiful country as we passed along. There is, indeed, only 
a small part under cultivation in tins fertile valley, but my mind 
naturally turned to the comparison of it with Kolobeng, where 
we waited anxiously during months for rain, and only a mere 



Chap. XXIX. BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. 591 

thuncler-sliower followed. I shall never forget the dry, hot east 
winds of that region ; the yellowish, sultry, cloudless sky ; the 
grass and all the plants drooping from drought, the cattle lean, 
the people dispirited, and our own hearts sick from hope deferred. 
There we often heard in the dead of the night the shrill whistle 
of the rain-doctor calling for rain that would not come, while here 
we listened to the rolling thunder by night and beheld the 
swelling valleys adorned with plenty by day. We have rain 
almost daily, and everything is beautifully fresh and green. I 
felt somewhat as people do on coming ashore after a long voyage 
— inclined to look upon the landscape in the most favourable 
light. The hills are covered with forests, and there is often 
a long line of fleecy cloud lying on them about midway up ; 
they are very beautiful. Finding no one willing to aid us in 
crossing the river, we proceeded to the village of the chief 
Mpende. A fine, large, conical hill now appeared to the N.N.E. ; 
it is the highest I have seen in these parts, and at some points it 
appears to be two cones joined together, the northern one being a 
little lower than the southern. Another high hill stands on the 
same side to the N.E., and, from its similarity in shape to an axe 
on the top, is called Motemwa. Beyond it, eastward, lies the 
country of Kaimbwa, a chief who has been engaged in actual 
conflict with the Bazunga, and beat them too, according to the 
version of tilings here. The hills on the south bank are named 
Kamoenja. When we came to Mpende's village, he immediately 
sent to inquire who we were, and then ordered the guides who had 
come with us from the last village to go back and call their masters. 
He sent no message to us whatever. We had travelled very 
slowly up to tins point, the tsetse-stricken oxen being now unable 
to go two miles an hour. We were also delayed by being obliged 
to stop at every village, and send notice of our approach to the 
head-man, who came and received a little informatioD, and gave 
some food. If we had passed on without taking any notice of 
them, they would have considered it impolite, and we should 
have appeared more as enemies than friends. I consoled myself 
for the loss of time by the thought that these conversations 
tended to the opening of our future path. 

23rcZ. — Tins morning, at sunrise, a party of Mpende's people 
came close to our encampment, uttering strange cries and waving 



592 A FIGHT ANTICIPATED. Chap. XXIX. 

some bright red substance towards us. They then lighted a fire 
with charms in it, and departed, uttering the same hideous 
screams as before. This was intended to render us powerless, and 
probably also to frighten us. Ever since dawn, parties of armed 
men have been seen collecting from all quarters, and numbers 
passed us while it was yet dark. Had we moved down the river 
at once, it would have been considered an indication of fear or 
defiance, and so would a retreat. I therefore resolved to wait, 
trusting in Him who has the hearts of all men in His hands. 
They evidently intended to attack us, for no friendly message 
was sent ; and when three of the Batoka the night before entered 
the village to beg food, a man went round about each of them, 
making a noise like a lion. The villagers then called upon 
them to do homage, and, when they complied, the chief ordered 
some chaff to be given them, as if it had been food. Other 
tilings also showed unmistakeable hostility. As we were now 
pretty certain of a skirmish, I ordered an ox to be slaugh- 
tered, as this is a means which Sebituane employed for inspiring 
courage. I have no doubt that we should have been victorious ; 
indeed, my men, who were far better acquainted with fighting 
than any of the people on the Zambesi, were rejoicing in the 
prospect of securing captives to carry the tusks for them. " We 
shall now," said they, "get both corn and clothes in plenty." 
They were in a sad state, poor fellows ! for the rains we had 
encountered had made then skin-clothing drop off piecemeal, and 
they were looked upon with disgust by the well-fed and well- 
clothed Zambesians. They were, however, veterans in maraud- 
ing, and the head-men, instead of being depressed by fear, as the 
people of Mpende intended should be the case in using their 
charms, hinted broadly to me that I ought to allow them to 
keep Mpende's wives. The roasting of meat went on fast and 
furious, and some of the young men said to me, " You have seen 
us with elephants, but you don't know yet what we can do with 
men." I believe that, had Mpende struck the first blow, he 
would soon have found out that he never made a greater mistake 
in his life. 

His whole tribe was assembled at about the distance of half 
a mile. As the country is covered with trees, we did not see 
them ; but every now and then a few came about us as spies, 



Chap. XXIX. MPENDE'S FRIENDSHIP. 593 

and would answer no questions. I handed a leg of the ox to two 
of these, and desired them to take it to Mpende. After waiting 
a considerable time in suspense, two old men made their appear- 
ance, and said they had come to inquire who I was. I replied, 
" I am a Lekoa " (an Englishman). They said, " We don't know 
that tribe. We suppose you are a Mozunga, the tribe with winch 
we have been fighting." As I was not yet aware that the term 
Mozunga was applied to a Portuguese, and thought they meant 
half-castes, I showed them my hair and the skin of my bosom, 
and asked if the Bazunga had hah' and skin like mine. As the 
Portuguese have the custom of cutting the hah' close, and are also 
somewhat darker than we are, they answered, "No; we never saw 
skin so white as that ;" and added, " Ah ! you must be one of 
that tribe that loves (literally, has heart to) the black men." I, 
of course, gladly responded hi the affirmative. They returned to 
the village, and we afterwards heard that there had been a long 
discussion between Mpende and his councillors, and that one of 
the men with whom we had remained to talk the day before had 
been our advocate. He was named Sinclese Oale'a. When we 
were passing Ins village, after some conversation, he said to Ins 
people, " Is that the man whom they wish to stop after he has 
passed so many tribes ? What can Mpende say to refusing him 
a passage?" It was owing to this man, and the fact that I 
belonged to the " friendly white tribe," that Mpende was per- 
suaded to allow us to pass. When we knew the favourable 
decision of the council, I sent Sekwebu to speak about the pur- 
chase of a canoe, as one of my men had become very ill, and I 
wished to relieve his companions by taking him in a canoe. 
Before Sekwebu could finish his story, Mpende remarked, " That 
white man is truly one of our friends. See, how he lets me know 
Ins afflictions ! " Sekwebu adroitly took advantage of this turn 
in the conversation, and said, " All ! if you only knew him as well 
as we do who have lived with him, you would understand that he 
highly values your friendship and that of Mburuma, and, as he is 
a stranger, he trusts in you to direct him." He replied, " Well, 
he ought to cross to the other side of the river, for tins bank is 
hilly and rough, and the way to Tete is longer on this, than on 
the opposite bank." " But who will take us across, if you do not ?" 
" Truly ! " replied Mpende, " I only wish you had come sooner to 

2 Q 



594 CROSSING THE ZAMBESI. Chap. XXIX. 

tell me about him; but you shall cross." Mpeude said fre- 
quently he was sorry he had not known me sooner, but that he 
had been prevented by his enchanter from coming near me ; and 
he lamented that the same person had kept him from eating the 
meat which I had presented. He did everything he could after- 
wards to aid us on our course, and our departure was as different 
as possible from our approach to his village. I was very much 
pleased to find the English name spoken of with such great 
respect so far from the coast, and most thankful that no collision 
occurred to damage its influence. 

24:th. — Mpende sent two of his principal men to order the 
people of a large island below to ferry us across. The river is 
very broad, and, though my men were well acquainted with the 
management of canoes, we could not all cross over before dark. 
It is 1200 yards from bank to bank, and between 700 and 800 
of deep water, flowing at the rate of 3f miles per hour. We 
landed first on an island, then, to prevent our friends playing 
false with us, hauled the canoes up to our bivouac, and slept in 
them. Next morning we all reached the opposite bank in safety. 
We observed as we came along the Zambesi that it had fallen two 
feet below the height at which we first found it, and the water, 
though still muddy enough to deposit a film at the bottom of vessels 
in a few hours, is not nearly so red as it was, nor is there so much 
wreck on its surface. It is therefore not yet the period of the 
central Zambesi inundation, as we were aware also from our know- 
ledge of the interior. The present height of the water has been 
caused by rains outside the eastern ridge. The people here seem 
abundantly supplied with English cotton goods. The Babisa are 
the medium of trade, for we were informed that the Bazunga, who 
formerly visited these parts, have been prevented by the war from 
coming for the last two years. The Babisa are said to be so fond 
of a tusk that they will even sell a newly married wife for one. 
As we were now not far from the latitude of Mozambique, I was 
somewhat tempted to strike away from the river to that port, 
instead of going to the S.E. in the direction the river flows, but, 
the great object of my journey being to secure water carriage, I 
resolved to continue along the Zambesi, though it did lead me 
among the enemies of the Portuguese. The region to the north 
of the ranges of hills on our left is called Senga, from being the 



Chap. XXIX. BAKWAIN THEOKY OF RAIN. 595 

country of the Basenga, who are said to be great workers in iron, 
and to possess abundance of fine iron-ore, which, when broken, 
shows veins of the pure metal in its substance. It has been 
well roasted in the operations of nature. Beyond Senga lies a 
range of mountains called Mashinga, to which the Portuguese 
in former times went to wash for gold, and beyond that, are 
great numbers of tribes which pass under the general term 
Maravi. To the N.E. there are extensive plains destitute of 
trees, but covered with grass, and in some places it is marshy. 
The whole of the country to the north of the Zambesi is asserted 
to be very much more fertile than that to the south. The Maravi, 
for instance, raise sweet potatoes of immense size, but when these 
are planted on the southern bank they soon degenerate. The 
root of this plant (convolvulus batala) does not keep more than 
two or three days, unless it is cut into thin slices and dried in the 
sun, but the Maravi manage to preserve them for months by 
digging a pit and burying them therein enclosed in wood-ashes. 
Unfortunately, the Maravi, and all the tribes on that side of the 
country, are at enmity with the Portuguese, and, as they practise 
night attacks in their warfare, it is dangerous to travel among 
them. 

29th. — I was most sincerely thankful to find myself on the 
south bank of the Zambesi, and, having nothing else, I sent back 
one of my two spoons and a shirt as a thank-offering to Mpende. 
The different head-men along this river act very much in concert, 
and if one refuses passage they all do, uttering the sage remark, 
" If so-and-so did not lend his canoes, he must have had some 
good reason." The next island we came to, was that of a man" 
named Mozinkwa. Here we were detained some days by con- 
tinuous rains, and thought we observed the confirmation of the 
Bakwain theory of rains. A double tier of clouds floated quickly 
away to the west, and as soon as they began to come in an oppo- 
site direction the rains poured down. The inhabitants who live 
in a dry region like that of Kolobeng are nearly all as weather- 
wise as the rainmakers, and any one living amongst them for 
any length of time, becomes as much interested in the motions 
of the clouds as they are themselves. Mr. Moffat, who was as 
sorely tried by droughts as we were, and had his attention directed 
in the same way, has noted the curious phenomenon of thunder 

2 q 2 



596 NATIVES' IDEAS OF THE ENGLISH. Chap. XXIX. 

without clouds. Mrs. L. heard it once, but I never had that good 
fortune. It is worth the attention of the observant. Humboldt 
has seen rain without clouds, a phenomenon quite as singular. 
I have been in the vicinity of the fall of three aerolites, none of 
which I could afterwards discover. One fell into the lake Kuma- 
dau with a report somewhat like a sharp peal of thunder. The 
women of the Bakurutse villages there, all uttered a scream on 
hearing it. This happened at midday, and so did another at 
what is called the Great Chuai, which was visible in its descent, 
and was also accompanied with a thundering noise. The thud 
fell near Kuruman and at night, and was seen as a falling star by 
people at Motito and at Daniel's Kuil, places distant forty miles 
on oj:>posite sides of the spot. It sounded to me like the report 
of a great gun, and a few seconds after, a lesser sound as if 
striking the earth after a rebound. Does the passage of a few 
such aerolites through the atmosphere to the earth by day cause 
thunder without clouds ? 

We were detained here so long that my tent became again 
quite rotten. One of my men, after long sickness, which I did 
not understand, died here. He was one of the Batoka, and, when 
unable to walk, I had some difficulty in making Ins companions 
carry hini. They wished to leave him to die when his case 
became hopeless. Another of them deserted to Mozinkwa. He 
said that his motive for doing so was that the Makololo had 
killed both his father and mother, and, as he had neither wife 
nor child, there was no reason why he should continue longer 
with them. I did not object to Ins statements, but said if he 
should change his mind he would be welcome to rejoin us, and 
intimated to Mozinkwa that he must not be sold as a slave. 
We are now among people mured to slave-dealing. We were 
visited by men who had been as far as Tete or Nyungwe, and 
were told that we were but ten days from that fort. One of 
them, a Mashona man, who had come from a great distance to 
the S.W., was anxious to accompany us to the country of the 
white men ; he had travelled far, and I found that he had also 
knowledge of the English tribe, and of their hatred to the trade 
in slaves. He told Sekwebu that the " English were men," an 
emphasis being put upon the term men, which leaves the impres- 
sion that others are, as they express it in speaking scornfully, 



Chap. XXIX. DISLIKE TO SLAVE-BUYERS. 597 

" only things." Several spoke in the same manner, and I found 
that from Mpende's downwards I rose higher every day in the 
estimation of my own people. Even the slaves gave a very high 
character to the English, and I fonnd ont afterwards that, when 
I was first reported at Tete, the servants of my friend the Com- 
mandant said to him in joke, " Ah ! this is our brother who is 
coming ; we shall all leave you and go with him." We had still, 
however, some difficulties in store for us before reaching that 
point. 

The man who wished to accompany us came and told us before 
our departure that his wife would not allow him to go, and she 
herself came to confirm the decision. Here the women have only 
a small puncture in the upper lip, in which they insert a little 
button of tin. The perforation is made by degrees, a ring with 
an opening in it being attached to the lip, and the ends squeezed 
gradually together. The pressure on the flesh between the ends 
of the ring causes its absorption, and a hole is the result. Children 
may be seen with the ring on the lip, but not yet punctured. 
The tin they purchase from the Portuguese, and, although silver 
is reported to have been found hi former times in this district, no 
one could distinguish it from tin. But they had a knowledge of 
gold, and for the first time I heard the word " dalama " (gold) in 
the native language. The word is quite unknown in the interior, 
and so is the metal itself. In conversing with the different people, 
we found the idea prevalent that those who had purchased slaves 
from them had done them an injury. " All the slaves of Nyungwe," 
said one, " are our children ; the Bazunga have made a town at 
our expense." When I asked if they had not taken the prices 
offered them, they at once admitted it, but still thought that they 
had been injured by being so far tempted. From the way in 
which the lands of Zumbo were spoken of as still belonging to the 
Portuguese (and they are said to have been obtained by purchase), 
I was inclined to conclude that the purchase of land is not looked 
upon by the inhabitants in the same light as the purchase of 
slaves. 

February 1st. — We met some native traders, and, as many of 
my men were now hi a state of nudity, I bought some American 
calico marked " Lawrence Mills, Lowell," with two small tusks, 
and distributed it amongst the most needy. After leaving Mo- 



598 SAND-RIVULET ZINGESI. Chap. XXIX. 

zinkwa's we came to the Zingesi, a sand rivulet in flood (lat. 15° 
38' 34" S., long. 31° 1' E.). It was sixty or seventy yards wide, 
and waist-deep. Like all these sand-rivers, it is for the most 
part dry ; but by digging down a few feet, water is to be found, 
winch is percolating along the bed on a stratum of clay. This 
is the phenomenon which is dignified by the name of " a river 
flowing underground." In trying to ford tins I felt thousands 
of particles of coarse sand striking my legs, and the slight dis- 
turbance of our footsteps caused deep holes to be made in the 
bed. The water, which is almost always very rapid hi them, 
dug out the sand beneath our feet in a second or two, and we 
were all sinking by that means so deep, that we were glad to 
relinquish the attempt to ford it before we got halfway over ; 
the oxen were carried away down into the Zambesi. These 
sand-rivers remove vast masses of disintegrated rock before it is 
fine enough to form soil. The man who preceded me was only 
thigh-deep, but the disturbance caused by his feet made it breast- 
deep for me. The shower of particles and gravel winch struck 
against my legs, gave me the idea that the amount of matter 
removed by every freshet must be very great. In most rivers 
where much wearing is going on, a person diving to the bottom 
may hear literally thousands of stones knocking against each 
other. This attrition, being carried on for hundreds of miles in 
different, rivers, must have an effect greater than if all the pestles 
and mortars and mills of the world, were grinding and wearing 
away the rocks. The pounding to which I refer, may be heard 
most distinctly hi the Vaal Kiver, when that is slightly in flood. 
It was there I first heard it. In the Leeambye in the middle of 
the country, where there is no discoloration and little carried 
along but sand, it is not to be heard. 

While opposite the village of a head-man called Mosusa, a 
number of elephants took refuge on an island in the river. 
There were two males, and a third not full-grown, indeed 
scarcely the size of a female. This was the first instance I had 
ever seen of a comparatively young one with the males, for they 
usually remain with the female herd till as large as their dams. 
The inhabitants were very anxious that my men should attack 
them, as they go into the gardens on the islands, and do much 
damage. The men went, but the elephants ran about half a 



Chap. XXIX. GAME-LAWS. 599 

mile to the opposite end of the island, and swam to the mam- 
land with their probosces above the water, and, no canoe being 
near, they escaped. They swim strongly, with the proboscis 
erect in the air. I was not very desirous to have one of these 
animals killed, for we understood that when we passed Mpende, 
we came into a country where the game-laws are strictly en- 
forced. The lands of each chief are very well defined, the 
boundaries being usually marked by rivulets, great numbers of 
which flow into the Zambesi from both banks, and, if an elephant 
is wounded on one man's land and dies on that of another, the 
under half of the carcase is claimed by the lord of the soil ; and so 
stringent is the law, that the hunter cannot begin at once to cut 
up his own elephant ; but must send notice to the lord of the soil 
on which it lies, and wait until that personage sends one autho- 
rized to see a fan partition made. If the hunter should begin to 
cut up before the agent of the landowner arrives, he is liable to 
lose both the tusks and all the flesh. The hind leg of a buffalo 
must also be given to the man on whose land the animal was 
grazing, and a still larger quantity of the eland, which here and 
everywhere else in the country is esteemed right royal food. In 
the country above Zumbo we did not find a vestige of tins law ; and 
but for the fact that it existed in the country of the Bamapela, 
far to the south of this, I should have been disposed to regard it 
in the same light as I do the payment for leave to pass — an im- 
position levied on him who is seen to be weak because in the 
hands of his slaves. The only game-laws in the interior are, that 
the man who first wounds an animal, though he has inflicted but 
a mere scratch, is considered the killer of it, the second is entitled 
to a hind-quarter, and the third to a fore-leg. 'The chiefs are 
generally entitled to a share as tribute; in some parts it is the 
breast, in others the whole of . the ribs and one fore-leg. I gene- 
rally respected this law, although exceptions are sometimes made 
when animals are killed by guns. The knowledge that he who 
succeeds in reaching the wounded beast first, is entitled to a share, 
stimulates the whole party to greater exertions in despatching 
it. One of my men, having a knowledge of elephant medicine, 
was considered the leader in the hunt ; he went before the others, 
examined the animals, and on his decision all depended. If he 
decided to attack a herd, the rest went boldly on; but if he 



600 THE SPOTTED HY^NA. Chap. XXIX. 

declined, none of them would engage. A certain part of the 
elephant belonged to hhn by right of the office he held, and such 
was the faith in medicine held by the slaves of the Portuguese 
whom we met hunting, that they offered to pay tins man hand- 
somely, if he would show them the elephant medicine. 

When near Mosusa's village we passed a rivulet called Chowe, 
now running with rain-water. The inhabitants there, extract a 
little salt from the sand when it is dry, and all the people of the 
adjacent country come to purchase it from them. Tins was the 
first salt we had met with since leaving Angola, for none is to be 
found in either the country of the Balonda or Barotse ; but we 
heard of salt-pans about a fortnight west of Naliele, and I got a 
small supply from Mpololo while there. That had long since been 
finished, and I had again lived two months without salt, suffering 
no inconvenience except an occasional longing for animal food or 
milk. 

In marching along, the rich reclclish-brown soil was so clammy, 
that it was very difficult to walk. It is, however, extremely fertile, 
and the people cultivate amazing quantities of corn, maize, millet, 
ground-nuts, pumpkins, and cucumbers. We observed that, when 
plants failed in one spot, they were in the habit of transplanting 
them into another, and they had also grown large numbers of 
young plants on the islands, where they are favoured by moisture 
from the river, and were now removing them to the mainland. 
The fact of their being obliged to do this shows that there is less 
rain here than in Londa, for there we observed the gram in all 
stages of its growth at the same time. 

The people here build their huts in gardens on high stages. 
Tins is necessary on account of danger from the spotted hyama, 
which is said to be very fierce, and also as a protection against 
lions and elephants. The hyaena is a very cowardly animal, 
but frequently approaches persons lying asleep, and makes an 
ugly gash on the face. Mozinkwa had lost his upper lip in this 
way, and I have heard of men being killed by them ; children 
too are sometimes carried off; for though he is so cowardly that 
the human voice will make him run away at once, yet, when his 
teeth are in the flesh, he holds on, and shows amazing power of 
jaw. Leg-bones of oxen, from which the natives have extracted 
the marrow and everything eatable, are by this animal crunched 



Chap. XXIX. A STINGY WHITE TRADER. 601 

up with the greatest ease, which he apparently effects by turning 
them round in his teeth till they are in a suitable position for 
being split. 

We had now come among people who had plenty, and were 
really very liberal. My men never returned from a village with- 
out some corn or maize in then hands. The real politeness with 
which food is given by nearly all the interior tribes, who have not 
had much intercourse with Europeans, makes it a pleasure to 
accept. Again and again I have heard an apology made for the 
smallness of the present, or regret expressed that they had not 
received notice of my approach in time to grind more, and gene- 
rally they readily accepted our excuse at having nothing to give 
in return, by saying that they were quite aware, that there are 
no white men's goods in the ulterior. When I had it in my 
power, I always gave something really useful. To Katema, 
Shinte, and others I gave presents which cost me about 21. each, 
and I could return to them at any time without having a cha- 
racter for stinginess. How some men can offer three buttons, or 
some other equally contemptible gift, while they have abundance 
in then possession, is to me unaccountable. They surely do not 
know, when they write it in then books, that they are declaring 
they have compromised the honour of Englishmen. The people 
receive the offering with a degree of shame, and ladies may 
be seen to hand it quickly to the attendants, and, when they 
retire, laugh until the tears stand in then- eyes, saying to those 
about them, "Is that a white man? then there are niggards 
among them too. Some of them are born without hearts ! " One 
white trader, having presented an old gun to a chief, became a 
standing joke in the tribe : " The white man who made a present 
of a gun that was new, when Ins grandfather was sucking Ins 
great-grandmother." When these tricks are repeated, the natives 
come to the conclusion that people who show such a want of 
sense must be told their duty; they therefore let them know 
what they ought to give, and travellers then complain of being 
pestered with their " shameless begging." I was troubled by 
importunity on the confines of civilization only, and when I first 
came to Africa. 

February 4:th. — We were much detained by rains, a heavy 
shower without wind falling every morning about daybreak ; it 



602 BOROMA'S VILLAGE. Chap. XXIX. 

often cleared up after that, admitting of our moving on a few 
miles. A continuous rain of several hours then set in. The 
wind up to this point was always from the east, but both rain and 
wind now came so generally from the west, or opposite direction 
to what we had been accustomed to in the interior, that we were 
obliged to make our encampment face the east, in order to have 
them in our backs. The country adjacent to the river abounds 
in large trees ; but the population is so numerous, that those left 
being all green, it is difficult to get dry firewood. On coming to 
some places, too, we were warned by the villagers not to cut the 
trees growing in certain spots, as they contained the graves of 
then ancestors. There are many tamarind-trees, and another 
very similar, which yields a fruit as large as a small walnut, of 
which the elephants are very fond. It is called Motondo, and the 
Portuguese extol its timber as excellent for building boats, as it 
does not soon rot in water. 

On the 6th we came to the village of Boroma, wliich is situated 
among a number of others, each surrounded by extensive patches 
of cultivation. On the opposite side of the river we have a great 
cluster of conical hills called Chorichori. Boroma did not make 
Ins appearance, but sent a substitute who acted civilly. I sent 
Sekwebu hi the morning to state that we intended to move on ; 
Ins mother replied that, as she had expected that we should re- 
main, no food was ready, but she sent a basket of corn and a fowl. 
As an excuse why Boroma did not present himself, she said that 
he was seized that morning by the Barimo, which probably meant 
that his lordship was drunk. 

We marched along the river to a point opposite the hill Pinkwe 
(lat. 15° 39' 11" EL, long. 31° 48' E.), but the late abundant rains 
now flooded the Zambesi again, and great quantities of wreck 
appeared upon the stream. It is probable that frequent freshets, 
caused by the rains on this side of the ridge, have prevented 
the Portuguese near the coast, from recognising the one peculiar 
flood of inundation observed in the interior, and caused the belief 
that it is flooded soon after the commencement of the rains. The 
course of the Nile being in the opposite direction to this, it does 
not receive these subsidiary waters, and hence its inundation is 
recognised all the way along its course. If the Leeambye were 
prolonged southwards into the Cape Colony, its flood would be 



Chap. XXIX. FOSSIL TREES. 603 

identical with that of the Nile. It would not be influenced by 
any streams in the Kalahari, for there, as in a corresponding part 
of the Nile, there would be no feeders. It is to be remembered 
that the great ancient river winch flowed to the lake at Boochap 
took this course exactly, and probably flowed tlnther until the 
fissure of the falls was made. 

Tins flood having filled the river, we found the numerous rivu- 
lets which flow into it, filled also, and when going along the Zam- 
besi, we lost so much time in passing up each little stream till 
we could find a ford about waist-deep, and then returning to the 
bank, that I resolved to leave the river altogether, and strike 
away to the S.E. We accordingly struck off when opposite the 
hill Pinkwe, and came into a hard Mopane country. In a hole 
of one of the mopane-trees, I noticed that a squirrel (JSeiurm 
cepapi) had placed a great number of fresh leaves over a store 
of seed. It is not against the cold of winter that they thus lay 
up food, but it is a provision against the hot season, when the 
trees have generally no seed. A great many silicified trees are 
met with lying on the ground all over this part of the country ; 
some are broken off horizontally, and stand upright ; others are 
lying prone and broken across into a number of pieces. One was 
4 feet 8 inches in diameter, and the wood must have been soft 
like that of the baobab, for there were only six concentric rings 
to the inch. As the semi-diameter was only 28 inches, tins large 
tree could have been but 168 years old. I found also a piece of 
palm-tree transformed into oxide of iron, and the pores filled with 
pure silica. These fossil trees lie upon soft grey sandstone con- 
taining banks of shingle, which forms the underlying rock of the 
country all the way from Zumbo to near Lupata. It is met with 
at Litubaruba and in Angola, with similar banks of sliingle im- 
bedded exactly like those now seen on the sea-beach, but I never 
could find a shell. There are many nodules and mounds of hard- 
ened clay upon it, winch seem to have been deposited in eddies 
made round the roots of these ancient trees, for they appear of 
different colours in wavy and twisted lines. Above this, we have 
small quantities of calcareous marl. 

As we were now in the district of Chicova, I examined the 
geological structure of the country with interest, because here, it 
has been stated, there once existed silver-mines. The general 



604 DISTKICT OF CHICOVA. Chap. XXIX. 

rock is the grey soft sandstone I have mentioned, but at the 
rivulet Bangue, we come upon a dyke of basalt six yards wide, 
running north and south. When we cross tins, we come upon 
several others, some of which run more to the eastward. The 
sandstone is then found to have been disturbed, and at the rivulet 
called Nake we found it tilted up and exhibiting a section which 
was coarse sandstone above, sandstone-flag, shale, and lastly a 
thin seam of coal. The section was only shown for a short dis- 
tance, and then became lost by a fault made by a dyke of basalt, 
which ran to the E.N.E. ha the direction of Chicova. 

This Chicova is not a kingdom, as has been stated, but a level 
tract, a part of which is annually overflowed by the Zambesi, and 
is well adapted for the cultivation of corn. It is said to be below 
the northern end of the bill Bungwe. I was very much pleased 
in discovering tins small specimen of such a precious mineral as 
coal. I saw no indication of silver, and, if it ever was worked by 
the natives, it is remarkable that they have entirely lost the 
knowledge of it, and cannot distinguish between silver and tin. 
In connexion with these basaltic dykes, it may be mentioned 
that when I reached Tete I was informed of the existence of a 
small rapid in the river near Chicova ; had I known tins pre- 
viously, I certainly would not have left the river without exa- 
mining it. It is called Kebrabasa, and is described as a number of 
rocks, winch jut out across the stream. I have no doubt but that 
it is formed by some of the basaltic dykes which we now saw, 
for they generally ran towards that point. I was partly influenced 
in leaving the river by a wish to avoid several chiefs in that 
direction, who levy a heavy tribute on those who pass up or down. 
Our path lay along the bed of the Nake for some distance, the 
banks being covered with impenetrable thickets. The villages 
are not numerous, but we went from one to the other and were 
treated kindly. Here they call themselves Bambiri, though the 
general name of the whole nation is Banyai. One of our guides 
was an inveterate talker, always stopping and asking for pay, that 
he might go on with a merry heart. I thought that he led us in 
the most difficult paths, in order to make us feel his value, for, 
after passing through one thicket after another, we always came 
into the bed of the Nake again, and as that was full of coarse 
sand, and the water only ankle-deep, and as hot as a footbath 



Chap. XXIX. NYAMPUNGO THE BAIN-CHARMER. 605 

from the powerful rays of the sun, we were all completely tired 
out. He likeAvise gave us a bad character at every village we 
passed, calling to them that they were to allow him to lead us 
astray, as we were a bad set. Sekwebu knew every word he said, 
and, as he became intolerable, I dismissed lnm, giving him six feet 
of calico I had bought from native traders, and telling him that 
his tongue was a nuisance. It is in general best, when a scolding 
is necessary, to give it in combination with a present, and then 
end it by good wishes. This fellow went off smiling, and my men 
remarked, " His tongue is cured now." The country around the 
Nake is liilly, and the valleys covered with tangled jungle. The 
people who live in this district have reclaimed their gardens from 
the forest, and the soil is extremely fertile. The Nake flows 
northerly, and then to the east. It is 50 or 60 yards wide, 
but during most of the year is dry, affording water only by 
digging in the sand. We found in its bed masses of volcanic 
rock, identical with those which I subsequently recognised as 
such at Aden. 

13th. — The head-man of these parts is named Nyampungo. I 
sent the last fragment of cloth we had, with a request that we 
should be furnished with a guide to the next chief. After a long 
conference with Ins council, the cloth was returned with a promise 
of compliance, and a request for some beads only. Tins man is 
supposed to possess the charm for rain, and other tribes send to 
him to beg it. This shows that what we inferred before was cor- 
rect, that less rain falls in this country than in Londa. Nyam- 
pungo behaved in quite a gentlemanly manner, presented me 
with some rice, and told my people to go amongst all the villages 
and beg for themselves. An old man, father-in-law of the chief, 
told me that he had seen books before, but never knew what they 
meant. They pray to departed chiefs and relatives, but the idea 
of praying to God seemed new, and they heard it with reverence. 
As this was an intelligent old man, I asked him about the silver, 
but he was as ignorant of it as the rest, and said, " We never dug 
silver, but we have washed for gold in the sands of the rivers 
Mazoe and Luia, winch unite in the Luenya." I think that this 
is quite conclusive on the question of no silver having been dug by 
the natives of this district. Nyampungo is afflicted with a kind 
of disease called Sesencla, which I imagine to be a species of 



606 WANT OF CATTLE. Chap. XXIX. 

leprosy common in this quarter, though they are a cleanly people. 
They never had cattle. The chief's father had always lived in 
their present position, and, when I asked him why he did not 
possess these useful animals, he said, " Who would give us the 
medicine to enable us to keep them ? " I found out the reason 
afterwards in the prevalence of tsetse, but of this he was ignorant, 
having supposed that he could not keep cattle because he had 
no medicine.

Wth. — We left Nyampungo this morning. The path wound 
up the Molinge, another sand-river which flows into the Nake. 
When we got clear of the tangled jungle which covers the banks 
of these rivulets, we entered the Mopane country, where we could 
walk with comfort. When we had gone on a few hours, my men 
espied an elephant, and were soon in full pursuit. They were in 
want of meat, having tasted nothing but grain for several days. 
The desire for animal food made them all eager to slay him, and, 
though an old bull, he was soon killed. The people of Nyam- 
pungo had never seen such desperadoes before. One rushed up 
and hamstrung the beast while still standing, by a blow with an 
axe. Some Banyai elephant-hunters happened to be present 
when my men were fighting with him. One of them took out 
his snuff-box, and poured out all its contents at the root of a 
tree, as an offering to the Barimo for success. As soon as the 
animal fell, the whole of my party engaged in a wild savage 
dance round the body, which quite frightened the Banyai, and 
he who made the offering said to me, " I see you are travelling 
with people who don't know how to pray : I therefore offered 



608 GAME-LAWS — HYENAS. Chap. XXX. 

the only thing I had in their behalf, and the elephant soon fell." 
One of Nyampimgo's men who remained with me, ran a little 
forward, when an opening in the trees gave us a view of the 
chase, and uttered loud prayers for success in the combat. I 
admired the devout belief they all possessed in the actual exist- 
ence of unseen beings, and prayed that they might yet know 
that benignant One who views us all as His own. My own 
people, who are rather a degraded lot, remarked to me as I 
came up, "God gave it to us. He said to the old beast, 'Go 
up there ; men are come who will kill and eat you.' " These 
remarks are quoted to give the reader an idea of the native 
mode of expression. 

A.s we were now in the country of stringent game-laws, we 
were obliged to send all the way back to Nyampungo, to give 
information to a certain person who had been left there by the 
real owner of this district to watch over his property, the owner 
himself living near the Zambesi. The side upon which the ele- 
phant fell, had a short broken tusk ; the upper one, winch was 
ours, was large and thick. The Banyai remarked on our good 
luck. The men sent to give notice, came back late in the after- 
noon of the following day. They brought a basket of corn, a 
fowl, and a few strings of handsome beads, as a sort of thank- 
offering for our having killed it on their land, and said they had 
thanked the Barimo besides for our success, adding " There it is ; 
eat it and be glad." Had we begun to cut it up before we got 
this permission, we should have lost the whole. They had brought 
a large party to eat their half, and they divided it with us in a 
friendly way. My men were delighted with the feast, though, by 
lying unopened a whole clay, the carcase was pretty far gone. 
An astonishing number of hyaenas collected round, and kept up 
a loud laughter for two whole nights. Some of them do make 
a very good imitation of a laugh. I asked my men what the 
hyaanas were laughing at ; as they usually give animals credit for 
a share of intelligence ; they said, that they were laughing because 
we could not take the whole, and that they would have plenty 
to eat as well as we. 

On coining to the part where the elephant was slain, we passed 
tlirough grass so tall that it reminded me of that in the valley of 
Cassange. Insects are very numerous after the rains commence. 



Chap. XXX. INSECT LIFE— BIRDS. 609 

While waiting by the elephant, I observed a great number of 
insects, like grains of fine sand, moving on my boxes. On exa- 
mination with a glass, four species were apparent ; one of green 
and gold preening its wings, which glanced in the snn with 
metallic lustre, another clear as crystal, a third of the colour 
of vermilion, and a fourth black. These are probably some 
of those which consume the seeds of every plant that grows. 
Almost every kind, has its own peculiar insect, and wheu the 
rains are over, very few seeds remain untouched. The rankest 
poisons, as the Kongwhane and Euphorbia are soon devoured — 
the former has a scarlet insect; and even the fiery bird's-eye 
pepper, which will keep off many others from their own seeds, is 
itself devoured by a maggot. I observed here, what I had often 
seen before, that certain districts abound in centipedes. Here 
they have light reddish bodies and blue legs ; great myriapedes 
are seen crawling everywhere. Although they do no harm, they 
excite in man a feeling of loathing. Perhaps our appearance pro- 
duces a similar feeling in the elephant and other large animals. 
Where they have been much disturbed, they certainly look upon 
us with great distrust, as the horrid biped that ruins their peace. 
In the quietest parts of the forest there is heard a faint but 
distinct hum, which tells of insect joy. One may see many 
whisking about in the clear sunshhie in patches among the green 
glancing leaves; but there are invisible myriads working with 
never-tiring mandibles on leaves, and stalks, and beneath the 
soil. They are all brimful of enjoyment. Indeed the univer- 
sality of organic life may be called a mantle of happy existence 
encircling the world, and imparts the idea of its being caused by 
the consciousness of our benignant Father's smile on all the 
works of His hands. 

The birds of the tropics have been described as generally want- 
ing in power of song. I was decidedly of opinion that this was 
not applicable to many parts hi Londa, though birds there are 
remarkably scarce. Here the chorus, or body of song, was not 
much smaller in volume than it is in England. It was not so 
harmonious, and sounded always as if the birds were singing in 
a foreign tongue. Some resemble the lark, and indeed there are 
several of that family ; two have notes not unlike those of the 
thrush. One brought the chaffinch to my mind, and another 

2 R 



610 BIRDS— CATERPILLARS. Chap. XXX. 

the robin ; but their songs are intermixed with several curious 
abrupt notes unlike anything English. One utters deliberately 
" peek, pak, pok ;" another has a single note like a stroke on a 
violin-string. The mokwa reza gives forth a screaming set of 
notes like our blackbird when disturbed, then concludes with what 
the natives say is " pula, pula " (rain, rain), but more like " weep, 
weep, weep." Then we have the loud cry of francolins, the 
" pumpuru, pumpuru " of turtle-doves, and the " chiken, chiken, 
chik, churr, churr " of the honey-guide. Occasionally near vil- 
lages we have a kind of mocking bird, imitating the calls of 
domestic fowls. These African birds have not been wanting in 
song, they have only lacked poets to sing their praises, which 
ours have had from the time of Aristophanes downwards. Ours 
have both a classic and a modern interest to enhance their fame. 
In hot dry weather, or at midday when the sun is fierce, all are 
still : let, however, a good shower fall, and all burst forth at 
once into merry lays and loving courtship. The early mornings 
and the cool evenings are their favourite times for singing. 
There are comparatively few with gaudy plumage, being totally 
unlike, in this respect, the birds of the Brazils. The majority 
have decidedly a sober dress, though collectors, having gene- 
rally selected the gaudiest as the most valuable, have conveyed 
the idea that the birds of the tropics for the most part possess 
gorgeous plumage. 

15th. — Several of my men have been bitten by spiders and 
other insects, but no effect except pain has followed. A large 
caterpillar is frequently seen, called lezuntabuea. It is covered 
with long grey hairs, and, the body being dark, it resembles a 
porcupine in minature. If one touches it, the hairs run into the 
pores of the skin, and remain there, giving sharp pricks. There 
are others which have a similar means of defence ; and when the 
hand is drawn across them, as in passing a bush on which they 
happen to be, the contact resembles the stinging of nettles. From 
the great number of caterpillars seen, we have a considerable 
variety of butterflies. One particular kind flies more like a 
swallow than a butterfly. They are not remarkable for the gaudi- 
ness of their colours. 

In passing along we crossed the hills Vungue or Mvungwe, 
which we found to be composed of various eruptive rocks. At 



Chap. XXX. THE HHINOCEKOS. Oil 

one part we have breccia of altered marl or slate in quartz, and 
various amygdaloids. It is curious to observe tlie different forms 
which silica assumes. We have it in clay stone porphyry here, 
in minute round globules, no larger than turnip-seed, dotted 
thickly over the matrix ; or crystallised round the walls of cavities, 
once filled with air, or other elastic fluid ; or it may appear in 
similar cavities as tufts of yellow asbestos, or as red, yellow, or 
green crystals, or in laminae so arranged as to appear like fossil 
wood. Vungue forms the watershed between those sand rivulets 
which run to the N.E. and others winch flow southward, as the 
Kapopo, Ue, and Due, which run into the Luia. 

We found that many elephants had been feeding on the fruit 
called Mokoronga. This is a black-coloured plum, having purple 
juice. We all ate it in large quantities, as we found it delicious. 
The only defect it has, is the great size of the seed in comparison 
with the pulp. This is the chief fault of all uncultivated wild 
fruits. The Mokoronga exists tlnoughout tins part of the country 
most abundantly, and the natives eagerly devour it, as it is said 
to be perfectly wholesome, or, as they express it, " It is pure fat," 
and fat is by them considered the best of food. Though only a 
little larger than a cherry, we found that the elephants had stood 
picking them off patiently by the horn*. We observed the foot- 
prints of a black rhinoceros (Rhinoceros bicornis, Linn.) and her calf. 
We saw other footprints among the hills of Semalembue, but the 
black rhinoceros is remarkably scarce in all the country north 
of the Zambesi. The white rhinoceros (Rhinoceros simus of 
Burchell), or Mohohu of the Bechuanas, is quite extinct here, 
and will soon become unknown in the country to the south. It 
feeds almost entirely on grasses, and is of a timid unsuspecting 
disposition : this renders it an easy prey, and they are slaughtered 
without mercy on the introduction of fire-arms. The black pos- 
sesses a more savage nature, and, like the ill-natured in general, is 
never found with an ounce of fat in its body. From its greater 
fierceness and wariness, it holds its place in a district much longer 
than its more timid and better conditioned neighbour. Mr. Oswell 
was once stalking two of these beasts, and as they came slowly to 
him, he, knowing that there is but little chance of hitting the 
small brain of this animal by a shot in the head, lay expecting 
one of them to give his shoulder, till he was within a few yards. 

2 E 2 



612 THE RHINOCEROS. Chap. XXX. 

The hunter then thought that by making a rush to his side he 
might succeed in escaping, but the rhinoceros, too quick for that, 
turned upon him, and though he discharged Ins gun close to the 
animal's head he was tossed in the air. My friend was insen- 
sible for some time, and on recovering found large wounds on 
the thigh and body : I saw that on the former part still open 
and five inches long. The white, however, is not always quite 
safe, for one, even after it was mortally wounded, attacked Mr. 
Oswell's horse, and thrust the horn through to the saddle, tossing 
at the time both horse and rider. I once saw a white rhino- 
ceros give a buffalo winch was gazing intently at myself a poke 
in the chest, but it did not wound it, and seemed only a hint 
to get out of the way. Four varieties of the rhinoceros are 
enumerated by naturalists, but my observation led me to con- 
clude that there are but two ; and that the extra species have been 
formed from differences in their sizes, ages, and the direction of 
the horns, as if we should reckon the short-horned cattle a different 
species from the Alderneys or the Highland breed. I was led to 
tins, from having once seen a black rhinoceros with a horn bent 
downwards, like that of the kuabaoba, and also because the 
animals of the two great varieties differ very much in appearance 
at different stages of their growth. I find, however, that Dr. 
Smith, the best judge in these matters, is quite decided as to the 
propriety of the subdivision into three or four species. For 
common readers it is sufficient to remember that there are two 
well-defined species, that differ entirely in appearance and food. 
The absence of both these rhinoceroses among the reticulated rivers 
in the central valley may easily be accounted for, they would be 
such an easy prey to the natives in their canoes at the periods of 
inundation ; but one cannot so readily account for the total absence 
of the giraffe and the ostrich on the high open lands of the Batoka, 
north of the Zambesi, unless we give credence to the native report 
winch bounds the country still further north by another network of 
waters near Lake Shuia, and suppose that it also prevented then 
progress southwards. The Batoka have no name for the giraffe 
or the ostrich in then language ; yet, as the former exists in con- 
siderable numbers in the angle formed by the Leeambye and 
Chobe, they may have come from the north along the western 
ridge. The Chobe would seem to have been too narrow to act as 



Chap. XXX. CONFINEMENT OF THE KOUWE. 61 



Q 



an obstacle to the giraffe, supposing it to have come into that 
district from the south ; but the broad river into which that stream 
flows, seems always to have presented an impassable barrier to 
both the giraffe and the ostrich, though they abound on its 
southern border, both in the Kalahari Desert and the country of 
Mashona. 

We passed through large tracts of Mopane country, and my 
men caught a great many of the buds called Korwe (TocTcus ery- 
throrhynchus) in their breeding-places, winch were in holes in 
the mopane-trees. On the 19th we passed the nest of a korwe, 
just ready for the female to enter : the orifice was plastered on 
both sides, but a space was left of a heart shape, and exactly the 
size of the bird's body. The hole in the tree was in every case 
found to be prolonged some distance upwards above the opening, 
and thither the korwe always fled to escape bemg caught. In 
another nest Ave found that one white egg, much like that of a 
pigeon, was laid, and the bird dropped another when captured. 
She had four besides hi the ovarium. The first time that I saw 
tills bird was at Kolobeng, where I had gone to the forest for some 
timber. Standing by a tree, a native looked behind me and ex- 
claimed, " There is the nest of a korwe." I saw a slit only, about 
half an inch wide and three or four inches long, in a slight hollow 
of the tree. Thinking the word korwe denoted some small 
animal, I waited with interest to see what he would extract ; he 
broke the clay which surrounded the slit, put Ins arm into the 
hole, and brought out a Tockus, or red-beaked hornbill, which 
he killed. He informed me that when the female enters 
her nest she submits to a real confinement. The male plasters 
up the entrance, leaving only a narrow slit by which to feed 
his mate, and which exactly suits the form of his beak. The 
female makes a nest of her own feathers, lays her eggs, hatches 
them, and remains with the young till they are fully fledged. 
During all this time, winch is stated to be two or three months, 
the male continues to feed her and the young family. The pri- 
soner generally becomes quite fat, and is esteemed a very dainty 
morsel by the natives, while the poor slave of a husband gets so 
lean that, on the sudden lowering of the temperature which some- 
times happens after a fall of rain, he is benumbed, falls down, 
and dies. I never had an opportunity of ascertaining the actual 



614 HONEY AND WAX. Chap. XXX. 

length of the confinement, but on passing the same tree at Kolo- 
beng about eight days afterwards, the hole was plastered up 
again, as if, in the short time that had elapsed, the disconsolate 
husband had secured another wife. We did not disturb her, and 
my duties prevented me from returning to the spot. This is 
the month in which the female enters the nest. We had seen 
one of these, as before mentioned, with the plastering not quite 
finished; we saw many completed; and we received the very 
same account here that we did at Kolobeng, that the bird comes 
forth when the young are fully Hedged, at the period when the 
corn is ripe ; indeed, her appearance abroad with her young is 
one of the signs they have for knowing when it ought to be so. 
As that is about the end of April, the time is between two 
and three months. She is said sometimes to hatch two eggs, and, 
when the young of these are full-fledged, other two are just out 
of the egg-shells : she then leaves the nest with the two elder, the 
orifice is again plastered up, and both male and female attend to 
the wants of the young which are left. On several occasions I 
observed a branch bearing the marks of the male having often 
sat upon it when feeding his mate, and the excreta had been ex- 
pelled a full yard from the orifice,. and often proved a means of 
discovering the retreat. 

The honey-guides were very assiduous hi their friendly offices, 
and enabled my men to get a large quantity of honey ; but though 
bees abound, the wax of these parts forms no article of trade. In 
Londa it may be said to be fully cared for, as you find hives 
placed upon trees in the most lonesome forests. We often met 
strings of carriers laden with large blocks of this substance, each 
80 or 100 lbs. in weight, and pieces were offered to us for sale 
at every village ; but here we never saw a single artificial hive. 
The bees were always found in the natural cavities of mopane- 
trees. It is probable that the good market for wax afforded to 
Angola by the churches of Brazil, led to the gradual develop- 
ment of that brancli of commerce there. I saw even on the 
banks of the Quango as much as sixpence paid for a pound. In 
many parts of the Batoka country, bees exist in vast numbers ; 
and the tribute due to Sekeletu is often paid in large jars of honey ; 
but having no market nor use for the wax, it is thrown away. 
This was the case also with ivory at the Lake Ngami, at the 



Chap. XXX. SLOW TRAVELLING. 615 

period of its discovery. The reports brought by my other party 
from Loanda of the value of wax, had induced some of my 
present companions to bring small quantities of it to Tete, but, 
not knowing the proper mode of preparing it, it was so dark 
coloured that no one would purchase it ; I afterwards saw a 
little at Kilimane, which had been procured from the natives 
somewhere in this region. 

Though we are now approaching the Portuguese settlement, 
the country is still full of large game. My men killed six buffalo 
calves out of a herd we met. The abundance of these animals, 
and also of antelopes, shows the insufficiency of the bow and arrow 
to lessen their numbers. There are also a great many lions 
and hyaenas, and there is no check upon the increase of the 
former, for the people, believing that the souls of then chiefs 
enter into them, never attempt to kill them ; they even believe 
that a chief may metamorphose himself into a lion, kill any one 
he chooses, and then return to the human form ; therefore when 
they see one they commence clapping their hands, which is the 
usual mode of salutation here. The consequence is, that lions 
and hyaenas are so abundant, that we see little huts made in trees, 
indicating the places where some of the inhabitants have slept 
when benighted in the fields. As numbers of my men frequently 
left the line of march in order to take out the korwes from their 
nests, or follow the honey-guides, they excited the astonishment 
of our guides, who were constantly warning them of the clanger 
they thereby incurred from lions. I was often considerably 
ahead of the main body of my men on this account, and was 
obliged to stop every hour or two, but, the sun being excessively 
hot by day, I was glad of the excuse for resting. We could 
make no such prodigious strides as officers in the Arctic regions 
are able to do. Ten or twelve miles a day were a good march 
for both the men and myself, and it was not the length of the 
marches, but continuing day after day to perform the same dis- 
tance, that was so fatiguing. It was in this case much longer than 
appears on the map, because we kept out of the way of villages. 
I drank less than the natives when riding, but all my clothing 
was now constantly damp from the moisture which was imbibed 
in large quantities at every pond. One does not stay on these 
. occasions to prepare water with alum or anything else, but

drinks any amount without fear. I never felt the atmosphere so 
steamy as on the low-lying lands of the Zambesi, and yet it was 
becoming cooler than it was on the highlands. 

We crossed the rivulets Kapopo and Ue, now running, but 
usually dry. There are great numbers of wild grape-vines 
growing in this quarter ; indeed they abound everywhere along 
the banks of the Zambesi. In the Batoka country there is a 
variety which yields a black grape of considerable sweetness. 
The leaves are very large and harsh, as if capable of withstanding 
the rays of this hot sun ; but the most common kinds — one with 
a round leaf and a greenish grape, and another with a leaf closely 
resembling that of the cultivated varieties, and with dark or 
purple fruit — have large seeds, which are strongly astringent and 
render it a disagreeable fruit. The natives eat all the varieties ; 
and I tasted vinegar made by a Portuguese from these grapes. 
Probably a country which yields the wild vines so very abundantly, 
might be a fit one for the cultivated species. At this part of 
the journey so many of the vines had run across the little foot- 
path we followed, that one had to be constantly on the watch to 
avoid being tripped. The ground was covered with rounded 
shingle, which was not easily seen among the grass. Pedestrian- 
ism may be all very well for those whose obesity requires much 
exercise, but for one who was becoming as thin as a lath, through 
the constant perspiration caused by marching day after day in 
the hot sun, the only good I saw in it was, that it gave an honest 
sort of man a vivid idea of the treadmill. 

Although the rains were not quite over, great numbers of pools 
were drying up, and the ground was in many parts covered with 
small, green, cryptogamous plants, which gave it a mouldy 
appearance and a strong smell. As we sometimes pushed aside 
the masses of rank vegetation which hung over our path, we felt 
a sort of hot blast on our faces. Everything looked unwhole- 
some, but we had no fever. The Ue flows between high banks 
of a soft red sandstone streaked with white, and pieces of tufa. 
The crumbling sandstone is evidently alluvial, and is cut into, 
12 feet deep. In tins region, too, we met with pot-holes, six feet 
deep and three or four in diameter. In some cases they form 
convenient wells ; in others they are full of earth ; and in others 
still, the people have made them into graves for their chiefs. 



Chap. XXX. NATIVE NAMES. 617 

On the 20th we came to Monina's village (close to the sand- 
river Tangwe, lat. 16° 13' 38" &, long. 32° 32' E.). This man 
is very popular among the tribes on account of his liberality. 
Boroma, Nyampungo, Monina, Jira, Katolosa (Monomotapa), and 
Susa, all acknowledge the supremacy of one called Nyatewe, 
who is reported to decide all disputes respecting land. This con- 
federation is exactly similar to what we observed in Londa and 
other parts of Africa. Katolosa is " the Emperor Monomotapa " 
of history, but he is a chief of no great power, and acknowledges 
the supremacy of Nyatewe. The Portuguese formerly honoured 
Monomotapa with a guard, to fire off numbers of guns on the 
occasion of any funeral, and he was also partially subsidized. 
The only evidence of greatness possessed by his successor, is his 
having about a hundred wives. When he dies, a disputed suc- 
cession and much fighting are expected. In reference to the 
term Monomotapa, it is to be remembered that Mono, Moene, 
Mona, Mana, or Mordna, mean simply chief, and considerable 
confusion has arisen from naming different people by making a 
plural of the chief's name. The names Monomoizes, spelt also 
Monemuiges and Monomuizes, and Monomotapistas, when applied 
to these tribes are exactly the same as if we should call the 
Scotch the Lord Douglases. Motape was the chief of the 
Bambiri, a tribe of the Banyai, and is now represented in the 
person of Katolosa. He was probably a man of greater energy 
than his successor, yet only an insignificant chief. Monomoizes 
was formed from Moiza or Muiza, the singular of the word 
Babisa or Aiza, the proper name of a large tribe to the north. 
In the transformation of this name the same error has been com- 
mitted as in the others ; and mistakes have occurred in many 
other names by inattention to the meaning, and predilection for 
the letter r. The river Loangwa, for instance, has been termed 
Arroangoa; and the Luenya, the Kuanha. The Bazizulu, or 
Mashona, are spoken of as the Morururus. 

The government of the Banyai is rather peculiar, being a sort 
of feudal republicanism. The chief is elected, and they choose 
the son of the deceased chief's sister in preference to his own 
offspring. When dissatisfied with one candidate, they even go to 
a distant tribe for a successor, who is usually of the family of the 
late chief, a brother, or a sister's son, but never his own son 



618 GOVERNMENT OF THE BANYAI. Chap. XXX. 

or daughter. When first spoken to on the subject, he answers as 
if he thought himself unequal to the task and unworthy of the 
honour, but, having accepted it, all the wives, goods, and children 
of his predecessor belong to him, and he takes care to keep 
them in a dependent position. When any one of them becomes 
tired of this state of vassalage and sets up his own village, it is 
not unusual for the elected chief to send a number of the young 
men, who congregate about himself, to visit him. If he does 
not receive them with the usual amount of clapping of hands 
and humility, they, in obedience to orders, at once burn Ins 
village. The children of the chief have fewer privileges than 
common free men. They may not be sold, but, rather than 
choose any one of them for a chief at any future time, the free 
men would prefer to elect one of themselves who bore only a very 
distant relationslnp to the family. These free men are a distinct 
class who can never be sold ; and under them there is a class of 
slaves whose appearance as well as position is very degraded. 
Monina had a great number of young men about him from twelve 
to fifteen years of age. These were all sons of free men, and 
bands of young lads like them in the different districts, leave 
their parents about the age of puberty, and live with such men 
as Monina for the sake of instruction. When I asked the nature 
of the instruction I was told " Bonyai," which I suppose may be 
understood as indicating manhood, for it sounds as if we should 
say, " to teach an American, Americanism," or " an English- 
man to be English." While here they are kept in subjection 
to rather stringent regulations. They must salute carefully 
by clapping their hands on approaching a superior, and when 
any cooked food is brought, the young men may not approach 
the dish, but an elder divides a portion to each. They remain 
unmarried, until a fresh set of youths is ready to occupy their 
place under the same instruction. The parents send servants 
with their sons to cultivate gardens to supply them with food, 
and also tusks to Monina to purchase clothing for them. When 
the lads return to the village of their parents, a case is submitted 
to them for adjudication, and if they speak well on the point, the 
parents are highly gratified. 

When we told Monina that we had nothing to present but 
some hoes, he replied that he was not in need of those articles, 



Chap. XXX. INSANITY AND DISAPPEARANCE OF MONAHIN. 619 

and that he had absolute power over the country in front, 
and if he prevented us from proceeding, no one would say any- 
thing to him. His little boy Boromo having come to the 
encampment to look at us, I gave him a knife, and he went off 
and brought a pint of honey for me. The father came soon 
afterwards, and I offered him a shirt. He remarked to his 
councillors, " It is evident, that this man has nothing, for, if 
he had, his people would be buying provisions, but we don't 
see them going about for that purpose." His council did not 
agree in this. They evidently believed that we had goods, but 
kept them hid, and we felt it rather hard to be suspected of 
falsehood. It was probably at their suggestion that in the 
evening a war-dance was got up, about a hundred yards from 
our encampment, as if to put us in fear and force us to bring 
forth presents. Some of Monina's young men had guns, but 
most were armed with large bows, arrows, and spears. They 
beat their drums furiously, and occasionally fired off a gun. As 
this sort of dance is never got up unless there is an intention to 
attack, my men expected an assault. We sat and looked at them 
for some time, and then, as it became dark, lay down, all ready 
to give them a warm reception. But an hour or two after dark 
the dance ceased, and, as we then saw no one approaching us, we 
went to sleep. During the night, one of my head-men, Monahin, 
was seen to get up, look towards the village, and say to one who 
was half awake, " Don't you hear what these people are saying ? 
Go and listen ! " He then walked off in the opposite direction 
and never returned. We had no guard set, but every one lay 
with his spear in his hand. The man to whom he spoke appears 
to have been in a dreamy condition, for it did not strike him 
that he ought to give the alarm. Next morning I found to my 
sorrow that Monahin was gone, and not a trace of him could be 
discovered. He had an attack of pleuritis some weeks before, 
and had recovered, but latterly complained a little of his head. 
I observed him in good spirits on the way hither, and in crossing 
some of the streams, as I was careful not to wet my feet, he 
aided me, and several times joked at my becoming so light. In 
the evening he sat beside my tent until it was dark, and did not 
manifest any great alarm. It was probably either a sudden fit 
of insanity, or, having gone a little way out from the camp, he

may have been carried off by a lion, as this part of the country 
is full of them. I incline to the former opinion, because sudden 
insanity occurs when there is any unusual strain upon their 
minds. Monahin was in command of the Batoka of Mokwine' in 
my party, and he was looked upon with great dislike by all that 
chief's subjects. The only difficulties I had with them arose in 
consequence of being obliged to give orders through him. They 
said Mokwine is reported to have been killed by the Makololo, 
but Monahin is the individual who put forth his hand and slew 
him. When one of these people kills in battle, he seems to 
have no compunction afterwards, but when he makes a foray 
on his own responsibility, and kills a man of note, the common 
people make remarks to each other, which are reported to him, 
and bring the affair perpetually to his remembrance. This 
iteration on the conscience causes insanity, and when one runs 
away in a wide country like this, the fugitive is never heard of. 
Monahin had lately become afraid of his own party from over- 
hearing their remarks, and said more than once to me, " They 
want to kill me." I believe if he ran to any village they would 
take care of him. I felt his loss greatly, and spent three days 
in searching for him. He was a sensible and most obliging man. 
I sent in the morning to inform Monina of this sad event, and 
lie at once sent to all the gardens around, desiring the people to 
look for him, and, should he come near, to bring him home. 
He evidently sympathised with us in our sorrow, and, afraid lest 
we might suspect him, added, " We never catch nor kidnap people 
here. It is not our custom. It is considered as guilt among all 
the tribes." I gave him credit for truthfulness, and he allowed 
us to move on without further molestation. 

After leaving his village we marched in the bed of a sand- 
river a quarter of a mile broad, called Tangwe. Walking on this 
sand is as fatiguing as walking on snow. The country is flat, 
and covered with low trees, but we see high hills in the distance. 
A little to the south we have those of the Lobole. Tins region 
is very much infested by lions, and men never go any distance 
into the woods alone. Having turned aside on one occasion at 
midday, and gone a short distance among grass a little taller 
than myself, an animal sprung away from me which was certainly 
not an antelope, but I could not distinguish whether it was a lion 



Chap. XXX. THE ORDEAL MUAVI. 621 

or a hyaena. This abundance of carnivora made us lose all hope 
of Monahin. We saw footprints of many black rhinoceroses, buf- 
faloes, and zebras. 

After a few hours we reached the village of Nyakoba. Two 
men, who accompanied us from Monina to Nyakoba's, would not 
believe us when we said that we had no beads. It is very trying 
to have one's veracity doubted, but, on opening the boxes, and 
showing them that all I had was perfectly useless to them, they 
consented to receive some beads off Sekwebu's waist, and I 
promised to send four yards of calico from Tete. As we came 
away from Monina's village, a witch-doctor, who had been sent 
for, arrived, and all Monina's wives went forth into the fields 
that morning fasting. There they would be compelled to drink 
an infusion of a plant named " goho," which is used as an ordeal. 
This ceremony is called " muavi," and is performed in this way. 
When a man suspects that any of his wives have bewitched him, 
he sends for the witch-doctor, and all the wives go forth into the 
field, and remain fasting till that person has made an infusion 
of the plant. They all drink it, each one holding up her hand 
to heaven in attestation of her innocency. Those who vomit it 
are considered innocent, while those whom it purges are pro- 
nounced guilty, and put to death by burning. The innocent 
return to their homes, and slaughter a cock as a thank-offering 
to their guardian spirits. The practice of ordeal is common 
among all the negro nations north of the Zambesi. This sum- 
mary procedure excited my surprise, for my intercourse with the 
natives here had led me to believe, that the women were held in 
so much estimation that the men would not dare to get rid of 
them thus. But the explanation I received was this. The 
slightest imputation makes them eagerly desire the test ; they 
are conscious of being innocent, and have the fullest faith in the 
muavi detecting the guilty alone ; hence they go willingly, and 
even eagerly, to drink it. When in Angola, a half-caste was 
pointed out to me, who is one of the most successful merchants 
in that country ; and the mother of this gentleman, who was 
perfectly free, went, of her own accord, all the way from Am- 
baca to Cassange, to be killed by the ordeal, her rich son 
making no objection. The same custom prevails among the 
Barotse, Bashubia, and Batoka, but with slight variations. The 



622 WOMAN'S EIGHTS. Chap. XXX. 

Barotse, for instance, pour the medicine down the throat of a 
cock or of a dog, and judge of the innocence or guilt of the 
person accused, according to the vomiting or purging of the ani- 
mal. I happened to mention to my own men the water-test for 
witches formerly in use in Scotland : the supposed witch, being 
bound hand and foot, was thrown into a pond ; if she floated, she 
was considered guilty, taken out, and burned ; but if she sank 
and was drowned, she was pronounced innocent. The wisdom of 
my ancestors excited as much wonder in their minds, as their 
custom did hi mine. 

The person whom Nyakoba appointed to be our guide, having 
informed us of the decision, came and bargained that his services 
should be rewarded with a hoe. I had no objection to give it, 
and showed him the article ; he was delighted with it, and went 
off to show it to his wife. He soon afterwards returned, and 
said that, though he was perfectly willing to go, Ins wife would 
not let him. I said, " Then bring back the hoe ;" but he re- 
plied, " I want it." " Well, go with us, and you shall have it." 
" But my wife won't let me." I remarked to my men, " Did 
you ever hear such a fool ? " They answered, " Oh, that is the 
custom of these parts ; the wives are the masters." And Sekwebu 
informed me that he had gone to this man's house, and heard 
him saying to his wife, " Do you think that I would ever leave 
you ? " then, turning to Sekwebu, he asked, " Do you think I 
would leave this pretty woman ? Is she not pretty ? " Sekwebu 
had been making inquiries among the people, and had found 
that the women indeed possessed a great deal of influence. We 
questioned the guide whom we finally got from Nyakoba, an intel- 
ligent young man, who had much of the Arab features, and 
found the statements confirmed. When a young man takes a 
liking to a girl of another village, and the parents have no 
objection to the match, he is obliged to come and live at their 
village. He has to perform certain services for the mother-in- 
law, such as keeping her well supplied with firewood ; and when 
he comes into her presence he is obliged to sit with his knees in 
a bent position, as putting out his feet towards the old lady 
would give her great offence. If he becomes tired of living in 
this state of vassalage, and wishes to return to Ins own family, he 
is obliged to leave all his children behind — they belong to the 



Chap. XXX. WOMAN'S RIGHTS. 623 

wife. This is only a more stringent enforcement of the law 
from which emanates the practice which prevails so very exten- 
sively in Africa, known to Europeans as " buying wives." Such 
virtually it is, but it does not appear quite in that light to the 
actors. So many head of cattle or goats are given to the parents 
of the girl, " to give her up," as it is termed, i. e. to forego all 
claim on her offspring, and allow an entire transference of her 
and her seed into another family. If nothing is given, the 
family from which she has come can claim the children as part 
of itself: the payment is made to sever this bond. In the case 
supposed, the young man has not been able to advance anything 
for that purpose ; and, from the temptations placed here before 
my men, I have no doubt that some prefer to have their 
daughters married in that way, as it leads to the increase 
of their own village. My men excited the admiration of the 
Bambiri, who took them for a superior breed on account of 
their bravery in elephant-hunting, and wished to get them as 
sons-in-law on the conditions named, but none yielded to the 
temptation. 

We were informed that there is a child belonging to a half- 
caste Portuguese in one of these tribes, and the father had 
tried in vain to get him from the mother's parents. We saw 
several things to confirm the impression of the higher position 
which women hold here ; and, being anxious to discover if I 
were not mistaken, when we came amongst the Portuguese I 
inquired of them, and was told that they had ascertained the 
same thing ; and that, if they wished a man to perform any 
service for them, he would reply, " Well, I shall go and ask 
my wife." If she consented, he would go, and perform his 
duty faithfully ; but no amount of coaxing or bribery would 
induce him to do it if she refused. The Portuguese praised 
the appearance of the Banyai, and they certainly are a fine 
race. 

We got on better with Nyakoba than we expected. He has 
been so much affected by the sesenda that he is quite decrepit, 
and requires to be fed. I at once showed his messenger that 
we had nothing whatever to give. Nyakoba was offended with 
him for not believing me, and he immediately sent a basket of 
maize and another of corn, saying that he believed my state- 



624 THE BANYAI. Chap. XXX. 

ment, and would send men with me to Tete who would not lead 
me to any other village. 

The birds here sing very sweetly, and I thought I heard the 
canary, as in Londa. We had a heavy shower of rain, and I 
observed that the thermometer sank 14° in one hour afterwards. 
From the beginning of February we experienced a sensible 
diminution of temperature. In January the lowest was 75°, 
and that at sunrise ; the average at the same hour (sunrise) 
being 79° ; at 3 p.m., 90° ; and at sunset, 82°. In February 
it fell as low as 70° in the course of the night, and the average 
height was 88°. Only once did it rise to 94°, and a thunder- 
storm followed this ; yet the sensation of heat was greater 
now than it had been at much higher temperatures on more 
elevated lands. 

We passed several villages by going roundabout ways through 
the forest. We saw the remains of a lion that had been killed by 
a buffalo, and the horns of a putokwane (black antelope), the finest 
I had ever seen, which had met its death by a lion. The drums 
beating all night in one village near which we slept, showed that 
some person in it had finished his course. On the occasion of 
the death of a chief, a trader is liable to be robbed, for the 
people consider themselves not amenable to law until a new 
one is elected. We continued a very winding course, in order 
to avoid the chief Katolosa, who is said to levy large sums 
upon those who fall into his hands. One of our guides was a 
fine tall young man, the very image of Ben-Habib the Arab. 
They were carrying dried buffalo's meat to the market at Tete 
as a private speculation. 

A great many of the Banyai are of a light coffee-and-milk 
colour, and indeed this colour is considered handsome through- 
out the whole country, — a fair complexion being as much a 
test of beauty with them as with us. As they draw out their 
hair into small cords a foot in length, and entwine the inner 
bark of a certain tree round each separate cord, and dye this 
substance of a reddish colour, many of them put me in mind of 
the ancient Egyptians. The great mass of dressed hair which 
they possess, reaches to the shoulders, but, when they intend to 
travel, they draw it up to a bunch, and tie it on the top of the 
head. They are cleanly in their habits. 



Chap. XXX. FACE OF THE COUNTRY. 625 

As we did not come near human habitations, and could only- 
take short stages on account of the illness of one of my men, I 
had an opportunity of observing the expedients my party resorted 
to in order to supply their wants. Large white edible mush- 
rooms are found on the anthills, and are very good. The 
mokuri, a tuber which abounds in the Mopane country, they 
discovered by percussing the ground with stones ; and another 
tuber, about the size of a turnip, called " bonga," is found in the 
same situations. It does not determine to the joints like the 
mokuri, and in winter has a sensible amount of salt in it. A 
fruit called " ndongo " by the Makololo, " dongolo " by the 
Bambiri, resembles in appearance a small plum, which becomes 
black when ripe, and is good food, as the seeds are small. 
Many trees are known by tradition, and one receives curious bits 
of information in asking about different fruits that are met with. 
A tree named " shekabakadzi is superior to all others for 
making fire by friction. As its name implies, women may even 
readily make fire by it when benighted. 

The country here is covered over with well-rounded shingle 
and gravel of granite, gneiss, with much talc in it, mica schist, 
and other rocks which we saw in situ between the Kafue and 
Loangwa. There are great mounds of soft red sand slightly 
coherent, which crumble in the hand with ease. The gravel 
and the sand drain away the water so effectually, that the trees 
are exposed to the heat during a portion of the year, without 
any moisture; hence they are not large, like those on the 
Zambesi, and are often scrubby. The rivers are all of the sandy 
kind, and we pass over large patches between this and Tete, 
in which, in the dry season, no water is to be found. Close on 
our south, the hills of Lokole rise to a considerable height, and 
beyond them flows the Mazoe with its golden sands. The great 
numbers of pot-holes on the sides of sandstone ridges, when 
viewed in connection with the large banks of rolled shingle and 
washed sand which are met with on this side of the eastern ridge, 
may indicate that the sea in former times rolled its waves along 
its flanks. Many of the hills between the Kafue and Loangwa, 
have their sides of the form seen in mud banks left by the tide. 
The pot-holes appear most abundant on low grey sandstone ridges 
here ; and as the shingle is composed of the same rocks as the 

2 s 



626 • PURSUED BY NATIVES. Chap. XXX. 

hills west of Zumbo, it looks as if a current had dashed along from 
the south-east in the line in which the pot-holes now appear, and 
if the current was deflected, by those hills, towards the Maravi 
country, north of Tete, it may have hollowed the rounded water- 
worn caverns, in which these people store their corn, and also 
hide themselves from their enemies. I could detect no terraces 
on the land, but, if I am right in my supposition, the form of 
tins part of the continent must once have resembled the curves 
or indentations seen on the southern extremity of the American 
continent. In the indentation to the S.E., S., S. W., and W. of 
this, he the principal gold-washings ; and the line of the current, 
supposing it to have struck against the hills of Mburuma, shows 
the washings in the N. and N.E. of Tete. 

We were tolerably successful in avoiding the villages, and slept 
one night on the flanks of the hill Zimika, where a great number 
of deep pot-holes afforded an abundant supply of good rain-water. 
Here, for the first time, we saw hills with bare, smooth, rocky tops, 
and we crossed over broad dykes of gneiss and syenitic porphyry : 
the directions in which they lay were N. and S. As we were now 
near to Tete, we were congratulating ourselves on having avoided 
those who would only have plagued us ; but next morning some 
men saw us, and ran off to inform the neighbouring villages of 
our passing. A party immediately pursued us, and, as they 
knew we were within call of Katolosa (Mononiotapa), they threat- 
ened to send information to that chief of our offence, in passing 
through the country without leave. We were obliged to give 
them two small tusks, for, had they told Katolosa of our supposed 
offence, we should in all probability have lost the whole. We 
then went through a very rough stony country without any path. 
Being pretty well tired out in the evening of the 2nd of March, 
I remained at about eight miles distance from Tete, Tette, or 
Nyungwe. My men asked me to go on ; I felt too fatigued to 
proceed, but sent forward to the Commandant the letters of 
recommendation with which I had been favoured in Angola by 
the Bishop and others, and lay down to rest. Our food having 
been exhausted, my men had been subsisting for some time on 
roots and honey. About two o'clock in the morning of the 3rd 
we were aroused by two officers and a company of soldiers, who 
had been sent with the materials for a civilized breakfast and a 



Chap. XXX. ARKIVAL AT TETE. 627 

"masheela" to bring me to Tete. (Commandant's house: 
lat. 16° 9' 3" S., long. 33° 28' E.) My companions thought 
that we were captured by the armed men, and called me in 
alarm. When I understood the errand on which they had 
come, and had partaken of a good breakfast, though I had 
just before been too tired to sleep, all my fatigue vanished. 
It was the most refreshing breakfast I ever partook of, and I 
walked the last eight miles without the least feeling of weari- 
ness, although the path was so rough that one of the officers 
remarked to me, " This is enough to tear a man's life out of 
him." The pleasure experienced in partaking of that breakfast 
was only equalled by the enjoyment of Mr. Gabriel's bed on my 
arrival at Loanda. It was also enhanced by the news that 
Sebastopol had fallen, and the war was finished. 



Note. — Having neglected, in referring to the footprints of the rhino- 
ceros, to mention what may be interesting to naturalists, I add it here in 
a note; that wherever the footprints are seen, there are also marks of the 
animal having ploughed up the ground and hushes with his horn. This 
has been supposed to indicate that he is subject to " fits of ungovernable 
rage ;" but when seen, he appears rather to be rejoicing in his strength. He 
acts as a bull sometimes does when he gores the earth with his horns. The 
rhinoceros, in addition to this, stands on a clump of bushes ; bends his back 
down, and scrapes the ground with his feet, throwing it out backwards, as if 
to stretch and clean his toes, in the same way that a dog may be seen to do 
on a little grass : this is certainly not rage.

I was most kindly received by the Commandant Tito Angusto 
d'Araujo Sicard, who did everything in his power to restore me 
from my emaciated condition ; and as this was still the unhealthy 
period at Kilimane, he advised me to remain with him until the 
following month. He also generously presented my men with 
abundant provisions of millet ; and by giving them lodgings in a 
house of his own, until they could erect their own huts, he pre- 
served them from the bite of the tampans, here named Carapatos.* 
We had heard frightful accounts of tins insect while among the 

* Another insect, resembling a maggot, burrows into the feet of the natives 
and sucks their blood. Mr. Westwood says, '* The tampan is a large species of 
mite, closely allied to the poisonous bug (as it is called) of Persia, Argos rejlexus, 
respecting which such marvellous accounts have been recorded, and which the 
statement respecting the carapato or tampan would partially confirm." Mr. W. 
also thinks that the poison- yielding larvae called N'gwa is a " species of chryso- 
melida3. The larva? of the British species of that family exude a fetid yellow 
thickish fluid when alarmed, but he has not heard that any of them are at all 
poisonous." 



Chap. XXXI. TETE : ITS POPULATION. 629 

Banyai, and Major Sicard assured me that to strangers its bite 
is more especially dangerous, as it sometimes causes fatal fever. 
It may please our homoeopathic friends to hear that, in curing the 
bite of the tampan, the natives administer one of the insects 
bruised in the medicine employed. 

The village of Tete is built on a long slope down to the river, 
the fort being close to the water. The rock beneath is grey 
sandstone, and has the appearance of being crushed away from 
the river : the strata have thus a crumpled form. The hollow 
between each crease is a street, the houses being built upon the 
projecting fold. The rocks at the top of the slope are much 
higher than the fort, and of course completely command it. 
There is then a large valley, and beyond that, an oblong hill 
called Karueira. The whole of the adjacent country is rocky 
and broken, but every available spot is under cultivation. The 
stone houses in Tete are cemented with mud instead of lime, and 
thatched with reeds and grass. The rains, having washed out the 
mud between the stones, give all the houses a rough untidy 
appearance. No lime was known to be found, nearer than 
Mozambique; some used in making seats in the verandahs, 
had actually been brought all that distance. The Portuguese, 
evidently, knew nothing of the pink and white marbles, which I 
found at the Mbai, and another rivulet, named the Unguesi, near 
it, and of which I brought home specimens; nor yet of the 
dolomite which lies so near to Zumbo; they might have 
burned the marble into lime without going so far as Mozam- 
bique. There are about thirty European houses; the rest are 
native, and of wattle and daub. A wall about ten feet high 
is intended to enclose the village, but most of the native inha- 
bitants prefer to live on different spots outside. There are 
about 1200 huts in all, winch with European households would 
give a population of about 4500 souls. Only a small propor- 
tion of these, however, live on the spot ; the majority are en- 
gaged in agricultural operations in the adjacent country. Gene- 
rally there are not more than 2000 people resident, for, compared 
with what it was, Tete is now a ruin. The number of Portu- 
guese is very small; if we exclude the military, it is under 
twenty. Lately, however, 105 soldiers were sent from Portugal 
to Senna, where in one year twenty-five were cut off by fever. 



630 DECADENCE OF PORTUGUESE POWER. Chap. XXXI. 

They were then removed to Tete, and here they enjoy much better 
health, though, from the abundance of spirits distilled from various 
plants, wild fruits, and grain, in which pernicious beverage they 
largely indulge, besides partaking chiefly of unwholesome native 
food, better health could scarcely have been expected. The 
natives here understand the method of distillation by means of 
gun-barrels, and a succession of earthen pots filled with water to 
keep them cool. The general report of the fever here is that, 
while at Kilimane the fever is continuous, at Tete a man re- 
covers in about three days. The mildest remedies only are used 
at first, and, if that period be passed, then the more severe. 

The fort of Tete has been the salvation of the Portuguese power 
in this quarter. It is a small square building, with a thatched 
apartment for the residence of the troops ; and though there are 
but few guns, they are in a much better state than those of any 
fort in the interior of Angola. The cause of the decadence of 
the Portuguese power in this region is simply this. In former 
times considerable quantities of grain, as wheat, millet, and maize, 
were exported, also coffee, sugar, oil, and indigo, besides gold- 
dust and ivory. The cultivation of grain was carried on by 
means of slaves, of whom the Portuguese possessed a large num- 
ber. The gold-dust was procured by washing at various points 
on the north, south, and west of Tete. A merchant took all his 
slaves with him to the washings, carrying as much calico and 
other goods as he could muster. On arriving at the washing- 
place he made a present to the chief, of the value of about a 
pound sterling. The slaves were then divided into parties, each 
headed by a confidential servant, who not only had the supervision 
of his squad while the washing went on, but bought dust from the 
inhabitants, and made a weekly return to his master. When 
several masters united at one spot, it was called a " Bara," and 
they then erected a temporary church, in wliich a priest from one 
of the missions performed mass. Both chiefs and people were 
favourable to these visits, because the traders purchased grain for 
the sustenance of the slaves with the goods they had brought. 
They continued at this labour until the whole of the goods 
were expended, and by this means about 130 lbs. of gold were 
annually produced. Probably more than tins was actually ob- 
tained, but, as it was an article easily secreted, tins alone was 



Chap. XXXI. TETE PLUNDERED AND BURNT. 631 

submitted to the authorities for taxation. At present the whole 
amount of gold obtained annually by the Portuguese is from 8 
to 10 lbs. only. When the slave-trade began, it seemed to many 
of the merchants a more speedy mode of becoming rich, to sell off 
the slaves, than to pursue the slow mode of gold-washing and 
agriculture, and they continued to export them, until they had 
neither hands to labour nor to fight for them. It was just tho 
story of the goose and the golden egg. The coffee and sugar 
plantations and gold-washings were abandoned, because the labour 
had been exported to the Brazils. Many of the Portuguese then 
followed their slaves, and the Government was obliged to pass a 
law to prevent further emigration, which, had it gone on, would 
have depopulated the Portuguese possessions altogether. A clever 
man of Asiatic (Goa) and Portuguese extraction, called Nyaude, 
now built a stockade at the confluence of the Luenya and Zambesi ; 
and when the Commandant of Tete sent an officer with his com- 
pany to summon him to Ins presence, Nyaude asked permission of 
the officer to dress himself, which being granted, he went into an 
inner apartment, and the officer ordered his men to pile their arms. 
A drum of war began to beat a note which is well known to the 
inhabitants. Some of the soldiers took the alarm on hearing this 
note, but the officer, disregarding their warning, was, with Iris whole 
party, in a few minutes disarmed and bound hand and foot. The 
Commandant of Tete then armed the whole body of slaves and 
marched against the stockade of Nyaude, but when they came 
near to it, there was the Luenya still to cross. As they did not 
effect this speedily, Nyaude despatched a strong party under Ins 
son Bonga across the river below the stockade, and up the left 
bank of the Zambesi until they came near to Tete. They then 
attacked Tete, winch was totally undefended save by a few 
soldiers in the fort, plundered and burned the whole town except 
the house of the Commandant and a few others, with the church 
and fort. The women and children fled into the church, and it is 
a remarkable fact, that none of the natives of this region will ever 
attack a church. Having rendered Tete a ruin, Bonga carried off 
all the cattle and plunder to his father. News of this having 
been brought to the army before the stockade, a sudden panic dis- 
persed the whole ; and as the fugitives took roundabout ways in 
then flight, Katolosa, who had hitherto pretended to be friendly 



632 NYAUDE AND KISAKA. Chap. XXXI. 

with the Portuguese, sent out his men to capture as many of them 
as they could. They killed many for the sake of their arms. 
This is the account winch both natives and Portuguese give of the 
affair. 

Another half-caste from Macao, called Kisaka or Choutama, on 
the opposite bank of the river, likewise rebelled. His father 
having died, he imagined that he had been bewitched by the 
Portuguese, and he therefore plundered and burnt all the planta- 
tions of the rich merchants of Tete on the north bank. As I 
have before remarked, that bank is the most fertile, and there the 
Portuguese had their villas and plantations to winch they daily 
retired from Tete. When these were destroyed, the Tete people 
were completely impoverished. An attempt was made to punish 
this rebel, but it also was unsuccessful, and he has lately been 
pardoned by the home Government. One point in the narrative 
of this expedition is interesting. They came to a field of sugar- 
cane so large, that 4000 men eating it during two days did not 
finish the whole. The Portuguese were thus placed between two 
enemies, Nyaude on the right bank and Kisaka on the left, and 
not only so, but Nyaude, having placed his stockade on the point 
of land on the right banks of both the Luenya and Zambesi, and 
washed by both these rivers, could prevent intercourse with the sea. 
The Luenya rushes into the Zambesi with great force, when the 
latter is low, and in coming up the Zambesi boats must cross it and 
the Luenya separately, even going a little way up that river, so as 
not to be driven away by its current in the bed of the Zambesi, and 
dashed on the rock winch stands on the opposite shore. In coming 
up to the Luenya for this purpose, all boats and canoes came close 
to the stockade to be robbed. Nyaude kept the Portuguese shut 
up in their fort at Tete during two years, and they could only get 
goods sufficient to buy food, by sending to Kilimane by an over- 
land route along the north bank of the Zambesi. The mother 
country did not in these " Caffre wars " pay the bills, so no one 
either became rich or blamed the missionaries. 

The merchants were unable to engage in trade ; and commerce, 
which the slave-trade had rendered stagnant, was now completely 
obstructed. The present Commandant of Tete, Major Sicard, 
having great influence among the natives from his good character, 
put a stop to the war more than once by his mere presence on 



Chap. XXXI. SEAMS OF COAL. 633 

the spot. We heard of him among the Banyai as a man with 
whom they would never fight, because " he had a good heart." 
Had I come down to this coast instead of going to Loanda in 
1853, I should have come among the belligerents while the war 
was still raging, and should probably have been cut off. My 
present approach was just at the conclusion of the peace ; and 
when the Portuguese authorities here were informed, through the 
kind offices of Lord Clarendon and Count de Lavradio, that I was 
expected to come this way, they all declared that such was the 
existing state of affairs that no European could possibly pass 
through the tribes. Some natives at last came down the river to 
Tete and said, alluding to the sextant and artificial horizon, that 
" the Son of God had come," and that he was " able to take the 
sun down from the heavens and place it under his arm ! " 
Major Sicard then felt sure that this was the man mentioned in 
Lord Clarendon's despatch. 

On mentioning to the Commandant that I had discovered 
a small seam of coal, he stated that the Portuguese were 
already aware of nine such seams, and that five of them were 
on the opposite bank of the river. As soon as I had recovered 
from my fatigue I went to examine them. We proceeded in 
a boat to the mouth of the Lofubu or Revubu, which is about 
two miles below Tete, and on the opposite or northern bank. 
Ascending tins about four miles against a strong current of 
beautifully clear water, we landed near a small cataract, and 
walked about two miles through very fertile gardens to the seam, 
which we found to be in one of the feeders of the Lofubu, called 
Muatize or Motize. The seam is in the perpendicular bank, and 
dips into the rivulet, or in a northerly direction. There is first of 
all, a seam 10 inches in diameter, then some shale, below which 
there is another seam, 58 inches of which are seen, and, as the 
bottom touches the water of the Muatize, it may be more. This 
part of the seam is about 30 yards long. There is then a fault. 
About 100 yards higher up the stream, black vesicular trap is 
seen, penetrating in thin veins the clay shale of the country, 
converting it into porcellanite, and partially crystallizing the coal 
with which it came into contact. On the right bank of the Lo- 
fubu there is another feeder entering that river near its con- 
fluence with the Muatize, which is called the Morongozi, in which 



634 . HOT SPUING. Chap. XXXI. 

there is another and still larger bed of coal exposed. Further 
up the Lofubu, there are other seams in the rivulets Inyavu and 
Makare ; also several spots in the Maravi country have the coal 
cropping out. This has evidently been brought to the surface by 
volcanic action at a later period than the coal formation. 

I also went up the Zambesi and visited a hot spring called 
Nyamboronda, situated in the bed of a small rivulet named 
Nyaondo, winch shows that igneous action is not yet extinct. 
We landed at a small rivulet called Mokorozi, then went a mile 
or two to the eastward, where we found a hot fountain at the 
bottom of a high hill. A little spring bubbles up on one side of 
the rivulet Nyaondo, and a great quantity of acrid steam rises up 
from the ground adjacent, about 12 feet square of which is so hot, 
that my companions could not stand on it with their bare feet. 
There are several little holes from which the water trickles, but 
the principal spring is in a hole a foot in diameter, and about the 
same in depth. Numbers of bubbles are constantly rising. The 
steam feels acrid in the throat, but is not inflammable, as it did 
not burn when I held a bunch of lighted grass over the bubbles. 
The mercury rises to 158° when the thermometer is put into the 
water in the hole, but after a few seconds it stands steadily at 160°. 
Even when flowing over the stones, the water is too hot for the 
hand. Little fish frequently leap out of the stream in the bed 
of winch the fountain rises, into the hot water, and get scalded to 
death. We saw a frog which had performed that experiment, and 
was now cooked. The stones over winch the water flows are 
encrusted with a white salt, and the water has a saline taste. The 
ground has been dug out near the fountain by the natives, hi 
order to extract the salt it contains. It is situated among rocks 
of syenitic porphyry in broad dykes, and gneiss tilted on edge, 
and having a strike to the N.E. There are many specimens 
of half-formed pumice, with greenstone and lava. Some of the 
sandstone strata are dislocated by a hornblende rock and by 
basalt ; the sandstone nearest to the basalt being converted into 
quartz. 

The country around, as indeed all the district lying N. and 
N.W. of Tete, is hilly, and, the hills being covered with trees, the 
scenery is very picturesque. The soil of the valleys is very fruit- 
ful and well cultivated. There would not be much difficulty in 



Chap. XXXI. WORKMEN'S WAGES. 635 

working the coal. The Lofubu is about 60 yards broad ; it flows 
perennially, and at its very lowest period, which is after Sep- 
tember, there is water about 18 inches deep, which could be 
navigated in flat-bottomed boats. At the time of my visit it was 
full, and the current was very strong. If the small cataract 
referred to were to be avoided, the land-carriage beyond would 
only be about two miles. The other seams farther up the river 
may, after passing the cataract, be approached more easily than 
that in the Muatize ; as the seam, however, dips down into the 
stream, no drainage of the mine would be required, for if water 
were come to, it would run into the stream. I did not visit the 
others, but I was informed that there are seams in the inde- 
pendent native territory, as well as in that of the Portuguese. 
That in the Nake, is in the Banyai country, and indeed I have no 
doubt but that the whole country between Zumbo and Lupata is a 
coalfield of at least 2h° of latitude in breadth, having many faults, 
made during the time of the igneous action. The grey sandstone 
rock having silicified trees lying on it, is of these dimensions. 
The plantation in which the seam of coal exists, would be valued 
among the Portuguese at about 60 dollars or 12/., but much more 
would probably be asked if a wealthy purchaser appeared. They 
could not, however, raise the price very much higher, because 
estates containing coal might be had from the native owners at a 
much cheaper rate. The wages of free labourers, when employed 
in such work as gold-washing, agriculture, or digging coal, is 
2 yards of unbleached calico per day. They might be got to 
work cheaper if engaged by the moon, or for about 16 yards per 
month. For masons and carpenters even, the ordinary rate is 
2 yards per day. This is called 1 brac>. Tradesmen from Kili- 
mane demand 4 bracks, or 8 yards, per day. English or American 
unbleached calico is the only currency used. The carriage of 
goods up the river to Tete, adds about 10 per cent, to their cost. 
The usual conveyance is by means of very large canoes and 
launches built at Senna. 

The amount of merchandise brought up during the five months 
of peace previous to my visit, was of the value of 30,000 dollars, or 
about 6000/. The annual supply of goods for trade is about 1 5,000/., 
being calico, thick brass-wire, beads, gunpowder, and guns. The 
quantity of the latter is, however, small, as the Government of 



636 TEADE— PEICES. Chap. XXXI. 

Mozambique made that article contraband, after the commence- 
ment of the war. Goods, when traded with in the tribes around 
the Portuguese, produce a profit of only about 10 per cent., the 
articles traded in being ivory and gold-dust. A little oil and wheat 
are exported, but nothing else. Trade with the tribes beyond the 
exclusive ones is much better. Thirty brass rings cost 10s. at Senna, 
11. at Tete, and 21. beyond the tribes in the vicinity of Tete ; these 
are a good price for a penful of gold-dust of the value of 21. The 
plantations of coffee, which, previous to the commencement of the 
slave-trade, yielded one material for exportation, are now deserted, 
and it is difficult to find a single tree. The indigo (Indigofera 
argentea, the common wild indigo of Africa) is found growing 
everywhere, and large quantities of the senna-plant * grow in the 
village of Tete and other parts ; but neither indigo nor senna is 
collected. Calumba-root, which is found in abundance in some 
parts further down the river, is bought by the Americans, it is said, 
to use as a dye-stuff. A kind of sarsaparilla, or a plant which is 
believed by the Portuguese to be such, is found from Londa to 
Senna, but has never been exported. 

The price of provisions is low, but very much higher than pre- 
vious to the commencement of the war. Two yards of calico are 
demanded for six fowls ; this is considered very dear, because, before 
the war, the same quantity of calico was worth 24 fowls. Grain 
is sold in little bags made from the leaves of the palmyra, like 
those in which we receive sugar. They are called panjas, and each 
panja weighs between 30 and 40 lbs. The panja of wheat at Tete 
is worth a dollar, or 5s. ; but the native grain may be obtained 
among the islands below Lupata, at the rate of three panjas for two 
yards of calico. The highest articles of consumption are tea and 
coffee — the tea being often as high as 156*. a pound. Food is 
cheaper down the river below Lupata, and, previous to the war, the 
islands winch stud the Zambesi were all inhabited, and, the soil 
being exceedingly fertile, grain and fowls could be got to any 
amount. The inhabitants disappeared before their enemies the 
Landeens, but are beginning to return since the peace. They 
have no cattle, the only place where we found no tsetse being 
the district of Tete itself; and the cattle in the possession of

Chap. XXXI. GOLD-WASHING. 637 

the Portuguese are a mere remnant of what they formerly 
owned. 

When visiting the hot fountain, I examined what were formerly 
the gold-washings in the rivulet Mokoroze, which is nearly on the 
16th parallel of latitude. The banks are covered with large groves 
of fine mango-trees, among which the Portuguese lived while super- 
intending the washing for the precious metal. The process of 
washing is very laborious and tedious. A quantity of sand is put 
into a wooden bowl with water ; a half rotatory motion is given to 
the dish, which causes the coarser particles of sand to collect on 
one side of the bottom. These are carefully removed with the 
hand, and the process of rotation renewed until the whole of the 
sand is taken away, and the gold alone remains. It is found in 
very minute scales, and, unless I had been assured to the contrary, 
I should have taken it to be mica, for, knowing the gold to be of 
greater specific gravity than the sand, I imagined that a stream of 
water would remove the latter and leave the former ; but here 
the practice is, to remove the whole of the sand by the hand. 
This process was, no doubt, a profitable one to the Portuguese, and 
it is probable that, with the improved plan by means of mercury, 
the sands would be lucrative. I had an opportunity of examining 
the gold-dust from different parts to the east and north-east of 
Tete. There are six well-known washing-places. These are 
called Mashinga, Shindundo, Missala, Kapata, Mano, and Jawa. 
From the description of the rock I received, I suppose gold is 
found both in clay-shale and quartz. At the range Mushinga to 
the N.N.W. the rock is said to be so soft, that the women pound 
it into powder in wooden mortars previous to washing. 

Round towards the westward, the old Portuguese indicate a 
station which was near to Zumbo on the river Panyame, and called 
Dambarari, near which much gold was found. Further west, lay 
the now unknown kingdom of Abiitua, which was formerly famous 
for the metal ; and then, coming round towards the east, we have 
the gold- washings of the Mashona, or Bazizulu, and further east, that 
of Manica, where gold is found much more abundantly than in any 
other part, and which has been supposed by some to be the Ophir 
of King Solomon. I saw the gold from this quarter as large as 
grains of wheat; that found in the rivers which run into the 
coalfield, being in very minute scales. If we place one leg of the 



638 PEACTICE WITH FLAKE-GOLD. Chap. XXXI. 

compasses at Tete, and extend the other three and a half degrees, 
bringing it round from the north-east of Tete by west, and then to 
the south-east, we nearly touch or include all the known gold-pro- 
ducing country. As the gold on this circumference is found in 
coarser grains than in the streams running towards the centre, or 
Tete, I imagine that the real gold-field lies round about the coal- 
field ; and, if I am right in the conjecture, then we have coal 
encircled by a gold-field, and abundance of wood, water, and provi- 
sions — a combination not often met with in the world. The inha- 
bitants are not unfavourable to washings, conducted on the principle 
formerly mentioned. At present they wash only when in want 
of a little calico. They know the value of gold perfectly well, 
for they bring it for sale in goose-quills, and demand 24 yards of 
calico for one penful. When the rivers in the district of Manica 
and other gold-washing places have been flooded, they leave a 
coating of mud on the banks. The natives observe the spots which 
dry soonest, and commence digging there, in firm belief that gold 
lies beneath. They are said not to dig deeper than their chins, 
believing that if they did so the ground would fall in and kill 
them. When they find a piece or flake of gold, they bury it again, 
from the superstitious idea that this is the seed of the gold, and, 
though they know the value of it well, they prefer losing it rather 
than the whole future crop. This conduct seemed to me so very 
unlikely in men who bring the dust in quills, and even put in a 
few seeds of a certain plant as a charm to prevent their losing any 
of it in the way, that I doubted the authority of my informant ; 
but I found the report verified by all the Portuguese who know 
the native language and mode of thinking, and give the statement 
for what it is worth. If it is really practised, the custom may have 
been introduced by some knowing one who wished to defraud the 
chiefs of their due ; for we are informed in Portuguese history that 
in former times, these pieces or flakes of gold were considered the 
perquisites of the chiefs. 

Major Sicard, the Commandant, whose kindness to me and 
my people was unbounded, presented a rosary made of the gold 
of the country, the workmanship of a native of Tete, to my 
little daughter ; also specimens of the gold-dust of three different 
places, which, with the coal of Muatize and Morongoze, are depo- 
sited in the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn-street, London. 



Chap. XXXI. LIBERALITY OF COMMANDANT. 639 

All the cultivation is carried on with hoes in the native manner, 
and considerable quantities of Holcus sorghum, maize, JPennisetum 
typhoideum, or lotsa of the Balonda, millet, rice, and wheat, are 
raised, as also several kinds of beans — one of which, called " litloo " 
by the Bechuanas, yields under-ground, as well as the Arachis 
hypogcea, or ground-nut ; with cucumbers, pumpkins, and melons. 
The wheat is sown in low-lying places which are annually flooded by 
the Zambesi. When the waters retire, the women drop a few grams 
in a hole made with a hoe, then push back the soil with the foot. 
One weeding alone is required before the grain comes to maturity. 
This simple process represents all our subsoil-plouglnng, liming, 
manuring, and harrowing, for in four months after planting, a good 
crop is ready for the sickle, and has been known to yield a hun- 
dred-fold. It nourished still more at Zumbo. No irrigation is 
required, because here there are gentle rains, almost like mist, in 
whiter, which go by the name of " wheat-showers," and are un- 
known in the interior, where no winter rain ever falls. The 
rains at Tete come from the east, though the prevailing winds 
come from the S.S.E. The finest portion of the flour does not 
make bread nearly so white as the seconds, and here the boyaloa 
(pombe), or native beer, is employed to mix with the flour instead 
of yeast. It makes excellent bread. At Kilimane, where the 
cocoa-nut palm abounds, the toddy from it, called " sura," is used 
for the same purpose, and makes the bread still lighter. 

As it was necessary to leave most of my men at this place, 
Major Sicard gave them a portion of land on which to cultivate 
their own food, generously supplying them with corn in the mean 
time. He also said that my young men might go and hunt 
elephants in company with his servants, and purchase goods with 
both the ivory and dried meat, in order that they might have 
something to take with them on their return to Sekeletu. The 
men were delighted with his liberality, and soon sixty or seventy 
of them set off to engage in this enterprise. There was no 
calico to be had at this time in Tete, but the Commandant hand- 
somely furnished my men with clothing. I was in a state of 
want myself, and, though I pressed him to take payment in 
ivory for both myself and men, he refused all recompence. I 
shall ever remember his kindness with deep gratitude. He 
has written me, since my arrival in England, that my men had 



640 GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION. Chap. XXXI. 

killed four elephants in the course of two months after my 
departure. 

On the day of my arrival I was visited by all the gentlemen of 
the village, both white and coloured, including the padre. Not 
one of them had any idea as to where the source of the Zambesi 
lay. They sent for the best travelled natives, but none of them 
knew the river even as far as Kansala. The father of one of the 
rebels who had been fighting against them, had been a great 
traveller to the south-west, and had even heard of our visit to 
Lake Ngami ; but he was equally ignorant with all the others 
that the Zambesi flowed in the centre of the country. They had, 
however, more knowledge of the country to the north of Tete 
than I had. One man, who had gone to Cazembe with Major 
Monteiro, stated that he had seen the Luapura or Loapula flowing 
past the town of that chieftain into the Luameji or Leeambye, 
but imagined that it found its way, somehow or other, into An- 
gola. The fact that sometimes rivers were seen to flow like tins 
towards the centre of the country, led geographers to the supposi- 
tion that inner Africa was composed of elevated sandy plains, into 
which rivers ran and were lost. One of the gentlemen present, 
Senhor Candido, had visited a lake 45 days to the N.N.W. of 
Tete, which is probably the Lake Maravi of geographers, as in 
going thither they pass through the people of that name. The 
inhabitants of its southern coast are named Shiva ; those on the 
north, Mujao ; and they call the lake Nyanja or Nyanje, which 
simply means a large water, or bed of a large river. A high 
mountain stands in the middle of it, called Murombo or Murom- 
bola, which is inhabited by people who have much cattle. He 
stated that he crossed the Nyanja at a narrow part, and was 
36 hours in the passage. The canoes were punted the whole 
way, and, if we take the rate about two miles per hour, it may be 
sixty or seventy miles in breadth. The country all round was 
composed of level plains covered with grass, and, indeed, in going 
thither they travelled seven or eight days without wood, and cooked 
their food with grass and stalks of native corn alone, The people 
sold their cattle at a very cheap rate. From the southern ex- 
tremity of the lake, two rivers issue forth : one, named after itself, 
the Nyanja, which passes into the sea on the east coast under 
another name ; and the Shire, winch flows into the Zambesi, a 



Chap. XXXI. IDEAS OF A SUPREME BEING. 641 

little below Senna. The Shire is named Shirwa at its point of 
departure from the lake, and Senlior Candido was informed, when 
there, that the lake was simply an expansion of the river Nyanja, 
which comes from the north and encircles the mountain Mu- 
rombo, the meaning of which is junction or union, in reference to 
the water having parted at its northern extremity, and united 
again at its southern. The Shire flows through a low, flat, marshy 
country, but abounding hi population, and they are said to be 
brave. The Portuguese are unable to navigate the Shire up to 
the lake Nyanja, because of the great abundance of a water-plant 
which requires no soil, and winch they name " alfacinya " (Pistia 
stratiotes), from its resemblance to a lettuce. This completely 
obstructs the progress of canoes. In confirmation of this I may 
state that, when I passed the mouth of the Shire, great quantities 
of this same plant were floating from it into the Zambesi, and 
many parts of the banks below were covered with the dead plants. 

Senhor Candido stated that slight earthquakes have happened 
several times in the country of the Maravi, and at no great dis- 
tance from Tete. The motion seems to come from the eastward, 
and never to have lasted more than a few seconds. They are 
named in the Maravi tongue " shiwo," and in that of the people 
of Tete " shitakote'ko," or " shivering" Tins agrees exactly with 
what has taken place in the coast of Mozambique — a few slight 
shocks of short duration, and all appearing to come from the east. 
At Senna, too, a single shock has been felt several times, which 
shook the doors and windows and made the glasses jingle. 
Both Tete and Senna have hot springs in their vicinity, but the 
shocks seemed to come not from them, but from the east and 
proceed to the west. They are probably connected with the 
active volcanoes in the island of Bourbon. 

As Senhor Candido holds the office of judge in all the disputes 
of the natives and knows their language perfectly, his statement 
may be relied on that all the natives of this region have a clear 
idea of a Supreme Being, the maker and governor of all things. 
He is named " Morimo," " Molungo," "Keza," "Mpambe," in 
the different dialects spoken. The Barotse name him " Nyampi," 
and the Balonda " Zambi." All promptly acknowledge him as 
the ruler over all. They also fully believe in the soul's continued 
existence apart from the body, and visit the graves of relatives, 

2 T 



642 TKADE RESTRICTIONS. Chap. XXXI. 

making offerings of food, beer, &c. When undergoing the ordeal, 
they hold up their hands to the Kuler of Heaven, as if appealing 
to him to assert their innocence. When they escape, or recover 
from sickness, or are delivered from any danger, they offer a 
sacrifice of a fowl or a sheep, pouring out the blood as a libation 
to the soul of some departed relative. They believe in the 
transmigration of souls ; and also that while persons are still 
living they may enter into lions and alligators, and then return 
again to their own bodies. 

While still at Tete the son of Monomotapa paid the Comman- 
dant a visit. He is named Mozungo, or " White Man," has a 
narrow tapering head, and probably none of the ability or energy 
his father possessed. He was the favourite of his father, who 
hoped that he would occupy his place. A strong party, however, in 
the tribe placed Katalosa in the chieftainship, and the son became, 
as they say, a child of this man. The Portuguese have repeatedly 
received offers of territory if they would only attend the inter- 
ment of the departed chief with troops, fire off many rounds of 
cartridges over the grave, and then give e'clat to the instalment 
of the new chief. Their presence would probably influence the 
election, for many would vote on the side of power, and a candi- 
date might feel it worth while to grant a good piece of land, if 
thereby he could secure the cliieftainship to liimself. When the 
Portuguese traders wish to pass into the country beyond Katalosa, 
they present him with about thirty-two yards of calico and some 
other goods, and he then gives them leave to pass in whatever 
direction they choose to go. They must, however, give certain 
quantities of cloth to a number of inferior chiefs beside, and they 
are subject to the game-laws. They have thus a body of ex- 
clusive tribes around them, preventing direct intercourse between 
them and the population beyond. It is strange that, when they 
had the power, they did not insist on the free navigation of the 
Zambesi. I can only account for this in the same way in which 
I accounted for a similar state of things in the west. All the 
traders have been in the hands of slaves, and have wanted that 
moral courage which a free man, with free servants on whom he 
can depend, usually possesses. If the English had been here, 
they would have insisted on the free navigation of tliis pathway 
as an indispensable condition of friendship. The present system 



Chap. XXXI. FORMER JESUIT ESTABLISHMENT. 643 

is a serious difficulty in the way of developing the resources of 
the country, and might prove fatal to an unarmed expedition. 
If this desirable and most fertile field of enterprise is ever to be 
opened up, men must proceed on a different plan from that 
winch has been followed, and I do not apprehend there would be 
much difficulty in commencing a new system, if those who 
undertook it insisted that it is not our custom to pay for a high- 
way which, has not been made by man. The natives themselves 
would not deny that the river is free to those who do not trade 
in slaves. If, hi addition to an open frank explanation, a small 
subsidy were given to the paramount chief, the willing consent of 
all the subordinates would soon be secured. 

On the 1st of April I went to see the site of a former establish- 
ment of the Jesuits, called Micombo, about ten miles S.E. of Tete. 
Like all their settlements I have seen, both judgment and taste 
had been employed in the selection of the site. A little stream 
of mineral water had been collected in a tank and conducted to 
their house, before winch was a little garden for raising vegetables 
at times of the year when no rain falls. It is now buried in a 
deep shady grove of mango-trees. I was accompanied by 
Captain Nunes, whose great-grandfather, also a Captain in the 
time of the Marquis of Pombal, received sealed orders, to be 
opened only on a certain day. When that day arrived, he found 
the command to go with Ins company, seize all the Jesuits of this 
establishment, and march them as prisoners to the coast The 
riches of the fraternity, winch were immense, were taken pos- 
session of by the state. Large quantities of gold had often been 
sent to their superiors at Goa, enclosed in images. The Jesuits 
here do not seem to have possessed the sympathies of the people 
as their brethren in Angola did. They were keen traders in 
ivory and gold-dust. All praise their industry. Whatever they 
did, they did it with all their might, and probably their successful 
labours in securing the clnef part of the trade to themselves, had 
excited the envy of the laity. None of the natives here can read ; 
and though the Jesuits are said to have translated some of the 
prayers mto the language of the country, I was unable to obtain 
a copy. The only religious teachers now in this part of the 
country are two gentlemen of colour, natives of Goa. The

graduate in Dogmatic Theology and Moral Philosophy. There 
is but a single school in Tete, and it is attended only by the native 
Portuguese children, who are taught to read and write. The 
black population is totally uncared for. The soldiers are marched 
every Sunday to hear mass, and but few others attend church. 
During the period of my stay, a kind of theatrical representation 
of our Saviour's passion and resurrection was performed. The 
images and other paraphernalia used were of great value, but the 
present riches of the church are nothing to what it once possessed. 
The Commandant is obliged to lock up all the gold and silver in 
the fort for safety, though not from any apprehension of its being 
stolen by the people, for they have a dread of sacrilege. 

The state of religion and education is, I am sorry to say, as low 
as that of commerce ; but the European Portuguese value educa- 
tion highly, and send their cliildren to Goa and elsewhere for 
instruction in the higher branches. There is not a single book- 
seller's shop, however, in either eastern or western Africa. Even 
Loanda, with its 12,000 or 14,000 souls, cannot boast of one store 
for the sale of food for the mind. 

On the 2nd the Zambesi suddenly rose several feet in height. 
Three such floods are expected annually, but this year there 
were four. Tins last was accompanied by discoloration, and 
must have been caused by another great fall of rain east of the 
ridge. We had observed a flood of discoloured water when we 
reached the river at the Kafue ; it then fell two feet, and from 
subsequent rains again rose so high, that we were obliged to 
leave it when opposite the hill Pinkwe. About the 10th of March 
the river rose several feet with comparatively clear water, and it 
continued to rise until the 21st, with but a very slight discolora- 
tion. Tins gradual rise was the greatest, and was probably caused 
by the water of inundation in the interior. The sudden rise 
which happened on the 2nd, being deeply discoloured, showed 
again the effect of rains at a comparatively short distance. The 
fact of the river rising tliree or four times annually, and the one 
flood of inundation being mixed with the others, may account for 
the Portuguese not recognising the phenomenon of the periodical 
inundation, so well known in the central country. 

The independent natives cultivate a little cotton, but it is not 
at all equal, either in quantity or quality, to what we found in 



Chap. XXXI. CONGE AND BUAZE. 645 

Angola. The pile is short, and it clings to the seed so much 
that they use an iron roller to detach it. The soil, however, is 
equal to the production of any tropical plant or fruit. The natives 
have never been encouraged to cultivate cotton for sale, nor has 
any new variety been introduced. We saw no palm-oil trees, the 
oil which is occasionally exported being from the ground-nut. 
One of the merchants of Tete had a mill of the rudest construction 
for grinding this nut, which was driven by donkeys. It was the 
only specimen of a machine I could exhibit to my men. A very 
superior land of salad-oil is obtained from the seeds of cucumbers, 
and is much used in native cookery. 

An offer, said to have been made by the ' Times/ having ex- 
cited attention even in this distant part, I asked the Commandant 
if he knew of any plant fit for the production of paper. He pro- 
cured specimens of the fibrous tissue of a species of aloe, named 
Conge', and some also from the root of a wild date, and, lastly, of a 
plant named Buaze, the fibres of which, though useless for the 
manufacture of paper, are probably a suitable substitute for flax. I 
submitted a small quantity of these fibres to Messrs. Pye, Brothers, 
of London, who have invented a superior mode for the preparation 
of such tissues for the manufacturer. They most politely under- 
took the examination, and have given a favourable opinion of 
the Buaze, as may be seen in the note below.* 

* 80, Lombard Street, 20th March, 1857. 
Dear Sir, — We have now the pleasure to return you the specimens of 
fibrous plants from the Zambesi river, on which you were desirous to see the 
effects of our treatment ; we therefore enclose you, 

No. 1. Buaze, in the state received from you. 
1 A. Do. as prepared by us. 

1 B. The tow which has come from it in hackling. 

No. 2. Conge, as received from you. 

2 A. Do. as prepared by us. 

With regard to both these fibres, we must state that the very minute 
quantity of each specimen has prevented our subjecting them to anything like 
the full treatment of our process, and we can therefore only give you an 
approximate idea of their value. 

The Buaze evidently possesses a very strong and fine fibre, assimilating to 
flax in its character, but we believe, when treated in quantity by our process, 
it would show both a stronger and finer fibre than flax ; but being unable to 
apply the rolling or pressing processes with any efficiency to so very small 
a quantity, the gums are not yet so perfectly extracted as they would be, nor 
the fibre opened out to so fine a quality as it would then exhibit. yy g

THE BUAZE. 



Chap. XXXI. 



A representation of the plant is given in the annexed woodcut, 
as a help to its identification. I was unable to procure either the 

flowers or fruit, but, as it is 
not recognised at sight by that 
accomplished botanist and 
eminent traveller, Dr. J. D. 
Hooker, it may safely be con- 
cluded that it is quite unknown 
to botanists. It is stated by 
the Portuguese to grow in 
large quantities in the Maravi 
country north of the Zambesi, 
but it is not cultivated, and 
the only known use it has 
been put to, is in making 
threads on which the natives 
string their beads. Elsewhere 
the split tendons of animals 
are employed for this purpose. 
This seems to be of equal 
strength, for a firm thread of 
The Bu^ze. it feels like catgut in the hand, 

and would rather cut the fingers than break. 

This i3 even yet more the case with the Conge, which, being naturally a 
harsh fibre, full of gums, wants exactly that powerful treatment which our 
process is calculated to give it, but which cannot be applied to such miniature 
specimens. We do not therefore consider this as more than half treated, its 
fibre consequently remaining yet harsh, and coarse, and stiff, as compared with 
what it would be if treated in quantity. 

Judging that it would be satisfactory to you to be in possession of the best 
practical opinion to be obtained on such a subject, we took the liberty of 
forwarding your little specimens to Messrs. Marshall, of Leeds, who have 
kindly favoured us with the following observations on them : — 

" We have examined the samples you sent us yesterday, and think the 
Conge or aloe fibre would be of no use to us, but the Buaze fibre appears to 
resemble flax, and as prepared by you will be equal to flax worth 501. or 607. 
per ton, but we could hardly speak positively to the value unless we had 
1 cwt. or 2 cwt. to try on our machinery. However, we think the result is 
promising, and we hope further inquiry will be made as to the probable supply 
of the material." 

We arc, dear Sir, 

Your very obedient servants, 

TJie. Rev. Dr. Livingstone. Pye, Brothers. 







Chap. XXXI. CINCHONA BARK. C47 

Having waited a month for the commencement of the healthy 
season at Kilimane, I would have started at the beginning of 
April, but tarried a few days in order that the moon might make 
her appearance, and enable me to take lunar observations on my 
way down the river. A sudden change of temperature happening 
on the 4th, simultaneously with the appearance of the new moon, 
the Commandant and myself, with nearly every person in the 
house, were laid up with a severe attack of fever. I soon re- 
covered by the use of my wonted remedies, but Major Sicard and 
his little boy were confined much longer. There was a general 
fall of 4° of temperature from the middle of March, 84° at 9 a.m. 
and 87° at 9 p.m. ; the greatest heat being 90° at mid-day, and 
the lowest 81° at sunrise. It afforded me pleasure to attend the 
invalids in their sickness, though I was unable to show a tithe of 
the gratitude I felt for the Commandant's increasing kindness. 
My quinine and other remedies were nearly all expended, and 
no fresh supply was to be found here, there being no doctors at 
Tete, and only one apothecary with the troops, whose stock of 
medicine was also small. The Portuguese, however, informed 
me that they had the cinchona bark growing in their country — 
that there was a little of it to be found at Tete — whole forests of 
it at Senna and near the delta of Kilimane. It seems quite a 
providential arrangement, that the remedy for fever should be 
found in the greatest abundance where it is most needed. On 
seeing the leaves, I stated that it was not the Cinchona longifolia, 
from which it is supposed the quinine of commerce is extracted, 
but the name and properties of this bark made me imagine that 
it was a cinchonaceous tree. I could not get the flower, but when 
I went to Senna I tried to bring away a few small living trees 
with earth in a box. They, however, all died when we came to 
Kilimane. Failing in tins mode of testing the point, I submitted 
a few leaves and seed-vessels to my friend, Dr. Hooker, who 
kindly informs me that they belong " apparently to an apocy- 
neous plant, very nearly allied to the Malouetia Heudlotii (of 
Decaisne), a native of Senegambia." Dr. H. adds, " Various 
plants of this natural order are reputed powerful febrifuges, and 
some of them are said to equal the cinchona in their effects." 
It is called in the native tongue Kumbanzo. 

The flowers are reported to be white. The pods are in pairs, a

foot or fifteen inches in length, and contain a groove on their 
inner sides. The thick soft bark of the root is the part used by 
the natives, the Portuguese use that of the tree itself. I imme- 
diately began to use a decoction of the bark of the root, and my 
men found it so efficacious, that they collected small quantities of 
it for themselves, and kept it in little bags for future use. Some 
of them said that they knew it in their own country, but I never 
happened to observe it. The decoction is given after the first 
paroxysm of the complaint is over. The Portuguese believe it to 
have the same effects as the quinine, and it may prove a substi- 
tute for that invaluable medicine. 

There are numbers of other medicines in use among the na- 
tives, but I have always been obliged to regret want of time to 
ascertain which were useful, and which of no value. We find a 
medicine in use by a tribe in one part of the country, and the 



Chap. XXXI. NATIVE MEDICINES. 649 

same plant employed by a tribe a thousand miles distant. This 
surely must arise from some inherent virtue in the plant. The 
Boers under Potgeiter visited Delgoa Bay for the first time 
about ten years ago, in order to secure a port on the east coast 
for their republic. They had come from a part of the interior 
where the disease called croup occasionally prevails. There was 
no appearance of the disease amongst them at the period of then- 
visit, but the Portuguese inhabitants of that bay found that 
they had left it among them, and several adults were cut off 
by a form of the complaint called Laryngismus stridulus, the 
disease of which the great Washington died. Similar cases have 
occurred in the South Sea Islands. Ships have left diseases, from 
which no one on board was suffering at the time of their visit. 
Many of the inhabitants here, were cut down, usually in three 
days from their first attack, until a native doctor adopted the 
plan of scratching the root of the tongue freely with a certain 
root, and giving a piece of it to be chewed. The cure may have 
been effected by the scarification only, but the Portuguese have 
the strongest faith in the virtues of the root, and always keep 
some of it within reach. 

There are also other plants which the natives use in the treat- 
ment of fever, and some of them produce diaphoresis in a short 
space of time. It is certain that we have got the knowledge of 
the most potent febrifuge in our pharmacopoeia from the natives 
of another country. We have no cure for cholera and some other 
diseases. It might be worth the investigation of those who visit 
Africa to try and find other remedies in a somewhat similar 
way to that in which we found the quinine.* 

* I add the native names of a few of their remedies in order to assist the 
inquirer : — Mupanda panda : this is used in fever for producing perspiration ; 
the leaves are named Chirussa ; the roots dye red and are very astringent. 
Goho or Goo : this is the ordeal medicine ; it is both purgative and emetic. 
Mutuva or Mutumbue : this plant contains so much oil that it serves as lights 
in Londa ; it is an emollient drink for the cure of coughs, and the pounded 
leaves answer as soap to wash the head. Nyamucu ucu has a curious soften- 
ing effect on old dry grain. Mussakasi is believed to remove the effects 
of the Goo. Mudama is a stringent vermifuge. Mapubuza dyes a red colour. 
Musikizi yields an oil. Shinkondo : a virulent poison ; the Maravi use it in 
their ordeal, and it is very fatal. Kanunka utare is said to expel serpents and 
rats by its pungent smell, which is not at all disagreeable to man ; this is 
probably a kind of Zanthoxylon, perhaps the Z. melancantha of Western 



650 AFRICAN IEON. Chap. XXXI. 

The only other metal, besides gold, we have in abundance in 
this region, is iron, and that is of excellent quality. In some 
places it is obtained from what is called the specular iron ore, 
and also from black oxide. The latter has been well roasted in 
the operations of nature, and contains a large proportion of the 
metal. It occurs generally in tears or rounded lumps, and is but 
slightly magnetic. When found in the beds of rivers, the natives 
know of its existence by the quantity of oxide on the surface, and 
they find no difficulty in digging it with pointed sticks. They 
consider English iron as " rotten ;" and I have seen, when a 
javelin of their own iron lighted on the cranium of a hippopota- 
mus, it curled up like the proboscis of a butterfly, and the 
owner would prepare it for future use by straightening it cold 
with two stones. I brought home some of the hoes which Seke- 
letu gave me to purchase a canoe, also some others obtained in 
Kilimane, and they have been found of such good quality that 

Africa, as it is used to expel rats and serpents there. Mussonzoa dyes cloth 
black. Mussio : the beans of this also dye black. Kangome, with flowers and 
fruit like Mocha coffee ; the leaves are much like those of the sloe, and the seeds 
are used as coffee or eaten as beans. Kanembe-embe : the pounded leaves used 
as an extemporaneous glue for mending broken vessels. Katunguru is used for 
killing fish. Mutavea Nyerere : an active caustic. Mudiacoro : also an external 
caustic, and used internally. Kapande : another ordeal plant, but used to 
produce diaphoresis. Karumgasura : also diaphoretic. Munyazi yields an oil, 
and is one of the ingredients for curing the wounds of poisoned arrows. 
Uombue : a large root, employed in killing fish. Kakumate : used in inter- 
mittents. Musheteko : applied to ulcers ; and the infusi6n also internally in 
amenorrhcea. Inyakanyanya : this is seen in small dark-coloured crooked 
roots of pleasant aromatic smell and slightly bitter taste, and is highly extolled 
in the treatment of fever ; it is found in Manfca. Eskinencia : used in croup 
and sore-throat. Itaca, or Itaka : for diaphoresis in fever ; this root is brought 
as an article of barter by the Arabs to Kilimane ; the natives purchase it 
eagerly. Mukundukundu : a decoction used as a febrifuge in the same way as 
quinine ; it grows plentifully at Shupanga, and the wood is used as masts for 
launches. I may here add the recipe of Brother Pedro of Zumbo for the cure 
of poisoned wounds, in order to show the similarity of practice among the 
natives of the Zambesi, from whom in all probability he acquired his know- 
ledge, and the Bushmen of the Kalahari. It consists of equal parts of the roots 
of the Calumba, Musheteko, Abutua, Batatinya, Paregekanto, Itaka, or Kapande, 
put into a bottle and covered with common castor-oil. As I have before 
observed, I believe the oily ingredient is the effectual one, and ought to be 
tried by any one who has the misfortune to get wounded by a Bushman's or 
Banyai arrow. 



Chap. XXXI. AFRICAN IRON. G51 

a friend of inine in Birmingham lias made an Enfield rifle of 
them.* 

The iron ore exists in great abundance, but I did not find any 
limestone in its immediate vicinity. So far as I could learn, there 
is neither copper nor silver. Malachite is worked by the people of 
Cazembe, but, as I did not see it, nor any other metal, I can say 
nothing about it. A few precious stones are met with, and some 
parts are quite covered with agates. The mineralogy of the 
district, however, has not been explored by any one competent to 
the task. 

When my friend the Commandant was fairly recovered, and I 
myself felt strong again, I prepared to descend the Zambesi. A 
number of my men were out elephant-hunting, and others had 
established a brisk trade in firewood, as their countrymen did at 
Loanda. I chose sixteen of those who could manage canoes to 

* The following remarks are by a practical blacksmith, one of the most 
experienced men in the gun trade. In this trade various qualities of iron are 
used, and close attention is required to secure for each purpose the quality of 
iron peculiarly adapted to it : — 

The iron in the two spades strongly resembles Swedish or Russian ; it is 
highly carbonised. 

The same qualities are found in both spades. 

When chilled in water it has all the properties of steel : see the piece marked 
I, chilled at one end, and left soft at the other. 

When worked hot it is very malleable ; but cold, it breaks quite short and 
brittle. 

The great irregularity found in the working of the iron, affords evidence that 
it has been prepared by inexperienced hands. 

This is shown in the bending of the small spade ; the thick portion retains 
its crystallised nature, while the thin part has been changed by the hammer- 
ing it has undergone. 

The large spade shows a very brittle fracture. 

The iron is too brittle for gun-work ; it would be liable to break. 

This iron, if repeatedly heated and hammered, would become decarbonised, 
and would then possess the qualities found in the spear-head, which, after 
being curled up by being struck against a hard substance, was restored by 
hammering to its original form without injury. 

The piece of iron marked II is a piece of gun-iron of fibrous quality, such as 
will bend without breaking. 

The piece marked III is of crystalline quality ; it has been submitted to a 
process which has changed it to IIII ; III and MI are cut from the same bar. 
The spade-iron has been submitted to the same process, but no corresponding 
effect can be produced.

convey me down the river. Many more would have come, but 
we were informed that there had been a failure of the crops at 
Kihrnane from the rains not coming at the proper time, and 
thousands had died of hunger. I did not hear of a single effort 
having been made to relieve the famishing by sending them food 
down the river. Those who perished were mostly slaves, and 
others seemed to think that their masters ought to pay for their 
relief. The sufferers were chiefly among those natives who 
inhabit the delta, and who are subject to the Portuguese. They 
are in a state of slavery, but are kept on farms and mildly 
treated. Many yield a certain rental of grain only to their 
owners, and are otherwise free. Eight thousand are said to have 
perished. Major Sicard lent me a boat which had been built on 
the river, and sent also Lieutenant Miranda to conduct me to the 
coast. 

A Portuguese lady who had come with her brother from 
Lisbon, having been suffering for some days from a severe attack 
of fever, died about 3 o'clock in the morning of the 20th of 
April. The heat of the body having continued unabated till 
6 o'clock, I was called in, and found her bosom quite as warm 
as I ever did in a living case of fever. This continued for 
three hours more. As I had never seen a case in winch fever- 
heat continued so long after death, I delayed the funeral until 
unmistakeable symptoms of dissolution occurred. She was a 
widow, only twenty-two years of age, and had been ten years in 
Africa. I attended the funeral in the evening, and was struck by 
the custom of the country. A number of slaves preceded us, and 
fired off many rounds of gunpowder in front of the body. When 
a person of much popularity is buried, all the surrounding chiefs 
send deputations to fire over the grave. On one occasion at 
Tete, more than thirty barrels of gunpowder were expended. 
Early in the morning of the 21st the slaves of the deceased 
lady's brother went round the village making a lamentation, and 
drums were beaten all day, as they are at such times among the 
heathen. 

The Commandant provided for the journey most abundantly, 
and gave orders to Lieutenant Miranda that I should not be 
allowed to pay for anything all the way to the coast, and sent 
messages to his friends Senhors Ferrao, Isidore, Asevedo, and

Nunes, to treat me as they would himself. From every one of 
these gentlemen I am happy to acknowledge that I received most 
disinterested kindness, and I ought to speak well for ever of 
Portuguese hospitality. I have noted each little act of civility 
received, because somehow or other we have come to hold the 
Portuguese character in rather a low estimation. This may have 
arisen partly from the pertinacity with which some of them have 
pursued the slave-trade, and partly from the contrast which they 
now offer to then illustrious ancestors — the foremost navigators 
of the world. If my specification of their kindnesses will tend to 
engender a more respectful feeling to the nation, I shall consider 
myself well rewarded. We had three large canoes in the com- 
pany winch had lately come up with goods from Senna. They 
are made very large and strong, much larger than any we ever 
saw in the ulterior, and might strike with great force against a 
rock and not be broken. The men sit at the stern when paddling, 
and there is usually a little shed made over a part of the canoe to 
shade the passengers from the smi. The boat hi which I went 
was furnished with such a covering, so I sat quite comfortably.

We left Tete at noon on the 22nd, and in the afternoon arrived 
at the garden of Senhor A. Manoel de Gomes, son-in-law and 
nephew of Bonga. The Commandant of Tete had sent a letter 
to the rebel Bonga, stating that he ought to treat me kindly, and 
he had deputed his son-in-law to be my host. Bonga is not at all 
equal to his father Nyaude, who was a man of great ability. He 
is also in bad odour with the Portuguese, because he receives all 
runaway slaves and criminals. He does not trust the Portuguese, 
and is reported to be excessively superstitious. I found his son- 
in-law, Manoel, extremely friendly, and able to converse in a very 
intelligent manner. He was in his garden when we arrived, but 
soon dressed liimself respectably, and gave us a good tea and dinner. 






Chap. XXXII. GORGE AND RANGE OF LUPATA. G55 

After a breakfast of tea, roasted eggs, and biscuits next morning, 
he presented six fowls and three goats as provisions for the journey. 
When we parted from him we passed the stockade of Bonga at 
the confluence of the Luenya, but did not go near it, as he is said 
to be very suspicious. The Portuguese advised me not to take 
any observation, as the instruments might awaken fears in Bonga's 
mind, but Manoel said I might do so if I wished ; his garden, 
however, being above the confluence, could not avail as a geo- 
graphical point. There are some good houses in the stockade. 
The trees of which it is composed, seemed to me to be living and 
could not be burned. It was strange to see a stockade menacing 
the whole commerce of the river in a situation where the guns of 
a vessel would have full play on it, but it is a formidable affair for 
those who have only muskets. On one occasion, when Nyaude 
was attacked by Kisaka, they fought for weeks; and though 
Nyaude was reduced to cutting up his copper anklets for balls, Ins 
enemies were not able to enter the stockade. 

On the 24th we sailed only about three hours, as we had done 
the day before ; but having come to a small island at the western 
entrance of the gorge of Lupata, where Dr. Lacerda is said to have 
taken an astronomical observation, and called it the island of Mo- 
zambique, because it was believed to be in the same latitude, or 
15° 1', I wished to verify his position and remained over night ; 
my informants must have been mistaken, for I found the island 
of Mozambique here to be, lat. 16° 34' 46" S., long. 33° 51' E. 

Respecting tins range, to which the gorge has given a name, 
some Portuguese writers have stated it to be so high that snow 
lies on it during the whole year, and that it is composed of 
marble. It is not so high in appearance as the Campsie Hills 
when seen from the Yale of Clyde. The western side is the most 
abrupt, and gives the idea of the greatest height, as it rises up 
perpendicularly from the water six or seven hundred feet. As 
seen from tins little island, it is certainly no higher than Arthur's 
Seat appears from Prince's-street, Edinburgh. The rock is com- 
pact siliceous schist of a slightly reddish colour, and in thin 
strata ; the island on which we slept, looks as if torn off from 
the opposite side of the gorge, for the strata are twisted and 
torn in every direction. The eastern side of the range is 
much more sloping than the western, covered with trees, and 



656 THE RIVER AND ISLANDS. Chap. XXXII. 

does not give the idea of altitude so much as the western. It 
extends a considerable way into the Maganja country in the north, 
and then bends round towards the river again, and ends in the 
lofty mountain Morumbala, opposite Senna. On the other or 
southern side it is straighter, but is said to end in Gorongozo, a 
mountain west of the same point. The person who called this 
Lupata " the spine of the world," evidently did not mean to say 
that it was a translation of the word, for it means a defile or gorge 
having perpendicular walls. This range does not deserve the 
name of either Cordillera or Spine, unless we are willing to believe 
that the world has a very small, and very crooked " back-bone." 

We passed through the gorge in two hours, and found it rather 
tortuous, and between 200 and 300 yards wide. The river is said 
to be here always excessively deep ; it seemed to me that a 
steamer could pass through it at full speed. At the eastern 
entrance of Lupata stand two conical hills ; they are composed of 
porphyry, having large square crystals therein. These hills are 
called Moenda en Goma, wliich means a footprint of a wild beast. 
Another conical lull on the opposite bank is named Kasisi (priest), 
from having a bald top. We sailed on quickly with the current 
of the river, and found that it spread out to more than two miles 
in breadth : it is, however, full of islands, wliich are generally 
covered with reeds, and wliich, previous to the war, were inhabited, 
and yielded vast quantities of grain. We usually landed to cook 
breakfast, and then went on quickly. The breadth of water 
between the islands was now quite sufficient for a sailing-vessel 
to tack, and work her sails in; the prevailing winds would 
blow her up the stream ; but I regretted that I had not come 
when the river was at its lowest rather than at its highest. The 
testimony, however, of Captam Parker and Lieutenant Hoskins, 
hereafter to be noticed, may be considered conclusive as to the 
capabilities of this river for commercial purposes. The Portu- 
guese state that there is high water during five months of the 
year, and when it is low there is always a channel of deep 
water. But this is veiy winding; and as the river wears 
away some of the islands and forms others, the course of the 
channel is often altered. I suppose that an accurate chart of it 
made in one year would not be very reliable the next ; but I 
believe, from all that I can learn, that the river could be navigated 



Chap. XXXII. WAE-DRUM AT SHIKAMBA. 657 

in a small flat-bottomed steamer during the whole } r ear as far as 
Tete. At this time, a steamer of large size could have floated 
easily. The river was measured at the latter place by the 
Portuguese, and found by them to be 1050 yards broad. The 
body of water flowing past when I was there was very great, and 
the breadth it occupied when amongst the islands, had a most 
imposing effect. I could not get a glimpse of either shore. All 
the right bank beyond Lupata is low and flat : on the north, the 
ranges of hills and dark lines below them are seen, but from the 
boat it is impossible to see the shore. I only guess the breadth 
of the river to be two miles, it is probably more. Next day we 
landed at Shiramba for breakfast, having sailed Si hours from 
Lupata. This was once the residence of a Portuguese brigadier, 
who spent large sums of money in embellishing his house and 
gardens : these we found in entire ruin, as his half-caste son had 
destroyed all and then rebelled against the Portuguese, but with 
less success than either Nyaude or Kisaka, for he had been seized 
and sent a prisoner to Mozambique a short time before our visit. 
All the southern shore has been ravaged by the Caffres, who are 
here named Landeens, and most of the inhabitants who remain, 
acknowledge the authority of Bonga and not of the Portuguese. 
When at breakfast, the people of Shiramba commenced beating 
the drum of war. Lieutenant Miranda, who was well acquainted 
with the customs of the country, immediately started to his feet, 
and got all the soldiers of our party under arms: he then 
demanded of the natives why the drum was beaten while we were 
there. They gave an evasive reply; and as they employ this 
means of collecting their neighbours when they intend to rob 
canoes, our watchfulness may have prevented their proceeding 
further. 

We spent the night of the 26th on the island called Nkuesi, 
opposite a remarkable saddle-shaped mountain, and found that 
we were just on the 17th parallel of latitude. The sail clown the 
river was very fine ; the temperature becoming low, it was pleasant 
to the feelings ; but the shores being flat and far from us, the 
scenery was uninteresting. We breakfasted on the 27th at Pita, 
and found some half-caste Portuguese had established themselves 
there, after fleeing from the opposite bank to escape Kisaka's 
people, who were now ravaging all the Maganja country. On the 

2 u 



658 SENNA : ITS RUINOUS STATE. Chap. XXXII. 

afternoon of the 27th we arrived at Senna. (Commandant Isi- 
dore's house, 300 yards S.W. of the mud fort on the banks of the 
river : lat. 17° 27' 1" S., long. 35° 10' E.) We foimd Senna to 
be twenty-three and a half hours' sail from Tete. We had the 
current entirely in our favour, but met various parties in large 
canoes toiling laboriously against it. They use long ropes and 
pull the boats from the shore. They usually take about twenty 
days to ascend the distance we had descended in about four. 
The wages paid to boatmen are considered high. Part of the 
men who had accompanied me, gladly accepted employment 
from Lieutenant Miranda, to take a load of goods in a canoe from 
Senna to Tete. 

I thought the state of Tete quite lamentable, but that of 
Senna was ten times worse. At Tete there is some life ; here 
everything is in a state of stagnation and ruin. The fort, built 
of sun-dried bricks, has the grass growing over the walls, which 
have been patched in some places by paling. The Landeens 
visit the village periodically, and levy fines upon the inhabitants, 
as they consider the Portuguese a conquered tribe, and very 
rarely does a native come to trade. Senlior Isidore, the Com- 
mandant, a man of considerable energy, had proposed to surround 
the whole village with palisades as a protection against the 
Landeens, and the villagers were to begin this work the day after 
I left. It was sad to look at the ruin manifest in every building, 
but the half-castes appear to be in league with the rebels and 
Landeens ; for when any attempt is made by the Portuguese to 
coerce the enemy or defend themselves, information is conveyed at 
once to the Landeen camp, and, though the Commandant prohibits 
the payment of tribute to the Landeens, on their approach the half- 
castes eagerly ransom themselves. When I was there, a party of 
Kisaka's people were ravaging the fine country on the opposite 
shore. They came down with the prisoners they had captured, 
and forthwith the half-castes of Senna went over to buy slaves. 
Encouraged by this, Kisaka's people came over into Senna fully 
armed and beating their drums, and were received into the house 
of a native Portuguese. They had the village at their mercy, 
yet could have been driven off by half a dozen policemen. The 
Commandant could only look on with bitter sorrow. He had 
soldiers, it is true, but it is notorious that the native militia of 



Chap. XXXII. ATTEMPTS TO REVIVE TRADE. 659 

both Senna and Kilimane never think of standing to fight, but 
invariably run away, and leave then officers to be killed. They 
are brave only among the peaceable inhabitants. One of them 
sent from Kiliinane with a packet of letters or expresses, arrived 
while I was at Senna. He had been charged to deliver them 
with all speed, but Senhor Isidore had in the mean time gone to 
Kilimane, remained there a fortnight, and reached Senna again 
before the courier came. He could not punish him. We gave 
him a passage hi our boat, but he left us in the way to visit his 
wife, and, " on urgent private business," probably gave up the 
service altogether, as he did not come to Kilimane all the time 
I was there. It is impossible to describe the miserable state 
of decay into wliich the Portuguese possessions here have sunk. 
The revenues are not equal to the expenses, and every officer 
I met told the same tale, that he had not received one farthing 
of pay for the last four years. They are all forced to engage 
in trade for the support of their families. Senlior Miranda had 
been actually engaged against the enemy during these four 
years, and had been highly lauded in the Commandant's des- 
patches to the Home Government; but when he applied to the 
Governor of Kilimane for part of Ins four years' pay, he offered 
him twenty dollars only. Miranda resigned his commission in 
consequence. The common soldiers sent out from Portugal re- 
ceived some pay in . calico. They all marry native women, and 
the soil being very fertile, the wives find but little difficulty in 
supporting then husbands. There is no direct trade with Por- 
tugal. A considerable number of Banians, or natives of India, 
come annually in small vessels with cargoes of English and 
Indian goods from Bombay. It is not to be wondered at then, 
that there have been attempts made of late years by speculative 
Portuguese in Lisbon, to revive the trade of Eastern Africa by 
means of mercantile companies. One was formally proposed, 
which was modelled on the plan of our East India Company; and 
it was actually imagined that all the forts, harbours, lands, &c, 
might be delivered over to a company, which would bind itself 
to develop the resources of the country, build schools, make 
roads, improve harbours, &c, and after all leave the Portuguese 
the option of resuming possession. 

Another effort has been made to attract commercial enterprise 

2 u 2 



660 COUNTRY ROUND SENNA. Chap. XXXII. 

to this region, by offering any mining company permission to 
search for the ores and work them. Such a company, however, 
would gain but little in the way of protection or aid from the 
government of Mozambique, as that can but barely maintain 
a hold on its own small possessions ; the condition affixed of 
importing at the company's own cost a certain number of 
Portuguese from the island of Madeira or the Azores, in order 
to increase the Portuguese population in Africa, is impolitic. 
Taxes would also be levied on the minerals exported. It is 
noticeable that all the companies which have been proposed 
in Portugal have this put prominently in the preamble, " and 
for the abolition of the inhuman slave-trade." This shows, 
either that the statesmen in Portugal are enlightened and phi- 
lanthropic, or it may be meant as a trap for English capitalists ; 
I incline to believe the former. If the Portuguese really wish 
to develop the resources of the rich country beyond their pos- 
sessions, they ought to invite the co-operation of other nations 
on equal terms with themselves. Let the pathway into the 
interior be free to all ; and, instead of wretched forts, with 
scarcely an acre of land around them which can be called their 
own, let real colonies be made. If, instead of military establish- 
ments, we had civil ones, and saw emigrants going out with their 
wives, ploughs, and seeds, rather than military convicts with 
bugles and kettle-drums, we might hope for a return of prospe- 
rity to Eastern Africa. 

The village of Senna stands on the right bank of the Zambesi. 
There are many reedy islands in front of it, and there is much 
bush in the country adjacent. The soil is fertile ; but the village, 
being in a state of ruin, and having several pools of stagnant 
water, is very unhealthy. The bottom rock is the akose of 
Brongniart, or granitic grit, and several conical hills of trap have 
burst through it. One standing about half a mile west of the 
village is called Baramuana, which has another behind it ; hence 
the name, which means " carry a child on the back." It is 300 
or 400 feet high, and on the top lie two dismounted cannon, 
which were used to frighten away the Landeens, who in one 
attack upon Senna killed 150 of the inhabitants. The prospect 
from Baramuana is very fine ; below, on the eastward, lies the 
Zambesi, with the village of Senna ; and some twenty or thirty 



Chap. XXXII. JESUIT STATION. 661 

miles beyond stands the lofty mountain Morumbala, probably 
3000 or 4000 feet high. It is of an oblong shape, and from its 
physiognomy, which can be distinctly seen when the sun is in 
the west, is evidently igneous. On the northern end there is a 
hot sulphurous fountain, which my Portuguese friends refused 
to allow me to visit, because the mountain is well peopled, and 
the mountaineers are at present not friendly with the Portu- 
guese. They have plenty of garden-ground and running water 
on its summit. My friends at Senna declined the responsibility 
of taking me into danger. To the north of Morumbala we have 
a fine view of the mountains of the Maganja ; they here come 
close to the river and terminate in Morumbala. Many of them 
are conical, and the Shire is reported to flow amongst them, and 
to run on the Senna side of Morumbala, before joining the 
Zambesi. On seeing the confluence afterwards, close to a low 
range of hills beyond Morumbala, I felt inclined to doubt the 
report, as the Shire must then flow parallel with the Zambesi, 
from which Morumbala seems distant only twenty or thirty 
miles. All around to the south-east, the country is flat, and 
covered with forest, but near Senna a number of little abrupt 
conical hills diversify the scenery. To the west and north the 
country is also flat forest, winch gives it a sombre appearance ; but 
just in the haze of the horizon south-west by south, there rises a 
mountain range equal in height to Morumbala, and called Nya- 
inonga. In a clear day, another range beyond this may be seen, 
which is Gorongozo, once a station of the Jesuits. Gorongozo 
is famed for its clear cold waters and healthiness, and there are 
some inscriptions engraved on large square slabs on the top of 
the mountain, which have probably baen the work of the fathers. 
As this lies in the direction of a district between Manica and 
Sofala, which has been conjectured to be the Ophir of King Solo- 
mon, the idea that first sprang up in my mind was, that these 
monuments might be more ancient than the Portuguese ; but on 
questioning some persons who had seen them, I found that they 
were in Koman characters, and did not deserve a journey of six 
days to see them. 

Manica lies three days north-west of Gorongozo, and is the 
best gold country known in Eastern Africa. The only evidence 
the Portuguese have of its being the ancient Ophir, is, that at 



662 BOAT-BUILDING. Chap. XXXII. 

Sofala, its nearest port, pieces of wrought gold have been dug 
up near the fort, and in the gardens. They also report the 
existence of hewn stones in the neighbourhood, but these cannot 
have been abundant, for all the stones of the fort of Sofala are 
said to have been brought from Portugal. Natives whom I met 
in the country of Sekeletu, from Manica, or Manoa, as they call 
it, state that there are several caves hi the country, and walls of 
hewn stone, which they believe to have been made by their ances- 
tors ; and there is, according to the Portuguese, a small tribe of 
Arabs there, who have become completely like the other natives. 
Two rivers, the Motirikwe and Sabia, or Sabe, run through their 
country into the sea. The Portuguese were driven out of the 
country by the Landeens, but now talk of re-occupying Manica. 
The most pleasant sight I witnessed at Senna was the negroes 
of Senhor Isidore building boats, after the European model, with- 
out any one to superintend their operations. They had been in- 
structed by a European master, but now go into the forest and 
cut down the motondo-trees, lay down the keel, fit in the ribs, 
and make very neat boats and launches, valued at from 20£. to 
100£. Senhor Isidore had some of them instructed also in car- 
pentry at Kio Janeiro, and they constructed for him the hand- 
somest house in Kilimane, the woodwork being all of country 
trees, some of which are capable of a fine polish, and very 
durable. A medical opinion having been asked by the Com- 
mandant respecting a better site for the village, which, lying on 
the low bank of the Zambesi, is very unhealthy, I recommended 
imitation of the Jesuits, who had chosen the high healthy 
mountain of Gorongozo, and to select a new site on Morumbala, 
which is perfectly healthy, well watered, and where the Shire is 
deep enough for the purpose of navigation at its base. As the 
next resource, I proposed removal to the harbour of Mitilone, 
which is at one of the mouths of the Zambesi, a much better 
port than Kilimane, and where, if they must have the fever, 
they would be in the way of doing more good to themselves and 
the country than they can do in their present situation. Had 
the Portuguese possessed this territory as a real colony, this 
important point would not have been left unoccupied ; as it is, 
there is not even a native village placed at the entrance of this 
splendid river to show the way in. 



Chap. XXXII. CAPTURE OF A BEBEL STOCKADE. 663 

On the 9th of May sixteen of my men Were employed to carry 
government goods in canoes up to Tete. They were much 
pleased at getting this work. On the 11th the whole of the 
inhabitants of Senna, with the Commandant, accompanied us to 
the boats. A venerable old man, son of a judge, said they were 
in much sorrow on account of the miserable state of decay into 
which they had sunk, and of the insolent conduct of the people 
of Kisaka, now in the village. We were abundantly supplied 
with provisions by the Commandant and Senhor Ferrao, and 
sailed pleasantly down the broad river. About thirty miles 
below Senna, we passed the mouth of the river Zangwe on our 
right, which farther up goes by the name of Pungwe ; and about 
five miles farther on our left, close to the end of a low range into 
which Morumbala merges, we crossed the mouth of the Shire, 
which seemed to be about 200 yards broad. A little inland 
from the confluence there is another rebel stockade, whicli was 
attacked by Ensign Rebeiro with three European soldiers, and 
captured ; they disarmed the rebels and threw the guns into the 
water. This Ensign and Miranda volunteered to disperse the 
people of Kisaka, who were riding roughshod over the inha- 
bitants of Senna ; but the offer was declined, the few real Portu- 
guese fearing the disloyal half-castes among whom they dwelt. 
Slavery and immorality have here done their work ; nowhere 
else does the European name stand at so low an ebb ; but what 
can be expected ? Few Portuguese women are ever taken to 
the colonies, and here I did not observe that honourable regard 
for the offspring which I noticed in Angola. The son of a late 
Governor of Tete was pointed out to me in the condition and 
habit of a slave. There is neither priest nor school at Senna, 
though there are ruins of churches and convents. 

On passing the Shire, we observed great quantities of the 
plant Alfacinya, already mentioned, floating down into the Zam- 
besi. It is probably the Pistia stratiotes, a gigantic "duck- 
weed." It was mixed with quantities of another aquatic plant, 
which the Barotse named " Njefu," containing in the petiole of 
the leaf a pleasant-tasted nut. This was so esteemed by Sebitu- 
ane, that he made it part of his tribute from the subjected tribes. 
Dr. Hooker kindly informs me that the njefu " is probably a 
species of Trapa, the nuts of which are eaten in the south of 



664 THE NJEFU — MAZARO. Chap. XXXII. 

Europe and in India. Government derives a large revenue from 
them in Kashmir, amounting to 12,000?. per annum for 128,000 
ass-loads ! The ancient Thracians are said to have eaten them 
largely. In the south of France they are called water-chesnuts." 
The existence of these plants in such abundance in the Shire, 
may show that it flows from large collections of still water. We 
found them growing in all the still branches and lagoons of the 
Leeambye in the far north, and there also we met a beautiful 
little floating plant, the Azolla nilotica, which is found in the 
upper Nile. They are seldom seen in flowing streams. 

A few miles beyond the Shire we left the hills entirely, and 
sailed between extensive flats. The banks seen in the distance 
are covered with trees. We slept on a large inhabited island, 
and then came to the entrance of the river Mutu (lat. 18° 3' 37" 
S., long. 35° 46' E.) : the point of departure is called Mazaro, or 
" mouth of the Mutu." The people who live on the north are 
called Baroro, and their country Bororo. The whole of the right 
bank is in subjection to the Landeens, who, it was imagined, would 
levy a tribute upon us, for this they are accustomed to do to 
passengers. I regret that we did not meet them, for, though they 
are named Caffres, I am not sure whether they are of the Zulu 
family or of the Mashona. I should have liked to form their 
acquaintance, and to learn what they really think of white men. 
I understood from Sekwebu, and from one of Changamera's 
people who lives at Linyanti, and was present at the attack on 
Senna, that they consider the whites as a conquered tribe. 

The Zambesi at Mazaro is a magnificent river, more than 
half a mile wide and without islands. The opposite bank is 
covered with forests of fine timber ; but the delta which begins 
here, is only an immense flat covered with high coarse grass 
and reeds, with here and there a few mango and cocoa-nut 
trees. This was the point which was reached by the late 
lamented Captain Parker, who fell at the Sulina mouth of the 
Danube. I had a strong desire to follow the Zambesi further, 
and ascertain where this enormous body of water found its way 
into the sea ; but, on hearing from the Portuguese that he had 
ascended to this point and had been highly pleased with the 
capabilities of the river, I felt sure that his valuable opinion 
must be in possession of the Admiralty. On my arrival in 



Chap. XXXH. THE QUILIMANE AND ZAMBESI. 665 

England I applied to Captain Washington, Hydrographer to the 
Admiralty, and he promptly furnished the document for publi- 
cation by the Koyal Geographical Society. 

The river between Mazaro and the sea must, therefore, be 
judged of from the testimony of one more competent to decide 
on its merits than a mere landsman like myself. 

On the Quilimane and Zambesi Rivers. From the Journal of 
the late Capt. Hyde Pakkek, E.N., H.M. Brig " Pantaloon." 

" The Luabo is the main outlet of the Great Zambesi. In the 
rainy season — January and February principally — the whole 
country is overflowed, and the water escapes by the different 
rivers as far up as Quilimane ; but in the dry season neither 
Quilimane nor Olinda communicates with it. The position of 
the river is rather incorrect in the Admiralty chart, being six 
miles too much to the southward and also considerably to the 
westward. Indeed, the coast from here up to Tongamiara seems 
too far to the westward. The entrance to the Luabo river is 
about two miles broad, and is easily distinguishable, when 
abreast of it, by a bluff (if I may so term it) of high straight 
trees, very close together, on the western side of the entrance. 
The bar may be said to be formed by two series of sandbanks, — 
that running from the eastern point runs diagonally across 
(opposite?) the entrance and nearly across it. Its western 
extremity is about two miles outside the west point. 

" The bank running out from the west point projects to the 
southward three miles and a half, passing not one quarter of a 
mile from the eastern or cross bank. This narrow passage is 
the bar passage. It breaks completely across at low water, 
except under very extraordinary circumstances. At tins time — 
low water — a great portion of the banks are uncovered ; in some 
places they are seven or eight feet above water. 

" On these banks there is a break at all times, but in fine 
weather, at high water, a boat may cross near the east point. 
There is very little water, and, in places, a nasty race and 
bubble, so that caution is requisite. The best directions for 
going in over the regular bar passage, according to my expe- 
rience, are as follows : — Steer down well to the eastward of the 
bar passage, so as to avoid the outer part of the western shoals, 



666 CAPTAIN HYDE PAKKER ON THE Chap. XXXII. 

on which there is usually a bad sea. When you get near the 
cross-bar, keep along it till the bluff of trees on the west side of 
the entrance bears N.E. ; you may then steer straight for it. This 
will clear the end of the cross-bar, and, directly you are within 
that, the water is smooth. The worst sea is generally just 
without the bar passage. 

" Within the points the river widens at first and then contracts 
again. About three miles from the Tree Bluff is an island ; the 
passage up the river is the right-hand side of it, and deep. The 
plan will best explain it. The rise and fall of the tide at the 
entrance of the river being at springs twenty feet, any vessel can 
get in at that time, but, with all these conveniences for traffic, 
there is none here at present. The water in the river is fresh 
clown to the bar with the ebb-tide, and in the rainy season it is 
fresh at the surface quite outside. In the rainy season, at the 
full and change of the moon, the Zambesi frequently overflows 
its banks, making the country for an immense distance one 
great lake, with only a few small eminences above the water. 
On the banks of the river the huts are built on piles, and at 
these times the communication is only in canoes; but the 
waters do not remain up more than three or four days at a 
time. The first village is about eight miles up the river, on the 
western bank, and is opposite to another branch of the river 
called ' Muselo,' which discharges itself into the sea about five 
miles to the eastward. 

" The village is extensive, and about it there is a very large 
quantity of land in cultivation ; calavances, or beans, of different 
sorts, rice, and pumpkins, are the principal things. I saw also 
about here some wild cotton, apparently of veiy good quality, 
but none is cultivated. The land is so fertile as to produce 
almost any (thing ?) without much trouble. 

" At this village is a very large house, mud-built, with a court- 
yard. I believe it to have been used as a barracoon for slaves, 
several large cargoes having been exported from this river. I 
proceeded up the river as far as its junction with the Quilimane 
river, called ' Boca do Rio,' by my computation between 70 and 
80 miles from the entrance. The influence of the tides is felt 
about 25 or 30 miles up the river. Above that, the stream, in 
the dry season, runs from 1J to 2 J miles an hour, but in the 



Chap. XXXII. QUILIMANE AND ZAMBESI. 667 

rains much stronger. The banks of the river, for the first 30 
miles, are generally thickly clothed with trees, with occasional 
open glades. There are many huts and villages on both sides, 
and a great deal of cultivation. At one village, about 17 miles 
up on the eastern bank, and distinguished by being surrounded 
by an immense number of bananas and plantain-trees, a great 
quantity of excellent peas are cultivated, also cabbages, tomatos, 
onions, &c. Above this there are not many inhabitants on the 
left or west bank, although it is much the finest country, being 
higher, and abounding in cocoa-nut palms ; the eastern bank 
being sandy and barren. The reason is, that some years back 
the Landeens, or Caffres, ravaged all this country, killing the 
men and taking the women as slaves, but they have never 
crossed the river ; hence the natives are afraid to settle on the 
west bank, and the Portuguese owners of the different " prasos " 
have virtually lost them. The banks of the river continue 
mostly sandy, with few trees, except some cocoa-nut palms, 
until the southern end of the large plantation of Nyanguc, 
formed by the river about 20 miles from Maruru. Here the 
country is more populous and better cultivated, the natives a 
finer race, and the huts larger and better constructed. Maruru 
belongs to Sefior Asevedo, of Quilimane, well known to all 
English officers on the east coast for his hospitality. 

" The climate here is much cooler than nearer the sea, and 
Asevedo has successfully cultivated most European as well as 
tropical vegetables. The sugar-cane thrives, as also coffee and 
cotton, and indigo is a weed. Cattle here are beautiful, and 
some of them might show with credit in England. The natives 
are intelligent, and under a good government this fine country 
might become very valuable. Three miles from Maruru is 
Mesan, a very pretty village among palm and mango trees. 
There is here a good house belonging to a Sefior Ferrao ; close 
by is the canal (Miitu) of communication between the Quilimane 
and Zambesi rivers, which in the rainy season is navigable (?). 
I visited it in the month of October, which is about the dryest 
time of the year ; it was then a dry canal, about 30 or 40 yards 
wide, overgrown with trees and grass, and, at the bottom, at 
least 16 or 17 feet above the level of the Zambesi, which was 
running beneath. In the rains, by the marks I saw, the entrance 



668 THE QUIL1MANE AND ZAMBESI : Chap. XXXII. 

rise of the river must be very nearly 30 feet, and the volume of 
water discharged by it (the Zambesi) enormous. 

" Above Maruru the country begins to become more hilly, and 
the high mountains of Boruru are in sight ; the first view of 
these is obtained below Nyangue, and they must be of consi- 
derable height, as from this they are distant above 40 miles. 
They are reported to contain great mineral wealth ; gold and 
copper being found in the range, as also coal (?). The natives 
(Lancleens) are a bold, independent race, who do not acknow- 
ledge the Portuguese authority, and even make them pay for 
leave to pass unmolested. Throughout the whole course of the 
river, hippopotami were very abundant, and at one village a 
chase by the natives was witnessed. They harpoon the animal 
with a barbed lance, to which is attached, by a cord 3 or 4 
fathoms long, an inflated bladder. The natives follow in their 
canoes, and look out to fix more harpoons as the animal rises to 
blow, and, when exhausted, despatch him with their lances. It 
is, in fact, nearly similar to a whale-hunt. Elephants and lions 
are also abundant on the western side ; the latter destroy many 
of the blacks annually, and are much feared by them. Alligators 
are said to be numerous, but I did not see any. 

" The voyage up to Maruru occupied seven clays, as I did not 
work the men at the oar, but it might be done in four ; we re- 
turned to the bar in two and a half days. 

" There is another mouth of the Zambesi, seven miles to the 
westward of Luabo, which was visited by the ' Castor's ' pinnace ; 
and I was assured by Lieutenant Hoskins that the bar was 
better than the one I visited." 

The conclusions of Captain Parker are strengthened by those 
of Lieutenant A. H. Hoskins, who was on the coast at the same 
time, and also visited this spot. Having applied to my friend 
for his deliberate opinion on the subject, he promptly furnished 
the following note in January last : — 

" The Zambesi appears to have five principal mouths, of which 
the Luabo is the most southern and most navigable ; Cumana, 
and two whose names I do not know, not having myself visited 
it, lying between it and the Quilimane, and the rise and fall at 
spring-tides on the bar of the Luabo is 22 feet ; and as, in the 



Chap. XXXII. LIEUTENANT IIOSKINS' REMARKS. 6G9 

passage, there is never less than four feet (I having crossed it 
at dead low- water — springs), this would give an average depth 
sufficient for any commercial purposes. The rise and fall is six 
feet greater, the passages narrower and more denned, conse- 
quently deeper and more easily found than that of the Quilimane 
river. The river above the bar is very tortuous, but deep ; and 
it is observable that the influence of the tide is felt much higher 
in this branch than in the others ; for whereas in the Catrina 
and Cumana I have obtained drinkable water a very short dis- 
tance from the mouth, in the Luabo I have ascended 70 miles 
without finding the saltness perceptibly diminished. This would 
facilitate navigation, and I have no hesitation in saying that 
little difficulty would be experienced in conveying a steam- vessel 
of the size and capabilities of the gunboat I lately commanded 
as high as the branching off of the Quilimane river (Mazaro), 
which, in the dry season, is observed many yards above the 
Luabo (main stream) ; though I have been told by the Portu- 
guese that the freshes which come down in December and March 
fill it temporarily. These freshes deepen the river considerably 
at that time of the year, and freshen the water many miles from 
the coast. The population of the delta, except in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the Portuguese, appeared to be very sparse. 
Antelopes and hippopotami were plentiful ; the former tame and 
easily shot. I inquired frequently of both natives and Portu- 
guese, if slavers were in the habit of entering there to ship their 
cargoes, but could not ascertain that they have ever done so in 
any except the Quilimane. With common precaution the rivers 
are not unhealthy ; for, during the whole time I was employed 
in them (off and on during eighteen months), in open boats and 
at all times of the year, frequently absent from the ship for a 
month or six weeks at a time, I had not, in my boat's crew of 
fourteen men, more than two, and those mild, cases of fever. 
Too much importance cannot be ascribed to the use of quinine, 
to which I attribute our comparative immunity, and with which 
our judicious commander, Commodore Wyvill, kept us amply 
supplied. I hope these few remarks may be of some little use 
in confirming your views of the utility of that magnificent river.

670 THE MUTU. Chap. XXXII. 

It ought to be remembered that the testimony of these gen- 
tlemen is all the more valuable, because they visited the river 
when the water was at its lowest, and the surface of the Zambesi 
was not, as it was now, on a level with and flowing into the 
Mutu, but 16 feet beneath its bed. The Mutu, at the point of 
departure, was only 10 or 12 yards broad, shallow, and filled 
with aquatic plants. Trees and reeds along the bank overhang 
it so much, that, though we had brought canoes and a boat 
from Tete, we were unable to enter the Mutu with them, and 
left them at Mazaro. During most of the year, this part of 
the Mutu is dry, and we were even now obliged to carry all 
our luggage by land for about fifteen miles. As Kilimane is 
called, in all the Portuguese documents, the capital of the rivers 
of Senna, it seemed strange to me that the capital should be 
built at a point where there was no direct water conveyance to 
the magnificent river whose name it bore; and on inquiry, I 
was informed that the whole of the Mutu was large in days of 
yore, and admitted of the free passage of great launches from 
Kilimane all the year round ; but that now this part of the Mutu 
had been filled up. 

I was seized by a severe tertian fever at Mazaro, but went 
along the right bank of the Mutu to the N.N.E. and E. for 
about 15 miles. We then found that it was made navigable by 
a river called the Pangazi, which comes into it from the north. 
Another river, flowing from the same direction, called the 
Luare, swells it still more ; and, last of all, the Likuare, with 
the tide, make up the river of Kilimane. The Mutu at Ma- 
zaro is simply a connecting link, such as is so often seen in 
Africa, and neither its flow nor stoppage affects the river of 
Kilimane. The waters of the Pangazi were quite clear com- 
pared with those of the Zambesi.* 

* I owe the following information, of a much later date, also to the 
politeness of Captain Washington. H. M. sloop "Grecian" visited the 
coast in 1852-3, and the master remarks that " the entrance to the Luabo 
is in lat. 18° 51' S., long. 36° 12' E., and may be known by a range of hum- 
mocks on its eastern side, and very low land to the S. W. The entrance is 
narrow, and, as with all the rivers on this coast, is fronted by a bar, 
which renders the navigation, particularly for boats, very dangerous with 
the wind to the south of east or west. Our boats proceeded 20 miles 
up this river, 2 fathoms on the bar, then 2\ — 4 — 6 — 7 fathoms. It was 



Chap. XXXII. EFFECTS OF FEVER, 671 

My fever became excessively severe, in consequence of tra- 
velling in the hot sun, and the long grass blocking up the narrow 
path, so as to exclude the air. The pulse beat with amazing 
force, and felt as if thumping against the crown of the head. 
The stomach and spleen swelled enormously, giving me, for the 
first time, an appearance which I had been disposed to laugh at 
among the Portuguese. At Interra we met Senhor Asevedo, a 
man who is well known by all who ever visited Kilimane, and 
who was presented with a gold chronometer watch by the Ad- 
miralty, for his attentions to English officers. He immediately 
tendered his large sailing launch, which had a house in the stern. 
This was greatly in my favour, for it anchored in the middle of 
the stream, and gave me some rest from the mosquitoes, which 

navigable further up, but they did not proceed. It is quite possible for 
a moderate-sized vessel to cross the bar at spring-tides, and be perfectly 
landlocked and hidden amongst the trees. 

" The Maiudo, in 18° 52' !3., 36° 12' E., is not mentioned in Horsburgh, nor 
laid down in the Admiralty chart, but is, nevertheless, one of some import- 
ance, and appears to be one of the principal stations for shipping slaves, 
as the boats found two barracoons, about 20 miles up, bearing every 
indication of having been very recently occupied, and which had good 
presumptive evidence that the ' Cauraigo,' a brig under American colours, 
had embarked a cargo from thence but a short time before. This river is 
fronted by a portion of the Elephant Shoals, at the distance of three or 
four miles outside. The eastern bank is formed by level sea-cliffs (as seen 
from the ship it has that appearance), high for this part of the coast, and 
conspicuous. The western side is composed of thick trees, and terminates 
in dead wood, from which we called it ' Dead-wood Point.' After crossing 
the bar it branches off in a W. and N.W. direction, the latter being the 
principal arm, up which the boats went some 30 miles, or about 10 
beyond the barracoon. Fresh water can be obtained almost immediately 
inside the entrance, as the stream runs down very rapidly with the ebb- 
tide. The least water crossing the bar (low-water — springs) was 1| fathom, 
one cast only therefrom from 2 to 5 fathoms, another 7 fathoms nearly 
the whole way up. 

" The Catrina, lat. 18° 50' S., long. 36° 24' E. The external appearance of 
this river is precisely similar to that of the Maiudo, so much so, that it is 
difficult to distinguish them by any feature of the land. The longitude 
is the best guide, or, in the absence of observation, perhaps the angles 
contained by the extremes of land will be serviceable. Thus, at nine 
miles off the Maiudo the angle contained by the above was seven points, 
the bearing being N.E. W. of N.W. (?) ; whilst off the Catrina, at the same 
distance from shore (about nine miles), the angle was only 3| to 4 points, 
being N. to N.W. As we did not send the boats up this river, no informa- 
tion was obtained." 



672 THE AUTHOR'S OBLIGATIONS. Chap. XXXIL 

in the whole of the delta are something frightful. Sailing com- 
fortably in this commodious launch along the river of Kilimane, 
we reached that village (lat. 17° 53' 8" S., long. 36° 40' E.) on 
the 20th of May, 1856, which wanted only a few days of being 
four years since I started from Cape Town. Here I was received 
into the house of Colonel Galdino Jose Nunes, one of the best 
men in the country. I had been three years without hearing 
from my family ; letters having frequently been sent, but some- 
how or other, with but a single exception, they never reached 
me. I received, however, a letter from Admiral Trotter, con- 
veying information of their welfare, and some newspapers, which 
were a treat indeed. Her Majesty's brig the " Frolic" had called 
to inquire for me in the November previous, and Captain Nolloth 
of that ship had most considerately left a case of wine ; and his 
surgeon, Dr. Jas. Walsh, divining what I should need most, left 
an ounce of quinine. These gifts made my heart overflow. I 
had not tasted any liquor whatever during the time I had been 
in Africa ; but when reduced in Angola to extreme weakness, I 
found much benefit from a little wine, and took from Loanda 
one bottle of brandy in my medicine-chest, intending to use it 
if it were again required ; but the boy who carried it whirled the 
box upside down, and smashed the bottle, so I cannot give my 
testimony either in favour of or against the brandy. 

But my joy on reaching the east coast was sadly embittered 
by the news that Commander MacLune, of H. M. brigantine 
" Dart," on coming in to Kilimane to pick me up, had, with 
Lieutenant Wooclruffe and five men, been lost on the bar. I 
never felt more poignant sorrow. It seemed as if it would have 
been easier for me to have died for them, than that they should 
all be cut off from the joys of life in generously attempting to 
render me a service. I would here acknowledge my deep obli- 
gations to the Earl of Clarendon ; to the Admiral at the Cape ; 
and others, for the kind interest they manifested in my safety ; 
even the inquiries made were very much to my advantage. I 
also refer with feelings of gratitude to the Governor of Mozam- 
bique for offering me a passage in the schooner " Zambesi," 
belonging to that province; and I shall never forget the 
generous hospitality of Colonel Nunes and his nephew, with 
whom I remained. One of the discoveries I have made is that 



Chap. XXXII. DEVELOPING RESOURCES OF INTERIOR. 673 

there are vast numbers of good people in the world, and I do 
most devoutly tender my unfeigned thanks to that Gracious One 
who mercifully watched over me in every position, and influenced 
the hearts of both black and white to regard me with favour. 

With the united testimony of Captain Parker and Lieutenant 
Hoskins, added to my own observation, there can be no reason- 
able doubt but that the real mouth of the Zambesi is available 
for the purposes of commerce. The delta is claimed by the 
Portuguese, and the southern bank of the Luabo, or Cuama, as 
this part of the Zambesi is sometimes called, is owned by inde- 
pendent natives of the Caffre family. The Portuguese are thus 
near the main entrance to the new central region ; and, as they 
have of late years shown, in an enlightened and liberal spirit, 
their desire to develop the resources of Eastern Africa by pro- 
claiming Mozambique a free port, it is to be hoped that the 
same spirit will lead them to invite mercantile enterprise up the 
Zambesi, by offering facilities to those who may be led to push 
commerce into the regions lying far beyond their territory. 
Their wish to co-operate in the noble work of developing the 
resources of the rich country beyond, could not be shown better 
than by placing a village with Zambesian pilots at the harbour 
of Mitilone, and erecting a lighthouse for the guidance of sea- 
faring men. If this were done, no nation would be a greater 
gainer by it than the Portuguese themselves, and assuredly no 
other needs a resuscitation of its commerce more. Their kind- 
ness to me personally makes me wish for a return of their 
ancient prosperity ; and the most liberal and generous act of 
the enlightened young king H. M. Don Pedro, in sending out 
orders to support my late companions at the public expense of 
the province of Mozambique until my return to claim them, 
leads me to hope for encouragement in every measure for either 
the development of commerce, the elevation of the natives, or 
abolition of the trade in slaves. 

As far as I am myself concerned, the opening of the new 
central country is a matter for congratulation only in so far as it 
opens up a prospect for the elevation of the inhabitants. As I 
have elsewhere remarked, I view the end of the geographical 
feat as the beginning of the missionary enterprise. I take the 
latter term in its most extended signification, and include every 

2 x

effort made for the amelioration of our race; the promotion of 
all those means by winch God in His providence is working, and 
bringing all His dealings with man to a glorious consummation. 
Each man in his sphere, either knowingly or unwittingly, is 
performing the will of our Father in heaven. Men of science, 
searching after hidden truths, which when discovered will, like 
the electric telegraph, bind men more closely together — soldiers 
battling for the right against tyranny — sailors rescuing the vic- 
tims of oppression from the grasp of heartless men-stealers — 
merchants teaching the nations lessons of mutual dependence — 
and many others, as well as missionaries, all work in the same 
direction, and all efforts are overruled for one glorious end. 

If the reader has accompanied me thus far, he may perhaps 
be disposed to take an interest in the objects I propose to myself, 
should God mercifully grant me the honour of doing something 
more for Africa. As the highlands on the borders of the central 
basin are comparatively healthy, the first object seems to be to 
secure a permanent path thither, in order that Europeans may 
pass as quickly as possible through the unhealthy region near 
the coast. The river has not been surveyed, but at the time 
I came down there was abundance of water for a large vessel, 
and this continues to be the case during four or five months of 
each year. The months of low-water still admit of navigation 
by launches, and would permit small vessels equal to the 
Thames steamers to ply with ease in the deep channel. If a 
steamer were sent to examine the Zambesi, I would recommend 
one of the lightest draught, and the months of May, June, and 
July for passing through the delta ; and this not so much for 
fear of want of water, as the danger of being grounded on a 
sand or mud bank, and the health of the crew being endangered 
by the delay. 

In the months referred to, no obstruction would be incurred in 
the channel below Tete. Twenty or thirty miles above that 
point we have a small rapid, of which I regret my inability to 
speak, as (mentioned already) I did not visit it. But taking the 
distance below this point,- we have, in round numbers, 300 miles 
of navigable river. Above this rapid we have another reach of 
300 miles, with sand, but no mudbanks in it, which brings us to 
the foot of the eastern ridge. Let it not, however, bethought 



Chap. XXXII. THE AUTHOK'S OBJECTS. 675 

that a vessel by going thither would return laden with ivory and 
gold-dust. The Portuguese of Tete pick up all the merchandize 
of the tribes in their vicinity, and, though I came out by tra- 
versing the people with whom the Portuguese have been at war, 
it does not follow that it will be perfectly safe for others to go in 
whose goods may be a stronger temptation to cupidity than any- 
thing I possessed. When we get beyond the hostile population 
mentioned, we reach a very different race. On the latter my 
chief hopes at present rest. All of them, however, are willing 
and anxious to engage in trade, and, while eager for this, none 
have ever been encouraged to cultivate the raw materials of 
commerce. Their country is well adapted for cotton ; and I 
venture to entertain the hope that by distributing seeds of better 
kinds thanthat which is found indigenous, and stimulating the 
natives to cultivate it by affording them the certainty of a market 
for all they may produce, we may engender a feeling of mutual 
dependence between them and ourselves. I have a two-fold 
object in view, and believe that, by guiding our missionary la- 
bours so as to benefit our own country, we shall thereby more 
effectually and permanently benefit the heathen. Seven years 
were spent at Kolobeng in instructing my friends there; but 
the country being incapable of raising materials for exportation, 
when the Boers made their murderous attack and scattered the 
tribe for a season, none sympathised except a few Christian 
friends. Had the people of Kolobeng been in the habit of 
raising the raw materials of English commerce, the outrage 
would have been felt in England ; or, what is more likely to 
have been the case, the people would have raised themselves in 
the scale by barter, and have become, like the Basutos of Mo- 
shesh and people of Kuruman, possessed of fire-arms, and the 
Boers would never have made the attack at all. We ought to 
encourage the Africans to cultivate for our markets, as the most 
effectual means, next to the Gospel, of their elevation. 

It is in the hope of working out this idea that I propose the 
formation of stations on the Zambesi beyond the • Portuguese 
territory, but having communication through them with the 
coast. A chain of stations admitting of easy and speedy inter- 
course, such as might be formed along the flank of the eastern 
ridge, would be in a favourable position for carrying out the 

2x2 



676 AEKANGEMENTS ON LEAVING AFEICA. Chap. XXXII. 

objects in view. The London Missionary Society lias resolved 
to have a station among the Makololo on the north bank, and 
another on the south among the Matebele. The Church — Wes- 
leyan, Baptist, and that most energetic body, the Free Church — 
could each find desirable locations among the Batoka and adja- 
cent tribes. The country is so extensive there is no fear of 
clashing. All classes of Christians find that sectarian rancour soon 
dies out when they are working together among and for the real 
heathen. Only let the healthy locality be searched for, and fixed 
upon, and then there will be free scope to w T ork in the same 
cause in various directions, without that loss of men which the 
system of missions on the unhealthy coasts entails. While 
respectfully submitting the plan to these influential societies, I 
can positively state that, when fairly in the interior, there is per- 
fect security for life and property among a people who will at 
least listen and reason. 

Eight of my men begged to be allowed to come as far as Kili- 
mane, and, thinking that they would there see the ocean, I 
consented to their coming, though the food was so scarce in 
consequence of a dearth, that they were compelled to suffer some 
hunger. They would fain have come further ; for when Sekeletu 
parted with them, his orders were that none of them should turn 
until they had reached Ma Bobert and brought her back with 
them. On my explaining the difficulty of crossing the sea, he 
said, "Wherever you lead, they must follow." As I did not 
know well how I should get home myself, I advised them to go 
back to Tete, where food was abundant, and there await my 
return. I bought a quantity of calico and brass wire with ten 
of the smaller tusks which we had in our charge, and sent the 
former back as clothing to those who remained at Tete. As 
there were still twenty tusks left, I deposited them with Colonel 
Nunes, that, in the event of anything happening to prevent 
my return, the impression might not be produced in the country, 
that I had made away with Sekeletu's ivory. I instructed 
Colonel Nunes, in case of my death, to sell the tusks and deliver 
the proceeds to my men ; but I intended, if my life should be 
prolonged, to purchase the goods ordered by Sekeletu in Eng- 
land with my own money, and pay myself on my return out of 
the price of the ivory. This I explained to the men fully, and 



Chap. XXXII. THE AUTHOK'S POSITION. 677 

they, understanding the matter, replied, " Nay, father, you will 
not die ; you will return to take us back to Sekeletu." They 
promised to wait till I came back, and, on my part, I assured 
them that nothing but death would prevent my return. This I 
said, though while waiting at Kilimane a letter came from the 
Directors of the London Missionary Society, stating that " they 
were restricted in their power of aiding plans connected only 
remotely with the spread of the Gospel, and that the financial 
circumstances of the Society were not such as to afford any 
ground of hope that it would be in a position, within any definite 
period, to enter upon untried, remote, and difficult fields of 
labour." This has been explained since as an effusion caused by 
temporary financial depression ; but feeling perfect confidence 
in my Makololo friends, I was determined to return and trust to 
their generosity. The old love of independence, which I had so 
strongly before joining the Society, again returned. It was roused 
by a mistaken view of what tins letter meant, for the Directors, 
immediately on my reaching home, saw the great importance of 
the opening, and entered with enlightened zeal on the work of 
sending the Gospel into the new field. It is to be hoped that 
their constituents will not only enable them to begin, but to 
carry out their plans ; and that no material depression will ever 
again be permitted, nor appearance of spasmodic benevolence 
recur. While I hope to continue the same cordial co-operation 
and friendship which have always characterised our intercourse, 
various reasons induce me to withdraw from pecuniary dependence 
on any Society. I have done something for the heathen, but for 
an aged mother, who has still more sacred claims than they, I 
have been able to do nothing, and a continuance of the connec- 
tion would be a perpetuation of my inability to make any pro- 
vision for her declining years. In addition to " clergyman's sore 
throat," which partially disabled me from the work, my father's 
death imposed new obligations ; and a fresh source of income 
having been opened to me without my asking, I had no hesita- 
tion in accepting what would enable me to fulfil my duty to my 
aged parent as well as to the heathen. 

If the reader remembers the way in which I was led, while 
teaching the Bakwains, to commence exploration, he will, I 
think, recognise the hand of Providence. Anterior to that, when 



678 RETROSPECT. Chap. XXXTI. 

Mr. Moffat began to give the Bible — the Magna Charta of all the 
rights and privileges of modern civilization — to the Bechuanas, 
Sebituane went north, and spread the language into which he was 
translating the sacred oracles, in a new region larger than France. 
Sebituane, at the same time, rooted out hordes of bloody savages 
among whom no white man could have gone, without leaving his 
skull to ornament some village. He opened up the way for me 
— let us hope also for the Bible. Then, again, while I was labour- 
ing at Kolobeng, seeing only a small arc of the cycle of Provi- 
dence ; I could not understand it, and felt inclined to ascribe 
our successive and prolonged droughts to the wicked one. But 
when forced by these, and the Boers, to become explorer, and 
open a new country in the north rather than set my face south- 
wards, where missionaries are not needed ; the gracious Spirit of 
God influenced the minds of the heathen to regard me with 
favour ; the Divine hand is again perceived. Then, I turned away 
westwards, rather than in the opposite direction, chiefly from 
observing that some native Portuguese, though influenced by the 
hope of a reward from their Government to cross the continent, 
had been obliged to return from the east without accomplishing 
their object. Had I gone at first in the eastern direction, which 
the course of the great Leeambye seemed to invite, I should have 
come among the belligerents near Tete, when the war was raging 
at its height, instead of, as it happened, when all was over. And 
again, when enabled to reach Loanda, the resolution to do my 
duty by going back to Linyanti, probably saved me from the fate 
of my papers in the " Forerunner." And then, last of all, this new 
country is partially opened to the sympathies of Christendom, 
and I find that Sechele himself has, though unbidden by man, 
been teaching his own people. In fact, he has been doing all, that 
I was prevented from doing, and I have been employed in ex- 
ploring — a work I had no previous intention of performing. ' I 
think, that I see the operation of the unseen hand in all this, and 
I humbly hope, that it will still guide me to do good in my day 
and generation in Africa. 

Viewing the success awarded to opening up the new country, 
as a development of Divine Providence in relation to the African 
family, the mind naturally turns to the probable influence it 
may have on negro slavery ; and more especially on the practice 



Chap. XXXII. COMMERCIAL STATIONS. 679 

of it by a large portion of our own race. We now demand in- 
creased supplies of cotton and sugar, and then reprobate the 
means our American brethren adopt to supply our wants. We 
claim a right to speak about this evil, and also to act in reference 
to its removal, the more especially because we are of one blood. 
It is on the Anglo-American race that the hopes of the world for 
liberty and progress rest. Now it is very grievous to find one 
portion of this race practising the gigantic evil, and the other 
aiding, by increased demands for the produce of slave-labour, in 
perpetuating the enormous wrong. The Mauritius, a mere speck 
on the ocean, yields sugar, by means of guano, improved ma- 
chinery, and free labour, equal in amount to one-fourth part of 
the entire consumption of Great Britain. On that island, land is 
excessively dear, and far from rich : no crop can be raised except 
by means of guano, and labour has to be brought all the way 
from India. But in Africa the land is cheap, the soil good, and 
free labour is to be found on the spot. Our chief hopes rest with 
the natives themselves ; and if the point to which I have given 
prominence, of healthy inland commercial stations, be realized, 
where all the produce raised may be collected, there is little doubt 
but that slavery among our kinsmen across the Atlantic will, 
in the course of some years, cease to assume the form of a neces- 
sity to even the slaveholders themselves. Natives alone can 
collect produce from the more distant hamlets, and bring it to 
the stations contemplated. This is the system pursued so suc- 
cessfully in Angola. If England had possessed that strip of land, 
by civilly declining to enrich her " Frontier colonists" by " Caffre 
wars," the inborn energy of English colonists would have de- 
veloped its resources, and the exports would not have been 
100,000?. as now, but one million at least. The establishment of 
the necessary agency must be a work of time, and greater difficulty 
will be experienced on the eastern, than on the western side of the 
continent, because in the one region we have a people who know 
none but slave-traders, while in the other we have tribes who 
have felt the influence of the coast missionaries, and of the great 
Niger expedition ; one invaluable benefit it conferred was the 
dissemination of the knowledge of English love of commerce and 
English hatred of slavery, and it therefore was no failure. But 
on the east, there is a river which may become a good pathway 
to a central population who are friendly to the English ; and if 



680 VILLAGE OF KILIMANE. Chap. XXXII. 

we can conciliate the less amicable people on the river, and in- 
troduce commerce, an effectual blow will be struck at the slave- 
trade in that quarter. By linking the Africans there to our- 
selves, in the manner proposed, it is hoped that their elevation 
will eventually be the result. In this hope and proposed effort, 
I am joined by my brother Charles, who has come from America, 
after seventeen years' separation, for the purpose. We expect 
success through the influence of that Spirit who already aided 
the efforts to open the country, and who has since turned 
the public mind towards it. A failure may be experienced by 
sudden rash speculation, over-stocking the markets there, and 
raising the prices against ourselves. But I propose to spend some 
more years of labour, and shall be thankful if I see the system 
fairly begun in an open pathway which will eventually benefit 
both Africa and England. 

The village of Kilimane stands on a great mud bank, and is 
surrounded by extensive swamps and rice-grounds. The banks 
of the river are lined with mangrove-bushes, the roots of which, 
and the slimy banks on which they grow, are alternately exposed 
to the tide and sun. The houses are well built of brick and 
lime ; the latter from Mozambique. If one digs down two or three 
feet in any part of the site of the village, he comes to water : 
hence the walls built on this mud bank gradually subside ; 
pieces are sometimes sawn off the doors below, because the walls 
in which they are fixed have descended into the ground, so as 
to leave the floors higher than the bottom of the doors. It is 
almost needless to say that Kilimane is very unhealthy. A man 
of plethoric temperament is sure to get fever ; and, concerning a 
stout person, one may hear the remark, " Ah ! he will not live 
long, he is sure to die." 

A Hamburgh vessel was lost near the bar before we came 
down. The men were much more regular in their habits than 
English sailors, so I had an opportunity of observing the fever, 
acting as a slow poison. They felt " out of sorts " only, but 
gradually became pale, bloodless, and emaciated, then weaker 
and weaker, till at last they sank more like oxen bitten by 
tsetse than any disease I ever saw. The captain, a strong robust 
young man, remained in perfect health for about three months, 
but was at last knocked down suddenly, and made as helpless as 
a child, by this terrible disease. He had imbibed a foolish pre- 



Chap. XXXII. VALUE OF QUININE. 681 

judice against quinine, our sheet-anchor in the complaint. This 
is rather a professional subject, but I introduce it here, in order 
to protest against the prejudice as almost entirely unfounded. 
Quinine is invaluable in fever, and never produces any un- 
pleasant effects in any stage of the disease, if exhibited in com- 
bination with an aperient. The captain was saved by it, without 
his knowledge, and I was thankful that the mode of treatment 
so efficacious among natives, promised so fair among Europeans. 

After waiting about six weeks at this unhealthy spot, in 
which, however, by the kind attentions of Colonel Nunes and 
his nephew, I partially recovered from my tertian, H. M. brig 
" Frolic " arrived off Kilimane. As the village is twelve miles 
from the bar, and the weather was rough, she was at anchor ten 
days before we knew of her presence, about seven miles from the 
entrance to the port. She brought abundant supplies for all my 
need ; and 150?. to pay my passage home, from my kind friend 
Mr. Thompson, the Society's agent at the Cape. The Admiral 
at the Cape kindly sent an offer of a passage to the Mau- 
ritius, which I thankfully accepted. Sekwebu and one atten- 
dant alone remained with me now. He was very intelligent, 
and had been of the greatest service to me ; indeed, but for 
his good sense, tact, and command of the language of the tribes 
through which we passed, I believe we should scarcely have 
succeeded in reaching the coast. I naturally felt grateful to 
him ; and as his chief wished all my companions to go to England 
with me, and would probably be disappointed if none went, I 
thought it would be beneficial for him to see the effects of civil- 
ization, and report them to his countrymen ; I wished also to 
make some return for his very important services. Others had 
petitioned to come, but I explained the danger of a change of 
climate and food, and with difficulty restrained them. The only 
one who now remained begged so hard to come on board ship, 
that I greatly regretted, that the expense prevented my acceding 
to his wish to visit England. I said to him, " You will die if you 
go to such a cold country as mine." " That is nothing," he 
reiterated ; " let me die at your feet." 

When we parted from our friends at Kilimane, the sea on the 
bar was frightful even to the seamen. This was the first time 
Sekwebu had seen the sea. Captain Peyton had sent two boats 



682 ROUGH PASSAGE TO THE " FROLIC." Chap. XXXII. 

in case of accident. The waves were so high that, when the 
cutter was in one trough, and we in the pinnace in another, her 
mast was hid. We then mounted to the crest of the wave, 
rushed down the slope, and struck the water again with a blow 
which felt as if she had struck the bottom. Boats must be sin- 
gularly well constructed to be able to stand these shocks. Three 
breakers swept over us. The men lift up their oars, and a wave 
comes sweeping over all, giving the impression that the boat is 
going down, but she only goes beneath the top of the wave, 
comes out on the other side, and swings down the slope, and a 
man bales out the water with a bucket. Poor Sekwebu looked 
at me when these terrible seas broke over, and said, " Is this 
the way you go ? Is this the way you go ? " I smiled, and 
said, " Yes ; don't you see it is ? " and tried to encourage him. 
He was well acquainted with canoes, but never had seen aught 
like this. When we reached the ship — a fine, large brig of six- 
teen guns and a crew of one hundred and thirty — she was rolling 
so, that we could see a part of her bottom. It was quite impos- 
sible for landsmen to catch the ropes and climb up, so a chair 
was sent down, and we were hoisted in as ladies usually are, and 
received so hearty an English welcome from Captain Peyton 
and all on board, that I felt myself at once at home in every- 
thing, except my own mother-tongue. I seemed to know the 
language perfectly, but the words I wanted, would not come at 
my call. When I left England I had no intention of returning, 
and directed my attention earnestly to the languages of Africa, 
paying none to English composition. With the exception of 
a short interval in Angola, I had been three and a half years 
without speaking English, and this, with thirteen years of pre- 
vious partial disuse of my native tongue, made me feel sadly at 
a loss on board the " Frolic." 

We left Kilimane on the 12th of July, and reached the Mauritius 
on the 12th of August, 1856. Sekwebu was picking up English, 
and becoming a favourite with both men and officers. He seemed 
a little bewildered, everything on board a man-of-war being so new 
and strange ; but he remarked to me several times, " Your country- 
men are very agreeable," and " What a strange country this is — 
all water together." He also said, that he now understood why I 
used the sextant. When we reached the Mauritius a steamer 



Chap. XXXII. DEATH OF SEKWEBU. VOYAGE HOME. 683 

came out to tow us into the harbour. The constant strain on 
his untutored mind seemed now to reach a climax, for during 
the night he became insane. I thought at first that he was 
intoxicated. He had descended into a boat, and, when I attempted 
to go down and bring him into the ship, he ran to the stern, and 
said, " No ! no ! it is enough that I die alone. You must not 
perish ; if you come I shall throw myself into the water." Per- 
ceiving that his mind was affected, I said, " Now, Sekwebu, we 
are going to Ma Kobert." This struck a chord in his bosom, 
and he said, " yes ; where is she, and where is Robert ? " and 
he seemed to recover. The officers proposed to secure him by 
putting him in irons, but, being a gentleman in his own country, 
I objected, knowing that the insane often retain an impres- 
sion of ill-treatment, and I could not bear to have it said in 
Sekeletu's country that I had chained one of his principal men, 
as they had seen slaves treated. I tried to get him on shore by 
day, but he refused. In the evening a fresh accession of insanity 
occurred — he tried to spear one of the crew, then leaped over- 
board, and, though he could swim well, pulled himself down 
hand under hand, by the chain cable. We never found the body 
of poor Sekwebu. 

At the Mauritius I was most hospitably received by Major- 
General C. M. Hay, and he generously constrained me to remain 
with him till, by the influence of the good climate and quiet 
English comfort, I got rid of an enlarged spleen from African 
fever. In November I came up the Red Sea; escaped the 
danger of shipwreck through the admirable management of 
Captain Powell, of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Com- 
pany's ship " Candia ;" and on the 12th of December was once 
more in dear old England. The Company most liberally refunded 
my passage-money. I have not mentioned half the favours 
bestowed, but I may just add that no one has cause for more 
abundant gratitude to his fellow-men and to his Maker than I 
have ; and may God grant that the effect on my mind be such 
that I may be more humbly devoted to the service of the Author 
of all our mercies !
