KAREPA, OF TE HAWERA.
[...]
"Karepa adhered to your advice, and when he felt a little unwell he
moved about, and did some light work. In the early part of October he
dug around and cleared away the grass from the four young apple-trees,
saying how glad he was to see the trees of his Minister spring and grow.
His illness increasing, he said he thought he should not recover. He now
summoned us all to come close around him, and with much love exhorted
us, talking energetically"—as was his custom—"a long while. He said—
'You well know that I have brought you from time to time much
riches. I have obtained for you muskets, powder, hatchets, knives, blankets,
shirts, spades, &amp;c. I afterward heard of the new riches, called
Faith. I sought it. I went to Manawatu—in those days a long and
perilous journey, for we were surrounded by enemies: no man travelled
alone. I saw the few Natives who, it was said, had heard of it; but
they could not satisfy me. I sought further, but in vain. I afterward
heard of a White Man, called Hadfield, being at Kapiti, at Otaki, and
that with him was the spring where I could fill my empty and dry calabash.
I travelled to his place, to Otaki, but in vain: he was gone—gone
away ill. I returned to you, my children, darkminded. Many days
passed by. The snows fell, they melted, they disappeared: the tree-buds
expanded, and the intricate, entangled paths of our low forests were again
passable to the foot of the Native Man. At last we heard of another White
Man, who was going about over mountains and through forests and swamps,
giving drink from his calabash to the poor secluded native folk—to the
remnants of the tribes of the mighty, of the renowned of former days—now
dwelling by twos and by threes among the roots of the big trees of
the ancient forests, and among the long reeds by the rills in the dells!
Yes, my grandchildren! my and your ancestors once spread over the
country, as the koitareke (quail) and kiwi (apteryx) once did; but now
their descendants are even as the descendants of these birds—scarce, gone,
dead, fast hastening to utter extinction! Yes, we heard of that White
Man: we heard of his going over the high snowy range to Patea, up the
East Coast, all over the rocks to Turakirae. I sent four of my children
to Mataikona to meet him.* They saw his face—yes,
you, you talked
with him. You brought me a drop of water from his calabash. You told
me he had said he would come to this far-off islet<a href="#note2"
id="note2back">† to see me. I rejoiced:
I disbelieved his coming; but I said, he may. I built the Chapel: we
waited expecting. You slept at nights. I did not. He came: he
emerged from the long forest: he stood upon Te Hawera ground. I saw
him: I shook hands with him: we rubbed noses together. Yes, I saw a
Missionary's face; I sat in his cloth house [tent]; I tasted his new food;
I heard him talk Maori. My heart bounded within me; I listened; I
ate his words. You slept at nights. I did not. Yes, I listened; and he told
me about God and His Son Jesus Christ, and of peace and reconciliation,
and of a loving Father's home beyond the stars. And now I, too, drank
from his calabash, and was refreshed. He gave me a book, as well as
words. I laid hold of the new riches for me and for you; and we have
it now. My children, I am old; my teeth are gone, my hair is white,
the yellow leaf is falling from the t?wai tree:<a href="#note3"
id="note3back">** I am departing. The
sun is sinking behind the great western hills: it will soon be night. But
hear me: do you hold fast the new riches—the great riches—the true
riches. We have had plenty of sin and pain and death; and we have
been teased by many—by our neighbours and relatives; but we have the
true riches. Hold fast the true riches which Karepa sight for, for you.'
"Here he became faint, and ceased talking. We all wept like little
children around the bed of the dying old man—of our father. We were
few in number, and far from human aid or sympathy. The next day he
expressed a wish that his only son, Huru, might be sent for. He had
been several weeks absent, roaming about on the Manawata river. The
messenger went to the nearest villages on the river, and learned that he
was nearly a week's journey off, so that he could not be fetched in time
to see his dying father. In two days the messenger returned, and Karepa,
when he heard that Huru was not come, and considered that he should
no more see the face of his only son in this world, was for a time very sad;
but he soon talked again as before, and left instructions for his son. The
next day the old Chief said, 'My children, I have been dreaming. I
last night saw my Minister: he was here, smiling upon me, and praying
intercessory prayers for me. It is well. It is good. Now I know I
shall go to the world of spirits. It is well. Hold fast the true riches
when I am gone. God may be merciful to me a sinner!' He now suffered
much pain, from which he had scarcely any cessation until death relieved
him. He prayed much and often, under the trees on the edge of the
wood, going—in his pain—from place to place. His prayers, in his exigency,
were those he had got by heart—the Collects for Ash-Wednesday,
the second Sunday in Advent, the second and fourth Sundays in Lent,
and the first in Communion Service, and the Lord's Prayer. He also
well knew the daily Collects of Morning and Evening Prayer, with the
Confession, and Chrysostom's, and St. Paul's Benedictory Prayer: these,
with the third chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel, the old man always used
whenever he was obliged to stay away from his Chapel, or to act as Minister.
His constant prayer was, however, that of the publican, 'God be merciful
to me a sinner!' He said he should like to see your face once more;
and straitly charged us to tell you, that, though his body is dead, his
love for his Minister still lives: this he often repeated. On Sunday, the
4th of November, while we, the few inhabitants of the village, were at
School in our little Chapel, Leah, Mikaera's wife"—who had remained as
a friend with Azubaha, Caleb's aged wife—"came running to the Chapel
to say he was gone! We concluded our School abruptly, and went over
to the edge of the wood, where the body was: the soul had fled away to
Jesus' city to dwell with Him. With much grief we paid the last rites.
In less than a fortnight after, Caleb's only brother, Seth, also an aged
man, who was in perfect health at this time, had also died; and now, O
our father! your eyes behold the remnant!"

* In Mr. Colenso's Journal of April 12th, 1845, we find—"I saw at Mataikona four
young men from Ihuraua," the old residence of Caleb, "three of whom immediately entered their
names as Candidates for Baptism." He then promised to visit their tribe in his next journey.
Of those four, three had preceded the old Chief to the eternal world; and the fourth was Mr.
Colenso's narrator.
† The Natives call an isolated wood or village, in the interior, by the name of an
island—motu.

of New Zealand.
