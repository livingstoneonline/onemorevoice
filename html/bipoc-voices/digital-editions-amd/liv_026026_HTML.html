  <h5 style="text-align:center;">"WHAT HAVE I TO DO ANY MORE WITH IDOLS?"</h5>
  <p>The following account of a poor heathen led to see, under the illuminating influence of the
    gospel, the vanity of idols, and the preciousness of Jesus as a Saviour, is taken from the
    journals of Mr. James White, one of our native catechists at Lagos, in the Bight of Benin, a
    place where Missionary work has been only recently commenced, and where it is carried on, as
    yet, amidst very much of difficulty and discouragement&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%"><em>April 6, 1853</em>&#8212;Having been requested by one
    of my Sunday-scholars,
    by the name of Ige, to come and take away her idols, and informed that
    she had obtained her mother's and husband's consent, because they had
    contributed towards procuring them, I went, accordingly, with Mrs.
    White, two of our converts, and our school teacher, to her house. We
    found that she had assembled her relatives together, and we read and
    prayed with them; and after encouraging her, she brought me her
    Shango, Elegbara, Osoyin, Obatala, and Ifa. Notwithstanding the
    violent opposition of her enemies, she stood firm and undaunted in her
    faith, as the following narrative will show.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">Her priestess having heard that she renounced
    idolatry, paid her a visit,
    with a hope of reclaiming her. "I have heard," said she, "that you have
    become a book-woman" (Christian). "Yes," Ige replied, "I have served
    idols long enough, and I now determine to try this new mode of worshipping
    God." "I beg you," said her priestess, "not to do so, else we shall
    no longer be friends." "Though you may hate me on this account," continued
    Ige, "yet I love you, and would recommend to you this new religion."
    "Are you mad?" said the woman. "You may think me so," replied
    Ige; "but I pray that you will one day become as mad as myself." After
    this discourse, Ige gave her something to eat, which she accepted; but
    first of all offered a pinch of it as a thankoffering to Ige's Shango, that was
    in one corner of the house; upon which Ige exclaimed, "How have you
    robbed me of my right! Instead of thanking me, your benefactress,
    you have given my praise to another: so," continued Ige, "we have given
    God's honour to idols." The priestess, having nothing more to say, left her,
    wondering at the mighty change that had taken place in her.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">A Sierra Leone emigrant, who lately arrived here,
    found the same firmness
    and resolution in her, which distinguishes her character. A very
    grave old man, indeed, he is; and has perhaps never once attended church
    in his whole life, though he was located in a place where the sound of the
    gospel incessantly invites sinners to accept of a Saviour's dying love.
    He was once at my house, where he met Ige learning her Primer. He said
    nothing, but went to Ige's mother, to question why she had allowed her
    daughter to go to a white man's house, "for I see they have brought the
    same lies that they teach in Sierra Leone: but who will ever believe them?"
    Then, putting his hand into his pocket, he produced his Ifa. "See," said he,
    "I have just come from white man's country. This is what took me there
    and brought me back again." Ige, who was then present, silently listened
    to him till he had done, and then answered, "Though I have never gone
    to a white man's country, yet I am not a stranger to all our idolatrous
    system, for I was one of its votaries, and I know that white men do not
    practice such lies and frauds as we do; and since I have not discovered
    any thing but the truth in all they say, I am determined to believe their
    teaching." After a warm debate on both sides, Ige remained invincible,
    and the old man went away ashamed.</p>
