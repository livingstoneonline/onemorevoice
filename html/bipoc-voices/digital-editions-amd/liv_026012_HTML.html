<h3 id="h3-title" class="center">INDIAN SNAKE-CATCHER.</h3>
<p class="noindent">T<span class="small">HE</span> colony of British Guiana is covered with vast forests, which
are traversed by no foot of man, except that of the wary Indian in
pursuit of game. There the panther has its lair, and the jaguar
prowls for his prey. Amidst the magnificent timber-trees macaws
of splendid plumage may be seen, and flocks of parrots, as numerous
and noisy as rooks in England; and there may be seen,
hanging in clusters from the branches, vampyre bats, the largest
of which such the blood of men and animals when sleeping. Nor
are these the only inhabitants of these forests. Serpents are there 
of enormous size, and mostly of a venomous nature. With these the
Indian wages a deadly warfare, destroying them wherever he meets
them. They are the objects of his disgust and hatred: nor is this
surprising, when we remember how painful and how fatal the wound
of the serpent is to man. A British-Guiana Missionary writes&#8212;</p>
<p class="small">It has been my lot to witness, on more than one occasion, the effects of
the bite of the labaria; and there is perhaps no person who has lived for
years in the interior who has not been in imminent danger at times from
the proximity of some of these creatures. I have, however, only heard
of one instance in which a full-grown man has been seized by one of the
boa species. This occurred in the swamps of the Akawini. The reptile,
a large camudi, sprang upon him, and coiled round his body, confining
one of his arms. Providentially, before it could master the other,
his wife, who was near, handed him a knife, with which he inflicted a
deep cut, causing the snake to quit him, and make its retreat. The
Indians, also, once told me of a large camudi having been killed in a
state of torpidity, which had just swallowed a boy of the Caribi nation.</p>
<p class="small">To any one who knows what destructive creatures abound in these
forests, it is surprising that accidents of this kind do not more frequently
occur. But the great characteristic of the Indian is caution, and his
keen eye and acute hearing are constantly exercised by the nature of his
situation.</p>

<p class="noindent">He displays a subtilty of artifice in capturing these reptiles
equal to that which is usually assigned to the serpent himself. I have
seen an Indian creep under a low bush on his hands and knees, and
capture a kolokonaro by means of a noose, which he dropped over its
head with a forked stick as it raised it to look at the intruder: the stick
being then quickly placed on its neck, and the noose drawn tight, the
reptile was hauled forth, and its capture completed. In this manner the
Indians catch such snakes as they wish to preserve alive for sale. If the
snake be not too large or venomous, the man grasps it tightly by the
neck, and allows it to coil itself round his arm [see the engraving], until
he is able to place it in secure confinement. The kolokonaro was only
about five feet in length, but so thick and strong that the Indian who
carried it was soon obliged to call for assistance, to remove the snake,
and release his arm from its pressure. This species is beautifully marked
with brown, orange, white, and other colours. It is sometimes called the
<em>land</em>-camudi or boa, to distinguish it from the other camudi, which takes
to the water, and is found in damp places. They both attain to a great size.</p>
<p class="small">Some of the larger snakes are said to attain to upwards of thirty feet
in length. I never saw any near that size. The largest that I knew of
was about twenty feet, and was captured by some of our Indians in a
similar manner to that related above, while gorged with food. They
then tied it to the stern of a canoe, and towed it through the water to
the residence of a settler, to whom they disposed of it alive.<a href="#note1" id="note1back">*</a>
</p>
<p>The following remarkable circumstance is related of Daehne, the
Moravian Missionary, who laboured amongst these Indians about
a hundred years ago&#8212;</p>
<p class="small">The Indians have forsaken him, he was left alone in the Mission
Settlement, and was often in no small danger from wild beasts and other
venomous creatures. Thus a tiger for a long time kept watch near his
hut, seeking an opportunity, no doubt, to seize the poor solitary inhabitant.
Every night it roared most dreadfully; and though he regularly
kindled a large fire in the neighbourhood before he went to bed, yet, as
it often went out by the morning, it would have proved but a miserable
defence, hand not the Lord preserved him. The following circumstance
is still more remarkable, and illustrates, in a singular manner, the care of
God over His servants. Being one evening attacked with a paroxysm of
fever, he resolved to go into his hut and lie down in his hammock.
Just, however, as he entered the door, he beheld a serpent descending
him in three different places; and, pursuing him closely, twined itself
several times round his head and neck as tightly as possible. Expecting
now to be bitten, or strangled to death, and being afraid lest his brethren
should suspect the Indians and murdered him, he, with singular presence
of mind, wrote with chalk on the table&#8212;"A serpent has killed me."
Suddenly, however, that promise of the Saviour darted into his mind,
"They shall take up serpents, and shall not be hurt." Encouraged by
this declaration, he seized the creature with great force, tore it loose from
his body, and flung it out of the hut. He then lay down in his hammock
in tranquillity and peace. This was most probably a boa-constrictor,
whose bite, though painful, is not venomous, and which destroys
his prey by crushing it to death and gorging it whole.</p>
