  CONFESSIONS OF AN IDOLATER.
  THE following account of an idolater, given by himself, is worthy
    of perusal. It very clearly shows the unhappiness of being such;
    the vain hopes and expectations of obtaining from idols what they
    are unable to grant; the greediness of the priests; the expense
    attendant on the sacrifices; and the bitter disappointments which are
    the portion of worshippers. It also shows the growing influence
    of Christianity in heathen lands, and the welcome refuge which the
    gracious Saviour affords to poor weary and heavy-laden sinners.
    We have extracted it from the journal of Mr. S. Crowther, jun., 
    one of the native agents at Abbeokuta.
  
    June 21, 1853&#8212;An idolater called this morning at my house at Igbein
      before 8 A.M., and inquired after me. After he had found me, he
      told me
      that he came for peace, and not for war, and that he was sent to me by his
      Obatala (a god composed of white beads, cowries, &amp;c.). As I perceived
      that he wanted medicine, I sent him up to Ake to wait for me. After
      my arrival at Ake I inquired into the reason that his Obatala had sent
      him to me; "for it is a marvellous thing," said I, "to hear that Obatala
      sends his worshipper to one connected with the true God." He replied,
      "I do not know how or why it is thus, but so it is; and let this not prevent
      you from hearing me, for I had long thought of Obatala's conduct
      towards me, which has been altogether strange, and before he had consented
      to send me to you I had almost given him up." He proceeded:
      "I am an Obatala worshipper, as you see by my white dress. I have
      been his servant from childhood, and he promised me health, wealth,
      and a good number of wives and children. I do not believe any one
      has been so faithful to him as I have been: I have sacrificed goats,
      sheep, and pigeons without number to Obatala, and I was glad when
      every thing was going on well with me. I was and am still a farmer: I
      got a good deal from my farm, and afterwards I was able to support a
      wife and a child. I then increased my sacrifices: I had an Ifa priest
      to divine for me; but after some time my wife died. I inquired at the
      hands of Obatala the reason, and he attributed it to the insufficiency of
      sacrifices. I redoubled my sacrifices. After a year or less my child also
      died, my only daughter"&#8212;here he spoke with much feeling. "I again
      inquired, and Obatala's answer was as formerly. I again redoubled my
      sacrifices. Not long after I fell sick of rheumatism. I would not ask
      any more of Obatala, as I could not spare money then to make sacrifices,
      but intended to keep the little I had in hand for the doctors who would
      cure me. I called in an Ifa priest to divine, and he told me that he
      would undertake my cure&#8212;with a good remuneration, of course: but this
      I cared not for; I wanted to get well again. However, after one year's trial
      without any good effect, for I became worse instead of better, I called
      the priest, and asked him the reason why I did not get better. He told me
      that Obatala wanted sacrifices, but did not wish me to use any medicine
      for my cure. It was then that I thought of the unreasonableness of
      Obatala's answer; for how could I have expected to get well without
      means? I then told Obatala that I wanted to make a trial of another
      doctor, for I had already been told of you. Obatala at first would not
      consent to my going to the Oibos,* lest I would believe theirs"&#8212;that is,
      embrace their religion. "However, I did not give Obatala rest, for I
      inquired over and over for a recommendation, until I got him to agree
      to my coming to you; and here I am now without any more property
      than what you see on my body. Tell me all about your religion, and
      what I should do; and upon my own words I am bound to believe and
      do it: but I also want your assistance with respect to my complaint."
    I explained to him accordingly the principles of the Christian religion,
      and pointed him to Jesus Christ, who, I told him, was evidently drawing
      him, by the lovely cords of His Holy Spirit, to Himself. I called a
      communicant of the Ake church, who entered the room at the end of
      our conversation, to explain the love of Jesus to him, and the folly of
      idolatry, and thereby to confirm all that I had told him. The woman
      spoke, from the true feeling of her heart, the truths of the Christian
      religion, and the folly, as well as the destroying tendency, of the Obatala
      worship, as also the cruelty and deceitfulness of the babbalawos; for she
      herself, she added, had been an Obatala worshiper, but now she was
      thankful that she was a member of Christ's church. After our long conversation
      I administered medicine to this sick man, and he went away full
      of gratitude and joy. Before he left, he desired me to tell him whether it
      would be lawful for him to attend the church under the state of sickness
      in which he was, and whether he should at once throw away his Obatala.
      I told him that the church is a place where all the sick, both of body and
      soul, are to lay their complaints before Jesus, the true and good physician;
      and that he would find many like himself there. I also advised
      him not to act immediately from the impulse of the moment, by throwing
      away his Obatala, but to attend always God's house of prayer and hear
      His word, and compare His worship with that of Obatala, and then
      make his choice.
  
  Since then, this individual has been regularly attending our church.
