<p class="p right "><span class="caps "><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Matadi</span>, <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo River</span></span>, <span class="smallcaps ">March</span> 30.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<br><p class="p ">During the two days' stay made by <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span>'s
expedition</span> at this place, in order to organize the caravan
inteaded to proceed by way of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span> to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Leopoldville</span>,
a resident here had a conversation with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span>, in
which the latter entered into full particulars concerning
his past and present connexion with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. H.M. Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="p ">It was at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>, where <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span>, accompanied by
his son, had gone to sell ivory, that he received <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
Stanley</span>'s letter from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Brussels</span>, proposing to him to enter
the service of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Assooiation</span>. No mention was then
made of any appointment as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span></span>, it
being merely stated that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span>'s services would be
used on the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Upper Congo</span></span>, as near as possible to the centre
of his operations in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span> mentioned these
proposals to his son, who advised him not to accept them
He resolved to await <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span>'s arrival, offering his
services meanwhile for engaging 200 <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> natives</span> for
the projected expedition.</p>
<p class="p ">After speaking of the services which he had rendered to
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lieutenant Cameron</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span>, and particularly to
the latter on his first expedition, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span> was asked what
had decided him to aceept <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span>'s offer and to ac-
company him to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Boma</span>. He replied as follows :—</p>
<p class="p ">"I never clearly understood the object or the
organization of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">International African Association</span>. The other
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> chiefs and myself at first believed, on seeing
expeditions organized at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> under <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Cambier</span> and
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lieutenant Becker</span>, that the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Europeans</span> wished to compete
with us in the markets of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tabora</span> and <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>, and
export, like ourselves, ivory and produce of various kinds.
We did not know whether <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Stanley</span> and the other white
chiefs were acting for the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">King of the Belgians</span>, for
<span class="country" title="A country.">Belgium</span>, or for the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">International Association</span>, and we
were always left in doubt on the point.</p>
<p class="p ">"But now that we have seen that such are not the
intentions of the whites—that is to say, of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Belgians</span>
and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>, whom we have met on the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">East Coast</span> ; now
that they have abandoned this part of <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> in order to
establish, by common accord, we are told, between all the
great peoples of <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Europe</span>, a State where everybody may
freely trade, we see no further reason to doubt the good
intentions of the whites, who have already done so much
in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>."</p>
<p class="p ">Being next asked if there were not other reasons which
had led him to accept <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span>'s proposals, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo
Tib</span> replied :—</p>
<p class="p ">"Yes. I confess that at first the idea of becoming a
functionary of the <span class="country" title="A country.">Independent Congo State</span> was a singular
one to me. But <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Stanley</span> pointed out that I should have a
privileged position; that the <span class="country" title="A country.">State</span> on its side could only
gain by seeing its establishments on the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Upper Congo</span></span>
supported by the authority which for many years past I
had acquired over the people of the interior, who all knew
me through having traded with me ; while,as regarded
myself, I could not but strengthen my commercial relations
by means of the support which the <span class="country" title="A country.">Congo State</span> would
afford to me, as to all who were established on its
territory.</p>
<p class="p ">"I perceived the justice of these arguments, and I had,
moreover, at heart to remedy, as far as I could, the
mischief which the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arabs</span> and the population at the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span>
had done in destroying the station at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Stanley Falls</span>. This
act was the result of misunderstanding and imprudence; but
I do not think that I can refuse to make reparation if, as
I believe, I can do so."</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span> admitted that he was also influenced by
commercial considerations of another kind, and said :—</p>
<p class="p ">"The circumstances under which trade is carried on
with the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">East <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Coast">coast</u></span> are no longer so favourable as some
years back, when I commenced trading with <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> and
abroad. Trade at that period had, so to speak, no
existence. I established myself at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Houron</span>, near <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tabora</span>,
with my old father and my brother <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mohamed Massoudi</span>,
wishing first to create in the neigbbourhood plantations
yielding satisfactory returns, and above all to monopolize
the ivory trade by establishing <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> correspondents
throughout <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span>, on the shores of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lakes</span>,
and as far <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span>. The people of the centre, who
had no means of disposing of their considerable stocks of
ivory, let me have them at a price which enabled me to
realize a large profit. In a short time I had monopolized
nearly all the sources of ivory production,
and all the trade of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Manyema</span> was in my hands.</p>
<p class="p ">"The great difficulty has always been to bring the
produce of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span> to the markets of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tabora</span> and
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. At first this was easy enough, but gradually
the people of the centre became aware that they could
also gain something by my operations, and commenced
imposing heavy tribute upon me for right of way through
their territories. For instanoe, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Wa-Kundis</span>, who
alone possess the boats necessary for crossing the
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Malagarazi</span>, exact exorbitant terms for the use of them.
Certain tribes sometimes attacked my caravans, causing
me heavy loss in men and merchandise.</p>
<p class="p ">"Even on the coast the conditions of trade changed.
The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Germans</span> were everywhere, and their pretentions
rendered business more and more difficult. Great
difficulties arose from this state of things, and on all these
grounds I concluded that if the trade of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span>
could follow another route and reach the coast by sure
roads on which no tribute would have to be paid, and
where no difficulties were to be apprhended, everybody
would be the gainer. After what I have seea at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Banana</span>
and <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Boma</span> I believe I am not mistaken, and that traders
like myself can only gain by dispatching their produce
from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span> by way of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span> and the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo</span>."</p>
<p class="p ">On being asked what he would do on reaching the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span>,
and how he would fulfil his mission, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span>
replied :—</p>
<p class="p ">"In the first place I feel sure that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Stanley</span> will succeed
in his enterprise and relieve <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Emin Pasha</span>. He is a real
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> for energy and intelligence. I do not know yet for
certain whether I shall go with him as far as <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Wadelai</span>, but
I think I shall. Once installed at the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span>, I shall rebuild
the stations and summon all the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> chiefs to
a great meeting, at which I shall announce to them my nomination
as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span>, and my intentions. They will
be surprised, I expect, to see me arrive from this side, for
the news of my leaving <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Stanley</span> and of my
nomination as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Governor</span> cannot reach <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span> and
<span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span> in less than four or five months, and I shall
arrive at the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span> before that time. When order is
reestablished at the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span>, I shall probably undertake a
commercial expedition to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span> and the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Lake
region</span>."</p>
<p class="p ">The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> chief's real name is <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Hamed-ben-Hamed</span>, the
<span class="italic "><em>sobriquet</em></span> of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span> having been given to him owing to
a twitching of the eyelids to which he is subject. The
best understanding exists between <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Stanley</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo
Tib</span>, and the latter has already been of great assistance in
maintaining order among the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> men</span>. Son of an
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzbiar</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tippoo Tib</span> detests negroes, and is
attached to the whites, whom, in conversation, he calls his
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span> brothers.</p>
