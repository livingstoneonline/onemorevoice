Warning: Readers should exercise caution when consulting this text and others published by the “BIPOC Voices” project due to the possible inclusion of offensive or otherwise problematic historical language. Readers should also take note that any racist or similar elements in the texts do not necessarily represent the real views of the BIPOC creator(s), but rather may be due to the (often silent) intervention of Victorian-era white British missionaries, editors, and publishers.

  Abdool Meseeh's Hymn.
  We hope that some of our young friends know, and can repeat, that
    beautiful hymn of good Abdool Meseeh, which we print below, but we hope,
    also, they are able to do more than repeat it, we mean feel it. Abdool was
    a Mohammedan, but was converted by the Spirit of God on reading a New
    Testament, in Persion, which was given him by the Rev. Henry Martyn.
    He was baptized in Calcutta, by the name of Abdool Meseeh, which means
    Servant of Christ. Some time after this, he was ordained a minister of the
    Gospel, by Bishop Herber, but he did not live long afterwards. He died
    in March 1827. On his death bed he sung the hymn we have referred
    to, which he had composed a short time before. Of course, it was not in
    English, but the translation made is quite a faithful one.
  
    
      Beloved Savior let not me
      In thy kind heart forgotten be:
      Of all that deck the field or bower,
      Thou art the fairest, sweetest flower.
    
    
      Youth's morn has fled, old age comes on
      But sin distracts my soul alone:
      Beloved Savior let not me
      In thy kind heart forgotten be.
