  <h5 style="text-align:center;">[from] Not Far from the Kingdom of God</h5>
  <p>[�] One man wrote to Mr. Vaughan in these most touching words:�</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">I am always very thankful to you for your kind
    exertions to save my
    soul from eternal ruin. I am not one of those who hold that Baptism is
    merely an outward ceremony, and not required for our salvation, yet
    such is my weakness that I cannot make up my mind to sacrifice a little
    earthly comfort for its sake. I am fully aware that I am pursuing a
    wrong course, and that if I wait for a "convenient time" that time
    may not come to me at all; but what shall I do? I have been delaying
    for a long time to confess openly the Saviour to whom alone I look for
    salvation. I need nothing to be convinced that I am doing wrong, and
    yet I cannot go up boldly to you to receive Baptism.</p>
