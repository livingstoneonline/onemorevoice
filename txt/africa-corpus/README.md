This corpus was compiled by Caitlin Matheis for a 2021 computational text analysis project for the *[One More Voice](https://onemorevoice.org/)* recovery project. The corpus encompasses 74 plain text (TXT) files containing nineteenth- and early twentieth-century literary works in English by 36 different British and African writers. All the works focus on different regions and locations on the African continent. Questions about the corpus and project can be directed to Caitlin Matheis (<cmatheis2@huskers.unl.edu>), the creator of the corpus, and Adrian S. Wisnicki (<awisnicki@unl.edu>), lead developer for *One More Voice*.

The corpus contains a balance of fiction and nonfiction works, as well as a balance between British authored and African authored works. The texts were selected by consulting the lists on the *One More Voice* “[Book-Length Published Works](https://onemorevoice.org/books.html)” page, while several additional titles were recommended by Dr. Adrian S. Wisnicki or drawn from the *Livingstone Online* [bibliography](https://livingstoneonline.org/resources/david-livingstone-bibliography). Additionally, Justin Livingstone, a *One More Voice* contributor, recommended many of the corpus's fictional texts. Finally, Ng'ang'a Wahu-Mũchiri, another *One More Voice* contributor, peer reviewed the whole list of works. (Note: Amardeep Singh’s corpus of [Colonial South Asian Literature](https://github.com/amardeepmsingh/Colonial-South-Asian-Literature) (2020) also served as a significant source of inspiration for the development of the present corpus.)

For most of the works, we located a scanned version of the first British edition; however, for the works where first edition scans were not available, we used the text of the earliest edition we could find. The majority of texts derive from the *[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)*, though some of the texts also come from *[HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/)*. The source and direct URL are indicated at the beginning of each plain text file. To create the files included in the corpus, we first downloaded the plain text OCR versions provided by the *Internet Archive* or *HathiTrust*. We then manually removed any extraneous text before the frontispiece of the book, corrected text from the frontispiece and title page to match the original because we noted that such text tended to be especially error-laden, but otherwise made no other alterations or corrections to the texts. As a result, each text file will exhibit some degree of erroneous text, which we estimate to be about 5-10%, though the figure may be higher in some cases.
