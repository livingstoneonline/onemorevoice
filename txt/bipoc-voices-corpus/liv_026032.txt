  THE FALSE AND THE TRUE VASANTA RAYAR.
  A Narrative of Religious Excitement in Southern India
    Ten Years ago.
  BY THE REV. DR.
    SARGENT.
  
  [...]
  
    (Proclamation of Vasanta Rayar.)
    Then follows the narrative, describing the address of Devenderan,
      with Vishnu's reply, in which he promises to appear on
      earth as "Vasanta Rayar." He is accordingly born on the tenth
      day of the tenth month in the year 1850, in Gowdama, on the
      Godaveri, north-east of Cashmere. In due course he is instructed
      by the holy sages of Mount Meru, and their utterances
      regarding him are recorded as oracles. Various kinds of deaths
      and ailments befalling the opponents are mentioned as precursors
      of the great event of Vasanta Rayar's reign. Thus:&#8212;
    "By the treachery of friends and assaults of open
      foes some will fall.
      By atrocities of various kinds will the goddess Kali destroy some. By the
      volcanic action of Mount Keilasam some will die. The idols in the Siva
      and Vishnu temples will rise up and dance, and this sight will kill some.
      Infants and old men will fall from mountain tops and die. Foxes,
      kites, and owls will howl and screech day and night unceasingly.
      Four stars will appear in the sky in open day, and a fearful sound be
      heard in the heavens. Creatures that live in water will cry out, 'We have
      got on land, we have got on land,' and making straight for Mount Keilasam,
      and entering Veera Malaram Temple, will stay there eight days, and
      then vanish. In the Temple of Kumara Sami, the door will be shut seven
      days, and in consequence a furious wind will blow, and destroy many
      people. Demons, tigers, and wild beasts will injure multitudes, and blood
      suffuse all eyes. At time of new moon, full moon will rise. At dead of
      night the sun will rise. Blood will fall as rain. The goddess of fortune
      will weep. The ocean and rivers will rage. The goddess Terra will salute
      and acknowledge Vasanta Rayar as supreme lord. Then charities and
      virtues will flourish as of old. People of every caste will rejoice. Rain
      will pour three times every month. Crops of grain will grow profusely.
      Gifts and charities be everywhere abundant. Brahmins, Chattriyas, Visyas,
      and Sudras will be prosperous, performing their respective duties."
  
    Then follow promises to those who promote the matter:&#8212;
        
    "Whoever believes what is herein mentioned, whoever
      performs poojah
      to this book, will have health, with long life, riches, possessions, and conveyances.
      Whoever will not write, nor read, nor hear this book, but
      ridicule and revile it, will be annihilated, worms will breed in their
      mouth, and the furies will torment them."
    "We, the emissaries in this matter, were seized and
      brought before the
      vile fellows who hold the present reins of government. They put powder
      and shot in their guns and fired at us, when the two balls came and fell
      into our hands."
    "Therefore in the year Perabava (1867)* Vasanta Rayar
      will come to
      reign, and that you who are virtuous may know this matter, we have
      written and sent this revelation to the several provinces. The virtuous
      and those who meditate on Siva, even if weak in the eyes, if they copy
      this book, and make poojah to it, will receive all that they wish for in
      their prayers. All who write, or read, or hear and worship this book,
      whatever be their present age, will be prosperous till he, Vasanta Rayar,
      come. Pluto cannot approach nor afflict with his pangs any who laud this
      book. The gods prosper you."
  
  Observing the excitement created on all sides by these proclamations,
      I determined to meet it, and take advantage of it, by
      publishing a tract reviewing the documents, and setting forth
      Jesus Christ as the true Vasanta Rayar. This tract of forty
      pages became for the time exceedingly popular, not only in Tinnevelly,
      but also in Travancore and Malabar, where a Malayalim
      translation of it was read with great avidity. It served not only
      to explode the current notions regarding the Hindu Messiah, but
      it was made useful under God's blessing to the conversion of
      several parties. One of the Basle missionaries wrote to me to
      say that he knew four persons who had been converted to
      Christianity by the perusal of this tract. It was styled:&#8212;
  
    [...]
    (Truth Victorious.)
    "GLORIOUS NEWS OF THE TRUE VASANTA RAYAR."
  
  Within three months after the publication of the tract, the
      excitement regarding Vasanta Rayar ceased, and not long after
      the matter was completely ignored.
  (In our next we shall give some extracts from this interesting tract.)
  
  
    * The Hindus reckon by cycles of sixty years, of which twenty are considered
      fortunate, twenty indifferent, and twenty unfortunate. Perabava is the first of
      the fortunate. [return]
