						<p>William Ivens Craft arrived into a foreign world when he joined his family in the United States. Nonetheless, he soon found himself at the center of the burgeoning African American political world in Washington, DC. He also tasted firsthand the bitter racism present in the new expanding federal state and bureaucracy.</p>

              <h3 id="friends">Old Friends and New</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>After ostensibly finishing their schooling in England, the two brothers left their home and traveled to the United States to join their family. On 3 March 1873, sixteen-year-old Brougham and eighteen-year-old William arrived aboard the ship <em>Manitoba</em> at Baltimore and set foot on American soil for the first time. They reported upon arrival that they intended to head to Savannah, most likely to join their family (“‘Manitoba’ Passenger List” 1873). What they found stood in stark contrast to their lives in London.</p>

						<p class="caption-text">Bell & Bro., “<a aria-label="External Link" href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2002723683/">‘Baltimore Harbor, Baltimore M.D.’</a>” (Photograph, [1870]), STEREO U.S. GEOG FILE - Maryland--Baltimore--Harbor [item] [P&P], Library of Congress, Washington, United States. No known restrictions on publication. William Ivens and Brougham might have seen something similar to this view as they stepped down the gangplank and entered the US for the first time. They also for the first time likely encountered populations of other free Black people in the city of Baltimore, which they stayed in only briefly before heading to the nation's capital.</p>

              <p>Despite listing their intended destination as Savannah upon their arrival in 1873, William Ivens and Brougham did not make it there that year or even the next. The brothers, who both likely spoke with a British lilt, spent the rest of 1873 and beginning of 1874 in the nation’s capital. Wendell Phillips – an old friend of Ellen and William – later remembered that in early 1874 he encountered William Ivens, “who, I had supposed was assisting his father in Georgia.” Phillips claimed that William Ivens “was idling away his time. [...] I was told while in Washington that young Crafts was doing nothing and living on his friends” (Anonymous 1878f).</p>

Public domain. Famed white abolitionist and orator Wendell Phillips aided William and Ellen Craft in their attempt to break free from slavery's clutches in the 1840s. In 1849, he wrote: "future historians and poets would tell [the Crafts' escape] story as one of the most thrilling in the nation’s annals, and millions would read it, with admiration of the hero and heroine of the story." He firmly supported political and civil rights for Black men and women, and advocated for the redistribution of land to formerly enslaved people. The Crafts even named their first son, Charles Estlin Phillips Craft, after the activist. However, in the 1870s, Phillips publicly derided the Craft family as lazy and deceptive.</p>
  
              <p>In contrast to Phillips’ calumny, however, William Ivens was gainfully employed as a messenger for the US government by the end of March 1874. He lived at 1416 I Street NW with his brother, Brougham, who continued his schooling and attended Howard University during their stay in the city (Anonymous 1878d; Davis 2021). The pair undoubtedly made new, and for the first time, American, friends.</p>

             <p> 1416 I Street NW was somewhat of a hub for the burgeoning Black political elite in the early 1870s, and especially during the year that Wiliam Ivens and Brougham spent there. In 1871 the building was listed as a boarding house run by a man named John Browne (“Boyd’s Directory” 1871, 43). It was the place of residence of Josiah T. Walls, the first African American elected to Congress from Florida (and the last, until 1992). Walls served in the House of Representatives from 1871 to 1876.</p>

No known restrictions on publication. Josiah Thomas Walls also boarded in the same quarters as William Ivens. Whether he and William Ivens crossed paths is unclear, but it is likely that they moved in the same social, political, and intellectual circles.</p>
              
              <p>Also at 1416 I Street lived another US Representative from South Carolina, <a aria-label="External Link" href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/12753">Robert B. Elliott</a>. Like William Ivens, pieces of Elliott’s biography are shrouded – due to a lack of extant paper documentation. Elliott was likely born in Boston in 1842 to parents who had moved there from the West Indies (although, some sources claim Elliott’s birthplace was England, near Liverpool, which would in fact make his story even more closely resemble that of the Craft children). He received his schooling at High Holborn Academy and went on to study law at Eton College, graduating in 1859 (Lamson 1973, 23).</p>

Muller & Co., “<a aria-label="External Link" href="https://www.loc.gov/item/00651115/">Robert Elliott Brown</a>” (Illustration, New York, [c.1883]), detail, Prints and Photographs Division, PGA - Muller--Distinguished colored men (D size) [P&P], Library of Congress, Washington, United States. No known restrictions on publication. Robert Brown Elliot, Representative from South Carolina, was a member of the cohort of African American representatives to U.S. Congress during the Reconstruction era. Prior to the white supremacist backlash and the subsequent disenfranchisement of Black voters, Elliot was one of sixteen Black Congressmen, who joined the ranks of over 600 Black men elected to state legislatures, and countless more elected to local offices in the South. Congress would not see so many Black Representatives and Senators from the US South again until the end of the twentieth century.</p>
                
              <p>It is unclear where Elliott was and what he did throughout the turbulent years of the US Civil War, but by 1867 he had traveled to South Carolina, where he was admitted to the bar, published a paper with Richard H. Cain, and was elected to Congress several years later (Lamson 1973, 21,23; Russell 1984, 44). And, in 1874, while living under the same roof as William Ivens and Brougham, Elliott rose to national fame for a speech he gave on the House Floor in support of legislation that would secure federal civil rights for Black Americans – a direct rebuttal to a speech made only a day earlier by former Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens. With a journey that paralleled the Craft childrens’ in many ways, it is unsurprising but nonetheless exciting to see Elliott and William Ivens – ten years apart in age – rooming together in Washington, DC, in 1874.</p>

Elliott delivering his impassioned rebuttal to the former Confederacy's Vice President, Alexander H. Stephens. This imagery, of a free Black man representing the former slave and Confederate state of South Carolina debating the former white Vice President of a nation built on the foundation of racialized slavery on the floor of the US House of Representatives, encapsulates both the promise and defeat bound up in Reconstruction-era politics and law. African American men and women fought for and gained political power in unprecedented ways while others in the Union sought reconciliation over all else and restored rebels and Confederates to their previous positions in government.</p>
                
              <p>In Washington, the Craft brothers lived and no doubt socialized with some of the most prominent members of the new elite Black political class, who likely influenced the young men and sharpened their ambition for political and economic success. In his time as a government employee, William Ivens managed to save some money and opened two accounts at the Washington, D.C., branch of the newly established Freedmen’s Savings Bank (“Freedman’s Bank Records” 1874a, 1874b; “Boyd’s Directory” 1874, 148).</p>

Public domain. William Ivens was just one of the many African Americans who put their trust and capital in a federal instution, only to be robbed of both.</p>
  
              <p>Yet whatever money the brothers might have saved was quickly lost to white greed and recklessness. The Freedmen’s Savings Bank, ostensibly secured by congressional oversight, failed late in 1874 due to unrestrained railroad speculation perpetrated by its white trustees (Baradaran 2017, 25-31). By late 1873 or 1874, Brougham decided to join his family down in Georgia--though he still appeared at 1416 I Street NW in the 1874 Washington, DC, directory (while William Ivens did not) (Blackett 1986, 127; “Boyd’s Directory” 1874, 148). It is here that William Ivens’ path would, possibly for the first time, diverge from that of his younger brother.</p>

              <p><strong>Lead image commentary:</strong> This photograph shows a large group of men and women, presumably students, standing on the lawn in front of Howard University in Washington, D. C. This photo captured the school as it looked in the late nineteenth century, as it might have when Brougham Craft, William Ivens’ brother, attended for a stint in the 1870s while the two lived in Washington, D. C. It is possible, though we have no record of it, that William Ivens also went to school at Howard while in that city, surrounded by the flourishing Black intellectual and political culture.</p><!-- Change -->
