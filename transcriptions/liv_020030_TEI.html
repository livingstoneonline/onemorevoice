                              ink, and paper.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In five minutes the writing materials were 
                              forthcoming, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, placing the paper on the top of his hat, wrote a few words, folded the paper and
                              put it in the hands of the emancipated negro.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The eyes of the black sparkled with delight as he clutched the deed which conferred
                              on him his freedom; he poured forth a thousand thanks for his master's kindness, in
                              the middle of which we quitted the hut and returned to the great house.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Neither <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> nor myself, however, retired to rest.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The former's scheme remained yet to be completed and put in execution, and the morning's
                              light found us busily engaged in the preparations for <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s funeral.

                           <p class="p  ">By eight o'clock all was completed—the coffin made, the shroud prepared and everything else that was necessary in readiness—even the grave was dug.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All being in excellent train, we proceeded to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>'s cottage, preceded by a dozen negroes carrying the funeral gear.
                           </p>
                           		
                           
                           <p class="p  "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> was still lying where we had left him, but the entrance of so many persons caused
                              him to turn round towards them. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span> however, and the negroes who accompanied him, the latter of whom were well tutored, appeared
                              not to take any notice of his having stirred.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> was supposed to be dead; and all that remained to be done was to bury him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Accordingly four stout strong fellows raised <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> upright on the bed and commenced to strip him of his clothes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether it was that the dead man was frightened into insensibility by the imposing
                              preparations, or whether he was too weak from the effects of the emetic to make any
                              resistance, I am not prepared to say; but he lay like a log in the hands of the negroes,
                              by whom he was speedily dressed in his grave-clothes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I had donned an old gray dressing gown, and with a <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Johnson</span>'s dictionary in my hand, stood ready to act the part of the parson.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Still <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> moved not.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The coffin was brought in—he seemed not to see it: he was placed in it, and yet was
                              insensible of what was being done—but when the lid was about to be put on, then, and
                              not till then, did <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span> afford any <br>

                              evidence of his being a living man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He yelled, he shrieked, cursed, 
                              swore, tore the grave-clothes, and struggled so manfully, that it was with the utmost
                              difficulty he was forced down into the coffin, and that the lid, in which several
                              small holes were bored, was slightly fastened 
                              down.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The old nurse, too, seemed to have been half mad at the extraordinary proceedings.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She declared that the poor boy was not dead—and that we were committing murder.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Tom</span>, however, silenced her by saying that the boy was dead, and that it was only the
                              jumbi of his grandy which had appeared to him, that had entered his body and was playing
                              such tricks.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The old woman believed this probable explanation, and was immediately quieted.

                              one of his white teeth was seen—gums and all.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But how can I describe the scene which took place when the coffin was lowered into
                              grave.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Curgy</span>, who had not ceased his exertions while he was being borne along to free himself
                              from his unnatural position, no sooner heard the first shovel full of earth upon the
                              coffin, than fear lent him the strength of a giant; with one powerful kick he knocked
                              off the top of the coffin—started up before we had time to hold him—and fled away
                              as if the devil was at his heels, the whole troop of negroes following helter skelter
                              after him.

                              his attempt, this is to request the friends of the undersigned to lodge the rascal in the nearest house of correction until he is sent for.
