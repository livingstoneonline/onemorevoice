PREFACE
By D. JONES
PURCHASE
ESTATE
EARLY in 1915 it was my good fortune to make the
acquaintance of Mr. Solomon Plaatje, a native Bechuana,
and as I found him to possess unusual linguistic ability,
I suggested to him that a useful purpose would be served
if we were to make an analysis of his native language on
modern phonetic lines. He readily agreed, and between
May 1915 and September 1916 we had constant meetings,
and have succeeded in producing a very complete and,
we believe, accurate record of the pronunciation of this
extraordinarily interesting language, including what has,
as far as I know, never before been attempted, viz. the
determination of the precise nature of the tones.
It is for various reasons not possible to publish the
whole of our results at the present time. The remainder
will, however, be forthcoming when opportunity offers.
We hope, in particular, to give at some future date much
more detailed descriptions of every sound and instructions
as to how each sound may be acquired by the foreign
learner.
Mention
may
be made here of one feature of Sechuana
pronunciation which we have not yet completely fathomed,
and which must be left for future investigations. We
have not yet been able to discover any general principles

governing the use of the sounds i and e, v and o. It
appears that in some words : is an essential sound, in
others e is essential, but in a very large number of cases
i and e are interchangeable; similar considerations apply
to v and o. It seems to us highly probable that some
general principles exist which when discovered will lead
to a simplification of the transcription, and may even
make it possible (by adopting some convention) to dis-
pense with the letters i and o altogether.
Not having been able, however, to discover any such
principles, we have thought it well for the purpose of
this book not to strive after simplification in this matter,
but to provide materials which may help others towards
the elucidation of the problem presented by these vowels.
We have done this by using italic letters to indicate
every case where alternation between 1 and e or v and o
appears possible. A comparison of all the cases, and
probably also an investigation of the pronunciation of
other natives, will be required before the principles
governing the use of the sounds i and e, u and o can be
satisfactorily established.
We wish it, then, to be clearly understood that the use
of these italics is to be regarded as a provisional device
only; when once the rules regarding the use of the
vowels in question have been discovered, the cases of
alternation will not require to be specially indicated.
In conclusion, I should like to emphasize one point for
the benefit of those who are not familiar with modern

PREFACE
By S. PLAATJE
The sen-
I HAD but a vague acquaintance with phonetics until
early in 1915, when Miss Mary Werner took me one day
to the Phonetics Department of University College, Lon-
don, where Mr. Daniel Jones was conducting a class.
After some exercises I gave the students a few Sechuana
sentences, which Mr. Jones wrote phonetically on the
blackboard. The result was to me astonishing. I saw
some English ladies, who knew nothing of Sechuana,
look at the blackboard and read these phrases aloud
without the least trace of European accent.
tences included the familiar question, "leina ja-xaxo
ima??" ("- What is your name?"), and it was as if I
heard the question put by Bahurutshe women on the
banks of the Marico River. I felt at once what a blessing
it would be if missionaries were acquainted with phone-
tics. They would then be able to reproduce not only the
sounds of the language, but also the tones, with accuracy.
Their congregations would be spared the infliction, only
too frequent at the present time, of listening to wrong
words, some of them obscene, proceeding from the mouth
of the preacher in place of those which he has in mind
(which have similar conventional spellings but different
tones)

The frequency of such errors will be understood when
I mention that there are at present not more than about
half a dozen missionaries who can really speak the
Sechuana language with fluency. Yet I have heard
some of them say pukwa (Mr. Nose) for y:kw? (tiger),
bu:a (to skin) for bù:a (to speak), nò:to (a note) for no:to
(a hammer), etc.
If phonetics were studied by everyone who wished
to learn the language, we should soon hear no more
of such errors; moreover, authors of books would no
longer be constrained to make such statements as the
difference in sound in this word can be distinguished by
a native, but not written." I
Since my first introduction to phonetics it has been
my pleasure on many occasions to sit and listen to Mr.
Jones reading aloud (from phonetic texts) long and diffi-
cult Sechuana passages, of which he did not know the
meaning, with a purity of sound and tone more perfect
than I have ever heard from Englishmen in Africa
who did know the meaning of the words they were
uttering
It is not the foreigner alone who would benefit by
a study of the phonetics of Sechuana. The younger
generation of Bechuana are to some extent losing the
original Sechuana tones. This is particularly the case
in the south of Bechuanaland, where the children now

generally say, e.g., kea-x]-Fi:ta instead of kèa-xo-Fxta
(I am taller than you).
It is my hope that Bechuana readers of this little book
will induce their friends to acquaint themselves with the
use of phonetics, if only to retain a correct pronunciation
of their mother-tongue. No elaborate course of study is
necessary for mastering the principles of phonetic writing.
I was myself able to write phonetically soon after I had
tried. Had the subject been a difficult one, this book
would never have been written, as my exacting duties
in London would not have permitted me to follow an
elaborate course of instruction.

INTRODUCTION
OBJECT OF THE BOOK
1. The object of this book is threefold. It is in-
tended (1) as a collection of reading-matter suitable
either for native Bechuanas or for foreign learners of
the Sechuana language, (2) as a guide to the pronuncia-
tion of the language, and (3) to demonstrate the de-
sirability and the feasibility of writing African languages
on the " one sound one letter" basis.
THE TEXTS
2. Texts I-XII have been specially written for this
book by Mr. Plaatje; they consist of native fables and
stories of adventure. Text No. XIII is a translation by
Mr. Plaatje from an English original; No. XIV is an
invented dialogue, adapted by Mr. Plaatje from an
English original; No. XV is the conventional version
of the Lord's Prayer,
THE ORTHOGRAPHY
3. In our opinion, no system of writing can be con-
sidered adequate which allows two words which are
pronounced differently to be written the same. In other
words, we hold that all " significant" distinctions should
be indicated. In all previous systems of writing the
Sechuana language the principle of indicating all signifi-

INTRODUCTION
no
cant distinctions has not been followed. Thus the tones
have never before been marked, though numberless
words may be distinguished by tones; and in more
than one of the existing orthographies essential dis-
tinctions of articulated sound are ignored.
4. The unsatisfactory nature of most African ortho-
graphies arises from the fact that authors have not
realized what an immense simplification can be effected
by supplementing the letters of the Roman alphabet by
a few new letters. They may have realised the fact that
the Roman alphabet, as it is, is inadequate to meet the
needs of many African languages, but they have not
hitherto hit on the right remedy. At best they have
tried to eke out the Roman letters by using accented
letters to represent sounds for which there was
suitable plain letter, a plan which can be shown to have
serious drawbacks.
5. The introduction of some new letters enables us
to write any language on the one sound one letter
principle. A system based on this principle is neces-
sarily easier than any other for natives to learn, and is
at the same time the most accurate guide to pronuncia-
tion for the foreign learner. Moreover, by this plan the
tops and bottoms of vowel-letters are left free for the
insertion of marks to denote any sound-attributes that
may be necessary, such as tones, nasality, or devocali-
zation.
6. Of the existing phonetic alphabets founded on the
"one sound one letter" basis the best is undoubtedly
that of the International Phonetic Association. We have,
therefore, adopted it in this book."
See, for instance, Jespersen's Phonetische Grundfragen, p. 19.

7. The main features of the International Phonetic
Alphabet are already known to the majority of the
younger generation of language teachers in England, the
system having been employed for many years past in
various schools and colleges in connection with the
teaching of French and other languages. The principal
(unaccented) types are possessed by many printers, and
may be purchased at prices not greatly exceeding those
of ordinary type.
THE PRONUNCIATION
8. The pronunciation represented in the texts is that
of Mr. Plaatje. Mr. Plaatje belongs to the Barolong
the I. P. A. has not yet decided upon signs. Two other minor
changes have also been made, viz. the addition of a cross-bar to
the I. P. A. I (to distinguish it better from i when surmounted by
a tone-mark) and the use of a for the I. P. A. ü (in order to have
the top of the letter free for the addition of tone-marks).
1 See, for instance, the Memorandum on the Teaching of Modern
Languages (Circular 797) issued by the Board of Education in 1912
and published by Wyman, price 3d. (particularly p. 19 and the
Appendix and note on p. 28). See also The Means of Training in
Phonetics available for Modern Language Teachers, by L. H. Althaus
(International Phonetic Association, 1912), where it is stated (p. 6)
that "of twenty-three [English] Universities and Colleges in which
French phonetics is taught twenty-two use the system of the Inter-
national Phonetic Association."
? See the various books in which the system is used. A list of
about 200 of these books was published in the Principles of the
I. P. A., 1912. Among the printers possessing International
Phonetic types we may mention the Clarendon Press, the Cambridge
University Press, Messrs. Richard Clay (Bungay) [the printers of
this book], Constable (London), Heffer (Cambridge), Turnbull and
Spears (Edinburgh).

INTRODUCTION
(barolo:y) tribe and has lived the greater part of his life
in Mafeking (marikèzy). The texts in this book may
therefore be taken as typical of the speech of the
Barolong natives.
VALUES OF THE LETTERS
9. The Sechuana language contains twenty-four ele-
mentary consonant-sounds, viz. :-
p, b, t, c, j, k, 1, m, n, p, q, 1,
l, r, , F, , J, 9, x, h, w, W, 4,
and ten vowel-sounds, viz. :-
i, 1, e, a, a, 0, 0, 0, u, H.
10. Of these the consonant-sounds c, d, 4, and the
vowel-sound # are probably "non-distinctive " in respect
to the sounds t, 1, w, and u. By this we mean that the
substitution of the sounds t, 1, w, u, respectively, for the
sounds c, d, 4, #, would probably never change the
meaning of any word. At the same time c, d, 4, # are
so distinct in sound from t, 1, w, u, that the substitution
of the latter sounds would constitute mispronunciations ;
it seems, therefore, desirable to assign special letters to
the sounds c, d, 4, #. (In simplified orthography the
sounds might, if desired, be represented by t, 1, w, u.)
11. Besides the above-mentioned thirty-four sounds
there exist two other non-distinctive sounds, viz. the
1 Reference is here made only to the obligatory c figuring in the
texts (i.e. as first element of the affricates cs and cl). c also exists
in Sechuana as a variant of k ($ 20); in the cases where this occurs
the use of c is never obligatory, and the interchange of k and c can
neither affect the meaning nor lead to an incorrect pronunciation.

consonant-sound j and the vowel-sound ?. These sounds
may be used in certain well-defined circumstances (see
$$ 38, 51), but their use is never obligatory. They need
not, therefore, be considered as essential speech-sounds of
the language, and it is not necessary to use the letters
in Sechuana phonetic texts. The same may be said of
the c which occurs as a variant of k ($ 20).
12. The language also contains five affricate consonant-
groups, viz. : Es, t?, cs, c9, and kx.
13. The following simple consonants and affricates
occur aspirated (i.e. followed by the sound h) as well as
unaspirated: p, t, k, ts, cs, cq. tl only occurs aspirated,
i.e. in the groups tlh, tlwh.
14. The mode of formation of the Sechuana sounds is
indicated roughly in the table on p. xvi. Certain details
are given in $$ 15-51, but for full information, explana-
tions of technical terms, and instructions as to the best
means of acquiring the sounds, the reader is referred to
the textbooks of phonetic theory.

may be used indifferently, the tendency being on
the whole to use the closed glottis variety (pho-
netically p') where emphasis is required. It is to
be understood that wherever p occurs in the texts
with a vowel or w following, either p' or
por un-
aspirated p may be used.
Aspirated p (written ph) also occurs.
16. b. Lip-articulation as in English, but fully voiced.
17. t. Tongue-tip articulation as in English. When
followed by a vowel or w the sound is either
unaspirated or pronounced with closed glottis, the
case being similar to that of p (see $ 15).
Aspirated t (written th) also occurs.
t also occurs as the first element of the affricate
ts; when ts is not aspirated, it is generally pro-
nounced with closed glottis.
18. C.
c is the phonetic sign for the breathed "palatal "
plosive, i.e. the breathed plosive consonant articu-
lated in the same place as the sound j.1
In the texts in this book the letter c is only used
in the representation of the affricate groups of, cq.

palatal. In cq the precise point of articulation of
the plosive element seems to vary between true
palatal and palato-alveolar. The tip of the tongue

ear intermediate between English p and b, t and d, etc.
When a sound requiring closed glottis is followed by a vowel, that
vowel is necessarily started off with a glottal stop; this glottal stop
is generally made as nearly as possible simultaneous with the
primary articulation of the consonant.

remains near the lower teeth in the formation of
these affricates.
c also occurs as a variant of k (see § 20).
19. J. ; is the voiced palatal plosive. In Sechuana the
contact is generally weak; frequently the position
of complete contact is not reached at all, in which
case the sound becomes a j. It is to be under-
stood that j is a possible variant for ; throughout.
20. k. k before back vowels has the same tongue-articul-
ation as in English. Before front vowels the
point of articulation is distinctly advanced (more
so than in English), so much so, in fact, that the
sound often becomes c. Thus Mr. Plaatje's name
is pronounced either plà:ki (with an advanced k)
or plà:ci (with full palatal articulation). It is to
be understood throughout that the sound c may
always be substituted for k before the front vowels
(i, i, e, and e).
Whenever the k-sound is followed by a vowel or
w, it is either unaspirated or pronounced with
closed glottis, the case being similar to that of p
(see § 15).
Aspirated k (written kh) also occurs. It is
distinct from the affricate kx.
21. tl. tl represents a t exploded laterally. It appears
to be always pronounced with closed glottis in
Sechuana, and acquires thereby a characteristic
quality resembling the sound of a click. It is, how-
ever, not a true click, but an "implosive" sound.
1 In a true click air enters at the point of primary articulation ;
in an implosive sound air passes outwards at the point of primary
articulation.

It strikes the ear as a single sound. In simplified
orthography the sound might be written tl.
22. m, n.
Formed as in English. When followed by
a consonant (other than w) these sounds are
syllabic.
23. p. p is the "palatal" nasal. There is in Sechuana
a tendency towards palato-alveolar articulation.
The tip of the tongue is not raised. The sound
may be taken to be identical with the normal
French sound of gn in montagne.
When followed by a consonant (other than y)
the sound n is syllabic.
24. 9. The Sechuana z is identical with the sound of ng
in the English word song (son).
When final or followed by a consonant (other
than w) the sound ? is syllabic.
25. 1. Tongue-tip articulation as in English. Reso-
nance 1 corresponding to the adjacent vowels.
The sound 1 does not occur before i or u in
Sechuana.
26. l. Unvoiced l. It only occurs in Sechuana in the
groups tlh, tlwh.
In simplified Sechuana orthography l might be
written simply 1.
27. r. Strongly rolled; never fricative as in English.
The sound is syllabic when immediately followed
by another r.

INTRODUCTION
28. 1. The consonant I is formed by placing the tip of
the tongue to one side against the hard palate
(behind the teeth-ridge), and then giving the
tongue a kind of flap forwards and downwards.
The contact is probably complete but loose, and as
the flap is made the air probably escapes both
medially and laterally at the same time. The
sound is a voiced one, and has to the English ear
an effect intermediate between that of d and that
of 1.
When pronounced with emphasis the sound I is
sometimes changed into d, but this change is
never essential.
I only occurs before i and u in Sechuana.
29. F. F is the breathed bi-labial fricative. It is much
the same as the sound made in blowing out a
candle. It has to the English ear an effect inter-
mediate between that of f and that of h.
As in English.
31. S. The English sound of sh, but pronounced with
spread lips.
32. 9. q is a breathed sound, having approximately the
tongue-position of j ? combined with a particular
kind of lip-rounding. The essential feature of
the lip-rounding is that the chief narrowing is
made by a point of the inside of the lower lip
against the upper teeth ; this point is between
and 1 an inch behind the edge of the lip. When
the sound q is pronounced with emphasis there

is considerable protrusion of the lips. The lip-
position is similar to that used in producing a
lip-teeth whistle.
The tongue-position appears to vary between
true palatal and palato-alveolar position. The
tongue-tip is always kept down, near the lower
teeth.
33. X.
Similar to the Scottish sound of ch in loch, but
with distinct uvular vibration.
34. h. Formed as in English. In Sechuana the sound
h often occurs as the aspiration of a preceding
consonant.
35. W.
The Sechuana w is not unlike the English sound
of w in well, but it generally seems to have a
lower tongue-position than the English sound.
The lip-position of the Sechuana w varies to some
extent according to the nature of the following
vowel. Before i, l, and e it is much the same as
in the English w, but before a there is less lip-
rounding, so that the sound becomes a variety of
o used in the capacity of a consonant (and might
in this case be written ;). Before e the articulation
is intermediate between this and the English w.
When w is preceded by a consonant, the lips
are put into the rounded position at the beginning
of the articulation of that consonant.
If the w
is preceded by more than one consonant, the lips
are put into the rounded position at the beginning
of the first of those consonants. Thus in n:twa
(war) the lips are rounded from the beginning of
the n to the end of the w.


## p. xxii (#28) ############################################

INTRODUCTION
w is often inserted in Sechuana to separate an
a from a preceding v or o. Thus morå (p. 17, 1. 4)
may also be pronounced mo:wa. Such insertion
is never essential.
In Sechuana the sound w does not occur before
0, 0, 0, or u.
36. w. Unvoiced w. It is one of the pronunciations of
wh in English. The sound only occurs in Sechuana
in the groups twh, tlwh. There are no instances
of these in the texts; examples are, tyhà:ni (a
kind of wild cat), tlwhà:re (python). In simplified
orthography w might be written simply w.
37. 4. The sound q has the lip-position of w, but a
tongue-position approaching that of i. It is
similar to the French consonantal sound of u in
nuit. In Sechuana the sound q appears to occur
only after n. Only one example occurs in the
texts in this book, viz..-bonqe (p. 11, 11. 8, 9). In
simplified orthography the sound might be written
w, since true w does not occur after p in Sechuana.
38. J. The English sound of
Y
in
yes.
In Sechuana J
is often inserted to separate an £, e, or e from a
preceding vowel; thus xà:e (p. 23, 1. 19), kr: è
(p. 11, 1. 2 from bottom), 7-bu? (p. 43, 1. 17) may
also be pronounced xà:je, ki je, -buje. Such
insertion of j is never essential.
j also occurs as a variant of ; (see § 19).
1 Some writers on phonetics use the letter M for W.

VOWELS
39. The vowels are best described by comparing them
with the eight " cardinal" vowels (i, e, a, a, a, 0, 0, u)
described in books on phonetics.1
40. i. The Sechuana i is cardinal vowel No. 1, i.e. the
"closest" possible variety of i. It is a pure
vowel, and is distinct from the diphthongic sound
so often heard in English words such as see, need.
The non-diphthongal variety of the English vowel
in see is nearer to the Sechuana i than to the
Sechuana i.
41. 1. The Sechuana z is intermediate in quality between
cardinal i and cardinal e.2 It requires much
practice on the part of the English learner to
distinguish it from i and from e.
Italic ; means that either : or e may be used,
I being probably the more frequent.
42. e. The Sechuana e has a tongue-position a shade
lower than cardinal e.2 The sound does not exist
in Southern English, but may be heard in the
Scottish pronunciation of words like day, fade.
It must be carefully distinguished from the
Southern English diphthongs heard in these
words.
Italic e means that either 1 or e may be used,
e being probably the more frequent.
1 A mastery of the cardinal vowels is an indispensable preliminary
for
anyone who wishes to analyse with accuracy the pronunciation
of foreign languages. These vowels are best learnt by oral instruc-

INTRODUCTION
45. a.
43. e. An exceedingly short e used in the capacity of-
a consonant. Its value varies somewhat accord-
ing to the nature of the following vowel, being an
undoubted e before o and o, but tending towards
? before o and a. (The sound only occurs before
these four vowels.)
44. E. The Sechuana e is cardinal vowel No. 3. It is
identical with the normal French sound of ê. The
sound occurs in the speech of many Southern
English people as the first element of the diph-
thong in fair (fæ?).
The most usual Sechuana a has a tongue-
position slightly advanced from cardinal vowel
No. 5. Many English speakers use a vowel
identical with this in words like father, calm.
When a syllable containing a is preceded by a
syllable containing u, v, or o (as in pu:la, "rain"),
there is a tendency to advance the a almost to a
(cardinal vowel No. 4).
In simplified orthography the letter a might, if
desired, be replaced by a.
The Sechuana o is intermediate between cardinal
vowels 5 and 6. It is much the same as the
average Southern English vowel in hot.
The Sechuana o is very nearly cardinal vowel
No. 7 (the French sound of Ô in tôt); the tongue-
position is, if anything, a shade lower than this.
The sound does not exist in Southern English,
but may be heard in the Scottish pronunciation of
words like home, go. It must be carefully dis-
tinguished from the diphthongs heard in the
various English pronunciations of such words.
Italic o means that either o or v may be used,
o being probably the more frequent.

48. 0. The Sechuana v is intermediate between the
cardinal vowels o and u. It requires much prac-
tice on the part of the English learner to dis-
tinguish it from o and from u.
Italic y means that eithér o or v may be used,
v being probably the more frequent.
49. u.
The Sechuana u is cardinal vowel No. 8, i.e. the
"closest" possible variety of u.
It is a pure
vowel, and is distinct from the diphthongic sounds
so often heard in English in words like too, food.
For y see § 67.
50. u.
A rounded vowel having tongue-position inter-
mediate between that of u and that of i. In rapid
speech it tends to become a true front vowel, i.e.
the French sound of u.1 # is a rare sound in
Sechuana, and appears to occur only after n;
there is no instance of the sound in this book.
In simplified orthography # might be written u,
since true u does not occur after .
The sound of a in the English word along. In
Sechuana e and : tend to change into a when
followed by x or kx. The use of ? in such cases
is, however, not essential.
51. a.
THE TONES
52. One of the most remarkable features of Sechuana
pronunciation is the use of significant word-tones.
tone is defined as the pitch of the voice with which a
syllable is pronounced. Every syllable in a Sechuana sen-
tence has a special pitch relatively to the other syllables ;
and if a syllable is said on a wrong pitch, it may change
the word into an entirely different word (see paragraph
12 on p. 41, and Preface, pp. viii, ix) or may give the
1 Phonetically y.

INTRODUCTION
word a wrong grammatical form. Syllabic m, n, p, y, r,
have tones just like any other syllable.
53. The tones are represented in this book by marks
chosen on the principle recommended by the International
Phonetic Association that each shall by its shape and
position give some indication of the musical value of the
tone.
54. The following are the essential tones :-
1. A high-level tone, indicated thus, a.
2. A lowered variety of high-level tone, indicated
thus, å. The term " semi-high " is suggested
for this tone.
3. mid-level tone, which is left unmarked.
4. A low-level tone, indicated thus, a.
5. A high-falling tone, indicated thus, à.
6. A low-falling tone, indicated thus, q.
55. There also exists a rising tone, which arises in all
cases from a juxtaposition of a mid-level and a high-level
tone. It is here indicated thus, aa (as in tlhaa, p. 13, 1. 1),
but it might also be written thus, á.
56. An exceptionally high tone (marked with =) occurs
once (p. 13, 1. 14); for details see note 2 on p. 13.
57. An idea of the musical values of the six essential
tones and the limits within which they may vary in
simple narration may be gathered from Text No. XIII,
in which a musical notation of the tones (for male voice)
is given. The music may, of course, be transposed up or
down to suit individual voices. For the female voice the
music should be transposed about a sixth higher. In
animated conversation the range of tone is often con-
siderably extended.
* Tones play an important part in the declension of nouns and
the conjugation of verbs.

NOTES ON THE INDIVIDUAL TONES
(1) Note on :
58. When a sentence begins with two consecutive
high-level tones, or when two high-level tones follow a
mid-tone, there is a tendency to lower slightly the first
of the high tones. Thus kxõsi (p. 17, 1. 20), motsamai
(p. 37, 1. 4), would in deliberate speech be pronounced
with the tunes
but in rapid speech
the tunes would often become
Such variations in the pitch of are not marked in the
texts, as they are not essential for good pronunciation,
and any exaggeration of them would lead to mispro-
nunciation.
(2) Notes on
59. The use of means that from this point onwards the
high-level pitch is slightly lower than what it was before.
A glance at the musical notation on p. 37 will show the
working of this curious system of tone-lowering.
60. Except in the cases noted in $$ 62, 63, the amount
of lowering represented by * may generally be taken for
practical purposes to be one semitone, though it is in
reality often less than this. All the lowerings marked by
- in the texts appear to be essential for good pronuncia-
tion. Cases of optional (non-essential) lowering also exist;
but they are not marked.
61. There are two important cases in which the drop
represented by is greater than a semitone.
62. (a) When a sentence ends with a syllable marked
(e.g. ... ki-ta:ú, p. 23, 1. 6), or with two or more high-level

INTRODUCTION
tones the first of which is marked - (e.g. ... od-m-põlaea,
p. 19, 1. 12), the value of - should be taken to be only one
semitone above mid-tone pitch. (The normal distance
separating high-level from mid-level is a major or minor
third.) It is well in connected texts to mark the special
character of such high tones by writing even when there
happens to be no preceding high tone in the sentence.
63. (b) When the sentence begins at an unusually high
pitch (indicated in the texts by (), any that occur near
the beginning of the sentence represent a drop of more
than a semitone. The drop in these cases would generally
be about a whole tone or a minor third, but it may
occasionally even exceed a major third.
64. The tone * has a grammatical significance. It is
conceivable that when full details as to the grammatical
conditions under which is used are known, it may be
possible to simplify the phonetic notation by dispensing
with the mark .
1.
or
(3) Notes on
65. The low-level tone is the lowest pitch that the
speaker can reach. It is written roughly
in the musical notation in Text No. XIII, but these notes
are to be understood to mean simply the lower limit of
the speaker's voice. It often becomes a sort of very low
grunt rather than a sound of definite musical pitch.
66. An alternative pronunciation of the tone applied
to a vowel 1 is to devocalize the vowel entirely. Vowels
marked may always be devocalized; such devocalization
is, however, particularly frequent when the vowel of the
1 But apparently not when applied to y.

preceding syllable is long (as in lobò:ly, p. 3, title).
Devocalization cannot take the place of any other tone
but :
67. In the single example kxõthy-kxothy-kxoth? (p. 15,
1. 9) devocalization of the u appears to be essential; the
vowel has accordingly in that case been marked with
instead of with :
(4) Notes on the Mid-level Tone.
68. The mid-level tone is generally about a major or
minor third lower than the high-level tone.
69. When a high-level tone is followed by two or more
mid-level tones, there is a tendency not to descend
to the true mid-tone pitch for the first mid-tone, but to
make the descent gradually. Thus in deliberate speech
kxatwan: (p. 3, title), 7-kxoxoxela (p. 23, 1. 17), would have
approximately the tunes
but in rapid speech these tunes would tend to become
70. These variations in the pitch of the mid-level tone
are not marked in the texts, as they are not essential for
good pronunciation, and any exaggeration of them would
lead to mispronunciation.
71. It must not be forgotten that every unmarked
syllabic m, n, p, ?, r, has the mid-level tone, e.g. the
first m in mmi (p. 9, 1. 16), the first n in ntekani (p. 21,
1.9), the ? in jàna? (p. 15, 1. 8), the first r in rra (p. 13, 1.3).
(5) Notes on !
72. The high-falling tone 'begins as a rule at the pitch
of the last preceding high-level tone. If the succeeding

XXX
INTRODUCTION
tone is the low-level or the low-falling, the high-falling
tone falls the whole way down to the low-level pitch. In
other cases it only falls as far as mid-level pitch.
73. Occasionally the high-falling tone begins slightly
(not more than a semitone) below the pitch of the last
preceding high-level tone. This appears to be generally
the case in the penultimate syllable of the sentence, in
which case the lowering is not marked specially in the
transcription. In the rare cases in which such lowering
seems essential otherwise than in penultinate position
the notation * + mid-tone is adopted (thus loo- on p. 13,
1. 19 = = a lowered lò:-).
(6) Note on
74. When the following syllable has the pitch
the
low-falling tone, begins rather below mid-level pitch and
falls to the pitch of. When the following syllable has
the pitch *, the low-falling tone begins at mid-level pitch
and falls a semitone or whole tone.
AVERAGE PITCH OF THE SENTENCE
75. The average pitch of the sentence is on the whole
much the same as in English.
76. One characteristic feature will, however, be noticed
from what was said in § 59, namely, that in most
Sechuana sentences the average pitch gradually descends
as the sentence proceeds. In very long sentences con-
taining many *, it is sometimes necessary to raise the
pitch in the middle; otherwise the average pitch is apt to
get so low that the tones cannot easily be distinguished.
Such raising may take place after any convenient pause;
thus, in the second sentence of No. VIII, the word ?icla


## p. xxxi (#37) ############################################

INTRODUCTION
xxxi
may, if necessary, be said on a higher pitch than that of
the last preceding high-level tone.
77. As in English, loud speech (and especially shouting)
has a higher (sometimes a much higher) average pitch
than quiet speech; similarly, the average pitch is higher
when the speaker is excited than when he is calm or
grave.
78. Cases in which the average pitch of a sentence is
considerably higher than the normal pitch of ordinary
quiet talking are marked in the texts by placing ? at the
beginning of the sentence.
LENGTH
79. Long vowels are shown by placing the mark : after
the vowel symbol.
80. Plosive consonants occurring at the beginning of
the second syllable (not counting any hyphened prefix) of
a word of three or more syllables are often noticeably
lengthened by prolonging their "stops." This may be
heard, for instance, in the t of matebele (p. 33, 1. 9), the
c of ka-mac¡ibani (p. 31, 1. 7), the p of -apola (p. 37,
1. 11). The following vowel is shortened in every case, so
that a rhythm of the type ... N.) results. We have
not thought it necessary to mark this phenomenon in
the texts, as it is probably not "significant."
STRESS
81. Stress (variation in the force of the breath) is
unimportant in Sechuana. Care must be taken by the
foreign learner not to confuse stress with tone. Certain
combinations of tone are apt to give to the English ear


## p. xxxii (#38) ###########################################

xxxii
INTRODUCTION
the impression of stress even when stress is not really
present.
ASSIMILATION
82. When a word ending in y occurs immediately
before a word beginning with a plosive consonant other
than k, the ? is in rapid speech changed into the nasal
consonant corresponding to the plosive. Thus in rapid
speech the ? of 0-i-toselitsen would tend to become m
before phòl?r?:l» (p. 29, l. 7), and the ? of ko-likale?
would tend to become n before tsa-13.ng (p. 29, 1. 11).
WORD-DIVISION
83. Many groups of syllables which would be written
as two or more words in other orthographies would be, in
our opinion, better written as single words. As a conces-
sion to existing usage we have divided off by hyphens
those parts of the word which would in other orthogra-
phies be written as single words.
84. Thus the sentence which would be written in Bible
orthography "e sa e ka chwanèlo re re " would, in our
opinion, be best written "isat kacqhan?l? reri," but as a
concession to existing usage we have written it "7-SA-Í
ka-cqhan?l? re-ri" (p. 7, last line).
SENTENCE - DIVISION
85. Pauses are generally made at the places indicated
by the punctuation marks. The sign | is used to indicate
places at which additional pauses may be made if the
speaker cannot manage to reach the place of the next
punctuation-mark without pause.
1 Thus the untrained observer hearing the tone-sequence aàa (as
in lobò:lu, p. 3, title) will generally say that there is a stress on
the syllable marked '. It is instructive to practise such a sequence
as this, varying the force of breath on the different syllables, but
taking care to keep the tones absolutely constant.

A FEW MAXIMS
FOR THE
TRANSCRIBER OF AFRICAN LANGUAGES
(1) Don't start with the idea that most of the sounds
of the foreign language are identical or almost identical
with sounds of your mother-tongue. They are not likely
to be so. You will be fortunate if the language you are
studying contains as many as six consonants and three
vowels identical with those of your mother-tongue.
(2) Don't put in the introductory chapter of your book
such statements as "the e of this language is pronounced
like the English ay in day," or "the o of this language is
pronounced like the English o in go." These statements
are meaningless, because the English word day is pro-
nounced in at least four easily distinguishable ways, and
the English word go is pronounced in at least six easily
distinguishable ways. Moreover, in the mouth of the
average English person (as distinguished from the Scots-
man) these words are pronounced with diphthongs and
not with pure vowels.
(3) Do not accept without reserve statements as to the
pronunciation of the language you are studying made by
persons who have " been in the country." Learn to
observe accurately for yourself, if necessary by taking a
preliminary course of ear-training exercises.
XXXV


## p. xxxvi (#42) ###########################################

xxxvi
A FEW MAXIMS
(4) If
your
native teacher tells
you
that
you pronounce
beautifully or "almost like a native," don't believe it.
He probably only means that you have got as near to the
right pronunciation as he thinks you are ever likely to.
(5) Record as many facts about pronunciation as you
are able to observe, but do not hazard explanations of
how pronunciations have arisen unless you can support
your theories by substantial proofs. Above all, do not
say that a word is pronounced in such and such a way
" for the sake of euphony."
(6) Don't speak of letters when you mean sounds.
Languages are made up
of SOUNDS.
(7) Don't imagine that the conventional orthographies
(official or otherwise) of African languages represent the
pronunciation with accuracy.
(8) Don't imagine that a difficult language can be
turned into an easy one if you only clothe it in an
inaccurate but familiar-looking orthography. You can-
not by any device abolish the difficulties of a language.
You may conceal many of them by an apparently "simple'
orthography, and the result will be that in practice you
will ignore the concealed difficulties and will therefore
speak the language badly.
(9) Don't forget that most, if not all, Bantu and Sudan
languages possess tones which may distinguish one word
from another. Let your orthography be such as to admit
of marking these tones.

I.-THE LIZARD AND THE CHAMELEON
The primitive Bechuana people had their own way of explaining
how death began. They said that the Creator of all things sent the
chameleon, saying: "Go and tell the people that when people die
they return again.'
The chaineleon, being a very slow animal, went along in very, very
slow jerks and consequently did not reach his destination the same
day.
Thereupon the lizard came from behind the chameleon and quickly
overtook him and arrived first; on reaching the destination he said
to the people : "When people die they depart for ever."
While the people were brooding over this very bad news, they saw
the chameleon coming a long time afterwards. When he reached
then he said: "When people die they return again."
But the people said : *Go away, your slowness has done for us;
we have already heard of the law ; it was proclaimed by the lizard
yesterday."

II. -MOURNING FOR THE HARTEBEEST AND THE HIDE
A Bechuana traveller was once walking in a lonely region carrying
a hide, when he saw a lame hartebeest running along in the forest.
So he placed his hide on the ground and chased the hartebeest.
He chased it and chased it all day long through the forest until he
was tired. At length the hartebeest got out of his reach, and he
gave it up in despair.
When he returned he searched for his hide in the place where he
had left it; but, search as he would through the forest, he could not
find it again.
While he was intent upon catching the hartebeest, he forgot the
proverb which says : Let spilt porridge alone, but hold on to that
which you have in your hand." He threw aside his hide and
followed the hartebeest of the forest, and in consequence he was
left empty-handed.
That is why the Bechuana people, in giving advice to the avari.
cious, say: "Take care that you don't mourn for the hartebeest and
the hide."
1 The use of the form bó- shows that porridge (boxò:b?) is
meant.

III.-RATEL IS-SUSPICIOUS-ABOUT HONEYCOMB
This is proverb Sechuana, it-originated here.
Ratel is little-animal of-the-veldt | which loves honey very-much.
It-usually it-intrudes-into | wild-bees of-the-veldt | in-lair, it-robs-
them honey | it-carries-them-off, honeycomb one by one | it-goes
to-place-them? | on-flat-stone | at-a-short-distance-away.
Many times | boys of-cattle-stations | whenever they-are-herding-
cattle they-see ratel | he-continues he-transports honeycomb, one
alone, he-piles-them aside. It-will-happen-that while-he-is-still-gone
to-take-out-some they-remain while they take honeycombs some ;
that-is-to-say while-he-continues while-he-piles up honeycombs |
also they | they-continue they-help-themselves with-them. Ratel
is-startled pile (i.e. to find the pile), instead | that it-should-increase,
it-continues it-decreases ; he-stops | he-looks-at-it; thus it-is-said :
"Ratel is-suspicious-about honeycomb."
Also man | whenever if we-see | he-is-displeased | by-occurrence
some, it-does-not-go properly we-say: "Ratel is-suspicious-about
honeycomb."
III.---THE RATEL IS SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE HONEYCOMB
This is a Sechuana proverb which originated as follows:
The ratel is a small animal of the veldt which is very fond of
honey. It is in the habit of entering into the nests of wild bees
and robbing them of their honey ; it carries off pieces of comb one
by one and deposits them on a flat stone a short distance off.
While the boys of the cattle-stations are herding the cattle, they
sometimes see a ratel carrying pieces of honeycomb one at a time and
piling them in an out-of-the-way spot. Then when the animal has
gone to get some more, they take some of the pieces of honeycomb;
so as fast as the ratel piles up his pieces of honeycomb the boys
help themselves to them. The ratel is astonished to find that his
pile is decreasing instead of increasing, and he stops and looks at it
suspiciously; then it is that people say: " The ratel is suspicious
about the honeycomb."
So also when we see a man displeased because something is not
going as it should, we say : "The ratel is suspicious about the
honeycomb."
Them = honeycombs.

IV.- THE STEENBOK AND THE TORTOISE
A tortoise once disputed with a steenbok as to which of them
could outrun the other. They agreed to run a race the next day.
During the night the tortoise went to collect some other tortoises to
come and help it. It placed them one after the other in the grass
at the side of the road along which the race had to be run.
At daybreak the tortoise and the steenbok went to run their
The steenbok darted off with great speed and left the tor-
toise behind. Then it stopped and cried : "I've beaten you, old
chap !" The tortoise which was next in front immediately said :
"No, you haven't beaten me; I am here."
So the steenbok darted off again, and stopped further on, and
asked : "Where are you now?" Another tortoise which was just in
front shouted : "I am here." The steenbok ran very hard, and
each time it stopped to ask, one of the tortoises which had been
placed overnight answered in front of him.
So the steenbok ran and ran, until at last it fell down dead from
exhaustion.

While they were passing through the country, the blind man

hovering. So he told the one who had the use of his legs about it,
and they went towards the place (where the vultures were hover-
ing). There they found some vultures assembled round the carcase
of a wild animal.
When they had driven away the vultures, a dispute arose between
them. The cripple said : "It was my eyes that found this animal" ;
the blind man said: "It was my feet that found it." When their
dispute became more heated, and they would not give in to one
another, the cripple crawled away from the blind inan. Then the
blind man, being unable to see either his companion or the animal,
called out : "My friend, it is evident that you are our eyes. Why
should lose your temper? I know that the animal was found
by you." Then the cripple came back and led the blind man to the
animal.

VII.-COMMANDMENT OF-MAN AGED
Man aged (lit. big) Bechuana | once, when days his were finishing,
he-called his-sons who are seven, so-that he might-come to-instruct-
them for-the-last-time.
He-arrived he-instructed-them that, in-life their, they-must-not
they ever they-separate. He-said-to him-who-is big (=eldest)
he-said: "Bring-me bundle of-sticks they-are seven.". When he
came with them | he-said-to-him he-said he-should-break-them
they-remaining bound. They-were-too-much-for-him. Then he said:
"Untie-them now, you-break-them, each alone." They continued
(i.e. the sticks continued) they-said : "Snap-snap-snap!"
So man aged | told his-sons he-said : "Children mine, if you-can
dwell together you-work together, you-be-united like | bundle
of-sticks, not will-not you-be-destroyed by-nothing; but if you-can
separate yourselves, you-will-break-to-pieces simply | as sticks
those they-have-finished to-be-untied."
To-come-out from-there | there-was-founded proverb which says:
"Not I-am man I-being alone, l-am man by-others.
VIII.-JUDGMENT OF-CHIEF
Bechuana-people have story one | it-is this. It-is-like I judgment
of-Solomon, which is-told in-the-Bible, whereas teachers of-before 1
say they-found | it known among-the-Bechuana.people, Bible it-
never it-was-written | in-Sechuana-language.
VII.-THE OLD MAN'S INSTRUCTIONS
An aged Bechuana, whose days were coming to a close, called his
seven sons in order to give them his last instructions.
When they came he exhorted them never to be divided through-
out their lives. He said to the eldest : "Bring me a bundle of
seven sticks." When he came with them, the old man told him to
break the bundle without undoing it. But the sticks were too
strong for him. Then the old man said : "Now untie the bundle
and break the sticks one by one." He did so, and the sticks
snapped one after the other.
So the old man said to his sons : "My children, if you can live
together and work together, and be united like the bundle of
sticks, nothing will be able to hurt you; but if you separate,
you will break to pieces just like those sticks after they were
untied."
On this story was founded the Sechuana proverb: "Alone I am
not a man; I am only a man by the help of others."
VIII.—THE KING'S JUDGMENT
The following is a Bechuana story. It is similar to the Bible
story of the judgment of Solomon, but the pioneer missionaries say
that they found it to be known among the Bechuanas before the
Bible was ever written in the Sechuana language.

child is yours; you-refuse with-knife, woman that herself she-permits
it-may-be-killed. Take-it you.go.
Judgment this is the-same it-began i proverb Sechuana / which
says: "Child's-mother | is she-who grasps | knife by-blade.
The story runs that two village wonien were once delivered of
children at about the same time. One of them, turning over at
night when she was asleep, pressed against her child and suffocated
it. Then she got up, took the dead body of the child and laid it
down by the other mother while she was asleep, and stole her living
child. The mother from whom the child had been stolen got up
and found that the dead child was not hers; so the women quar-
relled over the living child.
They brought their quarrel before the king, and continued to
dispute persistently, each one saying : " The living child is mine,
and the dead one is yours."
As soon as the king had heard them, he said: "Women, your
case is a difficult one. Moeakhotla,1 bring me a big knife; we will
cut the living child in two, and each woman shall take one half."
One of the women agreed to this, but the other refused.
When the sword was brought, the woman who refused grasped it
and held it, saying: "No, your majesty, do not kill it; give it
rather to that woman. Then the king said : "Now I see the child
is certainly yours ; you hold back the knife, while the other woman
is willing to let the child be killed. Take the child and depart.
This judgment is the origin of the Sechuana proverb: "The
mother of the child is she who grasps the knife by the blade."

'IX.- ELEPHANTS
The elephant is a noble and useful animal. In India elephants
are caught and tamed and employed as domestic animals like oxen
and horses. The Bechuana people only used to kill them, and sell
their tusks.
The intelligence of the elephant is sometimes almost human. The
primitive Bechuana people used to tell a story of an elephant which
once descended into the Zambesi river and drank. While it was
drinking, it felt a crocodile catching hold of its trunk and trying to
pull it into the water. Then the elephant lifted the crocodile out
of the water, hoisted it up with its trunk, and carried it away into
the veldt a long way away from the river. When it reached the
desert, it placed the crocodile on the ground and said : " You meant
to kill me, did you ? Then you just stay where you are, so that I
can see whether you will live away from the water."
Some Bechuana girls were once looking after some corn-fieids
when they saw an elephant coming with rolling gait towards them.
They ran away to hide in the huts belonging to the fields. But
they saw that the elephant followed them up, and came and knelt
down in front of their little hut and pushed its trunk into the hut.
The children were very much frightened, as they thought the
elephant had come to kill them. To their surprise it simply showed

camel-tree thorn sticking through the end of the trunk, so she
pulled it out. Then the elephant got up and went away.
Some time afterwards, while the girls were still looking after the
fields, they saw the elephant coming again; so they fled to the huts
a second time, and the elephant again followed them. While they
were wondering what it wanted now, they heard it drop something
down outside, retrace its steps, and return in the direction of the
veldt. When they came out they found a duiker. So you see this
is what happened: the elephant killed a duiker and brought it for
the girls who had pulled out its thorn.
X.-HUNTERS AND BEASTS OF PREY
Ancient stories show that there used to be brave people and
cowards in Bechuanaland.
Two men once took their assegais and went out to hunt. One of
them was a brave man and the other was timid. When they
entered the forest, they found a lion asleep. So the brave man
caught hold of the lion by the tail and said to the timid man: "Stab
it to the heart with your spear while I hold it." The lion jumped
up and stretched itself to get free, while the man was holding tightly

The poor man spent the night holding on to the lion's tail, so that
the animal could not turn round and bite him. Meanwhile the
other man had gone home and announced that his companion had
been eaten up by the lion.
When day broke the men of the village made him go before them
to show them the remains of his fellow-countryman. They set out
and reached the forest, and they found—wonderful to relate—that
the man was not dead, but was still holding the lion by the tail.
He told them how the timid man ran away from him on the pre-
vious day, and how he himself had been having a tug-of-war with
the lion all night, so that he was tired out.
The men of the village thereupon devised a terrible punishment
for the coward. They gave him a spear and said that he must go in
front of the lion and stab it. As soon as he got in front of it, his
fellow-countryman let go of the lion's tail; the animal roared and
rushed at the timid man and tore him to pieces.
As soon as it had killed him it ran off through the forest, and
the villagers retraced their steps and went home.
The following is another incident of this description that once
took place in the region of the Molopo river after the introduction
of firearms. A native farmer, having sent out his flock for the

tiger. He remembered that there was a man on the farms who had
a gun. So he hurriedly raised the alarm and called the owner of
the gun to come and kill the tiger for him. The latter shouldered
his gun as desired and followed the owner of the goat, and they
went to hunt the tiger.
When they approached the trees in which the tiger was hiding,
they walked stealthily so that it should not hear them, the owner
of the goat leading.
When the man in front appeared from behind a tree, he saw the
tiger still standing over his goat. So he looked round and said to
the owner of the gun in a whisper : "Here he is," but he was
surprised to find himself alone, the owner of the gun having fled.
In the twinkling of an eye the tiger was upon him ; it mauled his
head and right arm and left him unconscious. When he recovered
consciousness, he found himself suffering severely with sore wounds,
especially in the head and right arm, but none of his bones were
broken.
So he crawled with difficulty to the road, and lay down there
until he was picked up by some farm-boys who were going to fetch
water. They carried him away and took him to his home. They

and eventually he recovered. But although his wounds were well
healed, he carried the scars for the rest of his life.
XI.-THE KALAHARI AND THE LIONS
Of all wild aniinals the lion is the most terrible. In strength it
is only surpassed by the elephant. In olden times people used to
hunt them with assegais and dogs. Now, however, they are easily
overpowered by the white man's guns.
It is said that the lion generally respects man ; it only gets angry
with men when they have attacked it. But if at any time when
hunted it happens to kill a man, it does not fear men any more.
A Kalahari was once coming from Setlagole on his way to
Moshaneng, when he saw a lion which had killed an animal in the
Maritzani forest. As he had no provisions for his journey and was
hungry, he rushed at the lion, chased it, and drove it away from
the animal. After the lion had run away, he gathered up some
wood and made a blazing fire; then he roasted some of the meat

surrounding himself with a fire, so that the lion should not attack
him.
When day dawned he cut off some meat and proceeded on his
journey. He travelled until midday, when the heat became
oppressive. He was feeling tired, because he had been awake all
night, watching for the lion which he had driven away from the
animal. So he rested under the shade a tree.
While he was resting, he felt a presentiment that the lion was
following him. So he climbed up the tree and sat among the
branches. On looking behind him he saw four lions following his
track, and he realized that if he had still been resting in the shade
of the tree, the lions would have killed him.
The lions followed his foot-marks until they reached the foot of
the tree where the man was. Whenever they passed it they lost
the track and returned to pick it up again further back, only to
lose it again at the foot of the tree. They went backwards and
forwards several times in this way, while the man was looking at
them from among the branches of the tree At last one of them
looked up and saw him ; then it growled, and the others raised
their heads and they too saw him.
The lions walked round the tree looking up at him, but were
unable to climb, so they eventually lay down in the shade of
the tree.

The Kalahari, having been awake all night, was drowsy and soon
fell fast asleep in the branches of the tree. When he woke up he
felt himself tumbling down from the tree-top, and he fell heavily
right on the top of the lions.
The lions were so much startled that they suddenly rushed off
and ran away in all directions. The man too jumped up and
bolted at full speed; he ran and ran, and when night came on he
was still running, not knowing in the least where he was going ;
at last in the middle of the night he fainted from over-fatigue.
The next day some shepherds of Phitshane found him lying in the
veldt, picked him up, and carried him home; they picked out the
thorns of the trees through which he had been rushing during the
night, and treated him until he was cured.

He has hunted elephants and lions, he has seen all kinds of
things, and some of the stories of his experiences seem almost too
strange to be true. The following is one of them.
We were a party of Bakwenas returning from the mines in
Rhodesia, and journeying to Gwelo to take the train back to
the Bakwena country. In the forest we came across what looked
like the tracks of a herd of cattle, mixed up with the tracks of
donkeys, and we wondered what kind of cattle it could be so very
far away from human habitations. While we were wondering,
some Matabeles appeared who were following that track. They
said it was not oxen and donkeys, but buffaloes and zebras. As I
was anxious to see what a buffalo was like, we diverged from our
road and went with the Matabeles. We went on until we arrived
at a post station.2
The two men in charge of the horses were white men. They
took guns and mounted and went with us. When we arrived in
the depths of the forest, we found a large herd of young buffaloes.
The white men went in front and prepared to shoot. The
Matabeles said: "Now the white men are going to put their foot
into a hornet's nest; so look for some strong trees and climb up
them. Anyone who doesn't climb up a tree will not see his mother

herd, and one of the calves screamed. The sound instantly
roused the mothers of the herd far away in the forest.
While we were sitting among the branches of the trees, we saw
a cloud of dust; it grew until it seemed to reach the clouds in the
sky; then the Matabeles said: "They are coming." The cloud of
dust approached. Soon a herd of buffaloes emerged from the
forest, galloping towards the calves. The white men then mounted
their horses and fled.
When the buffaloes approached the calves, a bull left the others
and chased the white men. But in spite of every effort on the
part of the horses, we were astonished to see the buffalo overtake
them, rush in between them, pass them, and finally turn round to
rejoin the others. All this happened so quickly that we thought
che buffalo had done nothing; it had, however, caused considerable
damage.
When the buffalo turned back, one of the horses fell with its
rider. We climbed down the trees, and found that the buffalo
had torn the horse's side with its horns while it was running. It
crushed the calf of the inan's leg, but fortunately did not break
any bone. The horse, however, died.
We placed the wounded man on the remaining horse and
conveyed him to his station, and proceeded on our journey.'

XIII.-THE SOUTH WIND AND THE SUN
The South Wind and the Sun were once disputing which was the
stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first made the traveller take off his
cloak should be considered stronger than the other. Then the
South Wind blew with all his might, but the more he blew, the
more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him ; and at
last the South Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone
out warnily, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak; and
so the South Wind had to confess that the Sun was the stronger
of the two.

2. Yes, I should be pleased to. I have already on several
occasions taught the elements of our language to foreigners.
3. I want to learn more than the elements of the language. I
want to learn to speak the language quite fluently and as nearly as
possible like a native. I have already learnt some of the elements
of the language out of a book, but I found that that is not much
I can hardly make myself understood when I speak, and I
understand very little of what is said to me. I have come to the
conclusion that most of the indications given in the books are
insufficient.
4. That quite true. In most books the descriptions of the
sounds are inadequate, and the authors try to write the language
with an insufficient number of letters. And besides, the tones of
the voice are generally neglected altogether.
5. What do you mean by the tones of the voice ?

8. No wonder | it-being difficult that | person may-hear-you.
In-order-that person inay-discriminate words, it-is-sought (=it is
needful) you-cause-to-work | rises-and-falls with-fitness. Division
one with-one (2=each) | of-word Sechuana has-assigned-to-it note
its, just like song ; that is that (2=that is to say), it-is-proper to-
be-sung with-note its. If you-deviate-from note | which is-suitable-
to word, you-might change intention of-it.
9. How it-is-surprising how !
10. In-speech English | not you-have nothing which sits (=re-
sembles) like-that.
11. Is-that-so? It-is-it (=that is the reason) that we white-
people I speak Sechuana badly like this ! Eh you-can give-me
signs (= examples) some of-rises-and-falls ?
12. Certainly. Like-this; if you-say na:mg, you-having-lowered
voice, it-is thing which is-slaughtered-for to-be-eaten; if you-raise
voice, you-say nama, it-is that (2=that is to say), sit you-having-
stretched-out legs ; again nama, it-is" spend more time (over
something)"; if you-turn-downwards voice, like this, nà:ma,
it-is country of-Namaqua-people. Many-times rises-and-falls these
are-changed-about | by-nature of-words which lead-it (=follow),

8. No wonder you can't make yourself understood. The proper
use of the tones is essential for the meaning of the words. Every
syllable in a Sechuana sentence has a certain definite musical pitch
assigned to it; it has, in fact, to be sung on a certain note.
depart from the proper pitch, you may change the meaning of the
words.
9. How very funny.
10. You don't have anything like that in the English language.
11. I suppose we don't. Then that must be one of the chief
reasons why English people generally speak the Sechuana language
so badly. Would you give me some examples of the tones ?
12. Certainly. For instance, if you say na ma with low
pitch, it means that which is killed for food (i.e. meat); if the
pitch rises like this, ma, it means "sit with outstretched
legs"; also if the pitch rises (nama), it means "spend more time
(over something)"; if the pitch falls considerably, like this, nà:ma,
it is the name of the country Namaqualand. The tones of these
words may also vary according to the nature of words preceding or

and those which follow-it !=precede);1 like-this, "they-are-eating

13. But it-is what | white-people do-not-teach-themselves | to-use
rises-and-falls with-propriety ?
14. Because teachers not have increased (2=are not plentiful) |
who know | to-teach rises-and-falls properly.
15. Eh with-manner one other, Sechuana is difficult ?
16. Not to-surpass speech others. There are difficulties of
words, moreover sounds others are difficult to-be-taught-oneself.
17. But then, that-which I-like to-do-it | it-is this ; I-wish to-
teach-myself to-speak Sechuana | just like a-Bechuana. Eh you-
think that-thing may-be-able-to-happen?
18. There-shall-decide things they-are two ; ability your
of-
nature, and methods your of-teaching-yourself. If you have ear
which is-sharp, you-following methods which excel, not I-see | that-
which is-able-to-prevent that | eventually I you-speak just like a-
Bechuana.
following them; here is an example: "They are eating meat in
Namaqualand, they will therefore afterwards sit with outstretched
legs"; other examples are : " The porcupine bit off a section of
sugar-cane and tasted the sweet taste," and "The enmity of many
enemies is intolerable."
13. But why don't English people learn to use the tones
correctly?
14. Because there are not very many teachers who know how to
teach the tones properly.
15. Is the Sechuana language difficult in any other respects ?
16. Not more so than any other language. There are, of course,
difficulties of grammar, and some of the speech-sounds are not easy
to acquire.
17. Well, what I want to do is to learn to speak the language
just like a native. Do you think that would be possible ?
18. That depends on two things, your natural aptitude and your
method of learning. If you have a good ear and follow the best
methods, there is no reason why you should not speak just like a
native in time.
1 The idea in Sechuana is that the words are proceeding along
the line, the front one "leading" and the others * following." If
A B C are three words in order, "leads" and A " follows" B.

Father our, he-who is at-the-height, name Thy let-it-be-sanctified.

Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy
kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give
us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into
temptation ; but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
