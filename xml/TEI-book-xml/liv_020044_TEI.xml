<p>Our tribute to the memory of <persName>Mr. Cameron</persName> would not be complete
if we failed to record the universal sympathy and sorrow called
forth by the tidings of his death.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>On that Sabbath morning the sad
news reached the different congregations in the capital just as they <!-- Maybe capital should be enclosed in settlement? HB --><!-- No. AW -->
were assembling for worship, and preparing to partake of the
memorials of the Lord's death. How different was <hi rend="italic">our</hi> commemoration,
from <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, who was then "absent from the body," but "present
with the Lord !"<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>With us, a deep gloom and sadness overspread all
ranks and classes.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><choice><sic>Every one</sic><corr>Everyone</corr></choice> seemed to be mourning the loss of a <!-- Should Every one be orig/reg to Everyone? HB --><!-- Sic/corr. AW -->
father or of a dear and venerated friend.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <persName>Queen</persName> and <persName>Prime
Minister</persName> attired themselves in mourning, and their grief was deep and
sincere.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A kind letter of sympathy was at once dispatched by them
to <persName>Miss Cameron</persName>, with the request that the <persName>Queen</persName> might be allowed to
show her regard for her departed friend by bearing all the expenses
of the funeral, and signifying her wish also to erect a suitable and
lasting monument over his grave.</p>
<p>At the funeral, an immense concourse of people gathered together.
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>All the <term type="collective">Protestant</term> missions in the capital were strongly represented, <!-- Again, should capital be enclosed? Also, I took mission out of the collective tag, or should it be double-tagged with either another collective or orgName? HB --><!-- No on capital; looks good on missions. AW -->
and the aged <persName>M. Laborde</persName>, the <persName><term type="collective">French</term> Consul</persName>, also joined, by his presence
on the occasion, in paying the last tribute of respect to his friend.</p>
<p>At the grave, one of the highest officers of the <orgName>Court</orgName>, as representative
of the <persName>Queen</persName>, read in her name a proclamation, of which
the following is, as nearly as possible, a literal translation :—</p>
<p>" Thus saith <persName>Ranavalonamanjaka</persName>, <persName>Queen of <country>Madagascar</country></persName>, &amp;c.
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Carry this my word to my subjects, and to <persName>Mary Cameron</persName>, and to <!-- Subjects be enclosed in collective tag? HB --><!-- No. AW -->
the missionaries of the <orgName><settlement>London</settlement> Missionary Society</orgName>.</p> <!-- Missionaries be enclosed in collective tag? HB --><!-- No. AW -->
<p>" For, inasmuch as the decease of <persName>Mr. Cameron</persName> has befallen my
country and people, thus declares <persName>Ranavalonamanjaka</persName>, <term type="collective"><persName>Queen of <!-- my people be enclosed in collective tag? HB -->
<country>Madagascar</country></persName></term>, that great indeed has been the good done by <persName>Mr.

Cameron</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He sought, and desired, and accomplished such things as
benefit my kingdom and people.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>And he sought whatever would <!-- My kingdom and people be enclosed in collective tag? HB --><!-- No. AW -->
promote the Gospel of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> here in my kingdom and among
my people.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>And not only so, but from the very beginning, until now,
he has endeavoured to prosper this kingdom, for he was not a fickle
man, nor a man who ever opposed the interests of my kingdom, but
he did what was becoming and right.</p>
<p>" Further, on account of the benefits conferred by <persName>Mr. Cameron</persName>,
says <persName>Ranavalonamanjaka</persName>, <persName>Queen of <country>Madagascar</country></persName>, and inasmuch as a
subject of my friend <persName>Queen Victoria</persName> has done good here among my
people, and has died here in my kingdom, we therefore send our
representative to show our respect at his funeral.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>And although, in
the present state of things, no <term type="animal">cattle</term> are slaughtered and no cannon
are fired (to show him honour), nevertheless I account him as among
the benefactors of my kingdom.</p>
<p>" And further, I proclaim to my subjects, and to his daughter, and
to his friends, that whatsoever amount may be expended at the
funeral of <persName>Mr. Cameron</persName>, be it done according as you desire ;<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>for I
will defray all the expenses, for he has done good to my people and
my kingdom, and I do not forget :</p>

<p rend="right">" <persName>Queen of <country>Madagascar</country></persName>."</p>
<p>And so, at the conclusion of the service in English and in
Malagasy, we committed him to the tomb, where he sleeps by the
side of his fellow labourers in the vineyard who entered into rest
before him.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The beautiful monument to their memory had been
but lately completed by him, and its shadow falls upon his grave.
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His remains rest in the spot sacred to the memory of the labours
begun by him for the welfare of Madagascar nearly fifty years ago.
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There he taught the 600 young men those useful arts and sciences
which have changed the social life of the people and increased their
comforts a hundredfold.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There he set up the first printing-press and
helped to strike off the first twenty-three verses of the First Malagasy
Bible.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There he joined in forming the first <term type="collective">Christian</term> church and
helped to cheer and strengthen the early converts amid the dark
forebodings of the storm of persecution that was soon to burst in fatal
fury upon them.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There on his return to <country>Madagascar</country>, he was
welcomed by the acclaiming "voice of a great multitude" assembled
for prayer and praise to God.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There he aided in the erection of the
first memorial church, built to commemorate the faith and patience of
many who had been brought to <persName>Christ</persName> by his own instrumentality.
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>And as long as that building stands, or the faith of which it is a
visible symbol survives in the hearts of the people, the name of <seg rend="smallcaps">James
Cameron</seg> will be treasured unforgotten, as one of <country>Madagascar</country>'s 
earliest and greatest benefactors.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>"The righteous shall be in 
ever-lasting remembrance."<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Psalm cxii, 6.</p>
