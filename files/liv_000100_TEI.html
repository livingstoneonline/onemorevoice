Livingstone hoped his transcontinental expedition (1852-56), which took him from Linyanti to both Angola and Mozambique, would establish a trade route connecting central Africa with the west and east coasts (Kalusa 2009:55-56, Livingstone 1857aa:203).">Linyanti</span> <span class="persName" title="Sekeletu (c.1835-1863).

A London Missionary Society mission to the Makololo in the 1860s resulted in the majority of the members dying from fever, with Sekeletu wrongly suspected of having poisoned the party.

Term referring to the Khoekhoe people of southern Africa (primarily resident in Namibia and South Africa), who were historically pastoralist in lifestyle. The term dates from the seventeenth century and is now considered pejorative. It reportedly originates in a Dutch word for &#34;stutter&#34; or &#34;stammer,&#34; &#34;Huttentut,&#34; applied to the group on account of the clicking sounds in the Khoekhoe language. In the nineteenth century, Khoekhoe physicality and behaviours were the subject of much evolutionary speculation and racial science (Heath 2010c:573, Nave 2010a:650).">Hottentots</span>

It rises in present-day Zambia's North Western Province and flows south and west to enter the Zambezi River about fifteen miles north of Lukulu in Western Province. Livingstone sometimes mistakenly refers to the Kabompo River as the Leeambye (another name for the Zambezi River), since he incorrectly believed the Kabompo to be the main stream of the Zambezi rather than a tributary (Schapera 1963,1:27n3).">Leeambye</span>

In 1832 he embarked on a two-year trip to Egypt, publishing a travelogue on his return entitled Egypt and Mohammed Ali (1834). In this book, he describes the &#34;siksak&#34; bird that Livingstone cites. St. John was a prolific author who contributed widely to contemporary periodicals. He wrote a column for the Sunday Times from the 1840s, and played a leading role in the political department of the Daily Telegraph in the late 1850s (St. John 1834,1:177-79; Spilsbury 2004).">St John</span> &amp; <span class="persName" title="Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Étienne (1772-1844).

He was an important figure in nineteenth-century anatomy, developing the principle of the &#34;unity of composition&#34; of vertebrate organisms. Saint-Hilaire also collected specimens in Egypt as part of a large-scale scientific expedition, when Napoleon invaded in 1798 (Charton 2003:71-72).">Geofrey St-

During his transcontinental expedition (1852-56), Livingstone was hopeful that the Zambezi could provide a highway into central Africa, but during his later Zambezi Expedition (1858-64) he realised that he had overestimated the river's navigability. Livingstone provides various other local names for stretches of the river including Luambéji, Luambési, Ambézi, Ojimbési, Luabo, and Cuama.">Leeambye</span> <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">as</span>

Displaced by the political upheaval in the early nineteenth century (known as the Mfecane), the group migrated north and came to settle in the Zambezi Valley in present-day Zambia around 1840. Makololo porters, sent by chief Sekeletu, journeyed with Livingstone on his famous African transcontinental journey (1852-56) (Kalusa 2009:60-61).">Makololo</span> where they have only

During his transcontinental expedition (1852-56), Livingstone was hopeful that the Zambezi could provide a highway into central Africa, but during his later Zambezi Expedition (1858-64) he realised that he had overestimated the river's navigability.

River in south-central Africa and a major tributary of the Zambezi River. It rises in present-day Zambia's North Western Province and flows south and west to enter the Zambezi River about fifteen miles north of Lukulu in Western Province. Livingstone sometimes mistakenly refers to the Kabompo River as the Leeambye (another name for the Zambezi River), since he incorrectly believed the Kabompo to be the main stream of the Zambezi rather than a tributary (Schapera 1963,1:27n3).">Leeambye</span>

When the Makololo conquered the Lozi kingdom in the 1840s, he became an exile and settled north of the Kabompo river. He continued to be involved in skirmishes with the Makololo, the southern Luvale, and southern Lunda. Livingstone identifies him as the son of the Lozi king Mulambwa Santulu (called Santuru by Livingstone), but he was actually the son of Mubukwanu and therefore the grandson of Mulambwa Santulu (Oppen 1993:60, Caplan 1970:10; Schapera 1963,1:9n3).">Masiko</span> - Their visits explain

Livingstone came to the same view of Africa's continental structure during his cross-continental expedition, and considered his observations to provide empirical confirmation of Murchison's proposition (Stafford 1988:8, 17; Murchison 1852:cxxii; Livingstone 1857aa:475, 500; Schapera 1963,2:314).">central basin</span> very
