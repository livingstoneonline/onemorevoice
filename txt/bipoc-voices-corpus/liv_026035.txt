Warning: Readers should exercise caution when consulting this text and others published by the “BIPOC Voices” project due to the possible inclusion of offensive or otherwise problematic historical language. Readers should also take note that any racist or similar elements in the texts do not necessarily represent the real views of the BIPOC creator(s), but rather may be due to the (often silent) intervention of Victorian-era white British missionaries, editors, and publishers.

  Gleanings from Recent Letters.
  
  [...]
  Preaching on a Tricycle.
  The Rev. F. J. de Rozario, of Agurpura, Bengal, writes:&#8212;
  Baboo Guruchurn Bose, who has been with me since his
    conversion in
    1842, as head master of the English school, and has always assisted me in
    preaching the Gospel to the heathen, is now, notwithstanding his laborious
    duties in the school, out every morning and evening, combining exercise
    with preaching. He starts on his tricycle about four or five in the morning, and goes a great
    distance towards either end of the Barrackpore road.
    On his way he invariably finds groups of men and women, either as travellers from great
    distances, or as vendors of vegetables going to the
    different markets. When they are proceeding in the same direction with
    him, he joins them and enters into religious conversations, and points out
    to them Jesus Christ as the only Saviour of sinners. Should he meet
    such groups going in the opposite direction, he turns and accompanies
    them, speaking all the while about the salvation of their souls. Very
    frequently the traveling groups rest themselves for a while on the roadside. He also stops and
    preaches. Presently other groups come up, one
    after another, and form a large body of hearers of the Gospel. Thus distant people from cities
    and villages hear of Christ and His salvation.
