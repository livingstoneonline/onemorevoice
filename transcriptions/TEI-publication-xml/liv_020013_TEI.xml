The <term type="collective">Arabs</term> were very cruel and unkind. But one day, near a place called <placeName>Bussorah</placeName>, in <region>Persia</region>, an <term type="collective">English</term> ship<!-- Not sure if Persia is country or bloc? HB --><!-- region --> came and caught the <term type="collective">Arab</term> ship; we were all taken on board and carried to <settlement>Bombay</settlement>. Then I was seven or eight years old, and it was in <date when="1859">1859</date>. Many of the 

<cb/>
children who were taken with <!-- Beginning of column two. HB --> me went to <settlement>Nasik</settlement> to the school there, and I went too. <persName>Mr. Price</persName> took care of us, and we were all taught in the school.</p>

<p>One day <persName>Mr. Price</persName> came and asked if six of us would go and join the Doctor. We remembered the Doctor<!-- Should the doctor be tagged as persName as we know it's referring to DL? HB --><!-- No, formal names only. AW -->, for he had been at <settlement>Nasik</settlement> in <date when="1865">1865</date>, and we all knew about the other <settlement>Nasik</settlement> boys who had gone with him then. So plenty of boys said they would go. <persName>Mr. Price</persName> chose six, and I was the leader of the party. We went to <settlement>Bombay</settlement> and saw <persName>Mr. Robertson</persName>, who put us into a ship for <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName>. But he told us first we must never leave our master, and if he were dead we must find his grave and bring back his bones. When we were at <geogName>Zanzibar</geogName> <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName> came and said he had found <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName>, so <persName>Lieut.

sending, and we went. We travelled for two months until we reached a place called <settlement>Unyanyambe</settlement> ; there we found the Doctor, and went to the house where he was : we found him, and soon afterwards we began to travel with him, and we travelled every day for nearly nine months, until the Doctor 

<cb/>
died ; then we said we must <!-- Beginning of column two.
