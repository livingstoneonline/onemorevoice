  <h5 style="text-align:center;">OBITUARY OF AROKKIA NADAN.</h5>
  <p>Our native Missionary, the Rev. John Devasagayam, has communicated the following particulars
    respecting this aged catechist, who had long laboured for the spiritual good of his countrymen
    in the Tinevelly district&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">He entered on his rest on the 15th of June 1852, aged
    85 years.
    His heathen name was Periakannoo Nadan, and, like the rest of the heathen,
    he worshipped Sudalei Maden and several other idols. About
    twenty-five years ago, he and many other heathen came under Christian
    instruction. A good many of them became backsliders when a persecution
    arose from the heathen in consequence of their profession of Christiantity;
    but Arokkia Nadan remained faithful to the end. He was
    baptized by the late Rev. C. T. E. Rhenius, and always manifested a deep
    sense of his corrupt nature, and well-grounded hope of pardon and mercy
    through faith in Christ, the only Saviour of sinners. As he was a man
    of property and exemplary conduct, he was appointed a headman of the
    congregation. He evinced a particular desire for the conversion of the
    heathen. He was very active in bringing the people of both sexes to
    morning and evening service, and to the Sunday services in the church.
    His own conduct was a bright example to them. Even in extreme old age
    he was regular in going to the church every day, with the help of a cane.
    Once, in a dark and rainy night, when the wind was strong, he fell down
    near the church, and cried for help. I ran immediately, and asked him
    how he thought of coming to the church in the dark. He answered
    thus&#8212;"You know how much we suffered from want of rain, and how
    we prayed for it. The Lord has mercifully given us a little rain. Am
    I not bound to thank Him for it?" After the service, finding that many
    did not come to the church, he exclaimed, "Alas! like the nine lepers
    whom our Lord cured, they are ungrateful for the mercy shown to
    them." So he went to the houses of the people, and, rebuking them,
    entreated them to render praises to God, at least in their houses. On
    Sabbath days, after service, he used to spend the rest of the day in hearing
    the word of God read to him. He and his three sons, as is the case
    with many heathen, were not early instructed in reading; but his grandchildren
    of both sexes were taught in our Christian schools, and were
    a great comfort to him. One evening, while I was teaching the women
    their catechism, one of them was not able to repeat her lesson, when
    Arokkia Nadan addressed her in the following words&#8212;"Amma (dear
    child), your heart is like the ground which received the seed that fell by
    the way-side; but pray to God that He may teach you by His Holy
    Spirit." She said, "Oh, Nadan! what shall I do? The lesson does not
    remain in my mind." He replied, "When you pray to our Saviour,
    say, 'O Lord, open my heart, as you did Lydia's;' and then your understanding
    will be enlightened."</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">During his last illness, I read to him of the
    sufferings of our Saviour,
    from Matt. xxvii. He shed tears, and said, "What great love to me, the
    sinner, in suffering so much for me." I then left him, and went to him
    again in the evening, and asked him if he wished that I should read a
    chapter from the gospel. He answered, "I have no other desire so great
    and so sweet as to hear the word of God." I read to him Luke xxiii., after
    which he said, "My sin is the great cause of my Saviour's suffering so
    much."&#8212;I asked, "How?" He answered, "The Lord has shed His
    blood to save me, a sinner;" and repeated a verse from the hymn,
    "Dear Lord! why all these plagues or sufferings to Thee? Alas! they
    are caused by my sins: so, if I look to Jesus who suffered for me, He
    will pardon my sins and save me."</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">Another day he was visited by a number of his
    relatives and friends.
    After I had offered up a prayer, he looked around, and observed his
    daughter, who is still a heathen. She had been married to a heathen before
    Arokkia Nadan became a Christian. He addressed her in the following
    terms&#8212;"It grieves me exceedingly to see you a heathen, and remaining in
    a state in another which you cannot embrace Christ as your Saviour. Here is
    a Christian church in this village: come and live here, learn the word of
    God, trust in our Saviour for the pardon of your sins, and your soul's
    salvation. I have often exhorted you and your husband, but you have
    neglected my advice, and trust in the devil. I therefore did not come to
    see you. Respect my dying advice at least, and embrace the gospel.
    If not, your fate will be awful." Observing some of his children in
    tears, he said to them, "Do not weep like the heathen, who have no
    hope beyond the grave. My heavenly Father calls me: I desire to go
    gladly to the house of my Father." He then looked at me, and said,
    "Dear catechist, pray for me, and commend me to the Lord's will." I
    accordingly prayed for him. He then said, "When the Lord removes
    me, you must take care that our people do not weep like the ignorant
    heathen." I then read to him the 25th chapter of Matthew, and gave
    him some exhortation.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">I came to him on the following day, and told him that
    his present
    sickness might end in death. He said, "I don't fear to die. I wish to
    'finish my course with joy' and comfort, and go to my Saviour." I asked
    him to tell me the text which gave him such a comfort. He answered,
    "Did not our Saviour say, 'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
    heavy laden, and I will give you rest?' These words," he added, "give
    me solid comfort." I then read to him the 14th chapter of St. John.
    He said, with a feeble voice, that he was prepared to go to his heavenly
    Father's house, like the wise virgins. I asked him if he knew the parable
    of the ten virgins. He told me that he knew it when he came to learn
    Vedam,<a href="#note1" id="note1back">*</a> and that he was prepared to meet the Bridegroom
    three years
    ago. As he was very weak, I offered up a prayer, and came away.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">On another day, when I spoke to him, he repeated to
    me the following
    verse&#8212;"O Lord, let me die by the side, or under the shelter, of Christ!"
    and told me that he was washed by the blood of our Saviour, and that
    he hoped he would obtain eternal rest. He told me further, that, when
    he gives up his spirit, although unable to speak, still he would commit
    his soul to the care of his heavenly Father. I read to him the 5th
    chapter of the 2d Epistle to the Corinthians. He then sighed, and prayed,
    "O Lord, when my 'earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved,' receive
    me into that 'house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!'"</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">One day, when suffering exceedingly, he lifted up his
    hand. We understood
    that it was a sign for prayer, and I prayed immediately. A few
    minutes after, he stretched out his hands, and his happy spirit took its
    flight to the realms of glory. In the evening his burial service was
    performed by me. It was attended by all his numerous family, and
    a great number of Christians, heathen, and Mahommedans. He was
    loved and respected by all around him, and was always called Peria, or
    great, Nadan.</p>
