<br><p class="p ">I FOUND this man in the <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">. . . . . station</span> at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Q*</span> on<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity."><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>, and learned that he had
been kept by the missionaries for some years, since the day when a party of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native teachers</span> had
found him in his own town, situated in the forest some miles away from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Q*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In answer to my
inquiry as to how he came to lose his hands, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span>’s statement was as follows:—
</p>
<p class="p ">“<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">State<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."></span> soldiers</span> came from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">P*</span>, and attacked the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">R R* towns</span>, which they burned, killing
people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They then attacked a town called <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">A B*</span> and burned it, killing people there also.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From
that they went on to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span> people</span> fled into the forest, leaving some few of their
number behind with food to offer to the soldiers—among whom was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers came
to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span>, under the command of a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span> officer, whose <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> name was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">T U</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers
took prisoner all the men left in the town, and tied them up.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their hands were tied very tight
with <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> rope, and they were tied up outside in the open; and as it was raining very hard,
and they were in the rain all the time and all the night, their hands swelled, because
the thongs
contracted.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His (<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span>’s) hands had swollen terribly in the morning, and the thongs had cut into
the bone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers, when they came to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span>, had only one <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> a prisoner with them; he
was killed during the night.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span> itself eight people, including himself (<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span>) were taken
prisoners; all were men; two were killed during the night.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Six only were taken down in the
morning to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Y Y*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> ordered four of the prisoners to be released; the fifth was a
Chief, named <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">R R R</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This Chief had come back to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span> in the night to try secretly to get some
fire to take back into the forest, where the fugitives were hiding.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His wife had become sick during
the heavy rain in the forest, and the Chief wanted the fire for her; but the soldiers
caught him, and
he was taken along with the rest.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This Chief was taken to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">P*</span>, but he believes that on the
way, at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Z Z*</span>, he tried to escape, and was killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span>’s hands were so swollen that they
were quite useless.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers seeing this, and that the thongs had cut into the bone, beat
his hands against a tree with their rifles, and he was released.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He does not know why they
beat his hands.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">T U</span>, was not far off, and could see what they were doing.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">T U</span> was drinking palm-wine while the soldiers beat his hands with their rifle-butts against
the tree.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His hands subsequently fell off (or sloughed away).<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers left him by the
waterside, he got back to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span>, and when his own people returned from the forest they found
him there.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Afterwards some boys—one of whom was a relation—came to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">L L*</span>, and they found
him without his hands.”
</p>
<p class="p ">There was some doubt in the translation of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span>’s statement whether his hands had been <br>
<span class="pb-title">0077</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center ">77</span></span>
cut with a knife; but later inquiry established that they fell off through the tightness
of the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> rope and the beating of them by the soldiers with their rifle-butts.
</p>
<p class="p ">On the 14th August, I again visited the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> camp at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Irebu</span>, where, in the course of
con versation with the officer in command, I made passing but intentional reference
to the fact that
I had seen <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span>, and had heard his story from himself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I added that from the boy’s statement
it would seem that the loss of his hands was directly attributable to an officer who
was apparently
close at hand and in command of the soldiers at the time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I added that I had heard of other
cases in the neighbourhood.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Commandant at once informed me that such things were
impossible, but that in this specific case of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span> he should cause inquiry to be instantly made.
</p>
<p class="p ">On my return from the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lulongo River</span> I found that this remark in passing conversation had
borne instant fruit, although previous appeals on behalf of the boy had proved unsuccessful.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Commissaire-Général of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Equator District</span></span> had, learning of it, at once proceeded to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lake
Mantumba</span>, and a judicial investigation as to how <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V V</span> lost his hands had been immediately
instituted.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The boy was taken to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bikoro</span>, and I have since been informed that provision has
been made for him and a weekly allowance.
</p>
<p class="p ">When at the village of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">B C*</span>, I had found there a boy of not more than 12 years of age
with the right hand gone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This child, in answer to my inquiries, said that the hand had been
cut off by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> soldiers</span> some years before.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He could not say how long before, but
judging from the height he indicated he could not then have been more than 7 years
of age
if now 12.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His statement was fully confirmed by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S S</span> and his relatives, who stood around him
while I questioned him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers had come to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">B C*</span> from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Coquilhatville</span> by land through the
forest.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They were led by an officer whose name was given as “<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">U V</span>.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His father and mother
were killed beside him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He saw them killed, and a bullet hit him and he fell.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He here showed
me a deep cicatrized scar at the back of the head, just at the nape of the neck, and
said it was
there the bullet had struck him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He fell down, presumably insensible, but came to his senses
while his hand was being hacked off at the wrist.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I asked him how it was he could possibly lie
silent and give no sign.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He answered that he felt the cutting, but was afraid to move, knowing that
he would be killed if he showed any sign of life.
</p>
<p class="p ">I made some provision for this boy.</p>
<p class="p ">The names of six other persons mutilated in a similar way were given to me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The last of
these, an old woman, had died only a few months previously, and her niece stated that
her
aunt had often told her how she came to lose her hand.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The town had been attacked by
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> troops</span> and all had fled, pursued into the forest.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This old woman (whose name was
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">V W</span>) had fled with her son, when he fell shot dead, and she herself fell down beside
him—she
supposed she fainted.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She then felt her hand being cut off, but had made no sign.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When all
was quiet and the soldiers had gone, she found her son’s dead body beside her with
one hand
cut off and her own also taken away.
</p>
<p class="p ">Of acts of persistent mutilation by <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> soldiers</span> of this nature I had many statements
made to me, some of them specifically, others in a general way.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of the fact of this mutilation and
the causes inducing it there can be no shadow of doubt.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was not a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> custom prior to the
coming of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>; it was not the outcome of the primitive instincts of savages in their
fights between village and village; it was the deliberate act of the soldiers of a
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span>
Administration</span>, and these men themselves never made any concealment that in committing
these acts they were but obeying the positive orders of their superiors.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I obtained several specific
instances of this practice of mutilation having been carried out in the town of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Q*</span> itself, when
the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> soldiers</span> had come across from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">P*</span> to raid it or compel its inhabitants to work.
