<p class="p center ">–——◆——–</p>
<p class="p ">We have received files of papers from the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Cape of
Good Hope</span> to the 1st of November inclusive.</p>
<p class="p ">The <span class="italic "><em>Friend of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Free State</span></em></span> publishes the
following report of a conference between the President, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">J.
N. Boshoff, Esq.</span>, and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Basuta</span> Chief, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">his
Excellency Sir George Grey</span> being present. It took
place on the 5th of October last :—</p>
<p class="p ">"The President.—I am very glad to see <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> here in
the presence of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">his Excellency Sir G. Grey</span>, on the first
official opportunity we have had of meeting in the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Free
State</span>. I think it well that we should often meet, as
personal visits are always much more satisfactory than
correspondence by letter. As we meet now personally we had
better speak of business. I have often heard that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>
is a man of peace and is desirous of holding peace with the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">whites</span>. I am also a man of peace, and now in the presence
of his chief men I wish to show him on what terms we may
make peace and friendship continue. As the best mode <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: to">t o</u>
do so my view is that, as I am chosen on one side, and
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> on the other, to see that peace is not interrupted,
we should, in case any disturbances occur, let each other
know our minds freely. I shall therefore tell him at
once that I have, on my arrival, been very sorry to hear
of many thefts having been committed within our
boundary by wicked people from the other side. I would be
glad to convince him that such things must be put a stop to,
or the consequences will be that they will put the country
in a blaze, and do great harm to all. These are all the
complaints I know of as yet. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span> has already represented
the case to him, and he has promised to punish the thieves,
and put a stop to the stealing. I have no doubt that he
will prove himself a man of his word, and make his chiefs
help him to carry out his promises.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Peace is the mother of all. I admire what
your Honour has mentioned. I would be glad to hear any
remarks of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span>'s in confirmation.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—We will await your answer.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—If no one else speaks it may appear as if these
were the words of only two people.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—I am the representative of all my people,
and my word is theirs also. I wish to hear the mind of
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>'s people</span> through him as their chief.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—May the things we speak of ascend to
heaven! My mind looks on the two personages present as
the first fruits of a new year. I do not mind faults being
mentioned, but I understood this to be a meeting of
friendship. I met <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span> about the faults now brought
forward. I do not deny that some of the things have gone in
our direction. I do not know the best means of stopping
these things. What has the Governor come for? Has he
been sent by his master? Is there not a word of advice
and wisdom? I cannot bear the weight of all. You come
from the land of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chaka</span>. If you have not seen him, you
may have seen prints of him. He was ruined by his
relations. You have wisdom to build beautiful houses of clay.
We got all we have from the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">whites</span> ; can we not make
some plan by which we can enjoy what we have and keep
peace? <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Philip</span> wrote to the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> Government</span> when
we were in trouble, and it assisted us. The complaints
have not been sufficiently established. If you can show
me the cause of dissatisfaction let me know. There I end.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—I will take him up at the last word. The
cause he must know, but the way is this,—his people come
in and steal. The missionaries have been long enough in
the country for them to know that stealing is wrong. I
believe that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> has enough good men among his people
to help him to put down the wicked men who steal. I am
glad to hear that he wishes to get advice. I want it also. If
we can both get advice, I, for my part, am ready to take it,
and be guided by it. If he is willing to take advice from
his Excellency, I am also. I will state the cause of
complaint, and if he has any. I hope that he will state any he
may have, and then if I can I will remove it. I will tell
him clearly in as few words as possible what we complain
of. The thefts commnitted in <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span>'s district</span> within two
years, as carefully collected by him from the field-cornets,
amount to 297 head of breeding cattle.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I have already agreed with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span> that I
was convinced that some cattle had been stolen, and I have
made him promises. Can you not give me some advice?</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—If <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> will listen I will just tell him the
numbers.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—It is just what I wanted.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—Oxen and breeding cattle together, 363;
horses, 294 ; sheep, 112. I was not satisfied with the simple
returns of the field-cornets, and have instructed <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span>
to get statements on oath from the owners of stolen cattle.
This is not yet completed, but is considerable. Since the
numbers in the statement of the field-cornets have been
ascertained many more cattle have been stolen. When the
full amount is ascertained I will let <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> know. I do
not want to do anything unjust. I will examine the list
myself, and find out those for which <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> is
answerable, and when this number has been ascertained I
will tell <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>. I have now ordered the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Landdrosts</span>
to send in monthly returns of stolen cattle, with all
the particulars of the theft, instead of allowing the list
to accumulate for two years. I will tell him also that it is
not only from <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span>'s district</span> that complaints are
made. I have received reports also from <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Orpen</span> that
thefts of horses are committed on the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Winburg</span> border</span>.
Some of the horses have been found with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Molitsani</span>, and
some have been given up ; others he refuses to return,
unless the owners come to fetch them. This must not be.
My people cannot be put to such expenses. He ought to
have sent the stolen horses and thieves to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Winburg</span>, where
they would have been punished by us. Stealing will
never cease, unless the thieves are punished. Retaking
stolen cattle from the thief is no punishment. He ought
also to be fined or receive corporal punishment. If the
chief refuses to give up the thief he makes himself
responsible. We put thieves in prison, and punish them
when convicted. If he did so we would not have any
more stealing. He need not tell me that he has no power
to punish those who do wrong, for if they can retake the
stolen cattle they can punish the thief also. It is
complained that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Molitsani</span> harbours <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bushmen</span> and other thieves ;
also, that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Letsela</span> occupies the lands of the farmers and
makes gardens there. These are the very people whom
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> promised <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Hoffman</span> to remove last January.
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Molapa</span>'s people</span> have also encroached, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Molapa</span>, though
he has promised to remove them, has not done so. I
mention these things to show that they give rise to
quarrels. My people will not submit to it any longer.
Now, as he has asked my advice, I say that if his people
will not obey him he must make them. He must take
his people against them. Those things that they should not
wish us to do he must not do. He would not be
satisfied if I said I could not help such things, if committed
by my people. I know that they can do it, because
sometimes for months long no thefts were committed ; so, if they
could stop the thieving once, they could do so again, and
there are other chiefs who never steal. I conclude,
therefore, that those chiefs who will exercise their power can stop
stealing.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Can the names of those chiefs not be given?</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moroko</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jan Bloem</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lepui</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Adam Kok</span>,
and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Waterboer</span>.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—You mention those things, his Excellency
being present. We must remember that we are on a
friendly visit. Your honour must remember that you have
been only a short time in the country. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Landdrost</span> and
I, who have long lived here, know better. The sword of
the mouth is grievous. We had better not speak so, but
separate in peace, as we have met in peace.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—I think the best way to secure peace is that
friends meet and speak their minds. I have stated all I
have to say, and I want <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> to state any grievances he
has to speak about.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Not to-day.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—Very good ; I shall always be happy to hear
from him about anything that is done wrong by my people,
as war would only break us all down ; but if there is any
other thing, as his Excellency is present, of which he feels
aggrieved, I should be glad to hear it.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Not to-day. Let us go home. We can
correspond by letter.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—Would he like his Excellency to give us
some advice?</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—It is not the proper day. His Excellency is
not here to hear difficulties. We can correspond by letter.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—I thought <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> would wish it.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—Advice to a chief ought to be given in
private, and not in public.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—When occasion is urgent we seize the first
opportunity of meeting, and, if <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> postpones the
conference on these urgent matters, some accident may occur,
for which we may be sorry before we meet again. It may
be long before we can meet again ; it may not be easy for us
to do so. We can write, but we may not understand each
other so well as by conversing. I have therefore spoken to
him in his Excellency's presence, in order that he might give
us some advice, and that we might profit by it ; and it would
be a satisfaction to go home with the mutual conviction of
having come to an understanding to correct what has been
wrong.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I did not expect that the matters already
settled with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span>, and to whom I have already given an
answer, would be touched upon ; and I have also given a
paper to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Venter</span>, that people suffering from thefts
should be sent to me. I am ready to hear advice.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—I know nothing of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Venter</span>'s
arrangement. He had no right to make one. I was then in the
country. Such a proposal as yours, that we should go into
your country and search for our property, could never be
entertained. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Venter</span> was appointed with three others.
The directions given by all to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span> were good, and
ought not to have been broken by one. If I was to send my
people in that way into your country, it would only make
disputes, and break our friendships.</p>
<p class="p ">"Mosheh,—I did not come to speak of business.</p>
<p class="p ">"There seemed to be some misinterpretation of the
Chief's meaning in this last sentence, which had been
interpreted in English by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Nehemiah</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>'s son.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">His Excellency Sir George Grey</span> then asked the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Rev.
Mr. Arbousset</span>, who was acting as interpreter, whether he
thought <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> would like to hear what he thought he
ought to do.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Arbousset</span> replying in the affirmative, His
Excellency addressed <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> as follows:—You say that we are
wise people in being able to build beautiful houses of clay ;
a man who does that is respected by others, but a man
who raises barbarians in the scale of civilization is admired
by ages. You are now the builder. You have collected
some barbarians and made a kind of nation. The question
now is whether you are to succeed or fail. Not only is
<span class="country" title="A country.">South Africa</span> looking on, but many other parts of the world
too. Every good man is willing to assist ; no one more so
than the President. I have had an opportunity of hearing
his views, and I am sure he is anxious to help <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mosheh</span> to
succeed. It is impossible that a civilized nation can allow
a nation of thieves to remain on their boundary. The
President and I are ready to put them down. I would be
glad to see you more cordial to accept the President's offers
than you have seemed to be ; and, as I am now going away
for a considerable time, I should be glad to be certain that
I would devise some plan for the future. In such a plan
I will assist as far as the Cape colonial boundary is concerned.
It must be greatly owing to your own energy that you have
raised yourself to the position you now hold, and I would
advise you to trust to that energy in future, and not to bad
advisers. I trust that before I leave you will give some proofs
that you will put down stealing, and allow your tribe to
prosper. I am sure the President's remarks will be
appreciated ; I have been particularly struck with their justness.
I hope before I leave that you will promise to put an end to
such practices as those that have been carried on.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—We ought to praise his Excellency for his
words, though we were not aware, when called to visit, that
such things would have been brought forward.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—If he is not prepared to speak on business,
will he appoint another meeting, or will he go home and
consider, and acquaint me with the result, and in the
meantime try with his chiefs to put a stop to stealing? <u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Or">or</u>
otherwise consequences may ensue that we may all deplore.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—When I met <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span> at <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sefali</span>'s I made an
agreement with him that he should make a list of stolen
cattle, with the particulars of theft, in order that I could
call on the guilty chiefs, and show them the accusations
against them.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span> explained that the list was in the course of
formation.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> expressed himself satisfied, and said that the
measures adopted to settle the thefts on the list would go
towards stopping any future thefts.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—Will the chief give me some promise that
he and his chiefs will endeavour to put a stop to any
future thieving, or else the lists will only continue to in
crease?</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I cannot bind myself to say that there will
be no more stealing ; thieves do not tell me when they
come in or go out. Did I not at the meeting with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Ford</span>,
at <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sefali</span>'s, tell my people they must not even steal a goat?
You must give me time. I have eaten the Governor's
meat, and it will be easy for me to vomit it up, but it is
not so easy to make thieves disgorge what they have stolen.</p>
<p class="p ">"Presdent.—I praise <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> for the manner in which
he met <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Ford</span>.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—The sooner the papers are ready the better.
I will make my report on them as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—I will now go away satisfied. I shall
always be very glad, with him, to remove all difficulties, as
long as we remain in the same situations.</p>
<p class="p ">"<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>.—I feel as you do. I came to bring some
words to my people. Peace and tranquillity by all means!
They are the only things to be relied on. It must be the
wishes of both. We must by patience overcome evil.</p>
<p class="p ">"President.—I am very glad to hear what he says, and I
will remember his words.</p>
<p class="p ">"His Excellency the Governor.—Work away building
this house."</p>
<p class="p ">We have also received additional files of papers
from the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Cape of Good Hope</span> to the
25th of November. Everything was going on prosperously at the
colony.</p>
