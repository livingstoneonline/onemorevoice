Warning: Readers should exercise caution when consulting this text and others published by the “BIPOC Voices” project due to the possible inclusion of offensive or otherwise problematic historical language. Readers should also take note that any racist or similar elements in the texts do not necessarily represent the real views of the BIPOC creator(s), but rather may be due to the (often silent) intervention of Victorian-era white British missionaries, editors, and publishers.

  Madagascar.
  [...]
  2. THE QUEEN'S PROCLAMATION.
  The Proclamation is divided into five sections, and is addressed "to the assembled people at
    Andohalo, and published throughout the Kingdom of Madagascar on the 20th of June (11 Alakaosy),
    1877." The following is the text of the concluding clauses of Section V. :&#8212;
  
    "Now, the kingdom having been given by God to me, I declare that I will put a stop to these
      evils, for I am a Sovereign tsy mba tia vezovezo (who hates disturbance or
      quarrelsomeness).
    "Therefore I decree that I set free all the Mozambiques in my kingdom to be my Ambaniandro
      (subjects), whether those newly introduced or those who have been here for a long time. For it
      is not so! ye under heave?
    "And if there is any one who will not obey this edict, but still holds the Mozambiques as
      slaves, I shall count such as criminals, and the penalty of the laws shall be enforced upon
      them. For is it not so! Oh, ye under heaven?
    "And I also decree that whoever has traded in Mozambiques can no longer make a legal claim in
      respect of such transactions. And should such take place, he that makes such a claim shall be
      held guilty. For is it not so! ye under heaven?
    "And if this decree of mine is perverted by any one to deceive the wise or incite the simple,
      and so cause disturbances in my kingdom, then whoever he may be I will hold him guilty, and
      condemn him to death, for I am a Sovereign that will not deceive.
    "Again I declare unto you, ye under heaven, that whoever obeys the laws of
      Andrianampoinimerina, and alters not the decrees of Lehidama, Rabodonandrianampoinimerina, and
      Rasoherimanjaka and especially observes my own decrees, for I, Queen Ranavalomanjaka, am heir to
      these who reigned before me, then rest assured that I am the protector of your wives, your
      children, and your property; and when I say trust me then rest assured. For is it not so! ye
      under heaven?"
