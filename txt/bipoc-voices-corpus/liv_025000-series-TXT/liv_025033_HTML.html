<h4 style="text-align:center">AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AUTHAUTCHEE, (WIFE OF NATHANIEL,) BAPTIZED ON FEBRUARY 17, 1850.</h4>

<p>"I was born at Madras in the year 1833 of Roman Catholic parents, and was brought up in superstition. In the year 1840, my mother, hearing of her mother's illness at Bangalore, took me with her to see her, and found her very ill. After a while it pleased the Lord to restore her to health and strength; therefore my mother returned to Madras to my father, but left me with my grandmother. As my grandmother was a member of the church in connexion with the London Missionary Society—having been baptized and received into church-fellowship by the late Rev. J. Reid, at Bellary—she with affection instructed me in Divine things; and, in order that I might be educated and duly trained up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, sent me to the Tamil Mission School. Aboul a year after, my grandmother returned with me to Bellary, and soon after I was placed under the care of my uncle, Catechist John Stevenson, who not only sent me to the Mission School, but carefully instructed me at home. I am sorry to say that I did not benefit, but continued hardened and indifferent to the concerns of my immortal soul. However, when I was married, I was, by the providence of God, brought under the ministry of the Rev. J. Shrieves; and being instructed by Catechist John Craven at my house, I was led to reflect with sorrow on my sinfulness and hardness of heart, in having turned a deaf ear to the instructions of my grandmother, uncle, and others; and feeling the terrors of the wrath to come, I sought the Lord with tears and supplication. In course of time I obtained peace and comfort; and, feeling desirous to put on the Lord Jesus by baptism, and unite with his people, I made my mind known to Mr. Shrieves, who after instructing me, baptized me on February 17, 1850, with my husband, and admitted me into church-fellowship. I have here to acknowledge the goodness of God in separating me from my parents, who are still adhering to the errors of popery, and bringing me to the knowledge and possession of His righteousness, which is by faith in Christ Jesus, to whom be glory and honour for ever and ever. Amen."
