<p rend="center italic">Note of Information taken in the Charge of Cutting off the boy <persName><persName>I I</persName></persName>’s hand, preferred to 
<persName>Mr. Casement</persName> by the People of <settlement>E*</settlement>.</p>

<lb/><p>AT village of <settlement>E*</settlement> in the <region>C D* country</region>, on left bank of <geogName>E D*</geogName>, tributary of the <geogName>X* River</geogName>.</p>

<p><persName>Y Y</persName>, with many of the townsmen and a few women and children, also present.</p>

<p>A lad, about 14 or 15 years of age, <persName>I I</persName> by name, whose left hand had been cut off, the 
stump wrapped up in a rag, the wound being yet scarcely healed, appears, and, in answer to 
<persName>Consul</persName>’s question, charges a sentry named <persName>K K</persName> (placed in the town by the local agent of the 
<orgName>La Lulanga Society</orgName> to see that the people work rubber) with having done it.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This sentry is 
called, and after some delay appears with a cap-gun.</p>

<p>The following inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the loss of <persName>I I</persName>’s hand then 
takes place:&#8212;</p>

<p>The <persName>Consul</persName>, through <persName>W W</persName>, speaking in E F*, and <persName>X X</persName> repeating his utterances both in 
F G* to the sentry and in the local dialect to the others, asks <persName>I I</persName>, in the presence of the accused:</p>

<p>“Who cut off your hand?”</p>

<p><persName>I I</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“The sentry there.”</p>
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>


    <pb facs="liv_020060_0079" n="0079"/>
<fw><seg rend="center">79</seg></fw>

<p>The sentry denies the charge (interrupting), and stating that his name is <persName>T T T</persName> and not 
<persName>K K</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Consul</persName> requests him to keep silence&#8212;that he can speak later.</p>

<p><persName>Y Y</persName> is called and questioned by <persName>Consul</persName> through the interpreters.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After being exhorted to 
speak the truth without fear or favour, he states:</p>

<p>“The sentry before us cut off <persName>I I</persName>’s hand.”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Did you yourself witness the act?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Several of the Headmen of the town called upon by the <persName>Consul</persName> to testify.</p>

<p>To the first of these, who gave his name as <persName>Z Z</persName>, <persName>Consul</persName> asked, pointing to <persName>I I</persName>’s mutilated 
wrist-bone:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Who cut off this boy’s hand?”</p>

<p><persName>Z Z</persName> (pointing to the sentry):<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“That man did it.”</p>

<p>The second, who gave his name as <persName>A A A</persName>, asked by <persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Who cut off this boy’s 
hand?”</p>

<p>Answers:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“<persName>K K</persName>.”</p>

<p>The third, giving his name as <persName>B B B</persName>, asked by <persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Who cut off this boy’s hand?”</p>

<p>Answers:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“This man here, the sentry.”</p>

<p><persName>Z Z</persName> (re-questioned):<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Did you yourself see this sentry cut off this boy’s hand?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Yes, I saw it.”</p>

<p><persName>A A A</persName> (re-questioned):<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Did you yourself see this sentry cut off this boy’s hand?”</p>

<p>Answers:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“I should think so.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Did I not get this wound here” (pointing to a cut by the 
tendon <persName>Achilles</persName> on the left heel) “the same day, when running away in fright?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>My own knife 
wounded me.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I let it fall when I ran away.”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName> questions <persName>I I</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“How long ago was it your hand was cut off?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“He is not sure.”</p>

<p>Two fellow-villagers&#8212;young men, named <persName>C C C</persName> and <persName>D D D</persName>&#8212;step out and state that 
they remember.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The act occurred when the clay was being dug over at <settlement>C D</settlement>, when the 
slip-place for the steamers was begun.</p>

<p><persName>E E E</persName>, of <placeName>E*</placeName>, another section of the village of <settlement>R**</settlement>, questioned by <persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Did you 
see this lad’s hand cut off?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Yes.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I did not actually see it being cut off.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I came up and saw the severed 
hand and the blood lying on the ground.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The people had run away in all directions.”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName> asked interpreters to ask if there were others who had seen the crime and charged 
<persName>K K</persName> with it.</p>

<p>Nearly all those present, about forty persons, nearly all men, shouted out with one voice that 
it was <persName>K K</persName> who did it.</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“They are all sure it was <persName>K K</persName> here?”</p>

<p>Universal response:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Yes; he did it.”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName> asked the accused <persName>K K</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Did you cut off this boy’s hand?”</p>

<p>This question was put in the plainest language, and repeated six times, with the request that 
a plain answer&#8212;“yes” or “no”&#8212;should be given.</p>

<p>The accused failed to answer the question, beginning to talk of other things not relevant to the 
question, such as that his name was <persName>T T</persName> and not <persName>K K</persName> and that the people of <settlement>R**</settlement> had done 
bad things to him.</p>

<p>He was told to confine himself to the question put to him, that he could talk of other things 
later, but that now it was his place to answer the questions put, just as simply and plainly 
as the others had answered.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He had heard those answers and the charge they levied against 
him, and he should answer the <persName>Consul</persName>’s questions in just the same way.</p>

<p>The accused continued to speak of irrelevant subjects, and refused or failed to give any 
answer to the question put to him.</p>

<p>After repeated attempts to obtain answer to the question:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Did you or did you not cut off 
this boy <persName>I I</persName>’s hand?”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName> states:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“You are charged with this crime.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You refuse to answer the questions I 
put to you plainly and straightforwardly as your accusers have done.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You have heard their 
accusation.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Your refusal to reply as you should reply&#8212;viz., yes or no&#8212;to a direct and simple 
question leaves me convinced that you cannot deny the charge.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You have heard what has been 
charged against you by all these people.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Since you decline to answer as they did, you may 
tell your story your own way.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I shall listen to it.”</p>

<p>Accused began to speak, but before his remarks could be translated to me through <persName>X X</persName> 
first, to whom he spoke direct, and then through <persName>W W</persName>, a young man stepped out of the crowd 
and interrupted.</p>

<p>There was noise and then the man spoke:&#8212;</p>

<p>He stated he was <persName>F F F</persName> of <settlement>R**</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He had shot two <term type="animal">antelopes</term>, and he had brought two 
of their legs to this sentry as a gift.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The sentry refused to accept them, and tied his wife up.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
The sentry said they were not a sufficient present for him, and he kept <persName>F F F</persName>’s wife tied up 
until he, <persName>F F F</persName>, paid him 1,000 brass rods for her release.</p>

<p>Here a young man giving his name as <persName>G G G</persName> stepped into the ring and accused the sentry 
of having robbed him openly of two <term type="animal">ducks</term> and a <term type="animal">dog</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They were taken from him for no 
reason save that the sentry wanted them and took them by force.</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName> again turned to the sentry and invited him to tell his story, and to give his answer to 
the charge against him in his own way.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Consul</persName> enjoined silence on all, and not to interrupt 
the sentry.</p>

<p><persName>K K</persName> stated that he did not take <persName>G G G</persName>’s <term type="animal">ducks</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The father of <persName>G G G</persName> gave him a <term type="animal">duck</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
(All laughed.)<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It is true that <persName>F F F</persName> killed two <term type="animal">antelopes</term> and gave him the two legs as a gift 
but he did not tie up his wife or require money for her release.</p>

<fw><seg rend="center">80</seg></fw>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“That is all right.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>That finishes the <term type="animal">ducks</term> and the <term type="animal">antelopes</term>’ legs; but now I want 
to hear about <persName>I I</persName>’s hand.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Tell me what you know about <persName>I I</persName>’s hand being cut off.”</p>

<p><persName>K K</persName> again evaded the question.</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Tell him this.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He is put here by his master in this town, is he not? This is his 
town.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Now, does he say he does not know what goes on here where he lives?”</p>

<p>The sentry states:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“It is true that this is his town, but he knows nothing about <persName>I I</persName>’s hand 
being cut off.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Perhaps it was the first sentry here before he came, who was a very bad man and 
cut people’s hands off.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>That sentry has gone away&#8212;it was he who cut hands off, not himself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
He does not know anything of it.”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“What was the name then of this bad sentry, your predecessor, who cut people’s 
hands off?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You know it?”</p>

<p>The sentry gives no direct answer, and the question is repeated.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He then gives a statement 
about several sentries, naming three, as predecessors of himself here at <settlement>R**</settlement>.</p>

<p>Here a man named <persName>H H H</persName> jumped up, interrupting, and asserted that those three sentries 
did not reside at <settlement>R**</settlement>, but had been stationed in his own town&#8212;his, <persName>H H H</persName>’s, town.</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName> (to the sentry):<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“How long have you been in this town?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Five months.”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“You are quite sure?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Five months.”</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Do you, then, know this boy <persName>I I</persName>?<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Have you seen him before?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“I do not know him at all.”</p>

<p>Here the entire auditory roared with laughter, and expressions of admiration at the sentry’s 
lying powers were given vent to.</p>

<p>The sentry, continuing, stated that possibly <persName>I I</persName> comes from <persName>H H H</persName>’s town.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Anyhow, he 
(the sentry) does not know <persName>I I</persName>; he does not know him at all.</p>

<p>Here <persName>F F F</persName> stepped out and said he was full brother of <persName>I I</persName>; they had lived here always.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Their father was <persName>U U U</persName>, now dead; their mother is also dead.</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName> (to the sentry):<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Then it is finished.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You know nothing of this matter.”</p>

<p>The sentry:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“It is finished.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I have told you all.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I know nothing of it.”</p>

<p>Here a man giving his name as <persName>I I I</persName> , of <placeName>K K*</placeName>, the neighbouring section of <settlement>R**</settlement>, came 
forward with his wife.</p>

<p>He stated that the other sentries in their town were not so bad, but that this man was a 
villain.</p>

<p>The sentry had tied up his wife&#8212;the woman he brought forward&#8212;and had made him 
pay 500 rods before she was released.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He had paid the money.</p>

<p>Here <persName>Consul</persName> asked <persName>I I</persName> how his hand had been cut off.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He and <persName>C C C</persName> and <persName>D D D</persName> stated that 
he had first been shot in the arm, and then when he fell down the sentry had cut his hand off.</p>

<p><persName>Consul</persName>:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Did you feel it being cut off?”</p>

<p>Answer:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“Yes, I felt it.”</p>

<p>This terminated the inquiry.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <persName>Consul</persName> informed <persName>Y Y</persName> and the people present that he 
should report what he had seen and heard to the <orgName><country>Congo</country> Government</orgName>, and that he should beg them 
to investigate the charge against the sentry, who deserved severe punishment for his illegal and 
cruel acts.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The things that the sentry was charged with doing were quite illegal, and if the 
<orgName>Government</orgName> of his country knew of such things being done, the perpetrators of such crimes 
would, in all cases, be punished.</p>
