<p rend="no-indent">THE following interesting letter is from a 
<term type="collective">native African</term>, who, when quite a child, 
was kidnapped from the interior of <region>Nubia</region>. 
and after being several times sold, finally fell 
into the hands of an <term type="collective">English</term> family at 
<settlement>Alexandria</settlement>, where he acquired the rudiments 
of education, namely, a knowledge of the 
<term type="collective">English</term> alphabet. After remaining with 
this family for some time, he came to 
<country>Eng<!-- - -->land</country> in the capacity of servant; and having 
undergone many vicissitudes, at length went 
out to <settlement>Lagos</settlement>, to try what he could do on his 
own account. By his good conduct and 
ex<!-- - -->cellent principles, his sobriety, industry, and 
perseverance, he gained the confidence of 
the parties to whom he had been 
recom<!-- - -->mended, and his name is honourably mentioned 
in the despatches of <persName>Captain Burton</persName>, whom 
he accompanied on his recent visit to the 
<persName>King of <country><region>Dahomey</region></country></persName>, and who has again 
en<!-- - -->gaged him for his present expedition. We 
have received other communications from 
him, from time to time, but they were strictly 
personal. The present one appears to us to 
offer sufficient interest to merit a place in 
our columns, and we print it without 
correc<!-- - -->tion.</p>

<lb/><p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">Respected Sir</hi>,&#8212;Your kind favour of the 
<date when="1863-08-14">14th August</date> came to hand on my return from 
the <geogName>Congo River</geogName>, to which place I accompanied 
<persName>Consul Burton</persName> last <date when="1863-07">July</date>. The condition of that 
country, as far as we ascended, viz. 160 miles 
into the interior, is in a most deplorable state. 
The slave-trade and its accompaniments have 
been, and still are, ruling rampant in that river; 
and the result is a thorough demoralization of 
the inhabitants. The copious drafts of rum and 
other luxuries, showered upon the people by the 
<orgName><term type="collectivce">Portuguese</term> slave-traders</orgName><!-- Portuguese slave traders could probably be either term type="collective" or orgName; kind of an edge case. AW -->, has made them so 
thoroughly idle, that the earth groans for the 
want of some one to cultivate it. We found the 
poor victims to the influence of the vile traffic 
entirely in the hands of Satan; for thefts and 
debauchery of every description are rife 
through<!-- - -->out the whole country, but more especially from 
<geogName>Shark Point</geogName>, the mouth of the river, to 
<settlement>Em<!-- - -->bomma</settlement>, some eighty miles in the interior. Along 
the whole of the line are established baracoons 
and factories of every size and description. At 
some of these I saw plenty of slaves, and more 
particularly at one house in <settlement>Embomma</settlement>, where 
the unfortunate wretches were put in irons, 
awaiting the first opportunity of being sent down 
to the coast. I cannot give you a better 
exam<!-- - -->ple than this. We found, in the lower part of 
the river, the weaker sex awfully given to 
drunkenness, and, although nominally 
acknow<!-- - -->ledged by some one as their husband, they are <lb/>

in reality nothing but common property. I have 
now travelled through the greater part of <region>West 
<bloc>Africa</bloc></region>, <country>the Gambia</country>, <country>Sierra Leone</country>, <country>Liberia</country>, the 
<country>Gold Coast</country>, <country><region>Dahomey</region></country>, <settlement>Lagos</settlement>, <settlement>Badagry</settlement>, <settlement>Porto

<region><term type="collective">Euroba</term></region>, or <region><term type="collective">Yoruba</term> country</region>, the <country>Benin</country>, the

Ca<!-- - -->labar</settlement>, <country>Cameroons</country>, <geogName>Fernando Po</geogName>, <country>Gaboon</country>, and 
<settlement>St. Paul's de Loando</settlement>.<!-- I'm not 100% sure on the coding of all the foregoing. AW --> I have visited Africans
in their most primitive condition; but never in 
the whole of my experience did any thing like 
the state of affairs in the <geogName>Congo River</geogName> ever 
pre<!-- - -->sent itself to my notice. I am happy to say, 
however, that Her Majesty's cruisers are doing 
their utmost to suppress this market for human 
blood. When we left the <geogName>mouth of the <geogName>Congo</geogName></geogName> 
<date when="1863-10">last October</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Zebra</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Archer</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Griffin</hi>, 
the <hi rend="italic">Lee</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Afulet</hi>, were on duty there, so 
that we hope, ere long, to hear that the 
<term type="collective">Portu<!-- - -->guese</term> are ultimately compelled to leave the river. 
I hear that, according to present arrangements, 
the power of <country>Portugal</country> ought not to extend 
be<!-- - -->yond <settlement>Ambrizette</settlement>, forty miles south of the <geogName>Zaire</geogName>, 
or <geogName>Congo</geogName>. If so, they ought to be turned out 
of the river by force; for so long as they 
exer<!-- - -->cise their influence over the <term type="collective">natives</term><!-- Normally, we don't tag this term as too generic, but in this case it's being used in direct parallel to Europeans so I'm breaking the rule. AW -->, no 
legiti<!-- - -->mate commerce can be established with them. 
<orgName>Messrs. &#8212;&#8212; and &#8212;&#8212;</orgName> is the only <term type="collective">English</term> 
house in the river, and I am sorry to say that 
it is a failure; for, encouraged on every point 
by the slave-traders, the <term type="collective">native chiefs</term> find 
it more profitable to catch men and sell them 
for plenty of rum and beads and cloth, than to 
spoil their fingers by the manufacture of <term type="foodstuff">palm-oil</term>. 
In fact, I cannot see how a profitable traffic 
in <term type="collective">native</term> produce can be carried on unless the 
slave-traders were driven out, and the river 
shut up for two or three years, to purge it 
from the effects produced by the vile system 
ex<!-- - -->isting in its bosom. In about five or six days 
I hope to accompany <persName>Captain Burton</persName> (by whom 
I am now employed) to the <orgName>Court of the 
<persName><country><region>Da<!-- - -->homey</region></country> King</persName></orgName>. This will be our second visit to 
that country; and, from my slight experience 
of the country and people, I think <persName>Captain 
Bur<!-- - -->ton</persName> is just the right man in the right place.</p> 
<p>"Many thanks for the receipts, which came 
to hand all safe, as also the copies of the 
<hi rend="italic">Re<!-- - -->porter</hi>. The subscribers are quite delighted with 
the news, and wonder they had never heard of 
the <orgName>Society</orgName> before this. As the subject has now 
been introduced to their notice, I hope they will 
keep up the communication regularly with home; 
and I see no reason why all the intelligent 
na<!-- - -->tives on the coast should not become subscribers. 
I am sorry to say that the present system of 
education on the coast is not calculated to raise 
the <term type="collective">natives</term> much beyond their former scale of 
usefulness. There are only two things that they 
are educated for, viz. clerks and merchants. 
Everybody cannot be a merchant. Why not 
encourage agriculture? The same money that
<cb/>
makes the merchant can make the farmer, and 
I must confess that the latter would be the most 
independent of the two; for, singular to relate, 
that the prejudice of the <term type="collective">native</term> against the 
<term type="collective">European</term>, and, <hi rend="italic">vice versâ</hi>, of the <term type="collective">European</term> 
against the <term type="collective">native</term>, is any thing but 
encourag<!-- - -->ing. The <term type="collective">natives</term> have great capacities for 
trade; but the goods supplied to them on the 
coast are invoiced at such high prices, that it is 
really impossible for them to, realize any thing 
for themselves. To prove this, I have only to 
mention the case of <persName>Mr. &#8212;&#8212;</persName>, one of our 
subscribers. Last year he paid in something 
like 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (Eight hundred pounds) sterling 
as his yearly trade account with <orgName>Messrs.&#8212;&#8212; 
and &#8212;&#8212;</orgName>. Out of this he received commission 
about fifty pounds with which to maintain himself,
 his wife, and the <term type="collective">Kroo-boys</term>, besides a nephew and 
four children. Had it not been that <persName>Mr. 
&#8212;&#8212;</persName> had other sources to depend upon, his 
brokerage between the <term type="collective">Europeans</term> and <term type="collective">natives</term> 
would never keep his house in more than dry 
bread and water. He begged of me to 
recom<!-- - -->mend him to some gentleman in <country>England</country> with 
whom he could deal<space extent="2" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="5" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="5" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="5" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="5" unit="chars"/>.</p>

worth of <term type="foodstuff">palm-oil</term>, his own private property; 
and I should feel truly grateful if you will put 
him in the way of trading direct with <country>England</country>. 
He intends shipping some of his oil the moment 
he receives a communication from you. As for 
myself, I must candidly confess that I have 
found it more profitable for the present to be 
travelling about. That, however, cannot last, 
for, sooner or later, I must settle down somewhere. 
There are already too many engaged in 
<term type="foodstuff">palm-oil</term>; I therefore think of starting a <term type="plant">cotton</term> 
plan<!-- - -->tation at the foot of the <geogName><country>Cameroon</country> mountains</geogName> as 
soon as my period of servitude with my present 
employer has expired. Two or three thousand 
acres taken in and sown with <term type="plant">cotton</term> would not 
require more than 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out here, and, 
from experiments already tried, the farm could 
be made self-supporting after the first year. I 
do not think we shall be more than three months 
<country><region>Dahomey</region></country>, after which I think my master goes 
to <country>England</country>, and then I shall be at liberty to try 
for myself. I enclose a sample of <term type="plant">cotton</term> which 
I have grown this year in the <placeName>Consular grounds</placeName>. 
There are about two acres sowed with <term type="plant">cotton</term>, 
and I expect to gather about three cwt. With
