Gleanings from Recent Letters.
[...]
Preaching on a Tricycle.
The Rev. F. J. de Rozario, of Agurpura, Bengal, writes:&#8212;
Baboo Guruchurn Bose, who has been with me since his
conversion in
1842, as head master of the English school, and has always assisted me in
preaching the Gospel to the heathen, is now, notwithstanding his laborious
duties in the school, out every morning and evening, combining exercise
with preaching. He starts on his tricycle about four or five in the morning, and goes a great
distance towards either end of the Barrackpore road.
On his way he invariably finds groups of men and women, either as travellers from great
distances, or as vendors of vegetables going to the
different markets. When they are proceeding in the same direction with
him, he joins them and enters into religious conversations, and points out
to them Jesus Christ as the only Saviour of sinners. Should he meet
such groups going in the opposite direction, he turns and accompanies
them, speaking all the while about the salvation of their souls. Very
frequently the traveling groups rest themselves for a while on the roadside. He also stops and
preaches. Presently other groups come up, one
after another, and form a large body of hearers of the Gospel. Thus distant people from cities
and villages hear of Christ and His salvation.
