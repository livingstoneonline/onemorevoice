the Rubber Wars which began in 1893.</em></p>
<br><p class="p ">THE disturbance consequent on the attempt to levy a rubber tax in this district, a
tax which
has since been discontinued, appears to have endured up to 1900.</p>
<p class="p ">The population during the continuance of these wars diminished, I estimate, by some
60 per
cent., and the remnant of the inhabitants are only now, in many cases, returning to
their destroyed
or abandoned villages.</p>
<p class="p ">During the period 1893-1901 the <span class="country" title="A country.">Congo State</span> commenced the system of compelling the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> to collect rubber, and insisted that the inhabitants of the district should not go
out of
it to sell their produce to traders.</p>
<p class="p ">The population of the country then was not large, but there were numerous villages
with an
active people—very many children, healthy looking and playful.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They had good huts, large planta-
tions of plaintains and manioc, and they were evidently rich, for their women were
nearly all
ornamented with brass anklets, bracelets, and neck rings, and other ornaments.</p>
<p class="p ">The following is a list of towns or villages—giving their approximate population in
the
year 1893 and at the present time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These figures are very carefully estimated:—</p>

<br>
<p class="p ">This list can be extended to double this number of villages, and in every case there
has been
a great decrease in the population.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This has been, to a very great extent, caused by the extreme
measures resorted to by <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">officers of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span></span>, and the freedom enjoyed by the soldiers to do just
as they pleased.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are more people in the district near the villages mentioned, but they are
hidden away in the bush like hunted animals, with only a few branches thrown together
for
shelter, for they have no trust that the present quiet state of things will continue,
and they have
no heart to build houses or make good gardens.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In all the villages mentioned there are very few
good huts, and when the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> are urged to make better houses for the sake of their health,
the reply is, that there is no advantage to them in building good houses or making
extensive
gardens, as these would only give the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> a greater hold upon them and lead to more exorbitant
demands.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The decrease has several causes:—</p>
<p class="p ">1. O* was deserted because of demands made for rubber by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M. N O</span> and several others
were similar cases.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> went to the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">French</span> territory</span>.</p>
<p class="p ">2. “War,” in which children and women were killed as well as men.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Women and children
were killed not in all cases by stray bullets, but were taken as prisoners and killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sad to
say, these horrible cases were not always the acts of some <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">black soldier</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Proof was laid
against one officer who shot one woman and one man, while they were before him as
prisoners
with their hands tied, and no attempt was made by the accused to deny the truth of
the
statement.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To those killed in the so-called “war” must be added large numbers of those <br>
<span class="pb-title">0071</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center ">71</span></span>
who died while kept as prisoners of war.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Others were carried to far distant camps and have
never returned.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many of the young were sent to <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Missions</span>, and the death-rate was enormous.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Here is one example:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ten children were sent from a <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> steamer to a <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Mission</span>, and in spite
of comfortable surroundings there were only three alive at the end of a month.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The others had
died of dysentery and bowel troubles contracted during the voyage.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two more struggled on for
about fifteen months, but never recovered strength, and at last died.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In less than two years only
one of the ten was alive.</p>
<p class="p ">3. Another cause of the decrease is that the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> are weakened in body through insufficient
and irregular food supply.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They cannot resist disease as of old.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In spite of assurances that
the old state of things will not come again, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> refuses to build good houses, make
large gardens, and make the best of the new surroundings—he is without ambition because
without hope, and when sickness comes he does not seem to care.</p>
<p class="p ">4. Again a lower percentage of births lessen the population.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Weakened bodies is one cause
of this.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another reason is that women refuse to bear children, and take means to save themselves
from motherhood.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They give as the reason that if “war” should come a woman “big with
child,” or with a baby to carry, cannot well run away and hide from the soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Confidence will
no doubt, be restored, but it grows but slowly.</p>
<p class="p ">There are two points in connection with the “war” (so-called):—</p>
<p class="p "><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(1.) The cause.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(2.) The manner in which it was conducted.</p>
<p class="p ">(1.) The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> never had obeyed any other man than their own Chiefs.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Leopold II</span>
became their King they were not aware of the fact, nor had they any hand in the making
of the
new arrangement.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Demands were made on them, and they did not understand why they
should obey the stranger.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of the demands were not excessive, but others were simply
impossible.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">G H* people</span> and the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">O* group of towns</span> large demands of rubber
were made.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There was not much within their reach, and it was a dangerous thing to be a
stranger in a strange part of the forests.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">O* people</span> offered to pay a monthly tribute of
goats, fowls, &amp;c., but <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M. N O</span> would have rubber, so they left.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">G H*</span> had to bear the
scourge of war frequently and many were killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now they supply what they probably would
have supplied without the loss of one person, kwanga and fresh meats, and roofing
materials and
mats.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rubber was demanded from some others and war resulted.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These are now providing
the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> with fish and fowls.</p>
<p class="p ">Another fertile source of war lay in the actions of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native soldiers</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Generally speaking
their statements against other <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> were received as truth that needed no support.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take the
following as an example:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One morning it was reported that <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">State soldiers</span> had shot several
people near the channel leading from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">H K*</span> to the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several canoes full of manioc had
been also seized, and the friends of the dead and owners of two of the canoes asked
that they
might have the canoes and food, and that they might take the bodies and bury them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But
this was refused.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was alleged the people were shot in the act of deserting from the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">State</span> into
<span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">French</span> territory</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Chief who was shot was actually returning from having gone with a
message from <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M. O P</span> to a village, and was killed east of the camp and of his home, while
“<span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">France</span>”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lay to the west.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers said that the people had been challenged to stop and
that they refused, and that they had been shot as they paddled away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But really they had
landed when called by the soldiers; they had been tied hand and foot, and then shot.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One
woman had struggled when shot, and had broken the vines with which her feet were tied,
and
she, though wounded, tried to escape.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second bullet made her fall, but yet she rose and ran
a few steps, when a third bullet laid her low.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their hands had all been taken off—i.e., the
right hand of each—for evidence of the faithfulness of the soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M. O P</span> shot two of the
soldiers, but the leader of the party was not shot, though the whole matter was carried
through
by him, and he it was that gave <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M. O P</span> the false report.</p>
<p class="p ">A Chief complained that certain soldiers had taken his wives and had stolen all of
his
belongings that they cared to have.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He made no complaint against the “tax” that the soldiers
had gone there to secure, but told of the cruelty and oppression of the soldiers carried
on for
their own gain.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white officer</span> kicked him off the verandah and said that he told many lies.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
The Chief turned round with fury written on his face, stood silently looking at the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white
man</span>, and then stalked off; two days later there was a report that all the soldiers with

<p class="p ">After the rubber demand was withdrawn, in some places labour was demanded.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A very large

They returned here on the third day.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nearly every week there were complaints made that
someone’s wife had been kept by a soldier, and when it was suggested that the husband
should himself go and report the matter to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>, they would reply:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We dare not.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<p class="p ">When this matter was reported to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">M. N O</span>, he was angry, and called the Chief a “brigand,”
and said that he would be punished.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For numerous offences he was put “on the chain,” and some

<p class="p ">In most of the fights then the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> were merely trying to defend themselves and their
homes from attacks made on them by <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">black soldiers</span> sent to “punish them for some failure to
do their duty to the State;” and if the cause for war was weak, the way in which it

village without a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white officer</span> accompanying them, so that there was nothing to keep them
from awful excesses.</p>

If one in fifty of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> reports are true, there has been great lack on the part of some

home, and they went home, and then we, too, came out of the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was the first fight.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
After that another fighting took place.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I, my mother, grandmother, and my sister,
we ran away into the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers came and fought us, and left the town and followed
us into the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers came into the bush near us they were calling my

to stop
me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they went to another side, and then we left that place and went to another.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When

been killed
then.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A great number of our people were killed by the soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The friends who were left
buried the dead bodies, and there was very much weeping.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that there was not any fighting
for some time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the soldiers came again to fight with us, and we ran into the bush, but they
really came to fight with <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">M M*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They killed a lot of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">M M*</span> people</span>, and then one soldier came
out to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">K K*</span>, and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">K K*</span> people</span> killed him with a spear.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And when the other soldiers
heard that their friend was killed they came in a large number and followed us into
the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Then the soldiers fired a gun, and some people were killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that they saw a little bit of
my mother’s head, and the soldiers ran quickly towards the place where we were and
caught my
grandmother, my mother, my sister, and another little one, younger than us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several of the
soldiers argued about my mother, because each wanted her for a wife, so they finally
decided to
kill her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They killed her with a gun—they shot her through the stomach—and she fell, and
when I saw that I cried very much, because they killed my mother and grandmother,
and I was
left alone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My mother was near to the time of her confinement at that time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And they killed my
grandmother too, and I saw it all done.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They took hold of my sister and asked where her older
sister was, and she said: “She has just run away.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They said, “Call her.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She called me, but I was
too frightened and would not answer, and I ran and went away and came out at another
place,
and I could not speak much because my throat was very sore.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I saw a little bit kwanga lying
on the ground and I picked it up to eat.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At that place there used to be a lot of people, but when
I got there there were none.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My sister was taken to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">P*</span>, and I was at this place alone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One
day I saw a man coming from the back country.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He was going to kill me, but afterwards he
took me to a place where there were people, and there I saw my step-father<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He asked to buy me from this man, but the man would not let him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He said, “She is my slave
now; I found her.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One day the men went out fishing, and when I looked I saw the soldiers
coming, so I ran away, but a string caught my foot and I fell, and a soldier named

went out to the next town to wait for the soldiers to fight them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of the men stayed behind

ran away by himself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The oldest boys had gone away to wait for the soldiers at the other town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
As she went past she heard her mother calling to her, but she told her to run away
in another
direction, and she would go on with the little sister.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She found her little sister rather heavy for
her, so she could not run very fast, and a great number of people went past her, and
she was left
alone with the little one.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then she left the main road and went to hide in the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When
night came on she tried to find the road again and follow the people who had passed
her, but she
could not find them, so she had to sleep in the bush alone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She wandered about in the bush for
six days, then she came upon a town named <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">S S*</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At this town she found that the soldiers
were fighting there too.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Before entering the town she dug up some sweet manioc to eat, because
she was very, very hungry.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She went about looking for a fire to roast her sweet manioc, but
she could not find any.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then she heard a noise as of people talking, so she hid her little sister in
a deserted house, and went to see those people she had heard talking, thinking they
might be
those from her own town, but when she got to the house where the noise was coming
from she
saw one of the soldier’s boys sitting at the door of the house, and then also she
could not quite
understand their language, so she knew that they were not her people, so she took
fright and ran
away in another direction from where she had put her sister.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After she had reached the outside
of the town she stood still, and remembered that she would be scolded by her father
and mother
for leaving her sister, so she went back at night.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She came upon a house where the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>
was sleeping; she saw the sentry on a deck chair outside in front of the house, apparently
asleep,
because he did not see her slip past him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then she came to the house where her sister was, and
took her, and she started to run away again.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They slept in a deserted house at the very end of
the town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> sent out the soldiers to go and look for people all
over the town and in the houses.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S</span> was standing outside in front of the house, trying to
make her sister walk some, as she was very tired, but the little sister could not
run away through
weakness.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While they were both standing outside the soldiers came upon them and took them
both.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the soldiers said: “We might keep them both, the little one is not bad-looking;”
but the others said “No, we are not going to carry her all the way; we must kill the
youngest
girl.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So they put a knife through the child’s stomach, and left the body lying there where
they
had killed it.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They took <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S</span> to the next town, where the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> had told them to go and fight.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
They did not go back to the house where the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span> was, but went straight on to the next

<p class="p ">In the morning the soldiers wanted <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S</span> to go and look for manioc for them, but she was
afraid to go out as they looked to her as if they wanted to kill her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers thrashed her very
much, and began to drag her outside, but the corporal (<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">N N N</span>) came and took her by the hand and
said, “We must not kill her; we must take her to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white man</span>.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they went back to the

she went to do as he had told her, and those <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">cannibal soldiers</span> went to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">C D</span> and said that
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S</span> was trying to run away, so they wanted to kill her; but he told them to tie her,
so the

had charge of her came back he found her tied up.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">C D</span> called to him to ask about <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S</span>,
so he explained to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">C D</span> what he had told <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S</span> to do, so he was allowed to untie her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They

about, and she said yes, then he told her to show them the way, so that they could

soldiers killed her with a knife.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At several towns they found no people, but at last they came to

A lot of people—she thinks perhaps fifty—ran away, and she was in the crowd with them,

had scattered when the soldiers came, but she stayed with the big people, thinking

be safe.</p>
<p class="p ">When they were all killed she waited in the grass for two nights.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She was very frightened,
and her throat was sore with thirst, and she looked about and at last she found some
water in a

very
frightened—and they went away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the morning came she thought she would be better to
move, and went away and got up a tree.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She was three days without food, and was very hungry.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
In the tree she was near her grandmother’s house, and she looked around and, seeing
no soldiers,
she crept to her grandmother’s house and got some food and got up the tree again.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
soldiers had gone away hunting for buffaloes, and it was then she was able to get
down from the
tree.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers came back, and they came towards the trees and bushes calling out: s
“Now we see you; come down, come down!”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This they used to do, so that people, thinking
they were really discovered, should give themselves up; but she thought she would
stay on, and
so she stayed up the tree.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Soon afterwards the soldiers went, but she was still afraid to come
down.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Presently she heard her grandmother calling out to know if she was alive, and when
she
heard her grandmother’s voice she knew the soldiers were gone, and she answered, but
her voice
was very small—and she came down and her grandmother took her home.</p>

made a noise,
