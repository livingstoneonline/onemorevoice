<p rend="center">&#8211;&#8212;&#8212;&#9670;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>We have received files of papers from the <region>Cape of 
Good Hope</region> to the <date when="1855-11-01">1st of November</date> inclusive.</p> 
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Friend of the <region>Free State</region></hi> publishes the 
follow<!-- - -->ing report of a conference between the President, <persName>J. 
N. Boshoff, Esq.</persName>, and the <term type="collective">Basuta</term> Chief, <persName>Moshesh</persName>, <persName>his 
Excellency Sir George Grey</persName> being present. It took 
place on the <date when="1855-10-05">5th of October last</date> :&#8212;</p>
<p>"The President.&#8212;I am very glad to see <persName>Moshesh</persName> here in <!-- Adrian, not sure if "The President" should be tagged throughout this as persName? HB -->
the presence of <persName>his Excellency Sir G. Grey</persName>, on the first
official opportunity we have had of meeting in the <region>Free 
State</region>. I think it well that we should often meet, as 
per<!-- - -->sonal visits are always much more satisfactory than 
corre<!-- - -->spondence by letter. As we meet now personally we had 
better speak of business. I have often heard that <persName>Moshesh</persName> 
is a man of peace and is desirous of holding peace with the 
<term type="collective">whites</term>. I am also a man of peace, and now in the presence 
of his chief men I wish to show him on what terms we may 
make peace and friendship continue. As the best mode <choice><sic>t o</sic><corr>to</corr></choice> 
do so my view is that, as I am chosen on one side, and 
<persName>Moshesh</persName> on the other, to see that peace is not interrupted, 
we should, in case any disturbances occur, let each other 
know our minds freely. I shall therefore tell him at 
once that I have, on my arrival, been very sorry to hear 
of many thefts having been committed within our 
boun<!-- - -->dary by wicked people from the other side. I would be 
glad to convince him that such things must be put a stop to, 
or the consequences will be that they will put the country 
in a blaze, and do great harm to all. These are all the 
com<!-- - -->plaints I know of as yet. <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> has already represented 
the case to him, and he has promised to punish the thieves, 
and put a stop to the stealing. I have no doubt that he 
will prove himself a man of his word, and make his chiefs 
help him to carry out his promises.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Peace is the mother of all. I admire what 
your Honour has mentioned. I would be glad to hear any <!-- Honour persName? HB -->
remarks of <persName>Mr. Ford</persName>'s in confirmation.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;We will await your answer.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;If no one else speaks it may appear as if these 
were the words of only two people.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;I am the representative of all my people, 
and my word is theirs also. I wish to hear the mind of 
<term type="collective"><persName>Moshesh</persName>'s people</term> through him as their chief.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;May the things we speak of ascend to 
heaven! My mind looks on the two personages present as 
the first fruits of a new year. I do not mind faults being 
mentioned, but I understood this to be a meeting of 
friend<!-- - -->ship. I met <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> about the faults now brought 
for<!-- - -->ward. I do not deny that some of the things have gone in 
our direction. I do not know the best means of stopping 
these things. What has the Governor come for? Has he <!-- Governor persName? HB -->
been sent by his master? Is there not a word of advice 
and wisdom? I cannot bear the weight of all. You come 
from the land of <persName>Chaka</persName>. If you have not seen him, you 
may have seen prints of him. He was ruined by his 
rela<!-- - -->tions. You have wisdom to build beautiful houses of clay. 
We got all we have from the <term type="collective">whites</term> ; can we not make 
some plan by which we can enjoy what we have and keep 
peace? <persName>Dr. Philip</persName> wrote to the <orgName><term type="collective">English</term> Government</orgName> when 
we were in trouble, and it assisted us. The complaints 
have not been sufficiently established. If you can show 
me the cause of dissatisfaction let me know. There I end.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;I will take him up at the last word. The 
cause he must know, but the way is this,&#8212;his people come 
in and steal. The missionaries have been long enough in 
the country for them to know that stealing is wrong. I 
be<!-- - -->lieve that <persName>Moshesh</persName> has enough good men among his people 
to help him to put down the wicked men who steal. I am 
glad to hear that he wishes to get advice.  I want it also. If 
we can both get advice, I, for my part, am ready to take it, 
and be guided by it. If he is willing to take advice from
his Excellency, I am also. I will state the cause of <!-- Excellency persName? HB -->
com<!-- - -->plaint, and if he has any. I hope that he will state any he 
may have, and then if I can I will remove it. I will tell 
him clearly in as few words as possible what we complain 
of. The thefts commnitted in <region><persName>Mr. Ford</persName>'s district</region> within two 
years, as carefully collected by him from the field-cornets, 
amount to 297 head of breeding <term type="animal">cattle</term>.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I have already agreed with <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> that I 
was convinced that some <term type="animal">cattle</term> had been stolen, and I have 
made him promises. Can you not give me some advice?</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;If <persName>Moshesh</persName> will listen I will just tell him the 
numbers.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;It is just what I wanted.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;<term type="animal">Oxen</term> and breeding <term type="animal">cattle</term> together, 363;
<term type="animal">horses</term>, 294 ; <term type="animal">sheep</term>, 112. I was not satisfied with the simple 
returns of the field-cornets, and have instructed <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> 
to get statements on oath from the owners of stolen <term type="animal">cattle</term>. 
This is not yet completed, but is considerable. Since the 
numbers in the statement of the field-cornets have been 
ascertained many more <term type="animal">cattle</term> have been stolen. When the 
full amount is ascertained I will let <persName>Moshesh</persName> know. I do 
not want to do anything unjust. I will examine the list 
myself, and find out those for which <persName>Moshesh</persName> is 
answer<!-- - -->able, and when this number has been ascertained I 
will tell <persName>Moshesh</persName>. I have now ordered the <term type="collective">Landdrosts</term> <!-- Not sure what Landdrosts is enough to code? HB -->
to send in monthly returns of stolen <term type="animal">cattle</term>, with all 
the particulars of the theft, instead of allowing the list 
to accumulate for two years. I will tell him also that it is
not only from <region><persName>Mr. Ford</persName>'s district</region> that complaints are 
made. I have received reports also from <persName>Mr. Orpen</persName> that 
thefts of <term type="animal">horses</term> are committed on the <region><settlement>Winburg</settlement> border</region>. 
Some of the <term type="animal">horses</term> have been found with <persName>Molitsani</persName>, and 
some have been given up ; others he refuses to return, 
unless the owners come to fetch them. This must not be. 
My people cannot be put to such expenses. He ought to 
have sent the stolen <term type="animal">horses</term> and thieves to <settlement>Winburg</settlement>, where 
they would have been punished by us. Stealing will 
never cease, unless the thieves are punished. Retaking 
stolen <term type="animal">cattle</term> from the thief is no punishment. He ought 
also to be fined or receive corporal punishment. If the 
chief refuses to give up the thief he makes himself 
responsible. We put thieves in prison, and punish them 
when convicted. If he did so we would not have any 
more stealing. He need not tell me that he has no power 
to punish those who do wrong, for if they can retake the 
stolen <term type="animal">cattle</term> they can punish the thief also. It is 
com<!-- - -->plained that <persName>Molitsani</persName> harbours <term type="collective">Bushmen</term> and other thieves ; 
also, that <persName>Letsela</persName> occupies the lands of the farmers and 
makes gardens there. These are the very people whom 
<persName>Moshesh</persName> promised <persName>Hoffman</persName> to remove <date when="1854-01">last January</date>. 
<term type="collective"><persName>Molapa</persName>'s people</term> have also encroached, and <persName>Molapa</persName>, though 
he has promised to remove them, has not done so. I 
mention these things to show that they give rise to 
quarrels. My people will not submit to it any longer. 
Now, as he has asked my advice, I say that if his people 
will not obey him he must make them. He must take 
his people against them. Those things that they should not 
wish us to do he must not do. He would not be 
satis<!-- - -->fied if I said I could not help such things, if committed 
by my people. I know that they can do it, because 
some<!-- - -->times for months long no thefts were committed ; so, if they 
could stop the thieving once, they could do so again, and 
there are other chiefs who never steal. I conclude, 
there<!-- - -->fore, that those chiefs who will exercise their power can stop
stealing.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Can the names of those chiefs not be given?</p> 
<p>"President.&#8212;<persName>Moroko</persName>, <persName>Jan Bloem</persName>, <persName>Lepui</persName>, <persName>Adam Kok</persName>, 
and <persName>Waterboer</persName>.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;You mention those things, his Excellency 
being present. We must remember that we are on a 
friendly visit. Your honour must remember that you have
been only a short time in the country. The <term type="collectice">Landdrost</term> and 
I, who have long lived here, know better. The sword of 
the mouth is grievous. We had better not speak so, but 
separate in peace, as we have met in peace.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;I think the best way to secure peace is that 
friends meet and speak their minds. I have stated all I 
have to say, and I want <persName>Moshesh</persName> to state any grievances he 
has to speak about.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Not to-day.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;Very good ; I shall always be happy to hear 
from him about anything that is done wrong by my people, 
as war would only break us all down ; but if there is any 
other thing, as his Excellency is present, of which he feels 
aggrieved, I should be glad to hear it.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Not to-day.  Let us go home.  We can 
cor<!-- - -->respond by letter.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;Would he like his Excellency to give us
some advice?</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;It is not the proper day. His Excellency is 
not here to hear difficulties. We can correspond by letter.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;I thought <persName>Moshesh</persName> would wish it.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;Advice to a chief ought to be given in 
pri<!-- - -->vate, and not in public.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;When occasion is urgent we seize the first 
opportunity of meeting, and, if <persName>Moshesh</persName> postpones the 
con<!-- - -->ference on these urgent matters, some accident may occur, 
for which we may be sorry before we meet again.  It may 
be long before we can meet again ; it may not be easy for us 
to do so.  We can write, but we may not understand each 
other so well as by conversing.  I have therefore spoken to 
him in his Excellency's presence, in order that he might give 
us some advice, and that we might profit by it ; and it would 
be a satisfaction to go home with the mutual conviction of 
having come to an understanding to correct what has been 
wrong.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I did not expect that the matters already 
settled with <persName>Mr. Ford</persName>, and to whom I have already given an 
answer, would be touched upon ; and I have also given a 
paper to <persName>Mr. Venter</persName>, that people suffering from thefts 
should be sent to me. I am ready to hear advice.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;I know nothing of <persName>Mr. Venter</persName>'s 
arrange<!-- - -->ment.  He had no right to make one. I was then in the 
country.  Such a proposal as yours, that we should go into 
your country and search for our property, could never be 
entertained.  <persName>Mr. Venter</persName> was appointed with three others. 
The directions given by all to <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> were good, and 
ought not to have been broken by one.  If I was to send my
people in that way into your country, it would only make 
disputes, and break our friendships.</p>
<p>"Mosheh,&#8212;I did not come to speak of business.</p>
<p>"There seemed to be some misinterpretation of the 
Chief's meaning in this last sentence, which had been 
inter<!-- - -->preted in English by <persName>Nehemiah</persName>, <persName>Moshesh</persName>'s son.</p>
<p>"<persName>His Excellency Sir George Grey</persName> then asked the <persName>Rev. 
Mr. Arbousset</persName>, who was acting as interpreter, whether he 
thought <persName>Moshesh</persName> would like to hear what he thought he 
ought to do.</p>
<p>"<persName>Mr. Arbousset</persName> replying in the affirmative, His 
Excel<!-- - -->lency addressed <persName>Moshesh</persName> as follows:&#8212;You say that we are
wise people in being able to build beautiful houses of clay ; 
a man who does that is respected by others, but a man 
who raises barbarians in the scale of civilization is admired 
by ages.  You are now the builder.  You have collected 
some barbarians and made a kind of nation.  The question 
now is whether you are to succeed or fail.  Not only is 
<country>South Africa</country> looking on, but many other parts of the world 
too. Every good man is willing to assist ; no one more so 
than the President.  I have had an opportunity of hearing 
his views, and I am sure he is anxious to help <persName>Mosheh</persName> to 
succeed. It is impossible that a civilized nation can allow
a nation of thieves to remain on their boundary. The
President and I are ready to put them down. I would be
glad to see you more cordial to accept the President's offers 
than you have seemed to be ; and, as I am now going away 
for a considerable time, I should be glad to be certain that 
I would devise some plan for the future. In such a plan 
I will assist as far as the Cape colonial boundary is concerned. 
It must be greatly owing to your own energy that you have 
raised yourself to the position you now hold, and I would 
advise you to trust to that energy in future, and not to bad 
advisers. I trust that before I leave you will give some proofs 
that you will put down stealing, and allow your tribe to 
prosper. I am sure the President's remarks will be 
appre<!-- - -->ciated ; I have been particularly struck with their justness.
I hope before I leave that you will promise to put an end to 
such practices as those that have been carried on.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;We ought to praise his Excellency for his 
words, though we were not aware, when called to visit, that 
such things would have been brought forward.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;If he is not prepared to speak on business, 
will he appoint another meeting, or will he go home and 
consider, and acquaint me with the result, and in the 
mean<!-- - -->time try with his chiefs to put a stop to stealing? <choice><sic>or</sic><corr>Or</corr></choice>

<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;When I met <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> at <persName>Sefali</persName>'s I made an 
agreement with him that he should make a list of stolen 
<term type="animal">cattle</term>, with the particulars of theft, in order that I could 
call on the guilty chiefs, and show them the accusations 
against them.</p>
<p>"<persName>Mr. Ford</persName> explained that the list was in the course of 
formation.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName> expressed himself satisfied, and said that the 
measures adopted to settle the thefts on the list would go 
towards stopping any future thefts.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;Will the chief give me some promise that 
he and his chiefs will endeavour to put a stop to any 
future thieving, or else the lists will only continue to in<!--<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>-</corr></choice>--> 
crease?</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I cannot bind myself to say that there will 
be no more stealing ; thieves do not tell me when they 
come in or go out.  Did I not at the meeting with <persName>Ford</persName>, 
at <persName>Sefali</persName>'s, tell my people they must not even steal a <term type="animal">goat</term>? 
You must give me time. I have eaten the Governor's 
meat, and it will be easy for me to vomit it up, but it is 
not so easy to make thieves disgorge what they have stolen.</p>
<p>"Presdent.&#8212;I praise <persName>Moshesh</persName> for the manner in which 
he met <persName>Mr. Ford</persName>.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;The sooner the papers are ready the better. 
I will make my report on them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;I will now go away satisfied. I shall 
always be very glad, with him, to remove all difficulties, as 
long as we remain in the same situations.</p>
<p>"<persName>Moshesh</persName>.&#8212;I feel as you do. I came to bring some 
words to my people. Peace and tranquillity by all means! 
They are the only things to be relied on. It must be the 
wishes of both. We must by patience overcome evil.</p>
<p>"President.&#8212;I am very glad to hear what he says, and I 
will remember his words.</p>
<p>"His Excellency the Governor.&#8212;Work away building 
this house."</p> 
<p>We have also received additional files of papers 
from the <region>Cape of Good Hope</region> to the 
<date when="1855-11-25">25th of Novem<!-- - -->ber</date>.  Everything was going on prosperously at the 
colony.</p>
