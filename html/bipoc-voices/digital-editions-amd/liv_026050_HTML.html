  <h5 style="text-align:center;">Sick and Dying Christians in Yoruba</h5>
  <p> The Rev. T. B. Wright, Native Pastor of the Faji Church,
    Lagos, writes:&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">Two of our members have been removed by death this
    year: one, Phebe
    John, the wife of the late Mr. John, a Scripture reader at Ibadan; and
    the other is Daniel Tambariki, a very popular man here, as well as at
    Abeokuta. He is famous at Abeokuta for deeds of bravery in war. At
    Lagos he shall be long remembered by both the heathen and Mohammedan population of the town, who
    all got to be familiar with
    him, by his untiring anxiety to get them all, if possible, under the saving
    knowledge of God. He reckoned it a duty incumbent on him to be going
    from house to house (without being particularly asked), throughout the
    days of the week when his business would allow, and also on Sundays, in
    the mornings and afternoons before service hours, telling the people the
    great folly there is in remaining in heathenism, whilst God has sent a
    light to them to better their immortal souls; showing them they could
    not be as happy as he was, as no other religion in this life can make one
    happy as the Christian religion. He was a man, although austere in
    appearance, yet amicable in disposition, so that he was much beloved, and
    was deeply lamented by all, both heathen and Christian. He was an
    Egba, of Igbore tribe, and on embracing Christianity was so persecuted
    by his relatives, and the authorities of his tribe, that he escaped hither,
    and the Rev. C. A. Gollmer allowed him to reside in the Mission compound, where he was with his
    family for a long time. During this later
    years he was sorely afflicted in his family circle by the deaths of his wife
    and eldest son, which occurred one year after another, and he only outlived
    the last for a year.</p>
