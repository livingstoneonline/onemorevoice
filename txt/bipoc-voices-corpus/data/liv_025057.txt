II.—Madagascar.
FROM the engraving which we give in our present number, and which has been copied from a photograph, a correct idea may be formed of the plain and village of ANALAKELY, a northern suburb of the Capital of Madagascar. The church and district are under the charge of four native ordained pastors, assisted by a large staff of native preachers. The church member number some 6,500, and there are forty-five elementary schools in the district. The superintending missionary is the Rev. GEORGE COUSINS.
The chief item of intelligence from Madagascar which has reached England during the past month has called forth from all friends of liberty and progress a thrill of devout satisfaction and thankfulness. At a Kabary held in the capital on the 20th of June, freedom and protection were granted by the Malagasy Government to all Mozambique slaves at that time in the island, and such traffic in future was entirely prohibited. The PROCLAMATION read by the PRIME MINISTER at Andohalo, printed copies of which had previously been circulated by thousands through the length and breadth of the land, is far too extended to be quoted in full in our pages. From the authorised translation of the address, with which we have been favoured, a few passages have, however, been selected, and which may be fitly introduced by the following summary of the document as a whole, furnished by the Rev. R. TOY:—
"The speech itself was most skilfully arranged, and, from a Malagasy point of view, could not have been more successful. The Prime Minister spoke for about an hour, not confining himself to the written address which he held in his hand, but enforcing it by extempore speech. He gave the people an account of their former sovereigns, and showed them the great importance these attached to fulfilling treaty obligations. Then, coming down to the time of Rasoherina, when the English treaty was made, he reminded them that she had not concluded the treaty on her own responsibility, but had consulted them before its completion. This treaty, made in the time of Rasoherina, could not be set aside by Ranavalona, but must be upheld by her, as her successor and substitute, including the clauses referring to the importation of Mozambique slaves. Therefore, hearing that these were imported into the country, and concealed until they knew the language, she, in 1874, ordered the release of all who had been introduced into the country since the time that the English treaty was signed. Yet, notwithstanding, her word had been set aside, and only here and there one had been set at liberty. Not only so, but the trade in Mozambiques was still being carried on, though they are well known to have been stolen from their country. Now, however, not only those who have been brought here since the signing of the treaty, but all Mozambiques, however long they have been in the country, must be set free. This is the substance of what he said; but neither from this, nor from an English translation, will you be able to realise the full force which it has in its Malagasy form, or the effect which it produced here. But the main strength of the address rests upon the fact that it was understood, and intended to be understood, as meaning all that it said. It is seen clearly now that the Prime Minister is in earnest in the matter, and that any one refusing to liberate a single slave known to be African origin will do so at his own peril. Special emphasis was put upon this, that, whether the person belonged to the higher or lower ranks of society, if he refuse to obey the word of the Queen at this Kabary he would be held guilty, and suffer even the punishment of death for the offence."
2. THE QUEEN'S PROCLAMATION.
The Proclamation is divided into five sections, and is addressed "to the assembled people at
Andohalo, and published throughout the Kingdom of Madagascar on the 20th of June (11 Alakaosy),
1877." The following is the text of the concluding clauses of Section V. :—
"Now, the kingdom having been given by God to me, I declare that I will put a stop to these
evils, for I am a Sovereign tsy mba tia vezovezo (who hates disturbance or
quarrelsomeness).
"Therefore I decree that I set free all the Mozambiques in my kingdom to be my Ambaniandro
(subjects), whether those newly introduced or those who have been here for a long time. For it
is not so! ye under heave?
"And if there is any one who will not obey this edict, but still holds the Mozambiques as
slaves, I shall count such as criminals, and the penalty of the laws shall be enforced upon
them. For is it not so! Oh, ye under heaven?
"And I also decree that whoever has traded in Mozambiques can no longer make a legal claim in
respect of such transactions. And should such take place, he that makes such a claim shall be
held guilty. For is it not so! ye under heaven?
"And if this decree of mine is perverted by any one to deceive the wise or incite the simple,
and so cause disturbances in my kingdom, then whoever he may be I will hold him guilty, and
condemn him to death, for I am a Sovereign that will not deceive.
"Again I declare unto you, ye under heaven, that whoever obeys the laws of
Andrianampoinimerina, and alters not the decrees of Lehidama, Rabodonandrianampoinimerina, and
Rasoherimanjaka and especially observes my own decrees, for I, Queen Ranavalomanjaka, am heir to
these who reigned before me, then rest assured that I am the protector of your wives, your
children, and your property; and when I say trust me then rest assured. For is it not so! ye
under heaven?"
