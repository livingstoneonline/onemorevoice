  <p>We have received the Journal of Mr.
    C. Sandreczki to the end of March. It
    appears that the Turkish Government,
    supported by its Christian subjects, who
    are unwilling to bear any longer with the
    tyranny and extortions of their ecclesiastical
    leaders, is energetically endeavoring
    to check the spirit of avarice and oppression
    which has characterized the proceedings
    of the Greek and Armenian Patriarchs,
    and their subordinates, a result which it is
    seeking to accomplish in a manner which
    would not be discreditable to a Christian
    Government. Measures of this description, if successful in their results, may exercise an
    Influence on the Missionary cause, which,
    If ever so indirect, ought to be well watched and diligently improved; because, as Mr.
    Sandreczki says, "It becomes more and
    more evident that Mahomedanism at large
    will be vanquished by the reformation of
    the Eastern Churches." He then proceeds
    to say&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-right: 5%;margin-left: 5%">Just as the struggle against the letter of
    indulgence formed the prelude to our reformation,
    so the Sultan's procedure against
    the abuses of the Patriarchs may be the preliminary
    step toward the same end; for it
    has already called forth a hitherto unheard-of
    excitement amongst the laity, who are henceforth
    to bear a more equal, or even preponderating
    share in the administration of worldly
    affairs. By little and little they may be
    carried on, through the combat of worldly
    interests, to that of higher ones in search of
    truth; and then they will learn to value that
    liberty of conscience, which the chief of the
    orthodox Mussulmans has granted to his
    Christian subjects.</p>
  <p>Mr. Sandreczki, in a Letter dated April
    19, 1849, mentions some interesting particulars
    as to the progress of inquiry
    amongst the members of these Eastern
    Churches&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-right: 5%;margin-left: 5%">The American Missionaries kindly communicate
    to us the almost daily progress of
    spiritual or religious agitation among the Armenians
    and Nestorians. Highly-interesting
    details have of late come to our hearing. At
    A'indab (Syria) and Urumia&#8212;and these even
    among Bishops&#8212;the minds of the people are
    roused to great emotion. It is as if the dawning
    of revival were coming on; and I venture
    to say that Mr. Wolters' Greek Sermons, too,
    have already begun to stir up the minds of a
    few persons of the Greek community here.
    O for faith and perseverance now! O Lord,
    spread Thy table for the Mahomedans and
    Christians in this wilderness!</p>
  <p>In his Journal of Feb. 14 he adds&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-right: 5%;margin-left: 5%">Some forty Greeks of Broosa are already
    said to have separated from their Church on
    account of the extortions of their Bishop.
    The particulars of this case are still unknown
    to us. However, if the little we have heard
    of it prove true, the blow will be smartly felt
    by the Greek Clergy; and the example of the
    Protestant Armenians, the first-fruits of the
    indefatigable efforts of our American brethren,
    will be followed up more extensively; so that
    we may expect to see the beginning of a
    foreign-bred reformation converted into the
    more powerful advances of a native reformation.</p>
  <p>The Rev. J. Bowen, late of Knaresborough,
    having proceeded, at his own expense,
    to Syria, for the purpose of investigating
    the state of its population, and
    the opportunities which may exist of affording
    to them instruction in the pure Gospel,
    has reached Smyrna in safety, accompanied
    by Mr. Schwartz.</p>
  <p>In Mr. Sandreczki's Journal we find the
    following reference&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-right: 5%;margin-left: 5%"><em>March 25: Lord's-day.</em>&#8212;Mr. Bowen preached
    this morning at Boujah from Rom. xii. 1.
    He carries along with him a full load of spiritual
    refreshments from godly old England,
    which, to us pilgrims through, and sojourners
    in, the desert places, are powerful restorative&#8212;a
    breath of revival.</p>
