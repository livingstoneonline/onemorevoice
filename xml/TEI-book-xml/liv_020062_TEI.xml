<p>By the Indiana we have advices from <settlement>Cape 
Town</settlement> to the <date when="1853-01-24">24th of January</date>, 39 days later 
than those by the <persName>Lady Jocelyn</persName>, which left on 
the <date when="1852-12-16">16th of December</date> and reached <settlement>Plymouth</settlement> on 
the <date when="1853-01-24">24th of January</date>. <persName>General Cathcart</persName>, with 
2,000 men, had then entered the <region><geogName>Orange River</geogName> 
Sovereignty</region> to settle disputes between the 
powerful <term type="collective"><term type="collective">Basuta</term> chief</term>, <persName>Moshesh</persName>, and the <term type="collective"><region><w>Sove<!-- - -->reignty</w></region> 
farmers</term>, on the subject of plundered <term type="animal">cattle</term>. 
<persName>Assistant-Commissioners <persName>Hogge</persName> and <persName>Owen</persName></persName> had 
previously investigated the whole case, and decided 
that certain fines should be paid by delinquents of 
all classes and complexion. The fine imposed on 
<persName>Moshesh</persName> was never paid, and <persName>General Cathcart</persName>, under 
date <date when="1852-12-13">December 13</date>, demanded of that chief, within 
three days, 10,000 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term> and 1,000 <term type="animal">horses</term>, 
and, in default, threatened to take them himself or 
make reprisals. <persName>Moshesh</persName> came into the camp the 
next day and had a "parley" with the Governor. 
On the <date when="1852-12-18">18th</date> <persName>Moshesh</persName>'s son, <persName>Nehemiah</persName>, came in 
with 3,500 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term>.</p>

<p>On the <date when="1852-12-19">19th</date> no more <term type="animal">cattle</term> appearing, <persName>Lieutenant- 
Colonel Eyre</persName>, with the cavalry brigade, two guns, 
and one brigade of Infantry, encamped on the 
<region><geogName>Upper Caledon</geogName> Waggon Drift</region>, leading to <region><persName>Molitsani</persName>'s 
country</region>. On the <date when="1852-12-20">20th</date> this force, accompanied by His 
Excellency in person, marched at daylight in three 
columns. The force consisted of&#8212;</p>

<p><orgName>Detachment of 12th Lancers</orgName>, under <persName>Lieutenant 
Gough</persName>.</p>

<p>A demi-battery of 12-pounder howitzers, under 
<persName>Captain Robinson, R. A.</persName></p>

<p>Two companies of the <orgName>43d Regiment</orgName>, under <persName>Major 
Phillips</persName>.</p>

<p><orgName>Detachment of Cape Mounted Rifles</orgName>, under <persName><w>En<!-- - -->sign</w> 
Rorke</persName>.</p>

<p>According to <persName>Colonel Cloete</persName>'s official despatch, the 
<term type="collective">Basutos</term>, to defend their vast droves of <term type="animal">cattle</term>, first
fired on him and <persName>Captain Tylden</persName>. An attempt at 
parley by the Governor was answered by a shot, 
when two rounds of shrapnel caused the enemy to 
fly from the southern angle of the <geogName>Berea</geogName> towards 
<geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossigo</orig><reg>Thaba Bosiu</reg></choice></geogName>. The despatch proceeds:&#8212;</p> 

<p rend="small">"The infantry, strengthened by a company of the <orgName>43d 
regiment</orgName>, under <persName>Captain the Hon. Percy Herbert</persName>, were 
now brought up, and the column advanced, crossed the deep 
mountain stream '<geogName>Rietspruit</geogName>,' and were posted on a <w>com<!-- - -->manding</w> 
knoll at its junction with the <geogName>Little Caledon 
River</geogName><choice><sic>)</sic><corr/></choice> on the <region><geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossigo</orig><reg>Thaba Bosiu</reg></choice></geogName> plains</region>, covering the approaches 
by which <persName>Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre</persName> and <persName>Lieutenant-Colonel 
Napier</persName>'s columns were to join.</p> 

<p rend="small">"While in this position the enemy were collecting in 
fresh patches of horsemen in all directions; those <w>approach<!-- - -->ing</w> 
within distance were driven back. On the clearing 
away of a thunderstorm and rain the enemy suddenly <w>dis<!-- - -->played</w> 
his whole force. Masses of horsemen were observed 
to move from the <geogName><geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossigo</orig><reg>Thaba Bosiu</reg></choice></geogName> Poort</geogName> to turn the General's 
right, while large bodies extended along the front. These 
movements were conducted with the utmost order and <w>re<!-- - -->gularity</w>.</p> 

<p rend="small">"<persName>Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre</persName>'s division joined at 5 p.m., 
with 1,500 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term>, which it was necessary to secure, 
for which purpose some kraals in a commanding position 
were ordered to be occupied. The enemy, who had now 
mustered not less than 6,000 horsemen, made every effort to 
assail the troops moving into their bivouac, repeating their 
attacks on front and rear, but were repulsed by the troops. 
The demi-battery, by a round of canister, silenced the 
enemy's fire, which had been kept up till 8 p.m., when they 
disappeared from the field, having suffered severely."</p>

<p rend="no-indent">And says&#8212;</p>

<p rend="small">"Having reached the foot of the <geogName>Berea mountains</geogName>, I <w>ob<!-- - -->served</w> 
the <term type="collective">Basutas</term> drawn up in considerable force. A herd 
of <term type="animal">cattle</term> was presented in view, as if to entice us on, while 
by their war shouts they evidently defied our arms. On 
the right I detached the light company of the <orgName>73d</orgName>, under 
<persName>Lieutenant Gawler</persName>, with directions to climb the krantz 
which commanded the enemy on that side, and, bringing 
his right shoulders forward, to turn the left flank of the 
enemy. I directed the <persName>Hon. L. Curzon</persName> to advance with
the <orgName>Rifle Brigade</orgName>, and ascend the mountain a little on the 
left of the ligit company of the <orgName>73d</orgName>. I moved up <w>simul<!-- - -->taneously</w> 
with the remainder of my force along the regular 
but rugged path which seemed to lead into the centre of the 
enemy's position. The enemy fired and attempted to <w>op<!-- - -->pose</w> 
our progress until we reached the crest of the heights, 
when they instantly dispersed. I pursued them with the 
few mounted men under <persName>Lieutenant Goodrich</persName>, of the 
<orgName>Cape Mounted Rifles</orgName>, and we succeeded in capturing 
at least 30,000 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term>, with many <term type="animal">horses</term> 
having saddles on them. The enemy sustained some 
loss; 38 were killed, and several were found dead; 
and so completely defeated did the enemy appear 
that some were taken prisoners and made to drive back 
their own <term type="animal">cattle</term>. We found it, however, quite impossible, 
with so few mounted men, to drive on such large numbers, 
and in the effort to do so many thousand were driven by the 
few mounted <term type="collective">Fingoes</term> attached to my division down the 
opposite side of the mountain to that which my instructions 
required me to take. I was therefore obliged to abandon 
them and content myself with some 1,500. About 1 o'clock 
p.m. from 200 to 300 mounted men, with white caps and 
lances (which caused us to mistake them for his Excellency's 
escort), suddenly appeared in our front. Before the <w>mis<!-- - -->take</w> 
could be discovered two or three of our party fell into 
their hands, and I deeply regret to state that <persName>Cap<!-- - -->tain 
Faunce</persName>, <orgName>73d Regiment</orgName>, Deputy-Adjutant <w>Quarter<!-- - --> 
master</w>-General, was of that number. The enemy's 
force now rapidly increased, until we were opposed 
to at least 700 or 800 mounted men, who drew up in line 
in admirable order, and attempted to attack our front and 
left flank. As it was necessary to present a front, in order 
to protect our <term type="animal">cattle</term> and baggage, I formed three companies 
in skirmishing order, two in front and one thrown back on 
our left, keeping one in close order in support. The enemy 
charged up to us several times within 200 or 300 yards, but, 
daunted by the coolness and steadiness of the men lying 
down to receive them, dared not to approach nearer. As 
my instruction required me to proceed to <geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bossihgo</orig><reg>Thaba Bosiu</reg></choice></geogName>, I 
directed the <term type="animal">cattle</term> to be driven down a path on my right, 
intending to follow with the remainder of my force. No 
sooner was this discerned by the enemy, than he cheered and 
charged us, on which we halted and reformed in skirmishing 
order, and again repelled him. <persName>Captain the Hon. G. Devereux</persName> 
at the same time made some good shots with the rockets, 
and the result was the total disappearance of the enemy."</p> 

<p><persName>Lieutenant-Colonel G. Napier</persName> states his force to 
have been&#8212;<orgName>12th Lancers</orgName>, 114 rank and file, under 
<persName>Major Tottenham</persName>; <orgName>Cape Mounted Rifles</orgName>, 119, 
under <persName>Major Somerset</persName>, and says, "Having <w>col<!-- - -->lected</w> 
a great number of <term type="animal">cattle</term> I commenced 
driving them down the north-east side of the <geogName>Berea 
mountains</geogName>; when half way down, 700 mounted men 
attacked the rear, who retired. On the open 
ground the Lancers charged, and the enemy fled. 
Near the drift, on the <geogName>Caledon</geogName>, a large body of 
mounted <term type="collective">Caffres</term> were repulsed by the Minie rifles of 
the <orgName>74th Highlanders</orgName>, under <persName>Captain Bruce</persName>."</p> 

<p>In this contest, begun early in the morning of the 
<date when="1852-12-20">20th of December</date>, and not closed until 8 p.m., 
6,000 mounted <term type="collective">Caffres</term> are said to have been <w>en<!-- - -->gaged</w>. 
At the close <persName>Colonel Eyre</persName> had secured 
1,500 and <persName>Colonel Napier</persName> 3,000 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term>.</p> 

<p>The casualties on the part of the <term type="collective">British</term> were 
very severe. Killed&#8212;<persName>Captain Faunce</persName>, <orgName>73d</orgName>, and 
2 privates; <orgName>12th Lancers</orgName>, 4 non-commissioned officers 
and 23 privates; <orgName>Rifles</orgName>, 3 privates; and 5 <orgName>Cape 
Mounted Rifles</orgName>. Wounded&#8212;2 officers, 4 <w>non-commissioned</w> 
officers, and 9 privates. Total&#8212;killed, 
38; wounded, 15.</p> 

<p>This great sacrifice seems, however, to have 
secured the submission of <persName>Moshesh</persName>, who, the next 
day, the <date when="1852-12-21">21st of December</date>, sent to the camp the 
following letter:&#8212;</p>

<p rend="small right">"<geogName><choice><orig>Thaba Bosigo</orig><reg>Thaba Bosiu</reg></choice></geogName>, <date when="1852-12-20">Dec. 20th, 1852</date>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></p>

<p rend="small">"Your Excellency,&#8212;This day you have fought against 
my people, and taken much <term type="animal">cattle</term>. As the object for which 
you have come is to have a compensation for <term type="collective"><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></term>, I beg 
you will be satisfied with what you have taken. I entreat 
peace from you; you heve shown your power, you have 
chastised,&#8212;let be enough I pray you, and let me no 
longer be considered an enemy of the <persName>Queen</persName>. I will try 
all I can to keep my people in order in the future.</p>

<p rend="small right">"<persName><seg rend="caps">Moshesh</seg></persName>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/></p>

<p>To which his Excellency returned the following

<p rend="small">"<persName>Chief Moshesh</persName>,&#8212;I have received your letter. The 
words are those of a great chief, and of one who has the 
interests of his people at heart. But I care little for words; 
I judge of men by their actions. I told you that if you did 
not pay the fine, I must go and take it. I am a man who 
never breaks his word, otherwise the <persName>Queen</persName> would not have 
sent me here. I have taken the fine by force, and I am
satisfied.</p>

<p rend="small">"I am not angry with your people for fighting in defence 
of their property; for those who fought&#8212;and fought well&#8212; 
were not all of them thieves, and I am sorry that many 
were killed. This is your fault; for if you had paid the 
fine, it would not have happened. I now desire not to <w>con<!-- - -->sider</w> 
you, Chief, as an enemy of the <persName>Queen</persName>, but I must 
proclaim martial law in the <region>Sovereignty</region>, to give to <w>com<!-- - -->mandants</w> 
and fieldcornets power to make commandos in a 
regular manner, and, with the consent of the Resident, 
enter your country in search of plundered <term type="animal">horses</term> and <term type="animal">cattle</term> 
that may be stolen after this time. And I expect you to 
assist them; for though you are a great chief, it seems that 
you either do not, or cannot, keep your own people from 
stealing; and among the <term type="animal">cattle</term> you sent as part of your 
fine there were three <term type="animal">oxen</term> the property of <persName>Mr. Bain</persName>, of 
<settlement>Bloem Fontein</settlement>, stolen since I crossed the <geogName>Caledon River</geogName>. 
Now, therefore, <persName>Chief Moshesh</persName>, I consider your past <w>obli<!-- - -->gations</w> 
fulflled, and hope that you will take measures for 
preventing such abuses in future. In the meantime, as the

<p rend="small">"Whereas the <persName>Chief Moshesh</persName>, as the result of the battle 
of <geogName>Berea</geogName>, has made full and humble submission, and sued 
for peace, which has been granted.</p> 

<p rend="small">"And whereas, although the said chief has evinced his 
desire to preserve the good understanding and amity with 
<orgName>Her Majesty's Government</orgName>, now happily restored, by <w>pro<!-- - -->mising</w> 
to do all in his power to keep his people in order, it 
is scarcely to be expected that he will be able so to restrain 
their lawless practices as to entirely prevent <term type="animal">cattle</term> stealing 
for the future.</p> 

<p rend="small">"And whereas, in my last reply to the said Chief, I <w>ex<!-- - -->pressed</w> 
my intention of proclaiming martial law, in order to 
restore to the burghers the full powers of making <w>com<!-- - -->mandos,</w> 
which seem to have fallen into disuse; and whereas, 
upon further consideration, I have reason to believe that 
the course of proclaiming martial law might be <w>misinterpre<!-- - -->ted</w> 
and misunderstood, and tend to unnecessary irritation, 
excitement, and alarm, and that the object I have in view 
can be attained without proclaiming martial law as <w>afore<!-- - -->said</w>; 
now, therefore, I do hereby, by virtue of all the 
powers vested in me, provisionally and until sufficient legal 
enactment may be framed with the same intent, order, <w>com<!-- - -->mand</w>, 
and direct all civil commissioners, commandants, and 
fieldcornets within the <region><geogName>Orange River</geogName> Territory</region>, to be ready 
to organise their burghers for the purposes of self defence, 
and for the protection, security, and recovery of their <w>pro<!-- - -->perty</w> 
in case of need.</p>
