						<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>It is clear that William Ivens labored in a rigid class system that curtailed his chances for economic mobility. What is more complicated to untangle is how racism and British anti-Blackness stymied his opportunities. Racism and racial categories looked different in William Ivens’ home country than they did in the United States. Whether his hard work was thwarted by racism or classism – or a combination of both – William Ivens was determined to make London home again.</p>

						<h3 id="racism">Race and Racism in William Ivens’ London</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>In December 1881, William Ivens struggled to make ends meet. He had pawned his overcoat, lived “<u>very</u> economically,” he reported, and held out hope for an increase in salary at the start of the New Year (Craft 1881i). Although he had left the United States to escape what he termed “the spirit engendered by slavery,” William Ivens found himself fettered by lines of class in England. His struggle to find adequate and “decent” clothing was one example of how poverty circumscribed his economic advancement, although he understood the importance of appearance when it came to respectability (Craft 1881c; Craft 1881a).</p>

						<p>What is less clear is the extent to which racism pervaded his life in London. In some ways, William Ivens was unable to escape the reach of transatlantic anti-Blackness. He wrote to Nichol that the American minstrel troupe, the Haverly Minstrels, “had quite a successful time” in London and were headed to Scotland next (Craft 1881i). Such minstrelsy, with its claims to accurate portrayal of Black Americans, helped produce and perpetuate racist stereotypes of Black people as well as cross-class and even transatlantic white racial solidarity. Though he had traveled to England to escape American racism, the ocean could not interrupt the flow and cross currents of white supremacy.</p>

						<p>William Ivens’ encounter with minstrelsy in the second half of the nineteenth century was not an unusual experience for Londoners. Historian Jeffrey Green (2018, 51) has written about the form and function of such black-face performances for Victorian Londoners, which became wildly popular. “Minstrelsy’s success,” writes Green, “was due to it being a family show, with choral and solo singing, instrumental selections, humour, topicality, sentimentality and joy.” Nonetheless, he points out, the “legacy was almost toxic, for audiences associated African Americans with music, dance and humour.” Moreover, “[g]iven the so-limited opportunities” to Black Victorians, the “entertainment world attracted black men and women who would have met with success in other walks of life had American discrimination been less severe.” In fact, William Ivens’ return coincided with what scholar Laura Vorachek has termed the “apogee” blackface minstrelsy’s popularity in England. In 1882, the Prince of Wales decided to take up the banjo. He received lessons from African American musician James Bohee. This led to a “banjo craze” among the white British bourgeoisie (Vorachek 2013).</p>

						<h3 id="generation">A New Generation of Black Britons</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>As the British-born son of formerly enslaved people, William Ivens Craft represented a new generation of Black Englishmen. Black men and women who had fled slavery earlier in the nineteenth century “moved in every level of [English] society and were friends with influential people,” writes Jeffrey Green (2018, 23). They were also “lionized,” notes R. J. M. Blackett (1983, 40). Yet, William Ivens found these doors closed to him. Without the status of fugitive from slavery, he did not represent to white English people what Blackett terms “resistance to oppression” (1983, 201).</p>

						<p>Instead, William Ivens was an impoverished Black Briton in an expanding empire. The color line that Great Britain pushed further and further across the globe preferred to make William Ivens’ – and his Blackness – disappear (Lake and Reynolds 2008). Because race was not marked in the census or other bureaucratic papers, William Ivens and other Black Victorian English men and women were literally erased from the nation’s memory.</p>

						<p>“As I say, nothing was spoken about in this country, it was sort of hidden away a bit, really,” recalls Martin Copeland, William Ivens’ great-grandson. “Certainly, most of my family didn't even realize they had Black ancestors” (Copeland and Copeland 2022). Struggling to make enough money to board, eat, and find adequate clothing, William Ivens saw privation in front of him, and racism behind him.</p>

						<p>Yet whatever economic hardship William Ivens faced in England, it must have seemed better than the situation in America. Throughout 1882, William Ivens’ family encouraged him to stay in the “old Country.” Ellen and William “tried to pursuade [sic] him to remain a short time longer” in London, “it being so very much easier for a man of color to succeed” (Craft 1882). William Ivens’ brother also recommended that he remain in England (Craft 1882a).</p>

						<h3 id="despair">The ‘Edge of Despair’</h3><!-- Change -->

						<p>While his family believed that London could not possibly be worse than the situation in the southern U.S., William Ivens continued to face near destitution. He wrote to Nichols that, “if it had not been for your generosity I might now have been languishing in the Workhouse or some prison. Dear Friend,” he continued, “you cannot know nor imagine that flow of gratitude that fills my heart when I think of your goodness” (Craft 1882b).</p>

						<p>Despite the setbacks, William Ivens persisted in his hometown of London. He continued to work for the Railways & Metropolitan Omnibus Company Limited. He confided to Chesson in May of 1882 that if he did not procure five pounds by Saturday, he “may get into trouble” (Craft 1882c). He also wrote of his precarious position to Nichol, informing her that he teetered “on the ‘ragged edge of despair’” (Craft 1882b).</p>

						<p>It would appear that William Ivens, at an impasse bounded by class barriers and transatlantic anti-Blackness, considered and perhaps planned a return to his family and the increasingly unfree American South. He told Nichol that he would soon leave England and promised he would no longer bother her. “I am going back to America in the Autumn for sure,” William Ivens wrote on 3 May 1882. “If you accede to what I asked you for £3 I shall be all right” (Craft 1882b). We have no proof that Nichol ever sent him the three pounds.</p>
