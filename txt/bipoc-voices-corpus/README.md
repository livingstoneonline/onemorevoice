## Overview

The *Corpus of BIPOC Voices in the Victorian Periodical Press* brings together 61 short texts from Victorian periodicals plus 3 bonus texts. The Corpus is an unexpected by-product of “[BIPOC Voices in the Victorian Periodical Press]( https://onemorevoice.org/html/bipoc-voices/bv-home.html)” (henceforth, “BIPOC Voices”), a 2021 and 2022 initiative by scholars and students from *[One More Voice]( https://onemorevoice.org/)* (OMV) and [COVE]( https://editions.covecollective.org/) in collaboration with [Special Collections, SOAS Library]( https://www.soas.ac.uk/research/library/special-collections) and [Adam Matthew Digital](https://www.amdigital.co.uk/) (AMD) to identify, document, encode, publish, and critically study a series of BIPOC voices from Victorian missionary periodicals. The initiative involved two branches of endeavor, one funded by the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln]( https://www.unl.edu/) (UNL) and centered on the physical print holdings of SOAS, the other funded by the [Research Society for Victorian Periodicals]( https://rs4vp.org/) (RSVP) and centered on the digital holdings of AMD. Both branches focused on missionary periodicals because such periodicals offer an excellent opportunity for engaging with a wide range of Victorian-era representations of BIPOC voices due to the global nature of missionary work.

As part of the “BIPOC Voices” work, a set of graduate students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Purdue University, and elsewhere encoded the 64 pieces gathered in the present corpus in HTML; advanced scholars on the project then developed the files further. As that work came to a conclusion, it emerged that the files might easily be stripped of coding and presented alongside the other corpus already pubished by *One More Voice*, [Corpus of Africa-Centered Literary Works, 1830-1930](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/onemorevoice/tree/master/txt/africa-corpus). One of the “BIPOC Voices” Co-PIs Adrian S. Wisnicki, therefore, prepared the files for the corpus through a few simple steps: 
1. He stripped out the HTML tags by using the following terminal command iteratively over all the files: `sed 's/<[^>]*>//g ; /^$/d' filename.html > filename.txt`
2. He manually removed a few stray bits of coding not caught by the terminal command;
3. He manually replaced a few HTML-coded characters;
4. He stripped out unnecessary white space using a script already developed for One More Voice; 
5. He switched the order of items in the files so that the metadata now comes before rather than after the periodical piece text.
To support use of the files, Wisnicki also created an [integrated spreadsheet](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/onemorevoice/tree/master/txt/africa-corpus/data/bipoc-voices-corpus-metadata.xlsx) that provides metadata for all the files in the corpus in a standalone fashion.

The corpus is now published, like most of One More Voice's files, under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC BY 4.0) license in order to promote wide educational use. In engaging with the corpus and its texts, users are urged to exercise caution due to the possible inclusion of offensive or otherwise problematic historical language. Users should also take note that any racist or similar elements in the texts do not necessarily represent the real views of the BIPOC creator(s), but rather may be due to the (often silent) intervention of Victorian-era white British missionaries, editors, and publishers. The [home page](https://onemorevoice.org/html/bipoc-voices/bv-home.html) of the “BIPOC Voices” project provides access to the various critical materials produced by the initiative as a whole.
