<h5 style="text-align:center;">INDIAN SNAKE-CATCHER.</h5>
<p>The following remarkable circumstance is related of Daehne, the
Moravian Missionary, who laboured amongst these Indians about
a hundred years ago—</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">The Indians having forsaken him, he was left alone in the Mission 
Settlement, and was often in no small danger from wild beasts and other 
venomous creatures. Thus a tiger for a long time kept watch near his 
hut, seeking an opportunity, no doubt, to seize the poor solitary inhabitant.
Every night it roared most dreadfully; and though he regularly
kindled a large fire in the neighbourhood before he went to bed, yet, as 
it often went out by the morning, it would have proved but a miserable 
defence, hand not the Lord preserved him. The following circumstance 
is still more remarkable, and illustrates, in a singular manner, the care of 
God over His servants. Being one evening attacked with a paroxysm of 
fever, he resolved to go into his hut and lie down in his hammock. 
Just, however, as he entered the door, he beheld a serpent descending from the roof upon him. In the scuffle which ensued, the creature bit him in three different places; and, pursuing him closely, twined itself 
several times round his head and neck as tightly as possible. Expecting 
now to be bitten, or strangled to death, and being afraid lest his brethren 
should suspect the Indians and murdered him, he, with singular presence 
of mind, wrote with chalk on the table—"A serpent has killed me." 
Suddenly, however, that promise of the Saviour darted into his mind, 
"They shall take up serpents, and shall not be hurt." Encouraged by 
this declaration, he seized the creature with great force, tore it loose from 
his body, and flung it out of the hut. He then lay down in his hammock
in tranquillity and peace. This was most probably a boa-constrictor,
whose bite, though painful, is not venomous, and which destroys
his prey by crushing it to death and gorging it whole.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">May the old serpent Satan become as universally an object of antipathy to men; and may they be taught to dread that deadly poison of sin with which he destroys the soul! May the great Deliverer who bruised his head make us strong to wrestle with our great adversary, and "bruise Satan under our feet shortly!"</p></div>
