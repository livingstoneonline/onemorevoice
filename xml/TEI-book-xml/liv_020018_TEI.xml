<p rend="no-indent">you for what you have done for 
me. Beloved friends, to-day I 
thank you for what you have 
done for my son and for myself. 
I thank you for what he was 
taught, and for what he was 
prepared for, by your means. 
From the beginning you acted 
with great wisdom towards him, 
and thereby conferred privileges 
and marvellous blessings upon 
us all. You opened up every 
path for him by which he was 
directed in the way of salvation, 
and which you also showed unto 
his people as well as to himself 
and to his family.</p> 
<p>"Beloved, your work to my 
son I represent with the words 
which were said respecting man: 
The Creator first prepared a 
place for man before He created 
him. When He had finished all 
that was right for man, He 
created him, and placed him in 
the midst of every advantage. 
His commandment instructed 
him, like him who has departed. 
Thus it was so.</p> 
<p>"What can I speak to you? 
Dearly beloved, that which you 
began did you not finish? You 
gave the blood of your blood<ref target="#note_01">*</ref><!-- footnote "Referring to his marriage" to be inserted here? AM --> 
to my son. I have seen it with 
my own eyes. That event 
taught us to know your habits, 
your disposition, and your 

<cb/><!-- beginning of column 2 AM -->
speech. That great event united 
us very closely together. In 
effect it seemed to say to my 
son: '<persName>Tiyo Soga</persName>, go, take this 
great enlightener amongst your 
countrymen.' My friends, what 
can I say to you? He is gone 
to the place prepared for him<supplied>,</supplied> 
look there for him! Pardon me 
in referring to this matter. 
Beloved, what gift can be more 
highly esteemed than this? 
Rejoice, beloved! we also rejoice 
with the Churches in <country>Scotland</country>. 
Rejoice ye! Canzibe, the bright, 
the morning star of spring, has 
already risen upon <bloc>Africa</bloc>. The 
first teacher belonging to our 
countrymen was sent forth by 
you. Be glad, ye people of 
<region>Caffraria</region>! <settlement>Amaxosa</settlement>, the first 
home of my son, now lying 
desolate and forlorn, speaks of 
your laborious toil. Rejoice ye! 
These five <term type="plant">gum trees</term> still 
standing remind me that, while the 
desolate and deserted homes of 
our countrymen are covered 
with the couch grass, it is not 
so with respect to that in which 
my son abides this day. His 
home is now far distint from 
these <term type="plant">gum trees</term>. Vain, then, is 
it for you to care so much, and 
to be so anxious for the things 
of this world.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="2" unit="chars"/>.</p>

pray for me to the Lord, my 
friends, that when I reach that 
day which has neither a 
yesterday nor a to-morrow&#8212;a day 

<cb/><!-- beginning of column 2 AM -->
which has no end&#8212;I may
