						<p>In order to give you as clear a statement as possible, respecting the <term
							type="collective">Hottentot</term> settlement along the banks of the <geogName>Gread Fish
							River</geogName>, I intimated my intention to his honour the Lieut. Governor of visiting them
							in person; and having received his cordial approbation, I proceeded on the <date
							when="1837-07-11">11th inst.</date> to <settlement><term type="collective">Caffre</term>

						<div>

								Settlement</settlement>.</head>
							<p>The party were delighted to see me, and were loud in their praises of the privliges which
								they posessed in arable land, garden ground, &amp;c., &amp;c., The men here, as at all the
								settlements, receive rations from <orgName>Government</orgName>, and the women and children
								collect roots.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The men likewise go hunting, some of them to
								the river in which there are numerous <term type="animal">hippopotami</term>, and some to
								the bush, where the <term type="animal"><choice>
								<orig>bufaloes</orig>
								<reg>buffalo</reg>
								</choice></term> graze in heards; but there is sufficient land for several hundred
								families.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This is a good place for a Missionary station, and
								from its proximity to the <term type="collective">Caffres</term>, a congregation might, in
								time, be collected on the other side of the river; thus forming a field of Missionary
								exertion of a very encouraging nature, and as far as we are able to judge, with every
								prospect of usefulness and success.</p>
							<p>From <settlement><term type="collective">Caffre</term> Drift</settlement> we advanced up
								the river to <settlement>Trompettor's Drift</settlement>, and proceeded then to the</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<head rend="center italic"><settlement>Settlement under
								<persName>Appel</persName></settlement>.</head>
							<p>Here the whole party were busy erecting their habitations.<space extent="1" unit="chars"
								/>This place far exceeds in natural beauty any spot that I have seen along the whole course
								of the river, from the <settlement><term type="collective">Caffre</term> Drift</settlement>
								up to the junction of the <geogName>Kat River</geogName> with the <geogName>Fish
								River</geogName>; but it affords little opportunity to the settlers for the display of
								industry in the cultivation of land. Between their dwellings and the river, 50 paces is the
								extreme extent of what they call their garden ground, and there is no other spot, either
								above or below the site of their village, which presents more encouraging appearance.<space
								extent="1" unit="chars"/>Here there are 18 families, consisting of about 70 individuals, and
								several families are on their way to join them.</p>

								on the fronteir instead of <placeName>Fort Welshire</placeName> and <placeName>Double
								Drift</placeName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Above the last mentioned, <term
								type="collective"><persName>Klaas</persName>'s party</term> is located at the junction of
								the <geogName>Kat River</geogName> and the <geogName>Fish River</geogName>.<space extent="1"
								unit="chars"/>There are more than 50 families here.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Their
								greatest want, as they say themselves, is to have a Missionary who will teach their children,
								as well as preach to them, and advise with them in their several plans and operations.</p>
							<p>The site which they have chosen for a village is pleasantly situated.<space extent="1"
								unit="chars"/>Fronting their houses there is an island of considerable extent, which they
								intend to enclose immediately, subdiving the same into patches, varying in size, according
								to the wants and means of the several familites.</p>
							<p>This is certainly the most interesting settlement yet formed, and a Missionary<ref
								target="#note_01">*</ref> would find sufficient work here, independent of the other
								settlements lower down the river; but if schoolmasters are sent to this place and to
								<settlement>Trompettor's</settlement> and <settlement><term type="collective">Caffre</term>
								Drifts</settlement>, the Missionary may then itinerate among all of them, and a fine field
								it certainly is.</p>
							<p>During my journey I conducted Divine service twenty-three times in ten days, and all our
								meetings were accompanied by prayer.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I enjoyed it very much,
								and found that in watering others I was much refreshed myself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"

								life.</p>

						<p rend="no-indent">the <term type="collective">Hottentots</term> of the <geogName>Great Fish

							/>He considers that the <term type="collective">Hottentots</term> deprived of their country
							have strong claims on the <orgName>Government</orgName>, for any unoccupied lands it might
							have to dispose of; and in giving them the lands that have been assigned them, he has (in <choice>

							interests of the colony, the security of the fronteirs and the future well-being of the <term
							type="collective">Caffres</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The plan now pursued by the
							Lieut. Governor was recommended by the Crown Commissioner of the Inquiry in the reports to
							the <orgName>Home Government</orgName>, and perhaps it would have been well for
							the <settlement>Colony</settlement> had it been carried into effect at that period.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The
							<settlement><geogName>Kat River</geogName> settlement</settlement> and the protection of the
							<term type="collective">Griquas</term> have rendered to the <settlement>Colony</settlement> and to the tribes beyond
							them, show the great advantage to be derived from having tribes of civilised men of colour
							between the white Colonists and the barbarous tribes beyond the <settlement>Colony</settlement>.<space extent="1"
							unit="chars"/>The heart of the Lieut. Governor is now set upon the completion of this plan,
							in which he will, we doubt not, be ably secconded by his Excellency, <persName>Major General
							Napier</persName>; but he feels great difficulties in carrying it to the full extend he
							contemplated, owing to the great poverty of the people.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The
							<term type="collective">Hottentots</term> located on the <geogName>Kat River</geogName> had
							no assistance from Government, nor from any other quarter; but the banks of the <geogName>Kat
							River</geogName> were and are more favourable to the furtherance of such a scheme than the
							banks of the <geogName>Dish River</geogName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Besides, a
							number of the first settlers on the <geogName>Kat River</geogName> had something of their own
							to begin with, and those who had any thing of their own assisted their poorer
							neighbours.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>On the contrary, those that are permitted to
							locate themselves on the <geogName>Fish River</geogName> belong to that class of <term
							type="collective">Hottentots</term> who have had the least protection, and who stand in need
							of every thing.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They are without herds and flocks, without
							clothing, or the commonest agricultural tools.</p>
						<p>In a letter to a friend, the Lieut. Governor remarks:&#8212;"My plan cannot succeed without
							Missionaries and schoolmasters, and means to put the people in possession of a few sheep and
							goats, seed corn, and agricultural instruments," and for these he looks to the friends of
							religion and humanity in <country>England</country>, and we hope he will not look in vain for
							the assistance required.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This appeal to the sympathies of the
							friends of the colonial races in <country>England</country>, will be the more readily
							responded to, when it is known that the Lieut. Governor has generously advanced 3000 dollars
							out of his own pocket, to purchase for the settlers a small quantity of stock; but, as the
							people are flocking to the new locations, all that the most generous individual can furnish
							out of his private means will go but a little way to supply their necessities.</p>
						<p>We regret at this moment that we could not have remained a little time longer in
							<country>England</country>, to have made our appeals in person on behalf of this people; but
							we feel confident that the appeal we have left behind, as embraced in the preceeding
							statements, will not be unheeded by the generous friends of <bloc>Africa</bloc> in
