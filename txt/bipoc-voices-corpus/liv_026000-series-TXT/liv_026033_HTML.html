  <p>"My dear aunt Joanna Ebiba gently sleeps to-day in Jesus' loving arms,
    after a long illness of six months. Ebiba was brought to know about the
    Saviour through my instrumentality in 1852, a few years after my own
    conversion. She was selected for baptism. She came all the way from
    Abeokuta to tell me of this, of which I rejoiced to hear. "When shall
    the baptism take place?" I asked her. "In two week's time," she replied.
    I told her to be ready to get back in time for the purpose. On her way
    home she passed by Ijaye. Here she was told about the dangerous illness of her brother at
    Agbagi, several days' journey from Ijaye. She
    thought she should be there and back again before the day of her baptism,
    but alas! no sooner was she there than a long blockade took place, and
    the whole country was in confusion. During this time she became a
    resident of that part of the Efan country. Trying to trade about in the
    Efan country, she went on further and further, that we heard no more
    of her, and the hope of her being alive was given up. It seemed that
    there was reason in her case. A few years after her departure from us,
    I was made a schoolmaster; some years after, a catechist; and again, after
    this, it pleased the Lord to call me into the holy order of deacon. Two
    or three months after my ordination, news came that my aunt was still
    alive, living in a place about eleven days' journey from Ibadan. I sent
    immediately a young faithful Christian man to bring her to me, charging
    him to stay no longer than thirty days. This was faithfully accomplished.
    After eighteen long years' separation we were brought together again. The
    joy of this happy meeting is inexpressible. I asked her how she passed her
    life all the time she lived in the Efan country. 'I am known by everybody,' she replied, 'to be
    a worshipper of God after the way of the Oibo
    religion' (<em>i.e., Christianity</em>). Receiving a few months' instruction, she
    was admitted into the Church by baptism. She was about the age of
    ninety. Who could ever have throught eighteen years ago that her youn
    nephew would have to baptize her himself? How mysterious and wonderful are the ways of God!"</p>
