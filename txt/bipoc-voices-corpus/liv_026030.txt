Warning: Readers should exercise caution when consulting this text and others published by the “BIPOC Voices” project due to the possible inclusion of offensive or otherwise problematic historical language. Readers should also take note that any racist or similar elements in the texts do not necessarily represent the real views of the BIPOC creator(s), but rather may be due to the (often silent) intervention of Victorian-era white British missionaries, editors, and publishers.

  DAY-SPRING IN THE FAR WEST.
   Sketches of Mission Work in British North America.
  
  III.&#8212;EXTENSION OF THE MISSION
    WESTWARD.
  [...]
  In a letter dated August 19, 1871, Mr. Budd writes thus:&#8212;
  
    The growing population of Devon, and the endeavours
      of the people
      towards improvement in temporal as well as spiritual matters, give me
      full employment on the spot,
      and leave little room for
      visiting and seeing the Indians
      at other places. We
      see here new houses putting
      up every year, the soil
      ploughed up, the seed put
      in, parks and fences rising
      up here and there, until
      very little land is left for
      the cattle to graze upon.
      All this spring I was delighted
      to see them, each
      one trying to break up his
      own piece of land, and
      planting his potatoes in it,
      and now they have potatoes
      growing up nicely, and there
      is promise of a good harvest.
      The people have effectually
      put down the sale of any
      spirituous liquors among
      themselves, and now that
      the law has passed forbidding
      it, we trust we shall never
      see any more of that soul-destroying
      article of trade
      among our people.
    The Sunday services have
      been regularly attended by
      all the people when they are
      at home. It is seldom that
      all our people are at home
      together. Most of the strong
      and able go about hunting
      during winter, leaving their
      families sometimes, and at
      other times taking them
      with them. During the
      summer months the strong
      men are away tripping in
      the boats; but as the population
      is yearling increasing,
      we still have plenty at home
      who fill the church Sabbath
      by Sabbath. I am always
      particularly encouraged at
      the Sunday duties; for I feel
      that I am preaching to a
      people that understand me.
      The Sunday-school is not
      less encouraging. Here we
      have children and young
      people attending, many of
      them reading with fluency
      the Word of God in their
      own language. They manage
      to read it in their own language
      so much quicker than
      in English, and of course at
      once understand what they
      are reading about. This and
      the day-school I have to
      conduct myself, with the
      help of a young man whom
      I am training for a teacher.
