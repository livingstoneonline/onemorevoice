<p class="p noindent ">THE following interesting letter is from a
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native African</span>, who, when quite a child,
was kidnapped from the interior of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Nubia</span>.
and after being several times sold, finally fell
into the hands of an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> family at
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Alexandria</span>, where he acquired the rudiments
of education, namely, a knowledge of the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> alphabet. After remaining with
this family for some time, he came to
<span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> in the capacity of servant; and having
undergone many vicissitudes, at length went
out to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lagos</span>, to try what he could do on his
own account. By his good conduct and
excellent principles, his sobriety, industry, and
perseverance, he gained the confidence of
the parties to whom he had been
recommended, and his name is honourably mentioned
in the despatches of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Burton</span>, whom
he accompanied on his recent visit to the
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">King of <span class="country" title="A country."><span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Dahomey</span></span></span>, and who has again
engaged him for his present expedition. We
have received other communications from
him, from time to time, but they were strictly
personal. The present one appears to us to
offer sufficient interest to merit a place in
our columns, and we print it without
correction.

<br><p class="p ">"<span class="smallcaps ">Respected Sir</span>,—Your kind favour of the
14th August came to hand on my return from
the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo River</span>, to which place I accompanied
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul Burton</span> last July. The condition of that
country, as far as we ascended, viz. 160 miles
into the interior, is in a most deplorable state.
The slave-trade and its accompaniments have
been, and still are, ruling rampant in that river;
and the result is a thorough demoralization of
the inhabitants. The copious drafts of rum and
other luxuries, showered upon the people by the
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Portuguese</span> slave-traders</span>, has made them so
thoroughly idle, that the earth groans for the
want of some one to cultivate it. We found the
poor victims to the influence of the vile traffic
entirely in the hands of Satan; for thefts and
debauchery of every description are rife
throughout the whole country, but more especially from
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Shark Point</span>, the mouth of the river, to
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Embomma</span>, some eighty miles in the interior. Along
the whole of the line are established baracoons
and factories of every size and description. At
some of these I saw plenty of slaves, and more
particularly at one house in <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Embomma</span>, where
the unfortunate wretches were put in irons,
awaiting the first opportunity of being sent down
to the coast. I cannot give you a better
example than this. We found, in the lower part of
the river, the weaker sex awfully given to
drunkenness, and, although nominally
acknowledged by some one as their husband, they are <br>

in reality nothing but common property. I have
now travelled through the greater part of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">West
<span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span>, <span class="country" title="A country.">the Gambia</span>, <span class="country" title="A country.">Sierra Leone</span>, <span class="country" title="A country.">Liberia</span>, the
<span class="country" title="A country.">Gold Coast</span>, <span class="country" title="A country."><span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Dahomey</span></span>, <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lagos</span>, <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Badagry</span>, <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Porto
Novo</span>, and for 400 miles into the interior of the
<span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Euroba</span></span>, or <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Yoruba</span> country</span>, the <span class="country" title="A country.">Benin</span>, the

<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">St. Paul's de Loando</span>. I have visited Africans
in their most primitive condition; but never in
the whole of my experience did any thing like
the state of affairs in the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo River</span> ever
present itself to my notice. I am happy to say,
however, that Her Majesty's cruisers are doing
their utmost to suppress this market for human
blood. When we left the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">mouth of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo</span></span>
last October, the <span class="italic "><em>Zebra</em></span>, the <span class="italic "><em>Archer</em></span>, the <span class="italic "><em>Griffin</em></span>,
the <span class="italic "><em>Lee</em></span>, and the <span class="italic "><em>Afulet</em></span>, were on duty there, so
that we hope, ere long, to hear that the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Portuguese</span> are ultimately compelled to leave the river.
I hear that, according to present arrangements,
the power of <span class="country" title="A country.">Portugal</span> ought not to extend
beyond <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ambrizette</span>, forty miles south of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zaire</span>,
or <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo</span>. If so, they ought to be turned out
of the river by force; for so long as they
exercise their influence over the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span>, no
legitimate commerce can be established with them.
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Messrs. —— and ——</span> is the only <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>
house in the river, and I am sorry to say that
it is a failure; for, encouraged on every point
by the slave-traders, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native chiefs</span> find
it more profitable to catch men and sell them
for plenty of rum and beads and cloth, than to
spoil their fingers by the manufacture of palm-oil.
In fact, I cannot see how a profitable traffic
in <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> produce can be carried on unless the
slave-traders were driven out, and the river
shut up for two or three years, to purge it
from the effects produced by the vile system
existing in its bosom. In about five or six days
I hope to accompany <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Burton</span> (by whom
I am now employed) to the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Court of the
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person."><span class="country" title="A country."><span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Dahomey</span></span> King</span></span>. This will be our second visit to
that country; and, from my slight experience
of the country and people, I think <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain
Burton</span> is just the right man in the right place.
</p>
<p class="p ">"Many thanks for the receipts, which came
to hand all safe, as also the copies of the
<span class="italic "><em>Reporter</em></span>. The subscribers are quite delighted with
the news, and wonder they had never heard of
the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Society</span> before this. As the subject has now
been introduced to their notice, I hope they will
keep up the communication regularly with home;
and I see no reason why all the intelligent
natives on the coast should not become subscribers.
I am sorry to say that the present system of
education on the coast is not calculated to raise
the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> much beyond their former scale of
usefulness. There are only two things that they
are educated for, viz. clerks and merchants.
Everybody cannot be a merchant. Why not
encourage agriculture? The same money that
makes the merchant can make the farmer, and
I must confess that the latter would be the most
independent of the two; for, singular to relate,
that the prejudice of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> against the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span>, and, <span class="italic "><em>vice versâ</em></span>, of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span>
against the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span>, is any thing but
encouraging. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> have great capacities for
trade; but the goods supplied to them on the
coast are invoiced at such high prices, that it is
really impossible for them to, realize any thing
for themselves. To prove this, I have only to
mention the case of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. ——</span>, one of our
subscribers. Last year he paid in something
like 800<span class="italic "><em>l</em></span>. (Eight hundred pounds) sterling
as his yearly trade account with <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Messrs.——
and ——</span>. Out of this he received commission
about fifty pounds with which to maintain himself,
his wife, and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kroo-boys</span>, besides a nephew and
four children. Had it not been that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
——</span> had other sources to depend upon, his
brokerage between the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Europeans</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span>
would never keep his house in more than dry
bread and water. He begged of me to
recommend him to some gentleman in <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> with
whom he could deal<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.

worth of palm-oil, his own private property;
and I should feel truly grateful if you will put
him in the way of trading direct with <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>.
He intends shipping some of his oil the moment
he receives a communication from you. As for
myself, I must candidly confess that I have
found it more profitable for the present to be
travelling about. That, however, cannot last,
for, sooner or later, I must settle down somewhere.
There are already too many engaged in
palm-oil; I therefore think of starting a cotton
plantation at the foot of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity."><span class="country" title="A country.">Cameroon</span> mountains</span> as
soon as my period of servitude with my present
employer has expired. Two or three thousand
acres taken in and sown with cotton would not
require more than 350<span class="italic "><em>l</em></span>. to 400<span class="italic "><em>l</em></span>. out here, and,
from experiments already tried, the farm could
be made self-supporting after the first year. I
do not think we shall be more than three months
<span class="country" title="A country."><span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Dahomey</span></span>, after which I think my master goes
to <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, and then I shall be at liberty to try
for myself. I enclose a sample of cotton which
I have grown this year in the <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Consular grounds</span>.
There are about two acres sowed with cotton,
and I expect to gather about three cwt. With
many thanks for your kind wishes,
