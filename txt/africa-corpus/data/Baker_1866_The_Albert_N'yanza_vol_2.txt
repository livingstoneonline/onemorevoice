THE
ALBEET N'YANZA.

CHAPTER I.

LIFE AT OBBO.

For months we dragged on a miserable existence
at Obbo, wrecked by fever ; the quinine exhausted ;
thus the disease worried me almost to death, returning
at intervals of a few days. Fortunately my wife did
not suffer so much as I did. I had nevertheless pre
pared for the journey south ; and as travelling on foot
would have been impossible in our weak state, I had
purchased and trained three oxen in lieu of horses.
They were named "Beef," "Steaks," and "Suet."
" Beef " was a magnificent animal, but having been
bitten by the flies, he so lost his condition ¦ that I
changed his name to " Bones." We were ready to
start, and the natives reported that early in January
the Asua would be fordable. I had arranged with
Ibrahim that he should supply me with porters for
-vol. II. B

payment in copper bracelets, and that he should
accompany me with one hundred men to Kamrasi's
country (Unyoro), on condition that he would restrain
his people from all misdemeanours, and that they
should be entirely subservient to me. It was the
month of December, and during the nine months that
I had been in correspondence with his party I had
succeeded in acquiring an extraordinary influence.
Although my camp was nearly three-quarters of a
mile from their zareeba, I had been besieged daily for
many months for " everything that was wanted ; my
camp was a kind of general store that appeared to be
inexhaustible. I gave all that I had with a good
grace, and thereby gained the goodwill of the robbers,
especially as my large medicine-chest contained a
supply of drugs that rendered me in their eyes a phy
sician of the first importance. I had been very suc
cessful with my patients; and the medicines that I
generally used being those which produced a very
decided ^effect, both the ' Turks and natives consi
dered them with perfect faith. There was seldom
any difficulty in prognosticating the effect 'of tartar
emetic, and this became the favourite drug that was
almost daily applied for ; a dose of three grains en
chanting the patient, who always advertised my fame
by saying, "He told me I should be sick, and, by

chap, i.] INFLUENCE GAINED OVER THE PEOPLE. 3
Allah ! there was no mistake about it," Accordingly
there was a great run upon the tartar emetic. Many
people in Debono's camp had died, including several
of my deserters who had joined them. News was
brought that, in three separate fights with the natives,
my deserters had been killed on every occasion, and
my men and those of Ibrahim unhesitatingly declared
that it was the " hand of God." None of Ibrahim's
men had died since we left Latooka. One man, who
had been badly wounded by a lance thrust through
his abdomen, I had successfully treated; and the
trading party, who would at one time gladly have
exterminated me, now exclaimed, "What shall we do
when the Sowar (traveller) leaves the country % " Mrs.
Baker had been exceedingly kind to the women and
children of both the traders and natives, and together
we had created so favourable an impression that we
were always referred to as umpires in every dispute.
My own men, although indolent, were so completely
disciplined that they would not have dared to disobey
an order, and they looked back upon their former
mutinous conduct with surprise at their own audacity,
and declared that they feared to return to Khartoum,
as they were sure that I should not forgive them.
I had promised Ibrahim that I would use my in
fluence with the King of Unyoro to procure him the

4 KATCHIBA IS APPLIED TO FOR RAIN. [chap. i.
ivory of that country ;— ¦ I had a good supply of beads,
while Ibrahim had none ; thus he was dependent, upon
me for opening the road. Everything looked fair, and
had I been strong and well I should have enjoyed the
future prospect, but I was weak and almost useless,
and weighed down with anxiety lest I might die and
my wife would be left alone.
The rains had ceased, and the wild grapes were ripe;
the natives brought them in great quantities in exchange
for a few beads. They were in extremely large bunches,
invariably black, and of a good size, but not juicy — the
flavour was good, and they were most refreshing, and
certainly benefited my health. I pressed about two
hundred . pounds of grapes in the large sponging bath,
but procured so little juice, and that so thick, that wine-
making proved a failure ; it fermented, and we drank
it, but it was not wine. One day, hearing a great
noise of voices and blowing of horns in the direction
of Katchiba's residence, I sent to inquire the cause.
The old chief himself appeared, very angry and excited.
He said, that his people were very bad, that they had
been making a great noise and finding fault with him
because he had not supplied them with a few showers,
a3 they wanted to sow their crop of tullaboon. There
had been no rain for about a fortnight.
"Well," I replied, "you are the rainmaker ; why don't



## p. 5 (#27) ###############################################

chap, i.] " ARE YOU A RAINMAKER?* 5
you give your people rain?" "Give my people rain 1"
said Katchiba. " I give them rain if they don't give me
goats? You don't know my people; if I am fool
enough to give them rain before they give me the goats,
they would let me starve ! No, no ! let them wait— if
they don't bring me supplies of corn, goats, fowls, yams,
merissa, and all that I require, not one drop of rain
shall ever fall again in Obbo ! Impudent brutes are my
people! Do you know, they have positively threatened
to kill me unless I bring the rain ? They shan't have
a drop ; I will wither the crops, and bring a plague
upon their flocks. I'll teach these rascals to insult
me!" With all this bluster, I saw that old Katchiba was
in a great dilemma, and that he would give anything
for a shower, but that he did not know how to get out
of the scrape. It was a common freak of the tribes to
sacrifice their rainmaker, should he be unsuccessful.
He suddenly altered his tone, and asked, " Have you
any rain in your country ? " I replied that we had,
every now and then. " How do you bring it ? Are
you a rainmaker ? " I told him that no one believed
in rainmakers in our country^ but that we understood
how to bottle Lightning (meaning electricity). "I don't
keep mine in bottles, but I have a houseful of thunder
and lightning," he most coolly replied ; " but if you



## p. 6 (#28) ###############################################

6 KATCHIBA TAKES COUNSEL'S OPINION. [chap. i.
can bottle lightning you must understand rainmaking.
What do you think ofthe weather to day ? " I imme
diately saw the drift of the cunning old Katchiba ; he
wanted professional advice. I replied, that he must
know all about it, as he was a regular rainmaker. " Of
course I do," he answered, " but I want "to know what
you think of it." "Well," I said, "I don't think we shall
have any steady rain, but I think we may have a heavy
shower in about four days (I said this as I had observed
fleecy clouds gathering daily in the afternoon). " Just
my opinion ! " said Katchiba, delighted ; " in four or
perhaps in five days I intend to give them one shower ;
just one shower ; yes, I'll just step down to them now
and tell the rascals, that if they will bring me some
goats by this evening, and some corn to-morrow morning,
I will give them in four or five days just one shower."
To give effect to his declaration he gave several toots
upon his magic whistle. " Do you use whistles in your
country ? " inquired Katchiba. I only replied by giving
so shrill and deafening a whistle on my fingers that
Katchiba stopped his ears ; and relapsing into a smile
of admiration he took a glance at the sky from the
doorway to see if any sudden effect had been produced.
" Whistle again," he said ; and once more I performed
like the whistle of a locomotive. "That will do, we
shall have it," said the cunning old rainmaker ; and



## p. 7 (#29) ###############################################

< 'ii. w.i.J SUCCESSFUL CASE. ¦•j
proud of having so knowingly obtained "counsel's
opinion " on his case, he toddled off to his impatient
subjects. In a few days a sudden storm of rain and violent
thunder added to Katchiba's renown, and after the
shower, horns -were blowing and nogaras were beating
in honour of their chief. Entre nous, my whistle was
considered infallible.
The natives were busy sowing the new crop just as
the last crop was ripening. It did not appear likely
that they would reap much for their labour, as the
elephants, having an accurate knowledge of the season,
visited their fields nightly, and devoured and trampled
the greater portion. I had been too ill to think of
shooting, as there was no other method than to watch
in the tullaboon fields at night ; the high- grass in
which the elephants harboured being impenetrable.
Feeling a little better I took my men to the field
about a mile from the village, and dug a hole in
which I intended to watch.
That night I took Richarn, and we sat together in
our narrow grave. There was no sound throughout
the rdght. I was well wrapped up in a Scotch plaid,
but an attack of ague came on, and I shivered as
though in Lapland. I had several rifles in the grave ;
among others the "Baby," that carried a half-pound



## p. 8 (#30) ###############################################

8 NIGHT-WATCH FOR ELEPHANTS. [chap. t.
explosive shell. , At about 4 a.m. I heard the distant
trumpet of an elephant, and I immediately ordered
Richarn to watch, and to report to me their arrival.
It was extremely dark, but Richarn presently sank
slowly down, and whispered, " Here they are I "
Taking the "Baby," I quietly rose, and listening
attentively, I could distinctly hear the elephants tearing
off the heads of the tullaboon, and crunching the crisp
grain. I could distinguish the dark forms of the herd
about thirty paces from me, but much too indistinct
for a shot. I stood with my elbows resting on the
edge of the hole, and the heavy rifle balanced, waiting ,
for an opportunity. I had. a paper-sight arranged for
night shooting, and I several times tried to get the
line of an elephant's shoulder, but, to no purpose ; I
could distinguish the sight clearly, but not the elephant.
As I was watching the herd I suddenly heard a trum
pet close to my left, and I perceived an elephant quickly
walking exactly towards my grave. I waited with the
rifle at my shoulder until he was within about twelve
paces ; I then whistled, and he stopped and turned
quickly, . exposing his side. Taking the line of the
fore-leg, I fired at the shoulder. The tremendous flash
and smoke of ten drachms of powder completely blinded
me, and the sudden, reaction of darkness increased the
obscurity. I could distinguish nothing ; but I heard



## p. 9 (#31) ###############################################

chap, i.] ELEPHANT KILLED. 9
a heavy fall, and a few moments after I could hear a
rustling in the grass as the herd of elephants retreated
into the grass jungles. Richarn declared that the
elephant had fallen ; but I again heard a rustling in
the high grass jungle within eighty yards of me, and
this sound continued in the same place. I accordingly
concluded that the elephant was very badly wounded,
and that he could not move from the spot. Nothing
could be seen.
At length the birds began to chirp, and the " black
smith" (as I named one of the first to wake, whose
two sharp ringing notes exactly resemble the blows of
a hammer upon an anvil) told me that it was nearly
daybreak. The grey of morning had just appeared
when I heard voices, and I saw Mrs. Baker coming
along the .field with a party of men, whom she had
brought down from the village with knives and axes.
She had heard the roar of the heavy rifle, and knowing
the " Baby's " scream, and the usual fatal effects, she
had considered the elephant as bagged. The natives
had also heard the report, and people began to accu
mulate from all quarters for the sake of the flesh. The
elephant was not dead, but was standing about ten
yards within the grass jungle ; however, in a short time
a heavy fall sounded his knell, and the crowd rushed
in. He was a fine bull, and before I allowed him to

be cut up, I sent for the measuring-tape ; the result
being as follows : — - Feet. Inches.
From tip of trunk to "fleshy end of tail  26 \
Height from shoulder to fore-foot in a perpendicular
line . . .  ¦• • 10 H
Girth of fore-foot  4 10*
Length of one tusk in the curve .... ¦ ¦ 66
Ditto of fellow tusk (el Hadam, the servant) ... 511
Weight of tusks, 80 lbs. and 69 lbs. = 14-9 lbs.
The ridiculous accounts that I have read, stating a
that the height of elephants attains fifteen feet, is
simply laughable ignorance. A difference of a foot in
an elephant's height is enormous ; he appears a giant
among his lesser comrades. Observe the difference
between a horse sixteen hands high and a pony of
thirteen hands, and the difference of a foot in the
height of a quadruped is exemplified.
The word being given, the crowd rushed upon the
elephant, and about three hundred people were attack
ing the carcase, with knives and lances. About a
dozen men were working inside as though in a tunnel;
they had chosen this locality as being near to the fat,
which was greatly coveted.
A few days later I attempted to set fire to the grass
jungle, but it would not burn thoroughly, leaving
scorched stems that were rendered still tougher by the

fire. On the following evening 1 took a stroll over
the burnt ground to look for game. No elephants
had visited the spot; but as I was walking along
expecting nothing, up jumped a wild boar and sow
from the entrance of a large hole of the Manis, or
great scaled ant-eater. Being thus taken by surprise,
the boar very imprudently charged me, and was imme
diately knocked over dead by a shot through the spine
from the little Fletcher rifle, while the left-hand barrel
rolled over his companion, who almost immediately
recovered and disappeared in the grass jungle ; how
ever, there" was pork for those who liked it, and I went
to the camp and sent a number of natives to bring it
home. The Obbo people were delighted, as it was
their favourite game, but none of my people would
touch the unclean animal. The wild pigs of this
country live underground ; they take possession of the
holes made by the Manis, these they enlarge and form
cool and secure retreats.
A bad attack of fever laid me up until the 31st of
December. On the first day of January, 1864, I was
hardly able to stand, and was nearly worn out at the
very time that I required my strength, as we were to
start south in a few days.
Although my quinine had been long since exhausted,
I had reserved ten grains to enable me to start in case

the fever should attack me at the time of departure.
I now swallowed my last dose, and on 3d January, I
find the following note in my journal : " All ready for
a start to-morrow. I trust the year 1864 will bring
. better luck than the past, that having been the most
annoying that I have ever experienced, and full of
fever. I hope now to reach Kamrasi's country in a
fortnight, and to obtain guides from him direct to the
lake. My Latooka, to whom I have been very kind,
has absconded : there is no difference in any of these
savages ; if hungry, they will fawn upon you, and
when filled, they will desert. I believe that ten years'
residence in the Soudan and this country would spoil
an Angel, and would turn the best heart to stone." ,
It was difficult to procure porters, therefore I left all
my effects at my camp in charge of two of my
men, and I determined to travel light, without the
tent, and to take little beyond ammunition and cooking
utensils. Ibrahim left forty-five men in his zareeba,
and on the 5 th of January we started. Mrs. Baker
rode her ox, but my animal being very shy, I ordered
him to be driven for about a mile with the others to
accustom him to the crowd : not approving of the
expedition, he boltoi into the high grass with my
English saddle, and I never saw him again. In my
weak state I had to walk. We had not gone far when

a large fly fastened upon Mrs. Baker's ox, just by his
tail, the effect of which was to produce so sudden a
kick and plunge, that he threw her to the ground
and hurt her considerably; she accordingly changed
the animal, and rode a splendid ox that Ibrahim very
civilly offered. I had to walk to the Atabbi, about
eighteen miles, which, although a pleasant stroll when
in good health, I found rather fatiguing. We
bivouacked on the south bank of the Atabbi.
The next morning, after a walk of about eight
miles, I purchased of one of the Turks the best ox that
I have ever ridden, at the price of a double-barrelled
gun — it was a great relief to be well mounted, as I was
quite unfit for a journey on foot.
At 4.30 p.m. we arrived at one of the villages of
Farajoke. The character of the country had entirely
changed; instead of the rank and superabundant
vegetation of Obbo, we were in a beautiful open
country, naturally drained by its undulating character,
and abounding in most beautiful low pasturage. Vast
herds of cattle belonged to the different villages, but
these had all been driven to concealment, as the report
had been received that the Turks were approaching.
The country was thickly populated, but the natives
appeared very mistrustful; the Turks immediately
entered the villages and ransacked the granaries for

corn, digging up' the yams and helping themselves to
everything as though quite at home. I was on a
beautiful grass sward on the gentle slope of a hill ;
here I arranged to bivouack for the night.
In three days' march from this point through beautiful
park-like country, we arrived at the Asua river. The
entire route from Farajoke had been a gentle descent,
and I found this point of the Asua in lat. N. 3° 12
to be 2,875 feet above the sea level, 1,091 feet lower
than Farajoke. The river was a hundred and twenty
paces broad, and from the bed to the top of the per
pendicular banks was about fifteen feet. At this
season it was almost dry, and a narrow channel of
about six inches deep flowed through the centre of the
otherwise exhausted river. The bed was much ob
structed by rocks, and the inclination was so rapid
that I could readily conceive the impossibihty of
crossing it during the rains. It formed the great
drain of the country, all its waters flowing to the Nile,
but during the dry months it was most insignificant.
The country between Farajoke and the Asua, .although
lovely, was very thinly populated, and the only villages
that I saw were built upon low hills of bare granite,
which lay in huge piles of disjointed fragments.
On arrival at the river, while the men were wash
ing in the clear stream, I took a rifle and strolled

paces they obtained my wind, and, ceasing to graze,
they gazed intently at me. I was on the high bank
among the bushes, and I immediately picked out the
biggest, and fired, missing my mark. All dashed away
except the animal at which I fired, who stood in
uncertainty for a few moments, when the second barrel
of the Fletcher 24 rifle knocked him over, striking him

through the neck. Hearing the quick double shot, my
people came running to the spot, accompanied by a
number of the native porters, and were rejoiced to find
a good supply of meat : the antelope weighed about
five hundred pounds, and was sufficient to afford a
good dinner for the whole party.
The Mehedehet is about 13 hands high, with rough
brown hair like the Samber deer of India.
Our resting-place was on the dry, rocky bed of the
river, close to the edge of the shallow but clear stream
that rippled over the uneven surface. Some beautiful
tamarind trees afforded a most agreeable shade, and
altogether it was a charming place to bivouack.
Although at Obbo the grass was not sufficiently dry to
burn, in this country it was reduced to a crisp, straw,
and I immediately set fire to the prairies ; the wind -
was strong, and we had a grand blaze, the flames
crackling and leaping about thirty feet high, and ,.
sweeping along with so mad a fury that within an
hour the entire country was a continuous line of
fire. Not a trace of vegetation remained behind ; the
country appeared, as though covered with a pall of
black velvet. Returning from my work, I found my
, camping-place well arranged— beds prepared, and a
good dinner ready of antelope-soup and cutlets. *
'On waking the next morning, I found that ¦ the

Turks had all disappeared during the night, and that
I was alone with my people. It was shortly explained
that they had departed to attack some village, to
which they were guided by some natives who had
accompanied them from Farajoke.
I accordingly took my rifle and strolled along the
margin of the river to look for game, accompanied by
two of my porters. Although it was a most likely
country, being a natural park well timbered, with a
river flowing through the midst, there was a great
scarcity of wild animals. At length, in crossing a
ravine that had stopped the progress of the fire, an
antelope (water -buck) jumped out of a hollow, and,
rushing through the high grass, he exposed himself
for an instant in crossing the summit of a bare knoll,
and received a ball from the little Fletcher in the
hind-quarters. Although badly wounded, he was too
nimble for my natives, who chased him with their
spears for about a quarter of a mile. These fellows
tracked him beautifully, and we at length found him
hiding in a deep pool in the river, and he was im
mediately despatched.
After a long walk, during which I did not obtain
-another shot, I returned to my resting-place, and,
refreshed by a bathe in the cool river, I slept as sound
as though in the most luxurious bed. in England. On

18 TURKS' STANDARD-BEARER KILLED. [chap. i.
the following morning I went out early, and shot a
.small species of antelope; and shortly after my return
to breakfast, the Turks' party arrived, bringing with
them about three hundred head of cattle that they had
captured from the Madi tribe. They did not seem at
.all in good spirits, and I shortly heard that they had
lost their standard-bearer, killed in the fight, and that
the flag had been in great peril, and had been saved
by the courage of a young Bari slave. The ensign
was separated from the main party, and was attacked
by four natives, who killed, the bearer, and snatched
away the flag: this would inevitably: have been lost,
had not the Bari boy of about fifteen shot the fore
most native dead with a pistol, and, snatching the
flag from his hands, ran with it towards the Turks,
some of whom coming up at that instant, the natives
did not think it wise to pursue their advantage. A
number of slaves had been captured ; among others,
several young children, one of whom was an infant.
These unfortunate women and children, excepting the
infant, were all tied by the neck with a long leathern
thong, so as to form a living chain, and guards were
set over them to prevent escape. The Bari natives
would make good soldiers, as they are far more cou
rageous than most of the savage tribes. The best men
among the party of Ibrahim are Baris ; among them.

is a boy named Arnout ; he is the drummer, and he
once saved his master in a fight by suddenly presenting
his drumstick like a pistol at several natives, who had
attacked him while unloaded. The natives, seeing the
determined attitude of the boy, and thinking that the
drumstick was a firearm, ran off. We started at day
break on 13th January, and, ascending the whole way,
we reached Shooa, in latitude 3° 4'. The route through
out had been of the same park-like character, inter
spersed with occasional hills of fine granite, piled iD
the enormous blocks so characteristic of that stone.
Shooa was a lovely place. A fine granite mountain
ascended in one block in a sheer, precipice for about
800 feet from its base, perfectly abrupt on. the eastern
side, while the other portions of the mountain were
covered with fine forest trees, and picturesquely dotted
over with villages. This country formed a natural
park, remarkably well watered by numerous rivulets,
ornamented with fine timber, and interspersed with
numerous high rocks of granite, which from a distance
produced the effect of ruined castles.
The pasturage was of a superior quality, and of the
same description as that of Farajoke. The country
being undulating, there was a small brook in every
valley that formed a natural drain. Accordingly, the
more elevated land was remarkably dry and healthy.

20 THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SHOOA. [chap/i.
On arrival at the foot of the abrupt mountain, we
camped beneath an immense india-rubber tree, that
afforded a delightful shade, from which elevated spot
we had a superb view of the surrounding country, and
could see the position of Debono's camp, about twenty-
•five miles to the west by north, at the foot of the
Faloro hills.
By Casella's thermometer, I determined the altitude
of Shooa to be 3,877 feet — 1,002 feet above the Asua
river, and 89 feet lower than Farajoke. These obser
vations of the thermometer agreed with the natural
appearance of the country, the Asua river forming the
main drain in a deep valley, into which innumerable
rivulets convey the drainage from both north and
south. Accordingly, the Asua, receiving the Atabbi
river, which is the main drain of the western face of
the Madi mountains, and the entire drainage of the
Madi and Shooa countries, together with that of exten
sive countries to the east of Shooa, including the rivers
Chombi and Udat, from Lira and Umiro, it becomes
a tremendous torrent so long as the rains continue, and
conveys a grand volume of water to the Nile ; but the
inclination of all these countries tending rapidly to the
north-west, the bed of the Asua river partakes of the
general incline, and so quickly empties after the cessa
tion of the rains that it becomes nil as a river. By the

chap, i.] FRUITFULNESS OF SHOOA. 21
mean of several observations I determined the latitude
of Shooa 3° 04', longitude 32° 04'. E. We were now
about twelve miles south of Debono's outpost, Faloro.
The whole of the Shooa country was assumed to belong
to Mohammed Wat-el-Mek, the vakeel of Debono, and
we had passed the ashes of several villages that had
been burnt and plimdered by these people between
Farajoke and this point ; the entire country had been
laid waste.
There was no great enief at Shooa ; each village had
a separate headman : formerly the population had
Occupied the lower ground, but since the Turks had
been established at Faloro and had plundered the
neighbouring tribes, the natives had forsaken their vil
lages and had located themselves among the mountains
for security. It was the intention of Ibrahim to break
through the rules accepted by the White Nile traders,
and to establish himself at Shooa, which, although
claimed by Debono's people, would form an excellent
point d'appui for operations towards the unknown
south. Shooa was " flowing with milk and honey ;" fowls,
butter, goats, were in abundance and ridiculously cheap ;
beads were of great value, as few had ever reached that
country. The women flocked to see Mrs. Baker, bring
ing presents of milk and flour, and receiving beads and

bracelets in return. The people were precisely the"
same as those of Obbo and Farajoke in language and
appearance, exceedingly mild in their manner, and
anxious to be oh good terms.
The cultivation in this country was superior to any
thing that I had seen' farther north ; large quantities of
sesame were grown and carefully harvested, the crop
being gathered and airariged!in oblong frames about
twenty feet long by twelve high. These were inclined
at an angle of about sixty— the- pods of the sesame
plants on one face, so that the frames resembled enor
mous brushes. In this manner the crop was dried
previous to being stored in the granaries. Of the latter
there were two kinds— the wicker-work smeared with
cow-dung, supported on four posts, with a thatched
roof; and a simple contrivance by fixing a stout pole
about twenty feet long perpendicularly in the earth.
About four feet from the ground a bundle of strong
and long reeds are tied tightly round the pole;
hdbps of wicker-work are then bound" round them
at intervals until they assume the form of an in
verted umbrella half expanded; this being filled
with grain,, fresh reeds are added, until the work
has- extended to within a few feet of the top
of the pole; the whole is then capped with reeds
securely strapped : the entire granary has the appear-

ance of a cigar, but thicker in proportion about the
middle. Two days after our arrival at Shooa, the whole of
our Obbo porters absconded : they had heard that we
were bound for Kamrasi's country, and having received
exaggerated accounts of his power from the Shooa
people, they had determined upon retreat : thus we
were at once unable to proceed, unless we could pro
cure porters from Shooa. This was exceedingly diffi
cult, as Kamrasi was well known here, and was not
loved. His country was known as " Quanda," and I
at once recognised the corruption of Speke's " Uganda."
The slave woman, " Bacheeta," who had formerly given
me in Obbo so much information concerning Kamrasi's
country, was to be our interpreter ; but we also had
the luck to discover a lad who had formerly been em
ployed by Mahommed in Faloro, who also spoke the
language of Quanda, and had learnt a little Arabic. I
now discovered that the slave woman Bacheeta had
formerly been in the service of a chief named Sali, who
had been killed by Kamrasi. Sali was a friend of
Rionga (Kamrasi's greatest enemy), and I had been
warned by Speke not to set foot upon Rionga's ter
ritory, or all travelling in Unyoro would be cut off. 1
plainly saw that Bacheeta was in favour of Rionga, as
a friend of the murdered Sali, by whom she had had

two children, and that she would most likely tamper
with the guide, and that we should be led to Rionga
instead of to Kamrasi. There were " wheels within
wheels." It was now reported that in the past year,
immediately after the departure of Speke and Grant
from Gondokoro, when Debono's people had left me in
the manner already described, they had marched direct
to Rionga, allied themselves to him, crossed the Nile
with his people, and had attacked Kamrasi's country,
killing about three hundred of his men, and capturing
many slaves. I now understood why they had deceived
me at Gondokoro : they had obtained the information
of the country from Speke's people, and had made use
of it by immediately attacking Kamrasi in conjunction
with Rionga.
- This would be a pleasant introduction for me on
entering Unyoro, as almost immediately after the
departure of Speke and Grant, Kamrasi had been
invaded by the very people into whose hands his mes
sengers had delivered them, when they were guided
from Unyoro to the Turks' station at Faloro ; he would
naturally have considered that the Turks had been sent
by Speke to attack him ; thus the road appeared closed
to all exploration, through the atrocities of Dfebqno's
people. Many of Ibrahim's men, at hearing this inteUigence, >

refused to proceed to Unyoro. Fortunately for me,
Ibrahim had been extremely unlucky in procuring
ivory ; the year had almost passed away, and he had a
mere nothing with which to return to Gondokoro. I
impressed upon him how enraged Koorshid would be
should he return with such a trifle ; already his own
men declared that he was neglecting razzias, because
he was to receive a present from me if we reached
Unyoro ; this they would report to his master (Koor
shid), and it would be beheved should he fail in
securing ivory. I guaranteed him 100 cantars (1 0,000
lbs.) if he would push on at all hazards with me to
Kamrasi, and secure me porters from Shooa. Ibrahim
behaved remarkably well. For some time past I had
acquired a great influence over him, and he depended
so thoroughly upon my opinion that he declared
himself ready to do all that I suggested. Accord
ingly I desired him to call his men together, and
to leave in Shooa all those who were disinclined to
follow us.
At once I arranged for a start, lest some fresh idea
should enter the ever suspicious brains of our followers,
and mar the expedition.
It was difficult to procure porters, and I abandoned
all that was not indispensable — our last few pounds of
rice and coffee, and even the great sponging-bath, that

emblem of civilization that had been clung to even
when the tent had been left behind.
;, On the 18th January, 1864, we left Shooa. : The
pure air of that country had invigorated us, and I was.
so improved in strength, that I enjoyed the excitement
of the launch into unknown lands. The Turks knew
nothing of the route south, and I accordingly took the
lead of the entire party. I had come to a distinct
understanding' with Ibrahim that Kamrasi's ' country
should belong to me;- not an act of felony would be
permitted ; all were, to be under my government, and
I would insure him at least 100 cantars of tusks.
< Eight miles of agreeable march through the usual
park-like country brought us to the village of Fatiko,
situated upon a splendid plateau of rock upon elevated
ground, with beautiful granite cliffs, bordering a level
table-land of fine grass that would have formed a race
course; The : high rocks: were covered with natives>
perched upon the outline like a flock of ravens.
We halted to rest under some fine trees- growing
among large isolated blocks of granite and gneiss.
In a short time the natives assembled around us :
they were wonderfully friendly ^ and insisted upon a
personal introduction to both myself and Mrs. Baker.
We were thus compelled to hold a levee; not the
passive and cold ceremony of Europe, but a most

CHAP- id i^r/A'o z^pze. 27
active undertaking, as each native that was introduced
performed the salaam of his country, by seizing both
my hands and raising my arms three times to their
full stretch above my head. After about one hundred
Fatikos had been thus gratified by our submission to
this infliction, and our arms had been subjected to at
least three hundred stretches each, I gave the order to
saddle the oxen immediately, and we escaped a further
proof of Fatiko affection that was already preparing,
as masses of natives were streaming down the rocks
hurrying to be introduced. Notwithstanding the
fatigue of the ceremony, I took a great fancy to these
poor people ; they had prepared a quantity of merissa
and a sheep for our lunch, which they begged us to
remain and enjoy before we started ; but the pumping.
action of half a village not yet gratified by a pre
sentation was too much ; and mounting our oxen, with
aching shoulders we bade adieu to Fatiko.
Descending the picturesque rocky hill of Fatiko, we
entered upon a totally distinct country. We had now;
before us an interminable sea of prairies, covering to,
the horizon a series of gentle undulations inclining
from east to west. There were no trees except the
dolape palms ; these were scattered at long intervals iii
the bright yellow surface of high grass. The path was;
narrow,' but good, and after an hour's march we halted.

many rivulets from Shooa, it forms a considerable torrent
during the rainy season, and joins the Nile in N. lat.
3° 32' at the limit reached by Signor Miani, 1859, the
first traveller who ever attained a point so far south in
Nile explorations from Egypt. There was no wood for
fires, neither dung of animals ; thus without fuel we
Went supperless to bed. Although the sun wa's pain
fully hot during the day, the nights were so cold (about
55° Fahr.) that we could hardly sleep.
For two days we marched . through high dry grass,
(about ten feet), when a clear night allowed an obser-
vation,and the meridian altitude of Cape'lla gave lati
tude 2° 45' 37". In this intermmable sea of prairie
it was interesting to watch our progress south.
On the following day our guide lost the .road ; a
large herd of elephants had obscured it by trampling
hundreds of paths in all directions. The wind was
strong from the north, and I proposed to clear the
country to the south by firing the prairies. There were
numerous deep swamps in the bottoms between the
undulations, and upon arrival at one of these green
dells we fired the grass on the opposite side. In a few
minutes it roared before us, and we enjoyed the grand
sight of the boundless prairies blazing like infernal

regions, and rapidly clearing a path south. Flocks
of buzzards and the beautiful varieties of fly-catchers
thronged to the dense smoke to prey upon the innu
merable insects that endeavoured to escape from the
approaching fire.
In about an hour we marched over the black and
smoking ground, every now and then meeting dead
stumps of palm trees blazing; until we at length
reached another swamp. There the fire had terminated
in its course south, being stopped by the high green
reeds, and it was raging to the east and west. Again
the tedious operation had to be performed, and the
grass was fired in many places on the opposite side of
the swamp, while we waited until the cleared way was
sufficiently cool to allow the march. We were perfectly
black, as the wind brought showers of ashes that fell
like snow, but turned us into Ethiopians. I had led the
way on foot from the hour we left Fatiko, as, the
country being uninhabited for five days' march between
that place and Kamrasi's, the men had more faith in
my steering by the compass than they had in the
native guide. I felt sure that we were being deceived,
and that the woman Bacheeta had directed the guide
to take us to Rionga's. Accordingly that night, when
Uanopus was in the meridian, I asked our conductor
to point by a star the direction of Karuma Falls. He

30 DECEIT OF, THE GUIDE. [chap, i
immediately pointed to Canopus, which, I knew by
Speke's map should be. the direction of Rionga's islands,
and I charged him with the deceit. He appeared very
much astonished, and asked me "why I wanted a
guide if I knew the way ? " confessing that Karuma
Falls were " a little to the east of the star." I thanked
Speke and Grant at that moment, and upon many other
occasions, for the map they had so generously given
me ! It has been my greatest satisfaction to have
completed their great discovery, and to bear testi
mony to the correctness of their map and general
observations. The march was exceedingly fatiguing : there was a
swamp at least every half . hour during the day, at
each of which we had the greatest difficulty in driving
the oxen, who were above the girths in mud. One
swamp was so deep that we had to carry the luggage
piecemeal on an angarep by about twelve men, and my
wife being subjected to the same operation was too
heavy, and the people returned with her as imprac
ticable. I accordingly volunteered for service; and
carried her on my back; but when in the middle
of the swamp, the tenacious bottom gave way, and I
sank, and remained immoveably fixed, while she flound
ered frog-like in the muddy water. I was extricated
by the united efforts of, several men, and she was

marched for upwards of ten hours per day, so great
were the delays in crossing the morasses and in clearing
off the grass jungle by burning.
On the fourth day we left the prairies, and entered
a noble forest ; this was also so choked with high grass
that it was impossible to proceed without burning the
country in advance. There had been no semblance of
a path for some time ; and the only signs of game that
we had seen were the tracks of elephants and a large
herd of buffaloes, the fire having scared all wild animals
from the neighbourhood. An attack of fever seized
me suddenly, and I was obliged to lie down for four
or five hours under a tree until the fit had passed
away, when, weak and good for nothing, I again
mounted my ox and rode on.
On the 22d January, from an elevated position in
the forest at sunrise, we saw a cloud of fog hanging in
a distant valley, which betokened the presence of the
Somerset river. The guide assured us that we should
reach the river that day. I extract the note from my
journal on that occasion : —
"Marched, 6h. 20m., reaching the Somerset river,
or Victoria White Nile. 1 never made so tedious a
journey, owing to the delays of grass, streams, and deep
swamps, but since we gained the forest these obstacles

were not so numerous. Many tracks of elephants,
rhinoceros, and buffaloes ; but we saw nothing. Halted
about eighty feet above the river ; altitude above sea-
level, by observation, 3,864 ft. I went to the river
to see if the other side was inhabited ; saw two
villages on an island ; the natives came across in a
canoe, bringing the brother of Rionga with them ;
the guide, as I had feared during the journey, has.
deceived us, and taken us direct to Rionga's country.
On the north side the river all is uninhabited forest,
full of buffalo and elephant pitfalls, into which three
of our cattle have already fallen, including my beautiful
riding ox, which is thus so sprained as to be rendered
useless. " The natives at first supposed we were Mahommed
Wat-el-Mek's people, but finding their mistake they
would give no information, merely saying that the
lake was not far from here. They said, 'they were
friends of Mahommed's people who attacked Kamrasi,
and Rionga being his enemy became their ally.' I
must now be very careful, lest the news should reach
Kamrasi that I am in Rionga's country, which- would
cut off all chance of travelling in Unyoro.
"The slave woman, Bacheeta, secretly instructed'
the guide to lead us to Rionga instead of to Kamrasi,
precisely as I had suspected. The Karuma Falls are

a day's march east of this, at which point we must
cross the river. Obtained a clear observation of Capella,
meridian altitude showing latitude 2° 18'N."
We could get no supplies from Rionga's people,
who returned to their island after their conference with
Bacheeta, promising to send us some plantains and a,
basket of flour ; but upon gaining their secure retreat
they shouted, " That we might go to Kamrasi if we
liked, but that we should receive no assistance from
them." Early in the morning we started for Karuma.
This part of the forest was perfectly open, as the grass
had been burnt by the natives about three weeks ago,
and the young shoots of the vines were appearing from
the scorched roots ; among other plants was an abun
dance of the prickly asparagus, of which I collected
a basketful. Nothing could exceed the beauty of the
march. Our course through the noble forest was
parallel with the river, that roared beneath us on our
right in a succession of rapids and falls between high
cliffs covered with groves of bananas and varieties of
palms, including the graceful- wild date — the certain
sign of either marsh or river. The Victoria Nile or
Somerset river was about 150 yards wide; the cliffs
on the south side were higher than those upon the
north, being about 150 feet above the river. These
VOL. II. D

34 THE KARUMA FALLS. [chap. i.
heights were thronged with natives, who had collected
from the numerous villages that ornamented the cliffs
situated among groves of plantains ; they were armed
with spears and shields ; the population ran parallel to
our line of march, shouting and gesticulating as though
daring us to cross the river.
After a most enjoyable march through the exciting
scene of the glorious river crashing over innumerable
falls — and in many places ornamented with rocky
islands, upon which were villages and plantain groves
— w;e at length approached the Karuma Falls close to
the village of Atada above the ferry. The heights
were crowded with natives, and a canoe was sent
across to within parleying distance of our side, as the
roar of the rapids prevented our voices from being
heard except at a short distance. Bacheeta now ex
plained, that " Speke's brother had arrived from his
country to pay Kamrasi a visit, and had brought him
valuable presents."
" Why has he brought so many men with him ? "
inquired the people from the canoe.
" There are so many presents for the M'Kamma
(king) that he has many men to carry them," shouted
Bacheeta. " Let us look at him," cried the headman in the
boat ; having prepared for the introduction by changing

chap, i.] WELCOME BY KAMRASI'S PEOPLE. 35
my clothes in a grove of plantains for my dressing-
room, and altering my costume to a tweed suit, some
thing similar to that worn by Speke, I climbed up a
high and almost perpendicular rock that formed a
natural pinnacle on the face of the cliff, and, waving
my cap to the crowd on the opposite side, I looked
almost as imposing as Nelson in Trafalgar Square.
I instructed Bacheeta, who climbed up the giddy
height after me, to shout to the people that an English
lady, my wife, had also arrived, and that we wished
immediately to be presented to the king and his
family, as we had come to thank him for his kind
treatment of Speke and Grant, who had arrived safe
in their own country. Upon this being explained and
repeated several times, the canoe approached the shore.
I ordered all our people to retire, and to conceal
themselves among the plantains, that the natives might
not be startled by so imposing a force, while Mrs. Baker
and I advanced alone to meet Kamrasi's people, who
were men of some importance. Upon landing through
the high reeds, they immediately recognised the simi
larity of my beard and general complexion to that of
Speke ; and their welcome was at once displayed by
the most extravagant dancing and gesticulating with
lances and shields, as though intending to attack,
rushing at me with the points of their lances thrust

36 PASSAGE OF THE RIVER FORBIDDEN. [chap. i.
close to my face, and shouting and singing in great
excitement. I made each of them a present of a bead necklace,-
and explained to them my wish that there should be
no delay in my presentation to Kamrasi, as Speke had
complained that he had been kept waiting fifteen days
before the king had condescended to see him ; that, if
this occurred, no Englishman would ever visit him, as
such a reception would be considered an insult 
The headman replied that he felt sure I was not an
impostor ; but, that very shortly after the departure of
Speke and Grant in the previous year, a number of
people had arrived in their name, introducing them
selves as their greatest friends : they had been ferried
across the river, and well received by Kamrasi's orders,
and had been presented with ivory, slaves, and leopard
skins, as tokens of friendship ; but they had departed,
and suddenly returned with Rionga's people, and had
attacked the village in which they had been so well
received; and upon the country being assembled to
resist them, about three hundred of Kamrasi's men
had been killed in the fight. The king had, there
fore, given orders that, upon pain of death, no stranger
should cross the river. He continued : that when they
saw our people marching along the bank of the river,
they imagined them to be the same party that had

attacked them formerly, and they were prepared to
resist them, and had sent on a messenger to Kamrasi,
who was three days' march from Karuma at his capital
M'rooli ; until they received a reply, it would be im
possible to allow us to enter the country. He promised
to despatch another messenger immediately to in
form the king who we were, but that we must cer
tainly wait until his return. I explained that we had
nothing to eat, and that it would be very incon
venient to remain in such a spot; that I considered
the suspicion displayed was exceedingly unfair, as they
must see that my wife and I were white people like
Speke and Grant, whereas those who had deceived
them were of a totally different race, all being either
black or brown.
I told him that it did not much matter ; that I had
very beautiful presents intended for Kamrasi ; but that
another great king would be only too glad to accept
them, without throwing obstacles in my way. I should
accordingly return with my presents.
At the same time I ordered a handsome Persian
carpet, about fifteen feet square, to be displayed as one
•of the presents intended for the king. The gorgeous
colours, as the carpet was unfolded, produced a general
exclamation; before the effect of astonishment wore
off, I had a basket unpacked, and displayed upon a

38 THE NATIVES' DREAD OF KAMRASI. [chap. i.
cloth a heap of superb necklaces that we had prepared
while at Obbo of the choicest beads, many as large
as marbles, and glittering with every colour of the
rainbow. The garden of jewels of Aladdin's wonderful
lamp could not have produced more enticing fruit.
Beads were extremely rare in Kamrasi's land ; the few
that existed had arrived from Zanzibar, and all that I
exhibited were entirely new varieties. I explained that
I had many other presents, but that it was not neces
sary to unpack them, as we were about to return with
them to visit another king, who lived some days'
journey distant. " Don't go ; don't go away," said the
headman and his companions. "Kamrasi will  ."
Here an unmistakable pantomimic action explained their
meaning better than words ; throwing their heads well
back, they sawed across their throats with their fore
fingers, making horrible grimaces, indicative of the
cutting of throats. I could not resist laughing at the
terror that my threat of returning with the presents
had created ; they explained, that Kamrasi would not
only kill them, but would destroy the entire village of
Atada should we return without visiting him, but that he
would perhaps punish them in precisely the same manner
should they ferry us across without special orders.
" Please yourselves," I replied ; " if my party is not
ferried across by the time the sun reaches that spot on

the heavens (pointing to the position it would occupy
at about 3 p.m.), I shall return." In a state of great
excitement they promised to hold a conference on the
other side, and to see what arrangements could be
made. They returned to Atada, leaving the whole
party, including Ibrahim, exceedingly disconcerted —
having nothing to eat, an impassable river before
them, and five days' march of uninhabited wilderness
in their rear.
Karuma Falls were about three hundred yards to our
left as we faced Atada ; they were very insignificant,
not exceeding five feet in height, but curiously regular,
as a ridge of rock over which they fell extended Hke a
wall across the river. The falls were exactly at the
bend of the river, which, from that point, turned
suddenly to the west.
The whole day passed in shouting and gesticulating
our peaceful intentions to the crowd assembled on the
heights on the opposite side of the river, but the boat
did not return until long after the time appointed ;
even then the natives would only approach sufficiently
near to be heard, but nothing would induce them to
land. They explained, that there was a division of
opinion among the people on the other side ; some
were in favour of receiving us, but the greater number
were of opinion that we intended hostilities ; therefore

40 RESOLVE TO CROSS THE RIVER ALONE. [chap. i.
we must wait until orders could be sent from the
king. To assure the people of our peaceful intentions, I
begged them to take Mrs. Baker and myself alone,
and to leave the armed party on this side the river
until a reply should be received from Kamrasi. At
this suggestion the boat immediately returned to the
other side. ;
The day passed away, and as the sun set we per
ceived the canoe again paddling across the river : this
time it approached direct, and the same people landed
that had received the necklaces in the morning. They
said that they had held a conference with the headman,
and that they had agreed to receive my wife and
myself, but no other person. I replied, that my
servants must accompany us, as we were quite as great
personages as Kamrasi, and could not possibly travel
without attendants. To this they demurred ; therefore
I dropped the subject, and proposed to load the canoe
with all the presents intended for Kamrasi. There
was no objection to this, and I ordered Richarn, Saat,
and Ibrahim to get into the canoe to stow away the
luggage as it should be handed to them, but on no
account to leave the boat. I had already prepared
everything in readiness, and a bundle of rifles tied up
in a large blanket, and 500 rounds of ball cartridge,



## p. 41 (#65) ##############################################

chap, i.] THE FERRY OF ATADA. 41
were unconsciously received on board as presents. I
had instructed Ibrahim to accompany us as my servant,
as he was better than most of the men in the event of
a row ; and I had given orders, that in case of a pre
concerted signal being given, the whole force should
swim the river, supporting themselves and guns
upon bundles of papyrus rush. The men thought us
perfectly mad, and declared that we should be mur
dered immediately when on the other side ; how
ever, they prepared for crossing the river in case of
treachery. At the last moment, when the boat was about to
leave the shore, two of the best men jumped in with
their guns ; however, the natives positively refused to
start ; therefore to avoid suspicion, I ordered them to
retire, but I left word that on the morrow I would send
the canoe across with supplies, and that one or two
men should endeavour to accompany the boat to our
side on every trip.
It was quite dark when we started : the canoe was
formed of a large hollow tree, capable of holding twenty
people, and the natives paddled us across the rapid
current just below the falls. A large fire was blazing
upon the opposite shore, on a level with the river, to
guide us to the landing place. Gliding through a
narrow passage in the reecls, we touched the shore and

42 RECEPTION BY KEEDJA. [chap. i.
landed upon a slippery rock close to the fire, amidst a
crowd of people, who immediately struck up a deafen
ing welcome with horns and flageolets, and marched
us up the steep face of the rocky cliff through a dark
grove of bananas. Torches led the way, followed by a
long pile of spearmen ; then came the noisy band and
ourselves — -I towing my wife up the precipitous path,
while my few attendants followed behind with a
number of natives who had volunteered to carry the
luggage. On arrival at the top of the cliff we were about 180
feet above the river, and after a walk of about a quarter
of a mile we were triumphantly led into the heart of
the village, and halted in a small courtyard in front of
the headman's residence.
Keedja waited to receive us by a blazing fire. Not
having had anything to eat, we were uncommonly
hungry, and to our great delight a basketful of ripe
plantains was presented to us; these were the first that
I had seen for many years. A gourd bottle of plantain
wine was offered, and immediately emptied ; it re
sembled extremely poor cider. We were now sur
rounded by a mass of natives, no longer the naked
savages to whom we had been accustomed, but well-
dressed men wearing robes of bark cloth arranged in
various fashions, generally like the Arab " tope," or the

chap, i.] I LULL THE SUSPICIONS OF THE NATIVES. 43
Roman toga. Several of the headmen now explained
to us the atrocious treachery of Debono's men, who had
been welcomed as friends of Speke and Grant, but who
had repaid the hospitality by plundering and massa-
creing their hosts. I assured them that no one would
be more wroth than Speke when I should make him
aware of the manner in which his name had been used,
and that I should make a point of reporting the cir
cumstance to the British Government. At the same
time I advised them not to trust any but white people,
should others arrive in my name, or in those of Speke
and Grant. I upheld their character as that of English
men, and I begged them to state " if ever they had
deceived them ?" They replied, that " there could not
be better men." I answered, " You must trust me, as
I trust entirely in you, and have placed myself in your
hands ; but if you have ever had cause to mistrust a
white man, kill me at once ! — either kill me, or trust '
in me, but let there be no suspicions."
They seemed much pleased with the conversation,
and a man stepped forward and showed me a small
string of blue beads that Speke had given him for fer
rying him across the river. This little souvenir of my
old friend was most interesting ; after a year's wander
ing and many difficulties, this was the first time that I
had actually come upon his track. Many people told



## p. 44 (#68) ##############################################

44 APPELLATIONS OF SPEKE AND GRANT. [chap. i.
me that, they had known Speke and Grant ; the former
bore the name of " MoUegge " (the bearded one), while
Grant had been named "Masanga" (the elephant's
tusk), owing to his height. The latter had been
wounded at Lucknow during the Indian mutiny, and
I ' spoke to the people of the loss of his finger ; this
crowned my success, as they knew without doubt that
I had .seen him. It was late, therefore I begged the
crowd to depart, but to send a messenger the first
thing in the morning to inform Kamrasi who we were,
and to beg him to permit us to- visit him without loss
of time.
A bundle of straw was laid on the ground for Mrs.
Baker and myself, and in lieu of other beds, the ground
was our resting-place.
It was bitterly cold that night, as the guns were
packed up in the large blanket, and, not wishing to
expose them, we were contented with a Scotch plaid
each. Ibrahim, Saat, and Richarn watched by turns.
On the foUowing morning an immense crowd of natives
thronged to see us. There was a very beautiful tree
about a hundred yards from the viUage, capable of
shading upwards of a thousand men, and I proposed
that we should sit beneath this protection and hold a
conference. The headman of the village gave us a
large hut with a grand doorway of about seven feet



## p. 45 (#69) ##############################################

chap, i.] FREEMASONRY OF UNYORO. 45
high, of which my wife took possession, while I joined
the crowd at the tree. There were about six hundred
men seated respectfuUy on the ground around me, while
I sat with my back to the huge knotty trunk, with
Ibrahim and Richarn at a few paces distant.
The subject of conversation was merely a repetition
of that of the preceding night, with the simple addition
of some questions respecting the lake. Not a man
would give the shghtest information; the only reply,
upon my forcing the question, was the pantomime
already described by passing the forefinger across the
throat, and exclaiming, " Kamrasi !" The entire popu
lation was tongue-locked. I tried the chUdren ; to no
purpose, they were aU dumb. White-headed old men
I questioned as to the distance of the lake from this
point; they replied, "We are chUdren, ask the old
people who know the country." Never was freemasonry
more secret than the land of Unyoro. It was useless
to persevere. I therefore changed the subject by saying
that our people were starving on the other side, and
that provisions must be sent immediately. In all
savage countries the most trifling demand requires
much talking. They said that provisions were scarce,
and that until Kamrasi should give the order, they
could give no supphes. Understanding most thoroughly
the natural instincts of the natives, I told them that I

46 NATIVE CURIOSITY. [chap. i.
must send the. canoe across to fetch three oxen that I
wished to slaughter. The bait took at once, and several
men ran for the canoe, and we sent one of our black
women across with a message to the people that three
men, with their guns and ammunition, were to accom
pany the canoe and guide three oxen across by swim
ming them with ropes tied to their horns. These were
the riding oxen of some of the men that it was neces
sary to slaughter, to exchange the flesh for flour and
other supplies.
Hardly had the few boatmen departed, than some
one shouted suddenly, and the entire crowd sprang to
their feet and rushed towards the hut where I had left
Mrs. Baker. For the moment I thought that the hut was
on fire, and I joined the crowd and arrived at the door
way, where I found a tremendous press to see some
extraordinary sight. Every one was squeezing for the
best place ; and, driving them on one side, I found the
wonder that had excited their curiosity. The hut
being very dark, my wife had employed her solitude
during my conference with the natives in dressing her
hair at the doorway, which, being very long and
blonde, was suddenly noticed by some natives — a
shout was given, the rush described had taken place,
and the hut was literally mobbed by the crowd of
savages eager to see the extraordinary novelty. The

GoriUa would not make a greater stir in London streets
than we appeared to create at Atada.
The oxen shortly arrived ; one was immediately
killed, and the flesh divided into numerous smaU
portions arranged upon the hide.
Blonde hair and white people immediately lost their
attractions, and the crowd turned their attention to
beef — we gave them to understand that we required
flour, beans, and sweet potatoes in exchange.
The market soon went briskly, and whole rows of
girls and women arrived, bringing baskets filled with
the desired provisions. The women were neatly dressed
in short petticoats with a double skirt — many exposed
the bosom, whUe others wore a piece of bark cloth
arranged as a plaid across the chest and shoulders.
This cloth is the produce of -a species of fig-tree, the
bark of which is stripped off in large pieces and then
soaked in water and beaten with a mallet : in appear
ance it much resembles corduroy, and is the colour of
tanned leather ; the finer qualities are peculiarly soft to
the touch, as though of woven cotton. Every garden
is fuU of this species of tree, as their cultivation is
necessary for the supply of clothing ; when a man
takes a wife he plants a certain number of trees, that
are to be the taUors of the expected family.
The market being closed} the canoe was laden with

48 COMPARATIVE CIVILIZATION OF UNYOROS. [chap. i.
provisions, and sent across to our hungry people on
the other side the river.
The difference between the Unyoro people and the
tribes we had hitherto seen was most striking. On
the north side of the river the natives were either
stark naked, or wore a mere apology for' clothing in
the shape of a skin slung across their shoulders : the
river appeared to be the limit of utter savagedom, and
the people of Unyoro considered the indecency of naked
ness precisely in the same light as among Europeans.
The northern district of Unyoro at Karuma is caUed
Chopi, the language being the same as the Madi,
and different to the southern and central portions of
the kingdom. The people are distinct in their type,
but they have the woolly hair of negroes, like aU other
tribes of the White NUe.
By astronomical observation I determined the lati
tude of Atada at Karuma FaUs, 2° 15'; and by CaseUa's
thermometer, the altitude of the river level above the
sea 3,996 feet.
After the disgusting naked tribes that we had been
travelling amongst for more than twelve months, it was
a delightful change to find ourselves in comparative
civilization : this was evinced not only in the decency
of clothing, but- also in the manufactures of the
country. The blacksmiths were exceedingly clever, and

chap, i.] NATIVE POTTERY. 49
used iron hammers instead of stone ; they drew fine
wire from the thick copper and brass wire that they
received from Zanzibar ; their bellows were the same
as those used by the more savage tribes — but the
greatest proof of their superior civilization was ex
hibited in their pottery.
Nearly all savages have some idea of earthenware ;
but the scale of advancement of a country between
savagedom and civilization may generaUy be deter
mined by the example of its pottery. The Chinese,
who were as civilized as they are at the present
day at a period when the English were barbarians,;
were ever celebrated for the manufacture of porcelain,
and the difference between savages and civilized
countries is always thus exemplified ; the savage
makes earthenware, but the civilized make porcelain
— thus the gradations from the rudest earthen
ware wUl mark the improvement in the scale of
civilization. The prime utensU of the African savage
is tbe gourd ; the sheU of which is the bowl presented
to him by nature as the first idea from which he is to
model. Nature, adapting herself to the requirements
of animals and man, appears in these savage countries
to yield abundantly much that savage man can want.
Gourds with exceedingly strong shells not only grow
wUd, which if divided in halves afford bowls, but

50 THE BOTTLE GOURDS USED AS MODELS. [chap. i.
great and quaint varieties form natural bottles of aU
sizes, from the tiny phial to the demi-john containing
five gallons. The most savage tribes content themselves
with the productions of nature, confining their manu
facture to a coarse and half-baked jar for carrying
water; but the semi-savage, like those of Unyoro,
affords an example of the first step towards manu
facturing art, by the fact of copying from nature :
the utter savage makes use of nature — the gourd is
his utensil; and the more advanced natives of Unyoro
adopt it as the model for their pottery. They make
a fine quality of jet black earthenware, producing
excellent tobacco-pipes most finely worked in imitation
of the small egg-shaped gourd ; of the same earthen
ware they make extremely pretty bowls, and also
bottles copied from the varieties of the bottle gourds :
thus, in this humble art, we see the first effort of the
human mind in manufactures, in taking nature for a
model; precisely as the beautiful Corinthian capital
originated in a design from a basket of flowers.
A few extracts from my journal wUl describe the
delay at Atada : —

None of the principal chiefs have yet appeared. Kidg-

Vacoua of Mauritius, but the leaves are of a different
texture, producing a species of flax. Every day there
is a report that the headman, sent by Kamrasi, is on
the road ; but I see no signs of him.
"Jan. 28th. — Reports brought that Kamrasi has sent
his headman with a large force, including some of
Speke's deserters. They are to inspect me, and report
whether I am reaUy a white man and an Englishman.
If so, I beUeve we are to proceed ; if not, I suppose we
are to be exterminated. Lest there should be any
mistake I have taken aU necessary precautions ; but,

having only eight men on this side the river, I shall
be certain to. lose my baggage in the event of a dis
turbance, as no one could transport it to the canoe.
"-Jan. 29th. — Plantains, sweet potatoes, and eggs
supplied in great quantities. The natives are much
amused at our trying the eggs in water before pur
chase. Plantains, three for - one smaU bead. The
headman is. expected to-day. A polite message arrived
last night from Kamrasi inviting us to his capital, and
apologizing for. being unable to come in person. This

within an hour's march of Atada.
"In mid-day the headman arrived with a great
number of men, accompanied by three of Speke's
deserters, one of whom has been created a chief by
Kamrasi, and presented with two wives.
"I received them standing; and after thorough
inspection I was pronounced to be ' Speke's own
brother,' and all were satisfied. However, the busi
ness was not yet over : plenty of talk, and another
delay of four days, was declared necessary untU the
king "should reply _ to the satisfactory . message about
to be sent. Losing all patience, I stormed, declaring.
Kamrasi to be mere dust ; while a white man was
a king in comparison. I ordered aU my luggage to
be conveyed immediately to the canoe, and declared

that I would return immediately to my own country ;
that I did not wish to see any one so utterly devoid
of manners as Kamrasi, and that no other white man
would ever visit his kingdom.
" The effect was magical ! I rose hastily to depart.
The chiefs implored, declaring that Kamrasi would
kiU them all if I retreated : to prevent which mis
fortune they secretly instructed the canoe to be re
moved. I was in a great rage ; and about 40^0 natives,
who were present, scattered in aU quarters, thinking
that there would be a serious quarrel. I told the chiefs
that nothing should stop me, and that I would seize
the canoe by force unless my whole party should be
brought over "from the opposite side that instant. This
was agreed upon. One of Ibrahim's men exchanged
and drank blood from the arm of Speke's deserter, who
was Kamrasi's representative ; and peace thus firmly
established, several canoes were at once employed, and
sixty of our men were brought across the river before
sunset. The natives had nevertheless taken the pre
caution to send aU their women away from the village."
" Jan. 30th. — This morning aU remaining men and
baggage were brought across the river, and suppUes
were brought in large quantities for sale. We are to
march to-morrow direct to Kamrasi's capital; they say
he wiU give me a guide to the lake.

54 NEATNESS OF THE NATIVES IN PACKING, [chap. I.
" The natives of this country are particularly neat in
aU they do ; they never bring anything to seU unless
carefully packed in the neatest parcels, generaUy formed
of the bark of the plantain, and sometimes of the inner
portions of reeds stripped into snow-white stalks,' which
are bound round the parcels with the utmost care.
Should the plantain cider, 'maroua,' be brought in a
jar, the mouth is neatly covered with a fringe-like mat
of these clean white rushes split into shreds^ Not even
tobacco is brought for sale unless most' carefuUy
packed. During a journey, a pretty, bottle-shaped,
long-necked gourd is carried with a store of plantain
cider ; the mouth of the bottle is stopped with a bundle
of the white rush shreds, through which a reed is
inserted that reaches to the bottom : thus the drink
can be sucked up during the march without the necessity
of halting ; nor is it possible to spiU it by the move
ment of walking.
" The natives prepare the skins of goats very beauti
fully, making them as soft as chamois leather ; these
they cut into squares, and sew them together as neatly
as would be effected by a European tailor, converting
them into mantles, which are prized far more highly
than bark cloth, on account of their durabihty : they
manufacture their own needles, not by boring the eye,-
but by sharpening the end into a fine point and

turning it over, the extremity being hammered into a
smaU cut in the body of the needle to prevent it from
catching. " Clothes of all kinds are in great demand here, and
would be accepted to any amount in exchange for
ivory. Beads are extremely valuable, and would pur
chase ivory in large quantities, but the country would,
in a few years, become overstocked. Clothes being
perishable articles would always be in demand to
supply those worn out ; but beads, being imperishable,
very soon glut the market. Here is, as I had always
anticipated, an opportunity for commencing legitimate
trade." " Jan. 31st. — Throngs of natives arrived to carry
our luggage gratis by the king's orders. Started at
7 A.M. and marched ten miles and a half parallel with
the NUe, south ; the country thickly populated, and
much cultivated with sesame^ sweet potatoes, beans,
tuUaboon, dhurra, Indian corn, and plantains.
" The native porters relieved each other at every
village, fresh men being always in readiness on the
road. The river is here on a level with the country,
having no high banks ; thus there is a great faU from
Karuma towards the west. Halted in a grove of
plantains near a viUage. The plantains of this countiy

' Matta-Goomi.' There is now no secret about the
, lake. Both he and aU the natives say that the Luta
• N'zige lake is larger than the Victoria N'yanza, and
that both lakes are fed by rivers from the great moun-
. tain Bartooma. Is that mountain the M'fumbiro of
Speke ? the difference of name being local. According
to the position of the mountain pointed out by the
chief, it bears from this spot S. 45° W. Latitude of

" The natives of Unyoro have a very superior imple
ment to the molote used among the northern tribes ; it
is an extremely powerful hoe, fitted upon a handle,
simUar to those used on the sugar estates in the West
Indies, but the blade is heart-shaped : with these they

after a short march of three miles and a half. Here
we are detained for a day whUe a message is sent to

day, that the houses he had prepared for me had been
destroyed by fire, and to beg me to wait untU he should
have completed others. The truth is, he is afraid of
our large party, and he delays us in every manner
possible, in order to receive daUy reports of our beha
viour on the road. Latitude by observation at this
point, 1° 50' 47" N."
"Feb. 7th.- — Detained here for a day. I never saw
natives so filthy in their dwellings as the people •

owner, which, being littered down with straw, is a mere
cattle-shed, redolent of man and beast. The natives
sleep upon a mass of straw, upon a raised platform, this
at night being covered with a dressed skin. Yester
day the natives brought coffee in smaU quantities to
seU. .They have no idea of using it as a drink, but
simply chew it raw as a stimulant. It is a smaU and
finely-shaped grain, with a good flavour. It is brought
from the country of Utumbi, about a degree south of

ing's march formed the chord of the arc. Halted ;
again delayed for the day, as we are not far from the
capital, and a messenger must be sent to the king for
instructions before we proceed. I never saw such
abject cowardice as the redoubted Kamrasi exhibits.
Debono's vakeel having made a razzia upon his frontier
has so cowed him, that he has now left his residence,
and retreated to the other side of a river, from which
point he sends false messages to delay our advance as
much as possible. There is a total absence of dignity
in his behaviour ; no great man is sent to parley, but
the king receives contradictory reports from the many-
tongued natives that have utterly perplexed him. He
is told by some that we are the same people that came
with Ras-GaUa (Debono's captain), and he has neither
the courage to repel or to receive us. Our force of 112
armed men could eat the country in the event of a
fight, provided that a large supply of ammunition were
at hand. The present store is sixty rounds for each
man, which would not be sufficient."
" Feb. 9th. — After endless discussions and repeated
messages exchanged with the king, he at length sent
word that I was to come alone. To this I objected;
and, upon my starting with my men, the guide refused
to proceed. I at once turned back, and told the chief
(our guide) that I no longer wished to see Kamrasi,

60 ARRIVE AT LAST AT THE CAPITAL. [chap. i.
who must be a mere fool, and I should return to my
country. This created a great stir, and messengers
were at once despatched to the king, who returned an
answer that I might bring all my men, but that only
five of the Turks could be aUowed with Ibrahim. The
woman Bacheeta had told the natives that we were
separate parties.
" A severe attack of fever prevented me from starting.
This terrible complaint worries me sadly, as I have no
quinine." "Feb. 10th. — The woman Fadeela died of fever. I
. am rather better, and the chief is already here to
escort us to Kamrasi. After a quick march of three
hours through immense woods, we reached the capital —
a large village of grass huts, situated on a barren slope.
We were ferried across a river in large canoes, capable
of carrying fifty men, but formed of a single tree up
wards of four feet wide. Kamrasi was reported to be
in his residence on the opposite side ; but, upon our
arrival at the south bank, we found ourselves thoroughly
deceived. We were upon a miserable flat, level with the
river, and in the wet season forming a marsh at the
junction with the Kafoor river with the Somerset. The
latter river bounded the flat on the east, very wide and
sluggish, and much overgrown with papyrus and lotus.
The river we had just crossed was the Kafoor ; it was



## p. 61 (#87) ##############################################

chap, i.] IMPRISONED ON THE MARSH. 61
perfectly dead water, and about eighty yards wide,
including the beds of papyrus on either side. We were
shown some filthy huts that were to form our camp.
The spot was swarming with mosquitoes, and we had
nothing to eat except a few fowls that I had brought
with me. Kamrasi was on the other side ofthe river:
they had cunningly separated us from him, and had
returned with the canoes. Thus we were prisoners
upon the swamp. This was our welcome from the
King of Unyoro ! I now heard that Speke and Grant
had been lodged in this same spot."
"Feb. 10th. — Ibrahim was extremely nervous, as
were also my men ; they declared that treachery was
intended, .as the boats had been withdrawn, and they
proposed that we should swim the river and march
back to our main party, who had been left three hours
in the rear. I was iU with fever, also my wife, and
the unwholesome air of the marsh aggravated the
disease. Our luggage had been left at our last station,
as this was a condition stipulated by Kamrasi : thus we
had to sleep upon the damp ground of the marsh in
the filthy hut, as the heavy dew at night necessitated
shelter. With great difficulty I accompanied Ibrahim
and a few men to the bank of the river where we had
landed yesterday, and climbing upon a white ant hill
to obtain a view over the high reeds I scanned the

62 EXPECTATION OF AN ATTACK. [chap. i.
village with a telescope. The scene was rather exciting ;
crowds of people were rushing about in -aU directions
and gathering from aU quarters towards the river : the
slope from the river to the town M'rooli was black with
natives, and I saw about a dozen large canoes preparing
to transport them to our side. I returned from my
elevated observatory to Ibrahim, who on the low ground
only a few yards distant could not see the opposite side
of the river owing to the high grass and reeds. With
out saying more, I merely begged him to mount upon
the ant-hiU and look towards M'rooli. Hardly had
he cast a glance at the scene described, than he jumped
clown from his stand, and cried, ' They are going to
attack us ! ' ' Let us retreat to the camp and prepare
for a fight !' ' Let us fire at them from here as they
cross in the canoes,' cried others ; ' the buckshot wiU
clear them off when packed in the boats.' This my
panic-stricken foUowers would have done, had I not
been present.
" ' Fools ! ' I said, ' do you not see that the natives have
no shields with them, but merely lances ? — would they
commence an attack without their shields ? Kamrasi
is coming in state to visit us.' This idea was by no
means accepted by my people, and we reached our little
camp, and for the sake of precaution we stationed the
men in positions behind a hedge of thorns. Ibrahim

had managed to bring twelve picked men instead of
five as stipulated ; thus we were a party of twenty-four.
I was of very little use, as the fever was so strong upon
me that I lay helpless on the ground."
In a short time the canoes arrived, and for about an
hour they were employed in crossing and re-crossing,
and landing great numbers of men, until they at
length advanced and took possession of some huts about
200 yards from our camp. They now haUooed out
that Kamrasi had arrived ! and seeing some oxen
with the party, I felt sure they had no evU intentions.
I ordered my men to carry me in their arms to the
king, and to accompany me with the presents, as I was
determined to have a personal interview, although only
fit for a hospital.
Upon my approach, the crowd gave way, and I was
shortly laid on a mat at the king's feet. He was a
fine-looking man, but with a pecuUar expression of
countenance, owing to his extremely prominent eyes ;
he was about six feet high, beautifuUy clean, and was
dressed in a long robe of bark-cloth most gracefuUy
folded. The nails of his hands and feet were carefuUy
attended, and his complexion was about as dark a
brown as that of an Abyssinian. He sat upon a copper
stool placed upon a carpet of leopard skins, and he was
surrounded by about ten of his principal chiefs.

64 CONVERSATION WITH THE KING. [chap. i.
Our interpreter, Bacheeta, now informed him who I
was, and what were my intentions. He said that he
was sorry I had been so long on the road, but that he
had been obhged to be cautious, having been deceived
by Debono's people. I replied, that I was an English
man, a friend of Speke and Grant — that they had
described the reception they had met with from him,
and that I had come to thank him, and to offer him a
few presents in return for his kindness, and to request
him to give me a guide to the Lake Luta N'zige". He
laughed at the name, and repeated it several times with
his chiefs, —he then said, it was not Luta, but M-wootan
N'zige- — but that it was six months' journey from
M'rooli, and that in my weak condition I could not
possibly, reach it; that I should die upon the road,
and that the king of my country would perhaps imagine
that I. had been murdered, and might invade his terri
tory. I replied, that I was weak with the toU of years
in the hot countries of Africa, but that I was in search
of the great lake, and should not return untU I had
succeeded ; that I had no king, but a powerful
Queen who watched over aU her subjects, and that no
Englishman could be murdered with impunity ; there
fore he should send me to the lake without delay, and .
there would be the lesser chance of my dying in his
country.



## p. 65 (#91) ##############################################

chap, i.] HIS RECEPTION OF MY PRESENTS. 65
I explained that the river Nile flowed for a distance
of two years' journey through wonderful countries,
and reached the, sea, from which many valuable articles
would be sent to him in exchange for ivory, could I
only discover the great lake. As a proof of this, I had
brought him a few curiosities that I trusted he would
accept, and I regretted that the impossibility of pro
curing porters had necessitated the abandonment of
others that had been intended for him.
I ordered the men to unpack the Persian carpet,
which was spread upon the ground before him. I then
gave him an Abbia (large white Cashmere mantle), a
red silk netted sash, a pair of scarlet Turkish shoes,
several pairs of socks, a double-barrelled gun and
ammunition, and a great heap of first-class beads
made up into gorgeous necklaces and girdles. He
took very httle notice of the presents, but requested
that the gun might be fired off. This was done, to the
utter confusion of the crowd, who rushed away in such
haste, that they tumbled over each other like so many
rabbits ; this deUghted the king, who, although himself
startled, now roared with laughter. He told me that
I must be hungry and thirsty, therefore he hoped 1
would accept something to eat and drink : accordingly
he presented me with seventeen cows, twenty pots of
sour plantain cider, and many loads of unripe plan-

tains. I inquired whether Speke had left a medicine-
chest with him. He replied that it was a very feverish
country, and that he and his people had used all the
medicine. Thus my last hope of quinine was cut off.
I had always trusted to obtain a supply from the king,
as Speke had told me that he had left a bottle with
him. It was quite impossible to obtain any informa
tion from him, and I was carried back to my hut,
where I found Mrs. Baker lying down with fever, and
neither could render assistance to the other.
On the following morning the king again appeared.
I was better, and I had a long interview. He did not
appear to heed my questions, but he at once requested
that I would ally myself with him, and attack his
enemy, Rionga. I told him that I could not embroil
myself in such quarrels, but that I had only one
object, which was the lake ; I requested that he would
give Ibrahim a large quantity of ivory, and that on
his return from Gondokoro he would bring him most
valuable articles in exchange. He said that he was
not sure whether " my belly was black or white," — by
this he intended to express " evil or good intentions ;"
but that if it were white I should of course have no
objection to exchange blood with, him, as a proof of
friendship and sincerity. This was rather too strong a
dose ! I replied that it would be impossible, as in my

country the shedding of blood was considered a proof of
hostility ; therefore he must accept Ibrahim as my sub
stitute. Accordingly the arms were bared and pricked;
as the blood flowed, it was licked by either party,
and an alliance was concluded. Ibrahim agreed to
act with him against all his enemies. It was arranged
that Ibrahim now belonged to Kamrasi, and that
henceforth our parties should be entirely separate.
It rained in torrents, and our hut became so damp
from the absorption of the marsh soil, that my feet
sank in the muddy floor. I had fever daUy at about
3 p.m. and lay perfectly helpless for five or six hours,
until the attack passed off ; this reduced me to extreme
weakness. My wife suffered quite as acutely. It was
a position of abject misery, which wiU be better ex
plained by a few rough extracts from my journal : —
"Feb. 16th. — All my porters have deserted, having
heard that the lake is so far distant ; I have not one
man left to carry my luggage. Should we not be able
to ' cross the Asua river before the flood, we shaU be
naUed for another year to this abominable country, iU
with fever, and without medicine, clothes, or supplies."
" Feb. 17th. — Fever last night ; rain, as usual, with
mud accompaniment. One of Kamrasi's headmen,
whose tongue I have loosened by presents, teUs me
that he has been to the lake in ten clays to purchase

salt, and that a man loaded with salt can return in
fifteen days. God knows the truth ! and I am pressed
for, time, whUe Kamrasi delays me in the most annoying
manner. " Kamrasi came to-day ; as usual, he wanted all that
I had, and insisted upon a present of my sword, watch,
and compass, all of which I positively refused. I told
him that he had deceived me by saying that the lake
was so distant as six months' journey, as I knew that
it was ;only ten days. He rudely answered, ' Go, if
you hke ; but don't blame me if you can't get back ;
it is twenty days' march ; you may believe it or not,
as you choose.' To my question as to the means of
procuring porters, he gave no reply, except by asking
for my sword, and for my beautiful little Fletcher rifle."
" I retired to my hut in disgust. This afternoon a
messenger arrived from the king with twenty-four
smaU pieces of straw, cut into lengths of about four
inches. These he laid carefuUy in a row, and explained
that Speke had given that number of presents, whereas
Ihad only given ten, the latter figure being carefully
exemplified by ten pieces of straw ; he wished to know
' why I did not give him the same number as he had
received from Speke ?' This miserable, grasping, lying
coward, is nevertheless a king, and the success of my
expedition depends upon him."

consultation, he promised to send me to the lake to
morrow. I immediately took off my sword and belt,
and presented them to him, explaining that, as I was
now convinced of his friendship, I had a pleasure in
offering my sword as a proof of my amicable feeling,
as I thus placed the weapon of self-defence in his hand,
and I should trust to his protection. As a proof of
the temper of. the blade I offered to cut through the
strongest shield he could produce. This deUghted him
amazingly. I now trust to be able to reach the junc

lend anything to the Turks, it is an insult should I
ask for its. return. One hasty word might have upset
my boat ; and now, for twelve months, I have had to
talk, to explain, to manage, and to lead the brutes in
this direction, like a coachman driving jibbing horses.
Hosts of presents to Ibrahim, combined with a vivid
description of the advantages that he would secure by
opening a trade with Kamrasi, at length led him to
this country, which I could not have reached without
his aid, as it would have been impossible for me to
have procured porters without cattle. The porters I
have always received from him as far as Karuma for
a payment of six copper rings, per head for every
journey. I have now arranged that he shall leave
for me thirty head of cattle at Shooa ; thus, should
he have started for Gondokoro before my arrival at

Shooa, I shaU be able to procure porters, and arrive
in time for the expected boat.
" Up to this day astronomical observations have been
impossible, a thick coat of slate colour obscuring the
heavens. To-night I obtained a good observation of
Canopus, giving latitude 1° 33' N. By CaseUa's ther
mometer I made the altitude of the Somerset at M'rooli
4,061 feet above the sea, showing a faU of 65 feet
between this point and below the faUs at Karuma in
a distance of 37 mUes of latitude.
"Just as Ibrahim was leaving this morning I was
obliged to secure the slave Bacheeta as interpreter, at
the price of three double-barreUed guns to purchase
her freedom. I explained to her that she was now
free, and that I wished her to act as interpreter during
my stay in Unyoro ; and that I would then leave her
in her own country, Chopi, on my return from the
lake. Far from being pleased at the change, she re
gretted the loss of the Turks, and became excessively
sulky, although my wife decked her out with beads,
and gave her a new petticoat to put her in a good
humour." " Feb. 22d. — Kamrasi promised to send me porters,
and that we should start for the lake to-day, but there
is no sign of preparation ; thus am I delayed when
every day is so precious. Added to this trouble, the

woman that I have as an interpreter will not speak,
being the most sulky individual I ever encountered.
In the evening Kamrasi sent to say he would give
a guide and porters to-morrow morning. It is impos
sible to depend upon him."
After some delay we were at length honoured by
a visit from Kamrasi, accompanied by a number of
his people, and he promised that we should start on
the foUowing day. He pointed out a chief and a guide
who were to have us in their charge, and who were to
see that we obtained aU that we should require. He
concluded, as usual, by asking for my watch and for
a number of beads ; the latter I gave, him, together
with a quantity of ammunition for his guns. He
showed me a beautiful double-barreUed rifle by " Blis-
sett," that Speke had given him. I wished to secure
this to give to Speke on my return to England, as he
had told me, when at Gondokoro, how he had been
obhged to part with that and many other articles
sorely against his wUl. I therefore offered to give
him three common double-barreUed guns in exchange
for the rifle. This he dechned, as he was quite aware
of the difference in quahty. He then produced a large
silver chronometer that he had received from Speke.
" It was dead," he said, " and he wished me to repair
it." This I declared to be impossible. He then con-

fessed to having explained its construction, and the
cause of the " ticking," to his people, by the aid of a
needle, and that it had never ticked since that occasion.
I regretted to see such "pearls cast before swine,"
as the rifle and chronometer in the hands of Kamrasi.
Thus he had plundered Speke and Grant of all they
possessed before he would allow them to proceed.
It is the rapacity of the chiefs of the various tribes
that renders African exploration so difficult. Each
tribe wishes to monopolize your entire stock of valua
bles, without which the traveUer would be utterly
helpless. The difficulty of procuring porters hmits the
amount of baggage : thus a given supply must carry
you through a certain period of time ; if your supply
should fail, the expedition terminates with your power
of giving. It is thus extremely difficult to arrange
the expenditure so as to satisfy aU parties, and stUl
to retain a sufficient balance. Being utterly cut off
from aU communication with the world, there is no
possibility of receiving assistance. The traveUer de
pends entirely upon himself, under Providence, and
must adapt himself and his means to circumstances.

CHAPTER II.

THE START E0R THE LAKE.

The day of starting at length arrived j the chief and
guide appeared, and we were led to the Kafoor river,
where canoes were in readiness to transport us to the
south side. This was to our old quarters on the marsh !
The direct course to the lake was west, and I fuUy
expected some deception, as it was impossible to trust
Kamrasi. I complained to the guide, and insisted upon
his pointing out the direction Of the lake, which he did,
in its real position, west; but he explained that we
must foUow the south bank of the Kafoor river for
some days, as there was an impassable morass that
precluded a direct course. This did not appear satis
factory, and the whole affair looked suspicious, as we
had formerly been deceived by being led across the
river in the same spot, and not allowed to return. We
were now led along the banks of the Kafoor for about

chap, ii.] DESPICABLE CONDUCT OF THE KING. Jb
a mUe, untU we ai'rived at a cluster of huts ; here
we were to wait for Kamrasi, who had promised to
take leave of us. The sun was overpowering, and we
dismounted from our oxen, and took shelter in a
blacksmith's shed. In about an hour Kamrasi arrived,
attended by a considerable number of men, and took
his seat in our shed. I felt convinced that his visit
was simply intended to peel the last skin from the onion.
I had already given him nearly all that I had, but
he hoped to extract the whole before I should depart.
He almost immediately commenced the conversation
by asking for a pretty yeUow muslin Turkish hand
kerchief fringed with sUver drops that Mrs. Baker wore
upon her head : one of these had already been given
to him, and I explained that this was the last remain
ing, and that she required it  He " must " have it.
.... It was given. He then demanded other hand
kerchiefs. We had UteraUy nothing but a few most
ragged towels; he would accept no excuse, and in
sisted upon a portmanteau being unpacked, that he
might satisfy himself by actual inspection. The
luggage, aU ready for the journey, had to be un
strapped and examined, and the rags were displayed
in succession ; but so wretched and uninviting was the
exhibition of the famdy linen, that he simply returned
them, and said "they did not suit him." Beads he

76 PERTINACITY OF KAMRASI. [chap. ii.
must have, or I was " his enemy." A selection of the
best opal beads was immediately given him. I rose
from the stone upon' which I was sitting, and declared
that we must start immediately. "Don't be in a
hurry," he replied, " you have plenty of time ; but you
have not given me that watch you promised me." ....
This was my only watch that he had begged for, and
had been refused every day during my stay at M'rooli.
So pertinacious a beggar I had never seen. I explained
to him that, without the watch, my journey would be
useless, but that I would give him all that I had except
the watch when the exploration should be completed,
as I should require nothing on my direct return to
Gondokoro. At the same time, I repeated to him the
arrangement for the journey that he had promised,
begging him not to deceive me, as my wife and I
should both die if we were compeUed to remain another
year in this country by losing the annual boats in
Gondokoro. The understanding was this : he was to
give me porters to the lake, where I was to be furnished
with canoes to take me to Magungo, which was
situated at the junction of the Somerset. From Ma
gungo he told me that I should see the NUe issuing from
the lake close to the spot where the Somerset entered,
and that the canoes should take me down the river,
and porters should carry my effects from the nearest

point to Shooa, and deliver me at my old station
without delay. Should he be faithful to this engage
ment, I trusted to procure porters from Shooa, and to
reach Gondokoro in time for the annual boats. I had
arranged that a boat should be sent from Khartoum
to await me at Gondokoro early in this year, 1864 ;
but I felt sure that should I be long delayed, the boat
would return without me, as the people would be afraid
to remain alone at Gondokoro after the other boats had
quitted. In our present weak state another year of Central
Africa without quinine appeared to warrant death ; it
was a race against time, aU was untrodden ground
before us, and the distance quite uncertain. I trembled
for my wife, and. weighed the risk of another year in
this horrible country should we lose the boats. With
the self-sacrificing devotion that she had shown in
every trial, she implored me not to think of any risks
on her account, but to push forward and discover the
lake — that she had determined not to return until she
had herself reached the " M'wootan N'zigeV'
.. I now requested Kamrasi to aUow us to take leave,
as we had not an hour to lose. In the coolest manner
he repUed, " I wul send you to the lake and to Shooa,
as I have promised; but, you must leave your ivife
with me ! "

78 RESENTMENT OF THE KING'S INSOLENCE, [chap. ii.
At that moment we were surrounded by a great
number of natives, and niy suspicions of treachery at
having been led across the Kafoor river appeared con
firmed by this insolent demand. If this were to be the
end of the expedition I resolved that it should also be
the end of Kamrasi, and, drawing my revolver quietly,
I held it within two feet of his chest, and looking at
him with undisguised contempt, I told him, that if I
touched the trigger, not all his men could save him :
and that if he dared to repeat the insult I would shoot
him on the spot. At the same time I explained to
him that in my country such insolence would entail
bloodshed, and that I looked upon him as an ignorant
ox who knew no better, and that this, excuse alone
could save him. My wife, naturaUy ' indignant, had
risen from her seat, and maddened with the excitement
•of the moment, she made him a little speech in Arabic
{not a word of which he understood), with a counte
nance almost as amiable as the head of Medusa. Alto
gether the mise en scene utterly astonished him ; the
woman Bacheeta, although savage, had appropriated
the insult to her mistress, and she also fearlessly let fly
at Kamrasi, translating as nearly as she could the
compUmentary address that " Medusa" had just de
livered. Whether this little coup de thMtre had so im-

pressed Kamrasi with British female independence that
he wished to be off his bargain, I cannot say, but with
an air of complete astonishment, he said, " Don't be
angry ! I had no intention of offending you by asking
for your wife ; I wiU give you a wife, if you want one,
and I thought you might have no objection to give me
yours ; it is my custom to give my visitors pretty
wives, and I thought you might exchange. Don't
make a fuss about it ; if you don't like it, there's an end
of it ; I wUl never mention it again." This very prac
tical apology I received very sternly, and merely insisted
upon starting. He seemed rather confused at having
committed himself, and to make amends he caUed his
people and ordered them to carry our loads. His men
ordered a number of women who had assembled out of
curiosity, to shoulder the luggage and to carry it to
the next village where they would be relieved. , I
assisted my wife upon her ox, and with a very cold
adieu to Kamrasi, I turned my back most gladly on
M'rooli. •
The country was a vast flat of grass land inter
spersed with smaU villages and patches of sweet pota
toes ; these were very inferior, owing to the want of
drainage. For about two miles we continued on the
bank of the Kafoor river ; the women who carried the
luggage were straggling in disorder, and my few men

were much scattered- in their endeavours to coUect
them. We approached a considerable village ; but
just as we were nearing it, out rushed about six hundred
men with lances and shields, screaming and yelling
like so many demons. For. the moment, I thought it
was an attack, but almost immediately I noticed that
women and children were mingled with the men. My
men had not taken, so cool a view of the excited
throng that was now approaching us at fuU speed,
brandishing their spears, and engaging with each other
in mock combat. "There's a fight! there's a fight!"
my men exclaimed ; " we are attacked ! fire at them,
Hawaga." However, in a few seconds, I persuaded
them that it was a mere parade, and that there was no
danger. With a rush, hke a cloud of locusts, the natives
closed .around us, dancing, gesticulating, and yeUing
before my ox, feinting to attack us with spears and
shields., then engaging in sham fights with each other,
and .behaving like so many madmen. A very tall
chief accompanied them ; and one of their men was
suddenly knocked clown, and attacked by the crowd
with sticks and lances, and lay on the ground covered
with -blood : what his offence had been I did not hear.
The entire crowd were most grotesquely got up, being
dressed in either leopard or white monkey skins, with
cows' tails, strapped on behind, and antelopes' horns

fitted upon their heads, while their chins were orna
mented with false beards, made of the bushy ends of ""
cows' tails sewed together. Altogether, I never saw a
more unearthly set of creatures ; they were perfect
illustrations of my chUdish ideas of devils — horns,
tads, and aU, excepting the hoofs ; they were our
escort ! furnished by Kamrasi to accompany us to the
lake. Fortunately for aU parties the Turks were not
with us on that occasion, or the satanic escort would
certainly have been received with a volley when they
so rashly advanced to compUment us by their absurd
performances. We marched tiU 7 p.m. over flat, uninteresting
¦ country, and then halted at a miserable viUage which
the people had deserted, as they expected our arrival.
The foUowing morning I found much difficulty in
getting our escort together, as they had been foraging
throughout the neighbourhood ; these " devil's own "
were a portion of Kamrasi's troops, who considered
themselves entitled to plunder ad libitum throughout
the march ; however, after some delay, they collected,
and their tall chief approached me, and begged that a
gun might be fired as a curiosity. The escort had
crowded around us, and as the boy Saat was close to
me, I ordered him to fire his gun. This was Saat's
greatest defight, and bang went one barrel unexpectedly

close to the taU chiefs ear. The effect was charming.
The taU chief, thinking himself injured, clasped his
head with both hands, and bolted through the crowd,
which, struck with a sudden panic, rushed away in all
directions, the " devil's own " tumbling over each other,
and utterly scattered "by the second barrel which Saat
exultingly fired in derision as Kamrasi's warlike regi
ment dissolved before a sound. I felt quite sure, that
in the event of a fight, one scream from the " baby,"
with its charge of forty smaU buUets, would win the
battle, if weU delivered into a crowd of Kamrasi's
troops. That afternoon, after a march through a most beau
tiful forest of large mimosas in fuU blossom, we arrived
at the morass that had necessitated this great dStour
from our direct course to the lake. It was nearly
three-quarters of a mile broad, and so deep, that in
many places the oxen were obliged to swim; both
Mrs. Baker and I were carried across on our angareps
by twelve men with the greatest difficulty ; the guide,
who waded before us to show the way, suddenly dis
appeared in a deep hole, and his bundle that he had
carried on his head, being of hght substance, was seen
floating like a buoy upon the surface; after a thorough
sousing, the guide reappeared, and scrambled out, and
we made a circuit, the men toiling frequently up to

their necks through mud and water. On arrival at the
opposite side we continued through the same beautiful
forest, and slept that night at a deserted village,
M'Baze. I obtained two observations ; one of CapeUa,
giving lat 1° 24' 47", N. and of Canopus 1° 23' 29".
The next day we were much annoyed by our native
escort ; instead of attending to us, they employed
their time in capering and dancing about, screaming,
and gesticulating, and suddenly rushing off in advance
whenever we approached a village, which they plun
dered before, we could arrive. In this manner every
place was stripped ; nor could we procure anything to
eat unless by purchasing it for beads from the native
escort. We slept at Karche, lat. 1° 19' 31". N.
We were both Ul, but were obliged to ride through
the hottest hours of the sun, as our foUowers were
never ready to start at an early hour in the morning.
The native escort were perfectly independent, and so
utterly wUd and savage in their manner, that they
appeared more dangerous than the general inhabitants
of the country. My wife was extremely anxious, since
the occasion of Kamrasi's "proposal," as she was
suspicious that so large an escort as three hundred
men had been given for some treacherous purpose, and
that I should perhaps be waylaid to enable them to
steal her for the king. I had not the slightest fear of

84 PASSAGE OF THE KAFOOR. [chap. ii.
such an occurrence, as sentries were always on guard
during the night, and I was weU prepared during the
day. On the foUowing morning we had the usual diffi
culty in coUecting porters, those of the preceding day
having absconded, and others were recruited from
distant villages by the native escort, who enjoyed the
excuse of hunting for porters, as it gave them an
opportunity of foraging throughout the neighbourhood.
During this time we had to wait untU the sun was
high ; and we thus lost the cool hours of morning and
increased our fatigue. Having at length started, we
arrived in the afternoon at the Kafoor river, at a bend
from the south where it was necessary to cross over in
our westerly course. The stream was in the centre of
a marsh, and although deep, it was so covered with
thickly-matted water-grass and other aquatic plants,
that a natural floating-bridge was established by a
carpet of weeds about two feet thick : upon this, wav
ing and unsteady surface the men ran quickly across,
sinking merely to the ankles, although beneath the
tough vegetation there was deep water. It was equaUy
impossible to ride or to be carried over this treacherous
surface ; thus I led the way, and begged Mrs. Baker
to follow me on foot as quickly as possible, precisely
in my track. The river was about eighty yards wide,

chap, ii.] MRS. BAKER RECEIVES A SUN-STROKE 85
and I had scarcely completed a fourth of the distance
and looked back to see if my wife followed close to
me, when I was horrified to see her standing in one
spot, and sinking gradually through the weeds, whUe
her face was distorted and perfectly purple. Almost
as soon as I perceived her, she feU, as though shot
dead. In an instant I was by her side ; and with the
assistance of eight or ten of my men, who were fortu
nately close to me, I dragged her Uke a corpse through
the yielding vegetation, and up to our waists we scram
bled across to the other side, just keeping her head
above the water : to have carried her would have been
impossible, as we should all have sunk together through
the weeds. I laid her under a tree, and bathed her
head and face with water, as for the moment I thought
she had fainted; but she lay perfectly insensible as
though dead, with teeth and hands firmly clenched,
and her eyes open, but fixed. It was a coup de soleil.
Many of the porters had gone on ahead with the
baggage ; and I started off a man in haste to recaU an
angarep upon which to. carry her, and also for a bag
with a change of clothes,, as we had dragged her
through the river. It was in vain that I rubbed her
heart, and the black women rubbed her feet, to endea
vour to. restore animation. At length the Utter came,
and after changing her clothes, she was carried mourn-

86 DISMISSAL OF THE BRUTAL ESCORT, [chap. ii.
fully forward as a corpse. Constantly we had to halt
and support her head, as a painful rattling in. the
throat betokened suffocation. At length we reached
a viUage, and halted for the night.
I laid her carefuUy in a miserable hut, and watched
beside her. I opened her clenched teeth with a small
wooden wedge, and inserted a wet rag, upon which I
dropped water to moisten her tongue, which was dry
as fur. The unfeeling brutes that composed the native
escort were yelling and dancing as though all were
well ; and I ordered their chief at once to return with"
them to Kamrasi, as I would travel with them no
longer. At first they refused to return ; untU at
length I vowed that I would fire into them should
they accompany us on the foUowing morning. Day
broke, and it was a relief to have got rid of the brutal
escort. They had departed, and I had now my own
men, and the. guides supphed by Kamrasi.
There was nothing to eat in this spot. My wife
had never stirred . since she feU by the coup de soleil,
and merely respired about five times in a minute.
It was impossible to remain ; the people would have
starved. She was laid gently upon her Utter, and we
started forward on our funeral course. I was iU and
broken-hearted, and I followed by her side through
the long day's march over wild park-lands and streams,

chap, n.] MISERY AND DISTRESS. 87
with thick forest and deep marshy bottoms ; over un
dulating hills, and through vaUeys of tall papyrus
rushes, which, as we brushed through them on our
melancholy way, waved over the litter like the black
plumes of a hearse. We halted at a village, and again
the night was passed in watching. I was wet, and
coated with mud from the swampy marsh, and shivered
with ague ; but the cold within was greater than all
No change had taken place; she had never moved.
I had plenty of fat, and I made four baUs of about
half a pound, each of which would burn for three
hours. A piece of a broken water-jar formed a lamp^
several pieces of rag serving for wicks. So in solitude
the stiU calm night passed away as I sat by her side
and watched. In the drawn and distorted features
that lay before me I could hardly trace the same face
that for years had been my comfort through aU the
difficulties and dangers of my path. Was she to die ?
Was so terrible a sacrifice to be the result of my selfish
exUe? Again the night passed away. Once more the march.
Though weak and Ul, and for two nights without
a moment's sleep, I felt no fatigue, but mechanically
foUowed by the side of the Utter as though in a dream.
The same wUd country diversified with marsh and
forest. Again we halted. The night came, and I sat

by her side in a miserable hut, with the feeble lamp
flickering' while she lay, as in death. She had never
moved a muscle since she feU. My people slept. I
was -alone, and no sound broke the stillness of the
night. The ears ached at the utter sUence, tiU the
sudden wild cry of a hyena made me shudder as the
horrible thought rushed through my brain, that, should
she be buried in this lonely spot, the hyena would . . .
disturb her rest.
The morning was not far distant ; it was past four
o'clock. I had passed the night in replacing wet cloths
upon her head and moistening her lips, as she lay
apparently lifeless on her litter. I could do nothing
more ; in sohtude and abject misery in that dark hour,
in a country of savage heathens, thousands of mUes
away from a Christian land, I beseeched an aid above
aU'human, trusting alone to Him.
The morning broke ; my lamp had just burnt out,
and, cramped with' the night's watching, I rose from
my low seat, and seeing that she lay in the same un^
altered state, I went to the door of the hut to breathe
one gasp of the fresh morning air. I was watching
the first red streak that heralded the rising sun, when
I was startled by the words, "Thank God," faintly
uttered behind me. Suddenly she had awoke from
her torpor, and with a heart overflowing I. went to her

bedside. Her eyes were full of madness ! She spoke,
but the brain was gone !
I wiU not inflict a description of the terrible trial of
seven days of brain fever, with its attendant horrors.
The rain poured in torrents, and day after day we were
forced to travel for want of provisions, not being able
to remain in one position. Every now and then we
shot a few guinea-fowl, but rarely-; there was no game,
although the country was most favourable. In the
forests we procured wild honey, but the deserted vU-
lages contained no suppUes, as we were on the frontier
of Uganda, and M'tese's people had plundered the dis
trict. For seven nights I had not slept, and although
as weak as a reed, I had marched by the side of her
Utter. Nature could resist no longer. We reached a
viUage one evening ; she had been in violent convul
sions successively — it was all but over. I laid her
down on her Utter within a hut ; covered her with a
Scotch plaid, and I feU upon my mat insensible, worn
out with sorrow and fatigue. My men put a new
handle to the pickaxe that evening, and sought for a
dry spot to dig her grave !

horrified as the idea flashed upon me that she must be
dead, and that I had not been with her, I started up.
She lay upon her bed, pale as marble, and with that
calm serenity that the features assume when the cares
of life no longer act upon the mind, and the body rests
in death. The dreadful thought bowed me down ; but
as I gazed upon her in fear, her chest gently heaved,
not with the convulsive throbs of fever, but naturaUy.
She was asleep; and when at a sudden noise she opened
her eyes, they were calm and clear. She was saved !
When not a ray of hope remained, God alone knows
what helped us. The gratitude of that moment I will
not attempt to describe.
Fortunately there were many fowls in this village ;
we found several nests of fresh eggs in the straw which

littered the hut ; these were most acceptable after our
hard fare, and produced a good supply of soup.
Having rested for two days, we again moved forward,
Mrs. Baker being carried on a litter. We now con
tinued on elevated ground, on the north side of a vaUey
running from west to east, about sixteen mUes broad,
and exceedingly swampy. The rocks composing the
ridge upon which we traveUed due west were aU gneiss
and quartz, with occasional breaks, forming narrow1
valleys, all of which were swamps choked with immense
papyrus rushes, that made the march very fatiguing.
In one of these muddy bottoms one of my riding oxen
that was iU, stuck fast, and we were obliged to abandon
it, intending to send a number of natives .to drag it
out with ropes. On arrival at a viUage, our guide
started about fifty men for this purpose, while we con
tinued our journey.
That evening we reached a village belonging to a
headman, and very superior to most that we had passed
on the route, from M'rooU : large sugar-canes of the
blue variety were growing in the fields, and I had seen
coffee growing wUd in the forest in the vicinity. I
was sitting at the door of the hut about two hours after
sunset, smoking a pipe of exceUent tobacco, when I
suddenly heard a great singing in chorus advancing
rapidly from a distance towards the entrance of. the

courtyard. At first I imagined that the natives
intended dancing, which was an infliction that I
wished to avoid, as I was tired and feverish ; but in a
few minutes the boy Saat introduced a headman, who
told me that the riding ox had died in the swamp
where he had stuck fast in the morning, and that the
natives had brought his body to me. " What !" I
replied, " brought his body, the entire ox, to me ?"
" The entire ox as he died is delivered at your door,"
answered the headman ; " I could not allow any of
your property to be lost upon the road. Had the body
of the ox not been dehvered to you, we might have
been suspected of having stolen it." I went to the
entrance of the courtyard, and amidst a crowd of
natives I found the entire ox exactly as he had died.
They had carried him about eight mUes on a Utter,
which they had constructed of two immensely long
posts with cross-pieces of bamboo, upon which they
had laid the body. They would not eat the flesh, and
seemed quite disgusted at the idea, as they repUed that
"it had died." • '
, It is a curious distinction of the Unyoro people, that
they are peculiarly clean feeders, and will not touch
either the flesh of animals that have died, neither of
those that are sick ; nor wiU • they eat the crocodUe.
They asked for no remuneration for bringing their.

heavy load so great a distance ; and they departed in
good humour as a matter of course.
Never were such contradictory people as these crea
tures; they had troubled us dreadfaUy during the
journey, as they would suddenly exclaim against the
weight of their loads, and throw them down, and bolt
into the high grass ; yet now they had of their own
free wUl delivered to me a whole dead ox from a distance
of eight miles, precisely as though it had been an object
of the greatest value.
The name of this vdlage was Parkani. For several
days past our guides had told us that we were very
near to the lake, and we were now assured that we
should reach it on the morrow. I had noticed a lofty
range of mountains at an immense distance west, and
I had imagined that the lake lay on the other side of
this chain ; but I was now informed that those moun
tains formed the western frontier ofthe M'wootan N'zige,
and that the lake was actuaUy within a march of Par
kani. I could not beheve it possible that we were so
near the object of our search. The guide Rabonga now
appeared, and declared that if we started early on the
foUowing morning we should be able to wash in the
lake by noon !
That night I hardly slept. For years I had striven
to reach the " sources of the NUe." In my nightly

dreams during that arduous voyage I had always faded,
but after so much hard work and perseverance the. cup
was at my very lips, arid I was to drink at the mys
terious fountain before another sun should set-^at that •
great reservoir of Nature that ever since creation had
baffled aU discovery.
I had hoped, and prayed, and striven through all
kinds of difficulties, in sickness, starvation, and fatigue,
to reach that hidden source ; and when it had appeared
impossible, we had both determined to die upon the
toad rather than return defeated. Was it possible that
it was so near, and that to-morrow we could say, " the
work is accomplished ? "
The liih March. — The sun had not risen when I
was spurring my ox after the guide, who, having been
promised a double handful of beads on arrival at the
lake, had caught the enthusiasm of the moment. The
day broke beautifully clear, and having crossed a
deep valley between the hills, we toUed up the
opposite, slope. I hurried to the summit. The.
glory of our prize burst suddenly upon me-!
There, like a sea of quicksUver, lay far beneath
the grand expanse of water, — a boundless sea hori
zon on the south and south-west, glittering in the
noon-day sun ; and on the west, at fifty' or sixty
miles' distance, blue mountains rose from the bosom of

the lake to a height of about 7,000 feet above its
level. It is impossible to describe the triumph of that mo
ment; — here was the reward for all our labour — for the
years of tenacity with which we had toded through
Africa. England had won the sources of the NUe !
Long before I reached this spot, I had arranged to give
three cheers with all our men in EngUsh style in honour
of the discovery, but now that I looked down upon
the great inland sea lying nestled in the very heart of
Africa, and thought how vainly mankind had sought
these sources throughout so many ages, and reflected
that I had been the humble instrument permitted to
unravel this portion of the great mystery when so many
greater than I had failed, I felt too serious to vent my
feelings in vain cheers for victory, and I sincerely
thanked God for having guided and supported us
through aU dangers to the good end. I was about
1,500 feet above the lake, and I looked down from the
steep granite cliff upon those welcome waters— upon
that vast reservoir which nourished Egypt and brought
fertihty where aU was wilderness — upon that great
source so long hidden from mankind ; that source of
bounty and of blessings to mdlions of human beings ;
and as one ofthe greatest objects in nature, I determined
to honour it with a great name. As an imperishable

memorial of one loved and mourned by our gracious
Queen and deplored by every Englishman, I called
this. great lake "the Albert N'yanza." The Victoria
and the Albert lakes are the two sources of the
Nile. The zigzag path to descend to the lake was so steep
arid dangerous that we were forced to leave our oxen
with a guide, who was to take them to Magungo and
wait for our arrival. We commenced the descent of
the steep pass on foot. I led the way, grasping a
stout bamboo. My wife in extreme weakness tottered
down the pass, supporting herself upon my shoulder,
and stopping to rest every twenty paces. After a
todsome descent of about two hours, weak with years
of fever, but for the moment strengthened by success,
we gained the level plain below the cliff. A walk of
about a mde through flat sandy meadows of fine turf
interspersed with trees and bush, brought us to the
water's edge.. The waves were rolling upon a white
pebbly beach : I rushed into the lake, and thirsty with
heat and fatigue, with a heart fuU of gratitude, I
drank deeply from the Sources of the Nile. Within a
quarter of a mile of the lake was a fishing viUage
named Vacovia, in which we now established ourselves.
Everything smelt of fish — and everything looked like
fishing; not the "gentle art" of England with rod and

fly, but harpoons were leaning against the huts, and
lines almost as thick as the little finger were hanging
up to dry, to 'which were attached iron hooks of a size
that said much for the monsters of the Albert lake.
On entering the hut I found a prodigious quantity of
tackle; the lines were beautifuUy made of the fibre
of the plantain stem, and were exceedingly elastic, and
weU adapted to withstand the first rush of a heavy
fish ; the hooks were very coarse, but weU barbed, and"
varied in size from two to six inches. A number of
harpoons and floats for hippopotami were arranged in
good order, and the tout ensemble of the hut showed
that the owner was a sportsman.
The harpoons for hippopotami were precisely the
same pattern as those used by the Hamran Arabs on
the Taka frontier of Abyssinia, having a narrow blade
of three-quarters of an inch in width, with only one
barb. The rope fitted to the harpoon was beautifuUy
made of plantain fibre, and the float was a huge piece
of ambatch-wood about fifteen inches in diameter.
They speared the hippopotamus from canoes, and these
large floats were necessary to be easily distinguished
in the rough waters of the lake.
My men were perfectly astounded at the appearance
of the lake. The journey had been so long, and " hope
deferred" had so completely sickened their hearts, that

they had long since disbeheved in the existence of the
lake, and they were persuaded that I was leading
them to the sea. They now looked at the lake with
amazement — two of them had already seen the sea at
Alexandria, and they unhesitatingly declared that this
was the sea, but that it was not salt.
Vacovia was a miserable place, and the sod was so
impregnated with salt, that no cultivation was possible.
Salt was the natural • product of the country, and
the population were employed in its manufacture,
which constituted the business of the lake shores--
being exchanged for supplies from the interior. I
went to examine the pits : these were about six feet
deep, from which was dug a black sandy mud that
was placed in large earthenware jars ; these were sup
ported upon frames, and mixed with water, which
filtering rapidly through small holes in the bottom
was received in jars beneath : this water was again
used with fresh mud untU it became a strong brine,
when it was boded and evaporated. The salt was
white, but very bitter. I imagine that it has been
formed by the decay of aquatic plants that have been
washed ashore by the waves; decomposing, they
have formed a mud deposit, and much potash is
combined with the salt. The flat sandy meadow that
extends from the lake for about a mile to the foot of

the precipitous cliffs of 1,500 feet, appears to have
formed at one period the bottom of the lake — in fact,
the flat land of Vacovia looks hke a bay, as the moun
tain cliffs about five mdes south and north descend
abruptly to the water, and the flat is the bottom of a
horseshoe formed by the cliffs. Were the level of the
lake fifteen feet higher, this flat would be flooded to
the base of the hills.
I procured a couple of kids from the chief of the
viUage for some blue beads, and having received an
ox as a present from the headman of Parkani in return
for a number of beads and bracelets, I gave my men a
grand feast in honour of the discovery ; I made them
an address, explaining to them how much trouble we
should have been saved had my whole party behaved
weU from the first commencement and trusted to my
guidance, as we should have arrived here twelve
months ago ; at the same time I told them, that it
was a greater honour to have achieved the task with
so smaU a force as thirteen men, and that as the lake
was thus happdy reached, and Mrs. Baker was restored
to health after so terrible a danger, I should forgive
them past offences and wipe out all that had been
noted against them in my journal. This deUghted
my people, who ejaculated "Elhamd el IUah!" (thank
God!) and feU to immediately at their beef.

100 SURVEY OF THE LAKE. [chap. hi.
At sunrise on the following morning I took the
compass, and accompanied by the chief of the viUage,
my guide Rabonga, and the woman Bacheeta, I went
to the borders of the lake to survey the country. . It
was beautifully clear, and with a powerful telescope
I could distinguish two large waterfalls that cleft the
sides of the mountains on the opposite shore. Although
the outline of the mountains was distinct upon the
bright blue sky, and the dark shades upon their sides
denoted deep gorges, I could not distinguish other
features than the two great fa-Us, which looked like
threads of sdver on the dark face of the mountains.
No base had been visible, even from an elevation of
1,500 feet above the water-level,, on my first view of
the. lake, but the chain of lofty mountains on the
west a; peared to rise suddenly from the water. This
appearance must have been due to the great distance,
the base being below the horizon, as dense columns of
smoke were ascending apparently from the surface of
the water : this must have been produced by the
burning of prairies at the foot of the mountains. The
chief assured me that large canoes had been known to
cross over from the other side, but that it required
four days and nights of hard rowing to accomplish
the voyage, and that many boats had been lost in the
attempt. The canoes of Unyoro were not adapted for

so dangerous a journey ; but the western shore of the
lake was comprised in the great kingdom of Malegga,
governed by King Kajoro, who possessed large canoes,
and traded with Kamrasi from a point opposite to
Magungo, where the lake was contracted to the width
of one day's voyage. He described Malegga as a very
powerful country, and of greater extent than either
Unyoro or Uganda  South of Malegga was a
country named Tori, governed by a king of the
same name : beyond that country to the south on
the western shore no inteUigence could be obtained
from any one.
The lake was known to extend as far south as
Karagwe'; and the old story was repeated, that
Rumanika, the king of that country, was in the habit
of sending ivory-hunting parties to the lake at Utumbi,
and that formerly they had navigated the lake to
Magungo. This was a curious confirmation of the
report given me by Speke at Gondokoro, who wrote :
"Rumanika is constantly in the habit of sending
ivory-hunting parties to Utumbi."
The eastern shores of the lake were, from north to
south, occupied by Chopi, Unyoro, Uganda, Utumbi,
and Karagwe' : from the last point, which could not be
less than about "two degrees south latitude, the lake
was reported to turn suddenly to the west, and to

continue in that direction for an unknown distance.
. North of Malegga, on the west of the lake, was a small
country caUed M'CaroU ; then Koshi, on the west side
of the Nile at its exit from the lake ; and on the east
side of the Nile was the Madi, opposite to Koshi. Both
the guide and the chief of Vacovia informed me that
we should be taken by canoes to Magungo, to the point
at which the Somerset that we had left at Karuma
joined the lake ; but that we could not ascend it, as
it was a succession of cataracts the whole way from
Karuma until within a short distance of Magungo.
The exit of the Nile from the lake at Koshi was
navigable for a considerable distance, and canoes could
descend the river as far as the Madi.
They both agreed that the level of the lake was
never lower than at present, and that it never rose
higher than a mark upon the beach that accounted for
an increase of about four feet. The beach was perfectly
clean sand, upon which the waves roUed like those of
the sea, throwing up weeds precisely as seaweed may
be seen upon the Enghsh shore. It was a grand sight
to look upon this vast reservoir of the mighty Nde,
and to watch the heavy sweU tumbling upon the
beach, while far to the south-west the eye searched as
vainly for a bound as though upon the Atlantic. It
was with extreme emotion that I enjoyed this glorious

scene. My wife, who had followed me so devotedly,
stood by my side pale and exhausted— a wreck upon
the shores of the great Albert Lake that we had so
long striven to reach. No European foot had ever
trod upon its sand, nor had the eyes of a white man
ever scanned its vast expanse of water. We were the
first; and this was the key to the great secret that
even Jidius Caesar yearned to unravel, but in vain.
Here was the great basin of the Nde that received
every drop of water, even from the passing shower
to the roaring mountain torrent that drained from
Central Africa towards the north. This was the great
reservoir of the Nde !
The first coup d'osil from the summit of the cliff
1,500 feet above the level had suggested what a closer
examination confirmed. The lake was a vast depression
far below the general level of the country, surrounded
by precipitous cliffs, and bounded on the west and
south-west by great ranges of mountains from five to
seven thousand feet above the level of its waters — thus
it was the one great reservoir into which everything
must drain ; and from this vast rocky cistern the
Nde made its exit, a giant in its birth. It was a grand
arrangement of Nature for the birth of so mighty and
important a stream as the river Nde. The Victoria
-N'yanza of Speke formed a reservoir at a high altitude,



## p. 104 (#132) ############################################

104 SOURCES OF THE NILE. [chap. hi.
receiving a drainage from the west by the KitanguLS
river, and Speke had seen the M'fumbiro mountain at
a great distance as a peak among other mountains from
which the streams descended, which by uniting formed
the main river Kitangule, the principal feeder of the
Victoria lake from the west, in about the 2° S. latitude :
thus the same chain of mountains that fed the Victoria
on the east must have a watershed to the west and
north that would flow into the Albert lake. The gerieral
drainage of the NUe basin tending from south to north,
and the Albert lake extending much farther north than
the Victoria, it receives the river from the latter lake,
and thus monopohzes the entire head-waters of the
Nde. The Albert is the grand reservoir, whde the
Victoria is the eastern source ; the parent streams that
form these lakes are from the same origin, and the
Kitangule sheds its waters to the Victoria to be received
eventually by the Albert, precisely as the highlands of
M'fumbiro and the Blue Mountains pour their northern
drainage direct into the Albert lake. The entire NUe
system, from the first Abyssinian tributary the Atbara
in N. latitude 17° 37' even to the equator, exhibits a
uniform drainage from S.E. to N.W., every tributary
flowing in that direction to the main stream of the
Nde ; this system is persisted in by the Victoria Nde,
which having- continued a northerly course from its

turns suddenly to the west and meets the Albert lake
at Magungo ; thus, a line drawn from Magungo to the
Ripon FaUs from the Victoria lake wiU prove the
general slope of the country to be the same as exem
plified throughout the entfre system of the eastern
basin of the Nde, tending from S.E. to N.W.
That many considerable affluents flow into the Albert
lake there is no doubt. The two waterfaUs seen by
telescope upon the western shore descending from the
Blue Mountains must be most important streams, or
they could not have been distinguished at so great a
distance as fifty or sixty miles ; the natives assured
me that very many streams, varying in size, descended
the mountains upon all sides into the general reservoir.
I returned to my hut : the flat turf in the vicinity of
the viUage was strewn with the bones of immense fish,
hippopotami, and crocoddes ; but the latter reptdes were
merely caught in revenge for any outrage committed
by them, as their flesh was looked upon with disgust
by the natives of Unyoro. They were so numerous
and voracious in the lake, that the natives cautioned
us not to aUow the women to venture into the water
even to the knees when filling their water-jars.
It was most important that we should hurry forward
on our journey, as our return to England depended

entirely upon the possibiUty of reaching Gondokoro
before the end of April, otherwise the boats would have
departed. I impressed upon our guide and the chief that
we must be furnished with large canoes immediately,
• as we had no time to spare, and I started off Rabonga to
. Magungo, where he was to meet us with our riding
oxen. The animals would be taken by a path upon
the high ground ; there was no possibdity of travelling
near the lake, as the cliffs in many places descended
abruptly into deep water. I made him a present of a
large quantity of beads that I had promised to give
him upon reaching the lake ; he took his departure,
agreeing to meet us at Magungo with our oxen, and to
have porters in readiness to convey us direct to Shooa.
On the foUowing morning not one of our party could
rise from the ground. Thirteen men, the boy Saat,
-four women,' and we ourselves, were all down with
fever. The air was hot and close, and the country
frightfuUy unhealthy. The, natives assured us that all
strangers suffered in a similar manner, and that no
one could live at Vacovia without repeated attacks of
fever. The delay in supplying the boats was most annoy
ing ; every hour was precious ; and the lying natives
deceived us in every manner possible, delaying us
purposely in the hope of extorting beads.

The latitude of Vacovia was 1° 15' N. ; longitude
30° 50'. E. My farthest southern point on the road
from M'rooli was latitude 1° 13'. We were now to
turn our faces towards the north, and every day's
journey would bring us nearer home. But where was
home ? As I looked at the map of the world, and at
the Httle red spot that represented old England far,
far away, and then gazed on the wasted form and
haggard face of my wife and at my own attenuated
frame, I hardly dared hope for home again. We had
now been three years ever toding onwards, and
having completed the exploration of aU the Abyssinian
affluents of the Nde, in itself an arduous undertaking,
we were now actuaUy at the Nde head. We had
neither health nor supplies, and the great journey lay
aU before us.
Notwitlistanding my dady entreaties that boats
might be suppHed without delay, eight days were
passed at Vacovia, during which time the whole party
suffered more or less from fever. At length canoes
were reported to have arrived, and I was requested
to inspect them. They were merely single trees neatly
hoUowed out, but very inferior in size to the large
canoes on the Nde at M'rooU. The largest boat was
thirty-two feet long, but I selected for ourselves one of
.twenty-six feet, but wider and deeper. Fortunately I

had purchased at Khartoum an English screw auger
14; inch in diameter, and this tool I had brought with
me, foreseeing some difficulties in boating arrange
ments. I now bored holes two feet apart in the gun
wale of the canoe, and having prepared long elastic
wands, I spanned them in arches across the boat and
lashed them to the auger holes. This completed, I
secured them by diagonal pieces, and concluded by
thatching the framework with a thin coating of reeds
to protect us from the sun ; over the thatch I stretched
ox hides weU drawn and lashed, so as to render our
roof water-proof. This arrangement formed a tortoise
like protection that would be proof against sun and
rain. I then arranged some logs of exceedingly light
wood along the bottom of the canoe, and covered them
with a thick bed of grass ; this was covered with an
Abyssinian tanned ox hide, and arranged with Scotch
plaids. The arrangements completed, afforded a cabin,
perhaps not as luxurious as those of the Peninsular
and Oriental Company's vessels, but both rain and
sun-proof, which was the great desideratum. In this
rough vessel we embarked on a calm morning when
hardly a ripple moved the even surface of the lake.
Each canoe had four rowers, two at either end. Their
paddles were beautifully shaped, hewn from one piece
of wood, the blade being rather wider than that of

an ordinary spade, but concave in the inner side, so
as to give the rower a great hold upon the water.
Having purchased with some difficulty a few fowls
and dried fish, I put the greater number of my men
in the larger canoe ; and with Richarn, Saat, and the
women, including the interpreter Bacheeta, we led the
way, and started from Vacovia on the broad surface of
the Albert N'yanza. The rowers paddled bravely ;
and the canoe, although heavdy laden, went along at
about four mdes an hour. There was no excitement
in Vacovia, and the chief and two or three attendants
were all who came to see us off ; they had a suspicion
that bystanders might be invited to assist as rowers,
therefore the entire population of the viUage had
deserted At leaving the shore, the chief had asked for a few
beads, which, on receiving, he threw into the lake to
propitiate the inhabitants of the deep, that no hippo
potami should upset the canoe.
Our first day's voyage was delightful. The lake
was calm, the sky cloudy, and the scenery most lovely.
At times the mountains on the west coast were not
discernible, and the lake appeared of indefinite width.
We coasted within a hundred yards of the east shore ;
sometimes we passed flats of sand and bush of perhaps
a mde in width from the water to the base of the

fended the canoes off the sides, and assisted our pro
gress by pushing against the rock with bamboos.
These precipitous rocks were aU primitive, frequently
of granite and gneiss, and mixed in many places with
red porphyry. In the clefts were beautiful ever
greens of every tint, including giant euphorbias ; and
wherever a rivulet or spring glittered through the dark
foliage of a ravine, it was shaded by the graceful and
feathery wild date,
Great numbers of hippopotami were sporting in the
water, but I refused to fire at them, as the death of
such a monster would be certain to delay us for at
least a day, as the boatmen would not forsake the
flesh. Crocodiles were exceedingly numerous both in
and out of the water ; wherever a sandy beach invited
them to bask, several monsters were to be seen, Hke
trunks of trees, lying in the sun. On the edge of the
beech above high-water mark were low bushes, and
from this cover the crocoddes came scuttling down
into the water, frightened at the approach of the
canoe. There were neither ducks nor geese, as there
were no feeding-grounds : deep water was close to the
shore. ¦ • -;

Our boatmen worked well, and long after dark we
continued our voyage, until the canoe was suddenly
steered to the shore, and we grounded upon a steep
beach of perfectly clean sand. We were informed that
we were near a viUage, and the boatmen proposed to
leave us here for the night, whde they should proceed
in search of provisions. Seeing that they intended to
take the paddles with them, I ordered these important
implements to be returned to the boats, and a guard
set over them, whde several of my men should accom
pany the boatmen to the reported' viUage. In the
meantime, we arranged our angareps upon the beach,
Ughted a fire with some drift-wood, and prepared for
the night. The men shortly returned, accompanied.
by several natives, with two fowls and one smaU kid.
The latter was immediately consigned to the large
copper pot, and I paid about three times its' value to ,
the natives, to encourage them to bring supplies on the
foUowing morning.
While dinner was preparing, I took an observation,
and found our latitude was 1" 33' N. We had tra-
veUed weU, having made 16' direct northing.
On the first crowing of our solitary cock, we pre-,
pared to start ; — the boatmen were gone !
As soon as it was light, I took two men and went
to the viUage, supposing they were sleeping in their

112 DESERTED BY THE BOATMEN. [chap. iii.
huts. Within three hundred paces of the boats, upon
a fine turfy sward, on rising ground, were three
miserable fishing huts. These constituted the vdlage.
Upon arrival, no one was to be found : the natives had
deserted. A fine tract of broken grass-land formed a
kind of amphitheatre beneath the range of cliffs. These
I scanned with the telescope, but I. could trace no signs
of man. We were evidently deserted by our boatmen,
and the natives had accompanied them to avoid being
pressed into our service.
On my return to the canoes with this inteUigence,
my men were quite in despair ; they could not beheve
that the boatmen had reaUy absconded, and they begged
me to allow them to search the country in the hope of
' finding another viUage. Strictly forbidding any man
to absent himself from the boats, I congratulated our
selves on having weU guarded the paddles, which there
was no doubt would have been stolen by the boatmen
had I aUowed them to remain in their possession. I
agreed to wait untU 3 p.m. Should the boatmen not
return by that hour, I intended to proceed without
them. There was no dependence to be placed upon
these contradictory natives. Kindness was entirely
thrown away upon them. We had Kamrasi's orders
for boats and men, but in this distant frontier the
natives did not appear to attach much importance to

their king; nevertheless, we were dependent upon them.
Every hour was valuable, as our only chance of reach
ing Gondokoro in time for the boats depended upon
rapidity of traveUing. At the moment when I wished
to press forward, delays occurred that were most
trying. Three p.m. arrived, but no signs of natives. " Jump
into the boats, my lads !" I cried to my men; " I know
the route." The canoes were pushed from the shore,
and my people manned the paddles. Five of my men
were professional boatmen, but no one understood the
management of paddles except myself. It was in vain
that I attempted to instruct my crew. PuU they cer
tainly did; but — ye gods who watch over boats ! — round
and round we pirouetted, the two canoes waltzing and
polking together in their great baU-room, the Albert
N'yanza. The voyage would have lasted ad infinitum.
After three hours' exertion, we reached a point of rock
that stretched as a promontory into the. lake. This
bluff point was covered with thick jungle to the
summit, and at the base was a small plot of sandy
beach, from which there was no exit except by water,
as the cHff descended sheer to the lake upon either
side. It poured with rain, and with much difficulty
we lighted a fire. Mosquitoes were in clouds, and the
night was so warm that it was impossible to sleep

beneath the blankets. Arranging the angareps upon
the sand, with the raw ox-hides as coverlets, we lay
down in the rain. It was too hot to sleep in the boat,
especiaUy as the temporary cabin was a. perfect, mos
quito nest. That night I considered the best plan to
be adopted, and I resolved to adapt a paddle as a
rudder on the following morning. It rained without
ceasing the whole night ; and, at break of day, the
scene was sufficiently miserable. The men lay on the
wet sand, covered up with their raw hides, soaked
completely through, but still fast asleep, from which
nothing would arouse them. My wife was also wet
and wretched. It still rained. I Was soon at work.
Cutting a thwart in the stern of the canoe with my
> hunting-knife, I bored a hole beneath it with the large
auger, and securely lashed a paddle with a thong of
raw hide that I cut off my weU-saturated coverlet. I
made a most effective rudder. None of my men had
assisted me ; they had remained beneath their soaked-
skins, smoking their short pipes, while I was hard at
work. They were perfectly apathetic with despair, as
their ridiculous efforts at paddling on the previous
evening had completely extinguished aU hope within
them. They were quite resigned to their destiny, and
considered themselves as sacrificed to geography.
I threw them the auger, and explained that I was

ready to start, and should wait for no one; and,
cutting two bamboos, I arranged a mast and yard,
upon which I fitted a large Scotch plaid for a sail.
We shoved off the boat : fortunately we had two or
three spare paddles, therefore the rudder paddle was
not missed. I took the helm, and instructed my men
to think of nothing but pulling hard. Away we went
as straight as an arrow, to the intense delight of my
people. There was very Httle wind, but a light air
filled the plaid and eased us gently forward.
Upon rounding the promontory we found ourselves
in a large 'bay, the opposite headland being visible at
about eight or ten miles' distance. Should we coast
the bay it would occupy two days. There was another
smaU promontory farther in shore; I therefore resolved
to steer direct for that point before venturing in a
straight line from one headland to the other.
Upon looking behind me, I observed our canoe con
sort about a mile astern, amusing herself with pointing
to aU parts of the compass — the lazy men not having
taken the trouble to adapt the rudder as I had ordered
them. We travelled at about four miles an hour, and . my
people were so elated that they declared themselves
ready to row, without assistance, to the Nile junction.
The water was perfectly calm, and upon rounding the.

116 ..NATIVES VOLUNTEER AS BOATMEN. [chap. iii.
next promontory I was rejoiced to see a viUage in
a snug little bay, and a great number of canoes,
drawn up on the sandy beach, and others engaged in
fishing. A number of natives were standing on the
•sand close to the water's edge, about half a mile from
us, and I steered directly towards them. Upon our
close approach, they immediately sat down, and held
up their paddles, above their heads ; this was an un
mistakeable sign that they intended to volunteer as
boatmen, and I steered- the boat upon the beach. No
sooner had we grounded, than they rushed into the
water and boarded us, most good-humouredly pulling
down our mast and sad, which appeared to them highly
absurd (as they never use sads) ; and they explained
that they had seen on the other side the headland that
we were strangers, and their chief had ordered them
to assist us. I now begged them to send- six men to the
assistance of the lagging canoe ; this they promised to
do, and, after waiting for some time, we started at a
rattling pace to puU across the wide bay from point
to point.
When in the centre of the bay we were about, four
miles from land. At this time a swell set in from
the south-west. Whde at Vacovia I had observed that
although the mornings were calm, a strong wind gene
rally arose at 1 p.m. from S.W. that brought a heavy

sea upon the beach. I was now afraid that we should
be subject to a gale before we could reach the opposite
headland, as the rising sweU betokened wind from the
old quarter, especiaUy as dark thunder clouds were
gathering on the western shore.
I told Bacheeta to urge the rowers forward, as our
heavy canoe would certainly be swamped in the event
of a gale. I looked at my watch : it was past noon,
and I felt sure that we should catch a south-wester by
about one o'clock. My men looked rather green at
the ominous black clouds and the increasing sweU, but
exclaimed, "Inshallah, there will be no wind." With
due deference to their faith in predestination, I insisted
upon their working the spare paddles, as our safety
depended upon reaching the shore before the approach
ing storm. They had learnt to believe in my opinion,
and they exerted themselves to their utmost. The old
boat rushed through the water, but the surface of the
lake was rapidly changing ; the western shore was no
longer visible, the water was dark, and innumerable
white crests tipped the waves. The canoe laboured
heavdy, and occasionaUy shipped water, which was
immediately baled out with gourd-shells by my men,
who now exclaimed, " Wah IUahi el kalam betar el
Hawaga sahhe-!" (By AUah, what the Hawaga says is
true!) We were within about: a mde and a half of

' the point for which we had been steering, when we
could no longer keep our course; we had shipped
several heavy seas, and had we not been well supplied
with utensds for baling, we should have been swamped.
Several bursts of thunder and vivid lightning were
¦ followed by a tremendous gale from about the W.S.W.
before which we were obliged to run for the shore.
In a short space of time a most dangerous sea arose,
and on several occasions the waves broke .against the
arched covering of the canoe, which happdy protected
her in a sUght degree, although we were drenched with
water. Every one was at work baHng with aU their
might ; I had no idea that the canoe could Hve. Down
came the rain in torrents, swept along with a terrific
- wind ; nothing was discernible except the high cliffs
looming through the storm, and I only trusted that we
might arrive upon a sandy beach, and not upon bluff
rocks. We went along at a . grand rate, as the arched
cover of the canoe acted somewhat as a sad ; and it
was an exciting moment when we at length neared the
shore, and approached the foaming breakers that were
roUing wildly upon (happdy) a sandy beach beneath
the cHffs. I told my men to be ready to jump out the
moment that we should touch the sand, and to secure
the canoe by hauling the head up the beach. All
were ready, and we rushed through the surf, the

native boatmen paddling like steam-engines.. " Here
comes a wave; look out!" and just as we almost
touched the beach, a heavy breaker broke over the
black women who were sitting in the stern, and
swamped the boat. My men jumped into the water
Hke ducks, and the next moment we were all rolled in
confusion on the sandy shore. The men stuck weU to
• the boat, and hauled her firmly on the sand, while my
wife crawled out of her primitive cabin like a caddis
worm from its nest, half drowned, and jumped upon
the shore. "El hamd el Illah !" (thank God !) we all
exclaimed ; " now for a puU — all together ! " and having
so far secured the boat that she could not be washed
away, I ordered the men to discharge the cargo, and
then to puU her out of the lake. Everything was
destroyed except the gunpowder, that was aU in canisters.
But where was the other canoe ? I made up my mind
that it must be lost, for although much longer than
our boat, it was lower in the water. After some time
and much anxiety, we perceived it running for the
shore about half a mile in our rear; it was in the
midst of the breakers, and several times I lost sight of
it, but the old tree behaved weU, and brought the
crew safe to the shore.
Fortunately there was a viUage not far from the
spot where we landed, and we took possession of a

hut, lighted a good fire, and wrapped, ourselves in
Scotch plaids and blankets wrung out, while our clothes
were being dried, as there was not a dry rag in our
possession. We could procure nothing to eat, except a few dried
fish that, not having been salted, were rather high
i flavoured. Our fowls, and also two pet quails, were
drowned in the boat during the storm ; however, the-
drowned fowls were made into a stew, and with a
blazing fire, and clean straw to sleep upon, the night's
rest was perhaps as perfect as in the luxury of home.
. On the foUowing morning we were detained by bad
weather, as a heavy sea was stiU running, and we were
determined not to risk our canoes in another gale. It
was a beautiful neighbourhood, enhvened by a magni-
ficent waterfall that fell about a thousand feet from the
mountains, as the KaHgiri river emptied itself into the
lake in a splendid volume of water. This river rises
in the great marsh that* we had crossed on our way
from M'rooH to Vacovia. In this neighbourhood we
gathered some mushrooriis — the true Agaricus cam-
pestris of Europe — which were a great luxury.
In the afternoon the sea subsided, and we again
started. We had not proceeded above three mdes
from the village, when I observed an elephant bathing
in the lake ; he was in water so deep, that he stood

chap, hi.] SHOOT A CROCODILE. 121
with only the top of his head and trunk above the
surface. As we approached, he sunk entirely, only
the tip of his trunk remaining above the water. I
ordered the boatmen to put the canoe as close to
him as possible, and we passed within thirty yards,
just as he raised his head from his luxurious bath.
I was sorely tempted to fire, but remembering my
resolve, I refrained from disturbing him, and he slowly
quitted the lake, and entered' the thick jungle. A
short distance beyond this spot two large crocodiles
were lying upon the beach asleep ; but upon the
approach of the canoe they plunged into the water,
and raised their heads above the surface at about
twenty-five paces. I was uncertain about my Fletcher
rifle, as it had been exposed to so much wet ; therefore,
to discharge it, I .took a shot at the nearest crocodile
just behind the eye. The Httle rifle was in perfect
order— thanks to Eley's "double waterproof central
fire-caps," which wiU resist aU weathers — and the
bullet striking the exact spot, the great reptde gave a
convulsive lash with his tad, and turning on his back,
with his paws above the water, he graduaUy sunk.
The native boatmen were dreadfuUy frightened, at the
report of the rifle, to the great amusement of their
countrywoman, Bacheeta, and it was with difficulty
that I persuaded them to direct the canoe to the

122 TASTE OF CROCODILE FLESH. [chap. hi.
exact spot. Being close to the shore, the water was
not more than eight feet deep, and so beautifuUy clear,
that I could, when just above the crocodile, perceive it
lying at the bottom on its beUy, and distinguish the
bloody head that had been shattered by the buUet.
Whde one of my men prepared a sUp-knot, I took a
long lance that belonged to a boatman, and drove it
deep through the tough scales into the back, of the
neck; hauling gently, upon the lance T raised the
head near to the surface, and slipping the noose over
it, the crocodde was secured. It appeared to be quite
dead, and the flesh would be a bonne-bouche for my
men; therefore we towed it to the shore. It was a
fine monster, about sixteen feet long; and although
it had appeared dead, it bit furiously at a thick male
bamboo which I ran into its mouth to prevent it from
snapping during the process of decapitation. The
natives regarded my men with disgust as they cut
huge lumps of the choicest morsels and stowed them
in the canoes ; this did not occupy more than a quarter
of an hour, and hurrying on board, we continued our
voyage, weU provided with meat — for all who Hked it.
To my taste, nothing can be more disgusting than
¦ crocodile flesh. , I have eaten almost everything ; but
although I have tasted crocodile, I could never succeed
in swallowing it ; the combined flavour of bad fish,

rotten flesh, and musk, is the carte de diner offered to
the epicure.
That evening we saw an elephant with an enormous
pair of tusks; he was standing on a hiU about a
quarter of a mde from the boats as we halted. I was
aided to resist this temptation by an attack of fever :
it rained as usual, and no viUage being in the neigh
bourhood, we bivouacked in the rain on the beach in
clouds of mosquitoes.
The discomforts of this lake voyage were great ; in
the day we were cramped in our smaU cabin Hke two
. tortoises in one shell, and at night it almost invariably
rained. We were accustomed to the wet, but no accli
matisation can render the European body mosquito-
proof ; thus we had Httle rest. It was hard work for
. me, but for my unfortunate wife, who had hardly
recovered from her attack of coup de soleil, such hard
ships were most distressing.
On the foUowing morning the lake was calm, and
we started early. The monotony of the voyage was
broken by the presence of several fine herds of elephants,
consisting entirely of buUs. I counted fourteen of
these grand animals, aU with large tusks, bathing to
gether in a smaU shaUow lake beneath the mountains,
having a communication with the main lake through
a sandy beach : these elephants were only knee deep,

124 ELEPHANTS IN THE LAKE. '- [chap. iii.
and having been bathing they were perfectly clean,
and their colossal black forms and large white tusks
formed a beautiful picture in the calm lake beneath
the lofty cliffs. It was a scene in harmony with the
solitude of the Nde Sources — the wilderness of rocks
and forest, the Blue Mountains in the distance, and the
great fountain of nature adorned - with the mighty
beasts of Africa ; the elepharits in undisturbed grandeur,
arid hippopotami disporting their huge forms in the
great parent of the Egyptian river.
I ordered the boatmen to run the canoe ashore, that
we might land and enjoy the scene. We then dis
covered seven elephants on the shore within about two
hundred yards of us in high grass, while the main herd of
fourteen splendid bulls bathed majesticaUy in the placid
lake, showering cold streams from their trunks over
their backs and shoulders. There was no time to lose,
as every hour was important : quitting the shore, we
once more paddled along the coast.
Day after day passed, the time occupied in traveUing
from sunrise to mid-day, at which hour a strong gale
with rain and thunder occurred regularly, and obhged
us to haul our canoes ashore. The country was very
thinly inhabited, and the villages were poor and
wretched; the people most inhospitable. At length
we arrived at a considerable town situated in a

chap, hi.] INHOSPITABLE NATIVES. 125
beautiful bay beneath precipitous cliffs, the grassy
sides of which were covered with flocks of goats ; this,
was Eppigoya, and the boatmen that we had procured
from the last vdlage were to dehver us in this spot.
The delays in procuring boatmen were most annoying :
it appeared that the king had sent orders that each.
village was to supply the necessary rowers ; thus we
were paddled from place to place, at each of which the
men were changed, and no amount of payment would
induce them to continue with us to the end of our
voyage. Landing at Eppigoya we were at once met by the;
headman, and I proposed that he should sell us a few
kids, as the idea of a mutton chop was most appetizing.'
Far from supplying us with this luxury, the natives
immediately drove their flocks away, and after receiving,
a large present of beads, the headman brought us a
present of a sick lamb almost at the point of natural*
death, and merely skin and bone. Fortunately there
were fowls in thousands, as the natives did not use
them for food; these we purchased -for one blue bead
(monjoor) each, which in current value was equal
to 250 fowls for a shilling. Eggs were, brought in
baskets containing several hundreds, but they were all
poultry. At Eppigoya the best salt was produced, and we

purchased a good supply — also some dried fish : thus
provisioned, we procured boatmen, and again started
on our voyage.
Hardly had we proceeded two hundred yards, when
we were steered direct to the shore below the town,
and our boatmen cooUy laid down their paddles and
told us that they had performed their share, and that
as Eppigoya was divided into four parts under separate
headmen, each portion would supply rowers !
Ridiculous as this appeared, there was no contesting
their decision : and thus we were handed over from one
to the other, and delayed for about three hours in
changing boatmen four times within a distance of
less than a mde ! The perfect absurdity of such a
regulation, combined with the delay when time was
most precious, was trying to the temper. At every
change, the headman accompanied the boatmen to our
canoe, and presented us with three fowls at parting ;
thus our canoes formed a floating poultry show, as we
had already purchased large supplies. Our live stock
bothered us dreadfully : being without baskets, the
fowls were determined upon suicide, and many jumped
deliberately overboard, while others that were tied by
the legs were drowned in the bottom of the leaky
canoe. After the tenth day from our departure from Vacovia

the scenery increased in beauty. The lake had con
tracted to about thirty mdes in width, and was
decreasing rapidly northward; the trees upon the
mountains upon the western shore could be distin
guished. Continuing our voyage north, the western
shore projected suddenly, and diminished the width of
the lake to about twenty miles. It was no longer the
great inland sea that at Vacovia had so impressed me,
with the clean pebbly beach that had hitherto formed
the shore, but vast banks of reeds growing upon floating
vegetation prevented the canoes from landing. These
banks were most pecuUar, as they appeared to have
been formed of decayed vegetation, from which the
papyrus rushes took root ; — the thickness of the floating
mass was about three feet, and so tough and firm that
a man could walk upon it, merely sinking above his
ankles in the soft ooze. Beneath this raft of vegetation
was extremely deep water, and the shore for a width
of about half a mile was entirely protected by this ex
traordinary formation. One day a tremendous gale of
wind and heavy sea broke off large portions, and the
wind acting upon the rushes like sads, carried floating
islands of some acres about the lake to be deposited
wherever they might chance to hitch.
On the thirteenth day we found ourselves at the end
of. our lake voyage. The lake at this point was between

fifteen and twenty mdes across, and the appearance of '¦ '¦
the country, to the north was that of a delta. The
shores upon either side were choked with vast banks
of reeds, and as the canoe skirted the edge of that upon
the east coast, we could find no bottom with a bamboo
of twenty-five feet in length, although the floating mass
appeared like terra firma. We were in a perfect
wdderness of vegetation. On the west were mountains
of about 4,000 feet above the lake level, a continuation
of the chain that formed the western shore from the
south ; — these mountains decreased in height towards
the north, in which direction the lake terminated in a
broad. vaUey of.reeds..
We were told that we had arrived at Magungo, and
that this was the spot where the boats invariably
crossed from Malegga on the western shore to Kam
rasi's country. The boatmen proposed that we should
land upon the floating vegetation, as that would be a
short cut to the viUage or town of Magungo ; but as the
sweU of the water against the abrupt raft of reeds
threatened to swamp the canoe, I preferred coasting
until we should discover a good landing-place. After
skirting the floating reeds for about a mde, we turned
sharp to the east, and entered a broad channel of water
bounded on either side by the everlasting reeds. This
we were informed was the embouchure of the Somerset



## p. 129 (#159) ############################################

ciiap. m.] EMBOUCHURE OF THE SOMERSET RIVER. 129
river from the Victoria N'yanza. The same river that
we had crossed at Karuma, boiling and tearing along its
rocky com-se, now entered the Albert N'yanza as dead
water ! I could not understand this ; there was not
the sHghtest current ; the channel was about half a
mde wide, and I could hardly convince myself that
this was not an arm of the Take branching to the east.
After searching for some time for a landing place among
the wonderful banks of reeds, we discovered a passage
that had evidently been used as an approach by canoes,
but so narrow that our large canoe could with difficulty
be dragged through — aU the men walking through the
mud and reeds, and towing with their utmost strength.
Several hundred paces of this tedious work brought us
through the rushes into open water about eight feet
deep, opposite to a clean rocky shore. We had heard
voices for some time whde obscured on the other side
of the rushes, and we now found a number of natives,
who had arrived to meet us with the chief of Magungo
and our guide Rabonga, whom we had sent in advance
with the riding oxen from Vacovia. The water was
extremely shaUow near the shore, and the natives
rushed in and dragged the canoes by sheer force over
the mud to the land. We had been so entirely hidden
whde on the lake on the other side of the reed bank
that we had been unable to see the eastern, or Magungo

shore; we now found ourselves in a deUghtful spot
beneath the shade of several enormous trees on firm
sandy and rocky ground, whde the country rose in a
rapid incHne to the town of Magungo about a mde
distant on an elevated ridge.
My first question was concerning the riding oxen.
They were reported in good order. We were invited
to wait under a tree untd the presents from the head
man should be delivered. Accordingly, whde my wife
sat under the shade, I went to the waterside to examine
the fishing arrangements of the natives, that were on
an extensive scale. For many hundred feet, the edges
of the floating reeds were arranged to prevent the
possibdity of a large fish entering the open water ad
joining the shore without being trapped. A regular
system of baskets were fixed at intervals, with guiding
fences to their mouths. Each basket was about six
feet in diameter,, and the mouth about eighteen inches ;
thus the arrangements were for the monsters of the
lake, the large bones of which, strewed about the
vicinity, were a witness of their size. My men had
just secured the half of a splendid fish, known in the
Nde as the "baggera." They had found it in the
water, the other portion having been bitten off by a
crocodde. The piece in their possession weighed about
fifty pounds. This is one of the best fish in the lake.

fishing with the hook and line for heavy fish. They
arranged rows of taU bamboos, the ends stuck firmly

in the bottom, in a depth of about six feet of water,
and about five or ten yards apart. On the top of each
was a lump of ambatch-wood about ten inches in
diameter. Around this was wound a powerful line,
and, a smaU hole being made in this float, it was
- lightly fixed upon the point of the bamboo, or fishing-
rod. The line was securely attached to the bamboo,
then wound round the large float, whde the hook,
baited with a live fish, was thrown to some distance
beyond. Long rows of these fixed rods were set every
morning by natives in canoes, and watchers attended
them during the day, while they took their chance by
night. When a large fish took the bait, his first rush
unhitched the ambatch-float from the point of the
bamboo, which, revolving upon the water, paid out
line as required. When entirely run out, the great size
and buoyancy of the float served to check and to ex
haust the fish. There are several varieties of fish that
exceed 200 lbs. weight.
A number of people now arrived from the viUage,
bringing a goat, fowls, eggs, and sour milk, and, beyond
all luxuries, fresh butter. I delighted the chief, in return
for his civdity, by giving him a quantity of beads, and
we were led up the hill towards Magungo.
The day was beautifuUy clear. The soil was sandy
and poor, therefore the road was clean and hard ; and,

chap, iii.] EXIT OF THE NILE FROM THE LAKE. 133
after the many days' boating, we enjoyed the walk, and
the splendid view that lay before us when we arrived
at Magungo, and looked back upon the lake. We were
about 250 feet above the water level. There were no
longer the abrupt cliffs, descending to the lake, that
we had seen in the south, but the general level of the
country appeared to be about 500 feet above the water,
at a distance of five or six miles, from which point
the ground descended in undulations, Magungo being
situated on the summit of the nearest incline. The
mountains on the MaUegga side, with the lake in the
foreground, were the most prominent objects, forming
the western boundary. A few mdes north there appeared
to be a gap in the range, and the lake continued to the
west, but much contracted, whde the mountain range on
the northern side of the gap continued to the north-east.
Due north and north-east the country was a dead flat,
and far as the eye could.reach was an extent of bright
green reeds, marking the course of the Nile as it made
its exit from the lake. The sheet of water at Magungo
being about seventeen mdes in width, ended in a long
strip or tad to the north, until it was lost in the flat
vaUey of green rushes. This valley may have been
from four to six mdes wide, and was bounded upon
its west bank by the continuation of the chain of
mountains that had formed the western boundary of

the lake. The natives told me that canoes could navi
gate the Nile in its course from the lake to the Madi
country, as there were no cataracts for a greatdistance,
but that both the Madi and the Koshi were hostile,
and that the current of the river was so strong,
that should the canoe descend from the lake, it could
not return without many rowers. They pointed out
the country of Koshi on the west bank of the Nde,
at its exit from the lake, which included the moun
tains that bordered the river. The smaU country,
M'Caroli, joined Mallegga, and continued to the west,
towards the Makkarika. The natives most positively
refused to take me down the Nile from the lake into
the Madi, as they said that they would be kiUed by
the people, who. were their enemies, as I should not be
with them on their return up the river.
The exit of the Nile from the lake was plain enough,
and if the broad channel of dead water were indeed the
entrance of the Victoria Nde (Somerset) the information
obtained by Speke would be remarkably confirmed
Up to the present time all the information that I had
received from Kamrasi and his people had been correct.
He had told me that I should be about twenty days
from M'rooH to the lake ; I had been eighteen. He
had also told me that the Somerset flowed from Karuma
direct to the lake, aud that, having joined it, the great

Nde issued from the lake almost immediately, and
flowed through the Koshi and Madi tribes. I now saw
the river issuing from the lake within eighteen miles
of Magungo ; and the Koshi and the Madi countries
appeared close to me, bordering it on the west and
east. Kamrasi being the king, it was natural that he
should know his own frontier most intimately; but,
although the chief of Magungo and aU the natives
assured me that the broad channel of dead water at my
feet was positively the brawling river that I had crossed
below the Karuma Falls, I could not understand how
so fine a body of water as that had appeared could
possibly enter the Albert Lake as dead water. The
-guide and natives laughed at my unbeHef, and declared
that it was dead water for a considerable distance from
the junction with the lake, but that a great waterfaU
rushed down from a mountain, and that beyond that
fad the river was merely a succession of cataracts
throughout the entire distance of about six days' march
to Karuma Falls. My real wish was to descend the
Nde in canoes from its exit from the lake with my
own men as boatmen, and thus in a short time to reach
the cataracts in the Madi country ; there to forsake
the canoes and aU my baggage, and to march direct to
Gondokoro with only our guns and ammunition. I
knew from native report that the Nde was navigable

136 DETERMINATION TO SETTLE NILE QUESTION, [chap. hi.
as far as the Madi country to about Miani's tree, which
Speke had laid down by astronomical observation in
lat. 3° 3 4'; this would be only seven days' march from
Gondokoro, and by such a direct course I should be
sure to arrive in time for the boats to Khartoum. I
-had promised Speke that I would explore most tho
roughly the doubtful portion of the river that he had
been forced to neglect from Karuma FaUs to the lake.
I was myself confused at the dead water junction; and,
although I knew that the natives must be right — as it
was their own river, and they had no inducement to
mislead me — I was determined to sacrifice every other
wish in order to fulfil my promise, and thus to settle
the Nile question most absolutely. That the Nde flowed
out of the lake I had heard, and I had also confirmed
by actual inspection ; from Magungo I looked upon
the two countries, Koshi and Madi, through which it
flowed, and these countries I must actuaUy pass through
and again meet the Nde before I could reach Gondo
koro. Thus the only point necessary to swear to, was
the river between the lake and the Karuma FaUs.
I had a bad attack of fever that evening, and missed
my star for the latitude ; but on the foUowing morn
ing before daybreak I obtained a good observation
of Vega, and determined the latitude of Magungo
2° 16' due west from Atada or Karuma Falls. This



## p. 137 (#167) ############################################

ciiav. in.] NOBLY SECONDED BY MRS. BAKER. ]tf
was a strong confirmation that the river beneath my feet
Avas the Somerset that I had crossed in the same lati
tude at Atada, where the river was running due west,
and where the natives had pointed in that direction
as its com-se to the lake. Nevertheless, I was deter
mined to verify it, although by this circuitous route I
might lose the boats from Gondokoro and become a
prisoner in Central Africa, iU, and without quinine, for
another year. I proposed it to my wife, who not only
voted in her state of abject weakness to complete the
river to Karuma, but wished, if possible, to return and
foUow the Nde from the lake down to Gondokoro !
This latter resolve, based upon the simple principle of
" seeing is beHeving," was a sacrifice most nobly pro
posed, but simply impossible and unnecessary.
We saw from our point at Magungo the Koshi and
Madi countries, and the Nde flowing out of the lake
through them. We must of necessity pass through
those countries on our road to Gondokoro direct from
Karuma via Shooa, and should we not meet the river
in the Madi and Koshi country, the Nile that we now
saw would not be the Nde of Gondokoro. We knew,
however, that it was so, as Speke and Grant had gone
by that route, and had met the Nde near Miani's tree
in lat. 3° 34' in the Madi country, the Koshi being on
its western bank ; thus, as we were now at the Nile

head and saw it passing through the Madi and Koshi,
any argument against the river would be the argu-
mentum ad dbsurdum. I ordered the boats to be got
ready to start immediately.
The chief gave me much information, confirming the
accounts that I had heard a year previous in the La- 
tooka countries, that formerly cowrie shells were brought
in boats from the south, and that these sheUs and brass
coil brackets came by the lake from Karagwe\ He
caUed also several of the natives of Mallegga, who had
arrived with beautifuUy-prepared mantles of antelope
and goat-skins, to exchange for bracelets and glass
beads. The Mallegga people were in appearance the
same as those of Unyoro, but they spoke a different
language. The boats being ready, we took leave of the chief,
leaving him an acceptable present of beads, and we
descended the hiU to the river, thankful at having
so far successfuUy terminated the expedition as to
have traced the lake to that important point Magungo,
which had been our clue to the discovery even so far
away in time- and place as the distant country of
Latooka. We were both very weak and iU, and my
knees trembled beneath me as we walked down the
easy descent. I, in my enervated state, endeavouring
to assist my wife, we were the "blind leading the

bUnd ; " but had Hfe closed on that day we could have
died most happdy, for the hard fight through sick
ness and misery had ended in victory ; and, although
I looked to home as a paradise never to be regained,
I could have lain down to sleep in contentment on
this spot, with the consolation that, if the body had
been vanquished, we died with the prize in our grasp.
On arrival at the canoes we found everything in
readiness, and the boatmen afready in their places. A
crowd of natives pushed us over the shadows, and
once in deep water we passed through a broad canal
which led us into the open channel without the labour
of towing through the narrow inlet by which we had
arrived. Once in the broad channel of dead water we
steered due east, and made rapid way untd the even
ing. The river as it now appeared, although devoid
of current, was an average of about 500 yards in
width. Before we halted for the night I was sub
jected to a most severe attack of fever, and upon the
boat reaching a certain spot I was carried on a Utter,
perfectly unconscious, to a viUage, attended carefuUy
by my poor sick wife, who, herself half dead, foUowed
me on foot through the marshes in pitch darkness,
and watched over me untd the morning. At day
break I was too weak to stand, and we were both
carried down to the canoes, and, crawHng helplessly

140 ¦ STRICKEN AGAIN WITH FEVER. [chap. in.
within our grass awning, we lay down like logs while
the canoes continued their voyage. Many of our men
were also suffering from fever. The malaria of the
dense masses of floating vegetation was most poisonous;
and, upon looking back to the canoe that followed in
our wake, I observed all my men sitting crouched
together sick and dispirited, looking like departed
spirits being ferried across the melancholy Styx.
The river now contracted rapidly to about two
hundred and fifty yards in width about ten miles
from Magungo. We had left the vast flats of rush
banks, and entered a channel between high ground,
forming steep forest-covered hids, about 200 feet on
either side, north and south : nevertheless there was
uo perceptible stream, although there was no doubt
that we were actuaUy in the channel of a river. The
water was clear and exceedingly deep. In the
evening we halted, and slept on a mud bank close
to the water. The grass in the forest was very high
and rank : thus we were glad to find an open space
'for a bivouac, although a nest of mosquitoes and
malaria. On waking the next morning, I observed that a
thick fog covered the surface of the river ; and as I
lay upon my back, on my angarep, I amused myself
before I woke my men by watching the fog slowly

lifting from the river. While thus employed I was
struck by the fact, that the little green water-plants,
Hke floating cabbages (Pistia Stratiotes, L.), were cer
tainly, although very slowly, moving to the west. I
immediately jumped up and watched them most atten
tively; there was no doubt about it; they were travelling
towards the Albert Lake. We were now about eighteen
mdes in a direct Hne from Magungo, and there was
a current in the river, which, however slight, was never
theless perceptible.
Our todette did not take long to arrange, as we had
thrown ourselves down at night with our clothes on ;
accordingly we entered the canoe at once, and gave
the order to start.
The woman Bacheeta knew the country, as she had
formerly been to Magungo when in the service of Sali-,
who had been subsequently murdered by Kamrasi j
she now informed me that we should terminate our
canoe voyage on that day, as we should arrive at the
great waterfall of which she had often spoken. As
we proceeded, the river graduaUy narrowed to about
180 yards, and when the paddles ceased working
we could distinctly hear the roar of water. I had
heard this on waking in the morning, but at the
time I had imagined it to proceed from distant
thunder. .By ten o'clock the current had .so in-

creased as we proceeded, that it was distinctly per
ceptible, although weak. The roar of the waterfall was
extremely loud, and after sharp puUing for a couple of
hours, during which time the stream increased, we
arrived at a few deserted fishing-huts, at a point where
the river made a sUght turn. I never saw such an
extraordinary show of crocodiles as were exposed on
every sandbank on the sides of the river ; they lay
like logs of timber close together, and upon one bank
we counted twenty-seven, of large size ; every basking
place was crowded in a simdar manner. From the
time we had fairly entered the river, it had been con
fined by heights somewhat precipitous on either side,
rising to about 180 feet. At this point the cliffs
were stiU higher, and exceedingly abrupt. From the
roar of the water, I was sure that the faU would be in
sight if we turned the corner at the bend of the river ;
accordingly I ordered the boatmen to row as far as
they could : to this they at first objected, as they
wished to stop at the deserted fishing viUage, which
they explained was to be the limit of the journey,
further progress being impossible.
However, I explained that I merely wished to see
the faU, and they rowed immediately up the stream,
which was now strong against us. Upon rounding the
corner, a magnificent sight burst suddenly upon us.

chap, in.] THE MURCHISON FALLS. 143
On either side the river were beautifuUy wooded cUffs
rising abruptly to a height of about 300 feet ; rocks
were jutting out from the intensely green foHage ; and
rushing through a gap that cleft the rock exactly be
fore us, the river, contracted from a grand stream, was
pent up in a narrow gorge of scarcely fifty yards in
width ; roaring furiously through the rock-bound
pass, it plunged in one leap of about 120 feet (.per
pendicular into a dark abyss below.
The fall of water was snow-white, which had a
superb effect as it contrasted with the dark cUffs that
waUed the river, while the graceful palms of the tropics
and wdd plantains perfected the beauty of the view.
This was the greatest waterfaU of the Nde, and, in
honour of the distinguished President of the Royal
Geographical Society, I named it the Murchison Fads,
as the most important object throughout the entire
course of the river.
The boatmen, having been promised a present of
beads to induce them to approach the faU as close as
possible succeeded in bringing the canoe within about
300 yards of the base, but the power of the current
and the whirlpools in the river rendered it impossible
to proceed farther. There was a sand-bank on our
left which was HteraUy covered with crocodiles lying
parallel to each other like trunks of trees prepared

for shipment ; they had no fear of the canoe until
we approached within about twenty yards of them,
when they slowly crept into the water ; all except
ing one, an immense fellow who lazdy lagged be
hind, and immediately dropped dead as a bullet
froiri the Httle Fletcher No. 24 struck him in the
brain. • So alarmed were the boatmen at the unexpected
report of the rifle that they immediately dropped into
the body of the canoe, one of them losing his paddle.
Nothing would induce them to attend to the boat, as I
had fired a second shot at the crocodde as a " quietus,"
and the natives did not know how often the alarming
noise would be repeated. Accordingly we were at the
mercy of the powerful stream, and the canoe was
whisked round by the eddy and carried against a thick
bank of high reeds; — hardly had we touched this ob
struction when a tremendous commotion took place in
the rushes, and in an instant a great bull hippopotamus
charged the canoe, and with a severe shock striking the
bottom he lifted us half out of the water. The natives
who were in the bottom of the boat positively yeUed
with terror, not knowing whether the shock was in any
way connected with the dreaded report of the rifle ;
the black women screamed ; and the boy Saat handing
me a. spare rifle, and Richarn being ready likewise, we

looked out for a shot should the angry hippo again
attack us.
A few kicks bestowed by my angry men upon the
recumbent boatmen restored them to the perpendicular..
The first thing necessary was to hunt for the lost pad
dle that was floating down the rapid current. The
hippopotamus, proud of having disturbed us, but doubt
less thinking us rather hard of texture, raised his head
to take a last view of his enemy, but sank too rapidly
to permit a shot. Crocodile heads of enormous size
were on aU sides, appearing and vanishing rapidly as
they rose to survey us ; at one time we counted
eighteen upon the surface. Fine fun it would have
been for these monsters had the buU hippo been
successful in his attempt to capsize us; the fat black
woman, Karka, would have been a dainty morsel.
Having recovered the lost paddle, I prevailed upon
the boatmen to keep the canoe steady while I made
a sketch of the Murchison FaUs, which being com
pleted, we drifted rapidly down to the landing-place
at the deserted fishing-vUlage, and bade adieu to the
navigation of the lake and river of Central Africa.
The few huts that existed in this spot were mere
ruins. Clouds had portended rain, and down it came,

looseness of the bowels. I saw that it was all up
with our -animals. Weak as I was myself, I was
obhged to walk, as my ox could not carry me up
the steep inoHnation, and I toded languidly to the
summit of the cliff. It poured with rain. Upon
arrival at the summit we were in precisely the same
park-Hke land that characterises Chopi and Unyoro,
but the grass was about seven feet high ; and from
the constant rain, and the extreme fertility of the
sod, the country was choked with vegetation. We
were now above the Murchison FaUs; and we heard
the roaring of the water ' beneath us to our left. We
continued our route paraUel to the river above the
FaUs, steering east ; and a little before evening we
arrived at a smaU viUage belonging' to the j headman

was protected by a hide roofing. Feverish and ex

On the foUowing morning we started; the route as
before paraUel to the river, and so close that the roar
of the rapids was extremely loud. The river flowed in
a deep ravine upon our left. We continued for a clay's
march along the Somerset, crossing many ravines

and torrents, until we turned suddenly down to the
left, and arriving at the bank we were to be trans
ported to an island caUed Patooan, that was tiie resi
dence of a chief. It was about an hour after sunset,
and being dark, my riding ox, who was being driven
as too weak to carry me, feU into an elephant pitfaU.
After much haUooing, a canoe was brought from the
island which was not more than fifty yards from the
mainland, and we were ferried across. We were both
very id with a sudden attack of fever ; and my wife,
not being able to stand, was, on arrival on the island,
carried in a litter I knew not whither, escorted by
some of my men, while«.I lay down on the wet ground
quite exhausted with the annihdating disease. At

those who had carried my wife to the viUage returning

the aid of a long stick, upon which I rested with both

natives, made themselves much more comfortable than
their employers ; nor did they attempt to interfere with
our misery in any way until summoned to appear at
sunrise. The island of Patooan was about half a mde
long by 150 yards wide, and was one of the
numerous masses of rocks that choke the river
between Karuma Falls and the great Murchison
cataract. The rock was entirely of grey granite,
from the clefts of which beautiful forest trees grew
so thickly that the entire island was in shade. In
the middle of this secluded spot was a considerable
viUage thickly inhabited, as the population of the
mainland had fled from their dwellings and had
taken refuge upon the numerous river islands, as the
war was raging between Rionga and Kamrasi. A
succession of islands from the east of Patooan con
tinued to within a march of Karuma FaUs. These
were in the possession of Rionga, and a still more
powerful chief and ally, Fowooka, who were the
deadly enemies of Kamrasi.
It now appeared that after my departure from
M'rooli to search for the lake, Ibrahim had been in
structed by Kamrasi to accompany his army, and

attack Fowooka. This had been effected, but the
attack had been confined to a bombardment by
musketry from the high cliffs of the river upon the
people confined upon one of the islands. A number
of men had been kiUed, and Ibrahim had returned to
Gondokoro with a quantity of ivory and porters sup
plied by Kamrasi ; but he had left ten of his armed
men as hostages with the king, to act as his guard
until he should return on the foUowing year to Unyoro.
Ibrahim and his strong party having quitted the coun-^
try, Fowooka had invaded the mainland of Chopi,
and had burnt and destroyed aU the villages, and kiUed
many people, including a powerful chief of Kamrasi's,
the father of the headman of the island of Patooan
where we were now staying. Accordingly the fugi
tives from the destroyed vdlages had taken refuge
upon the island of Patooan, and others of the same
character. The headman informed us that it would
be impossible to proceed along the bank of the river
to Karuma, as that entire line of country was in
possession of the enemy. This was sufficient to assure
me that I should not procure porters.
There was no end to the difficulties and trouble in
this horrible country. My exploration was completed,
as it was by no means necessary to continue the route
from Patooan to Karuma. I had followed the Somerset

from its junction with the lake at Magung©> to this
point; here it was a beautiful river, precisely similki' mi
character to the point at which I had Left it. at. Kar-
ruina, we were now within thirty mdes of that platb
and about eighteen miles from the point opposite
Rionga's island, where we had first hit upon, the' amnn
on our arrival from the north. The direetioni waa p«ai-
fectly in accordance with my observations, at Karuinaav
and at Magungo, the Somerset running from. east, to,
west. The river was about 180 to 200 yards in. width,
but much obstructed with rocks and islands ; the -stream
ran at about four mdes per hour, and the rapids- and
falls were so numerous that the roar of water had beeni
continuous throughout our march from MurcMsom's
Falls. By -observations of Casella's thermometeB I
made the altitude of the river level at the island of
Patooan 3,195 feet ; thus from this point to- the level
of the Albert Lake at Magungo, there was a fall- &£
475 feet — this difference being included between. Pa>
todan and the foot of Murchison Falls : the latter, baing
at the lowest estimate 120 feet, left 355 feet, to he
accounted for between Patooan and the top of the fa-Is-.
As the ledges of rock throughout the course of the
river formed a series of steps, this was a mataral dif
ference in altitude that suggested the eoEBectness of
the observations.



## p. 152 (#184) ############################################

1 52 DIFFERENCE IN OBSERVATIONS. [chap. in.
At the river level below Karuma Falls I had mea
sured the altitude at 3,996 feet above the sea level.
Thus, there was a fall from that point to Patooan of
801 feet, and a total of 1,276 feet in the descent of the
river from Karuma to the Albert N'yanza. These
measurements, most carefully taken, corroborated the
opinion suggested by the natural appearance of the
river, which was a mere succession of cataracts through
out its westerly course from Karuma.
• To me. these observations were more than usuaUy
interesting, as when I had met my friend Speke at
Gondokoro, he was inuch perplexed concerning the
extraordinary difference in his observation between the
altitude of the river-level at Karuma FaUs, lat. 2° 15',
and at Gebel Kookoo in the Madi country, lat. 3° 34',
the point at which he subsequently met the river. He
knew that both rivers were the Nde, as he had been
told this by the natives ; the one, before it had joined
the Albert Lake — the other, after its exit ; but he had
been told that the river was navigable from Gebel
Kookoo, lat. 3° 34', straight up to the junctiori of the
lake ; thus, there could be no great difference in altitude
between the lake and the Nde where he met it, in lat.
3° 34'. Nevertheless, he found so enormous a difference
in his observations between the river at Karuma and at,
Gebel Kookoo that he concluded there must be a fall



## p. 153 (#185) ############################################

chap, m.] ALTITUDES. 153
between Karuma and the Albert Lake of at least 1,000
feet ; by careful measurements I proved the closeness of
his reasoning and observation, by finding a fall of only
275 feet more than he had anticipated. From Karuma
to the Albert Lake (although unvisited by Speke), he
had marked upon his map, "river faUs 1,000 feet;"
by actual measurement I proved it to be 1,275 feet.
The altitudes measured by me have been examined,
and the thermometer that I used has been tested at
Kew, and its error corrected since my return to England ;
thus aU altitudes observed with that thermometer
should be correct, as the results after correction by Mr.
Dunkin, of the Greenwich Royal Observatory, are those
now quoted. It wiU therefore be interesting to compare
the observations taken at the various points on the
Nile and Albert Lake in the countries of Unyoro and
Chopi — the correctness of which relatively wdl be seen
by comparison : —

sixty-five feet ; say minus five feet; for the Karuma Falls
equals-sixty feet' fall in 37' of latitude; or aUowirig for
the great bend of the river, twenty miles of extra course,
it will be equal to about sixty statute miles of actual
river from M'rooli to Atada or Karuma FaUs, showing
a fall of one foot per mile. Froiri M'rooli to the head
of the Karuma FaUs the river is navigable ; thus the
observations of altitudes showing a fall of one foot
per mile must be extremely accurate.

CHAPTER IV.
TREACHEROUS DESIGNS OE THE NATIVES.
We were prisoners on the island of Patooan, as we
could not procure porters at any price to remove our
effects. We had lost aU our riding oxen within a few
days ; they had succumbed to the flies, and the only
animal alive was already half dead ; this was the little
buU that had always carried the boy Saat. It was the
8 th April, and within a few days the boats upon which
we depended for our return to civilization would as
suredly quit Gondokoro. I offered the natives aU the
beads that I had (about 50 lbs.), and the whole of my
baggage, if they would carry us to Shooa direct from
this spot. We were in perfect despair, as we were both
completely worn out with fever and fatigue, and certain
death seemed to stare us in the face should we remain
in this unhealthy spot; worse than death was the idea



## p. 156 (#188) ############################################

156 CONFINED IN THE COUNTRY. [chap. iv.
of losing the boats and becoming prisoners for another
year in this dreadful land ; which must inevitably
happen should we not hurry direct to Gondokoro with
out delay. The natives, with their usual cunning, at
length offered to convey us to Shooa, provided that I
paid them the beads in advance ; the boats were pre
pared to ferry us across the river, but I fortunately
discovered through the woman Bacheeta their treach
erous intention of placing us on the uninhabited
wilderness on the north side, and leaving us to die of
hunger. They .had conspired together to land us, but
to immediately return with the boats after having thus
got rid of the incubus of their guests.
We were in a great dilemma — had we been in good
health, I would have forsaken everything but the guns
and ammunition, and have marched direct to Gondo
koro on foot : but this was utterly impossible ; neither
my wife nor I could walk a quarter of a mde without
fainting — there was no guide — and the country was
now overgrown with impenetrable grass and tangled
vegetation eight feet high ; — we were in the midst of
(he rainy season; — not a day passed without a few hours
of deluge— altogether it was a most heartbreaking
position. Added to the distress of mind at being thus
thwarted, there was also a great scarcity of provision.
Many of my men were weak, the whole party having

suffered much from fever — in fact, we were completely
helpless. Our guide Rabonga, who had accompanied us from
M'rooH, had absconded, and we were left to shift for
ourselves. I was determined not to remain on the
island, as I suspected that the boats might be taken
away, and that we should be kept prisoners ; I there
fore ordered my men to take the canoes, and to ferry
us to the main land, from whence we had come. The
headman, upon hearing this order, offered to carry us
to a viUage, and then to await orders from Kamrasi as
to whether we were to be forwarded to Shooa or not.
The district in which the island of Patooan was situ^
ated was caUed Shooa Moru, although having no con
nexion with the Shooa in the Madi country to which
we were bound.
We were ferried across to the main shore, and both
in our respective angareps were carried by the natives
for about three mdes, arriving at a deserted' viUage,
half of which was in ashes, having been burnt and
plundered by the enemy ; we were deposited on the
ground in front of an old hut in the pouring rain, and
were informed that we should remain there that night,
but that on the foUowing morning we should proceed
to our destination.
Not trusting the natives, I ordered my men to dis-

158 DESERTED BY THE NATIVES. [chap. Iv:
arm them, and to retain their spears and shields as
security for their appearance on the following day.1
This effected, we were carried into a filthy hut about
six inches deep in mUd, as the roof was much out of
repair, and the heavy rain had flooded it daily for some
weeks. I had a canal cut through the muddy floor;
and in misery and low spirits we took possession.
On the foUowing morning not a native was present!"
We had been entirely deserted ; although I held the
spears and shields, every man had absconded — there
were neither inhabitants nor provisions — the wholes
eountfy was a wilderness of rank grass that hemmed
us in on all sides ; not an animal, nor even a bird was
to be seen; it was a miserable, damp, lifeless country.
We were on elevated ground, and the vaUey of the
Somerset was about two miles to our north, the river
roaring suUenly in its obstructed passage, its course
marked by the double belt of huge dark trees that
grew upon its banks.
My men were -naturally outrageous, and they pro
posed that we should return to Patooan, seize the
eanoes, and take provisions by force, as we had been-
disgracefuUy deceived. The natives had merely depo
sited us here to get us out of the way, and in' this'
spot we might starve. Of course I would not counte
nance the proposal of seizing provisions, but I directed

my men to search among the ruined viUages for buried
corn, in company with the woman Bacheeta, who, being
a native of this country, would be up to the ways of
the people, and might assist in the discovery.
After some hours passed in rambling over the black
ashes of several viUages that had been burnt, they dis*
covered a hoUow place, by sounding the earth with a
stick, and, upon digging, they arrived at a granary of
the seed known. as "tuUaboon ;" this was a great prize,
as, although mouldy and bitter, it would keep us from
starving. The women of the party were soon hard at
work grinding, as many of the necessary stones had
been found among the ruins. *
Fortunately there were three varieties of plants grow
ing wild in great profusion, that, when boiled^ were a
good substitute for spinach ; thus we were rich in Vege
tables, although without a morsel of fat or animal food.
Our dinner consisted daily of a mess of black porridge
of bitter mouldy flour, that no English pig would con
descend to notice, and a large dish of spinach. "Better
a dinner of herbs where love is," &c. often occurred to
me ; but I am not sure, that I was quite of that opinion
after a fortnight's grazing upon spinach.
Tea and coffee were things of the past, the very idea
of which made our mouths water ; . but I found a
species of wdd thyme growing, in the jungles, and



## p. 160 (#192) ############################################

160 MISERY AT SHOOA MORU, [chap. iv.
this, when boiled, formed a tolerable substitute for tea ;
sometimes our men procured a little wild honey, which,
added to^the thyme tea, we considered a great luxury.;
This wretched fare, in our exhausted state from
fever and general effects of climate, so completely
disabled us, that for nearly two months my wife lay
helpless on one angarep, and I upon- the other ; neither
of us could walk. The hut was Hke aU in Kamrasi's
country, a perfect forest of thick poles to support the
roof (I counted thirty-two) ; thus, although it was
tolerably large, there was but Httle accommodation.
These poles we now found very convenient, as we were
so weak, that we could not rise from bed without
hauhng by one of the supports.
We were very nearly dead, and our amusement was a
childish conversation about the good things in England,
and my idea of perfect happiness was an English beef
steak and a bottle of pale ale ; for such a luxury I
would most wiUingly have sold my birthright at that
hungry moment. We were perfect skeletons ; and it
was annoying to see how we suffered upon the bad
fare, whde our men apparently throve. There were
plenty of wild red peppers, and the men seemed tq
enjoy a mixture of porridge and legumes a la sauce
piquante. They were astonished at my falUng away
on this food, but they yielded to my argument when.



## p. 161 (#193) ############################################

chap. iv.J HARD FARE. 161
I suggested that a " Hon would starve where a donkey
grew fat." I must confess that this state of existence
did not improve my temper, which, I fear, became
nearly as bitter as the porridge. My people had a
windfall of luck, as Saat's ox, that had lingered for a
long time, lay down to die, and stretching himself out,
commenced kicking his last kick ; the men immedi
ately assisted him by cutting his throat, and this
supply of beef was a luxury which, even in my hungry
state, was not the Enghsh beefsteak for which I
sighed ; and I declined the diseased buU.
The men made several long excursions through the
country to endeavour to purchase provisions, but in
two months they procured only two kids ; the entire
country was deserted, owing to the war between Kam
rasi and Fowooka. Every day the boy Saat and the
woman Bacheeta saUied out and conversed with the
inhabitants of the different islands on the river ; some
times, but very rarely, they returned with a fowl ;
such an event caused great rejoicing.
We had now given up aU hope of Gondokoro, and
were perfectly resigned to our fate ; this, we felt sure,
was to be buried in Chopi. I wrote instructions in
my journal, in case of death, and told my headman
to be sure to dehver my maps, observations, and
papers to the English Consul at Khartoum ; this was

162 PREPARATION FOR DEATH. [chap. iv.
my only care, as I feared that all my labom- might
be lost should I die. I had no fear for my wife, as
she was quite as bad as I, and if one should die,
the other would certainly follow ; in fact, this had
been agreed iipon lest she should faU into the hands
of Kamrasi at my death. We had struggled to win,
and I thanked God that we had won ; if death were
to be the price, at all events we were at the goal,
and we both looked upon death rather as a pleasure,
as affording rest ; there would be no more suffering ;
no fever ; no long journey before us, that in our weak
state was an infliction ; the only wish was to lay down
the burthen.
Curious is the warfare between the animal instincts
and the mind ! Death would have been a release that
I would have courted, but I should have liked that
one " English beefsteak and pale ale " before I died !
During our misery of constant fever and starvation
at Shooa Morii, insult had been added to injury.
There was no doubt that we had been thus deserted
by Kamrasi's orders, as every seven or eight days one
of his chiefs arrived, and told me that the king was
with his army only four days' march from me, and
that he was preparing to attack Fowooka, but that
he wished me to join him, as with my fourteen guns
we should win a, great victory. This treacherous con-

duct, after his promise to forward me without delay
to Shooa, em-aged me exceedingly. We had lost the
boats at Gondokoro, and we were now nailed to the
country for another year, should we Hve, which was
not Hkely ; not only had the brutal king thus deceived
us, but he was dehberately starving us into conditions,
his aim being that my men should assist him against
his enemy. At one time the old enemy tempted me
sorely to join Fowooka against Kamrasi ; but, discarding
the idea generated in a moment of passion, I deter
mined to resist his proposals to the last. It was per
fectly true that the king was within thirty mdes of us,
and that he was aware of our misery; he made use
of our extremity to force us to become his aUies.
After more than two months passed in this distress
it became evident that something must be done ; I sent
my headman, or vakeel, and one man with a native as
a guide (that Saat and Bacheeta had procured from an
island), with instructions to go direct to Kamrasi, to
abuse him thoroughly in my name for having thus
treated us, and teU him that I was much insulted at
his treating with me through a third party in proposing
an aUiance. My vakeel was to explain that I was a
much more powerful chief than Kamrasi, and that if
he required my aUiance, he must treat with me in
person, and immediately send fifty men to transport

164 THE BAIT TAKES., [chap. iv.
my wife, myself, and effects to his camp, where we
might, in a personal interview, come to terms.
I told my vakeel to return to me with the fifty men,
and to be sure to bring from Kamrasi some token by
which I should know that he had actuaUy seen him.
The vakeel and Yaseen started.
After some days, the absconded guide, Rabonga,
appeared with a number of men, but without either
my vakeel or Yaseen. He carried with him a smaU
gourd bottle, carefully stopped ; this he broke, and
extracted from the inside two pieces of printed paper,
that Kamrasi had sent to me in reply.
On examining the papers, I found them to be
portions of the Enghsh Church Service translated into
(I think) the " KisiiahiH " language, by Dr. Krapf !
There were many notes in pencd on the margin, written
in Enghsh, as translations of words in the text. It
quickly occurred to me that Speke must have given
this book to Kamrasi on his arrival from Zanzibar, and
m
that he riow extracted the leaves, and sent them to me
as the token ,1 had demanded to show that my message
had been dehvered" to him.
Rabonga made a lame excuse for his previous
desertion ; he dehvered a thin ox that Kamrasi had
sent me, and he declared that his orders were, that he
should take my whole party immediately to Kamrasi,

as he was anxious that we should attack Fowooka
without loss of time ; we were positively to start on
the foUowing morning ! My bait had taken ! and we
should escape from this frightful spot, Shooa Moru.
On the following morning we were carried in our
Utters by a number of men. The ox had been kdled,
the whole party had reveUed in good food, and a
supply sufficient for the journey was taken by my
men. Without inflicting the tedium of the journey upon
the reader, it wiU be sufficient to say that the country
was the same as usual, being a vast park overgrown
with immense grass. Every day the porters bolted,
and we were left deserted at the charred ruins of
various viUages that had been plundered by Fowooka's
people. It poured with rain ; there was no cover, as
aU the huts had been burnt, and we were stricken
with severe fever dady. However, after five days of
absurdly slow marching, the roar of the rapids being
distinctly audible at night, we arrived one morning
at a deserted camp of about 3,000 huts, which were
just being ignited by several natives. This had been
Kamrasi's head-quarters, which he had quitted, and
according to native custom it was to be destroyed
by fire. It was reported, that the king had removed
to another position within an hour's march, and that

he had constructed a new camp. Although throughout
the journey from Shooa Moru the country had been
excessively wild and uncultivated, this neighbourhood
was a mass of extensive plantain groves and burnt
villages, but every plantain-tree had been cut through
the middle and recklessly destroyed. This destruction.'
had been perpetrated by Fowooka's people, who had
invaded the country, but had retreated on the advance
of Kamrasi's army.
After winding through dense jungles- of bamboos
and interminable groves of destroyed plantains, we
perceived the tops of a number of grass huts appearing
among the trees. My men now begged to be allowed
to fire a salute, as it was reported that the ten men of
Ibrahim's party that had been left as hostages were
quartered at this village with Kamrasi. Hardly had
the firing commenced, when it was immediately replied
to by the Turks from their camp, who, upon our
approach, came out to meet us with great manifesta
tions of delight and wonder at our having accomplished
our long and difficult voyage.
My vakeel and Yaseen were the first to meet us,
• with an apology that severe fever had compelled them
to remain in camp instead of returning to Shooa Moru
according to my orders, but they had delivered my
message to Kamrasi, who had, as I had' supposed, sent

two leaves out of a book Speke had given him, as a
reply. An immense amount of news had to lie ex
changed between my men and those of Ibrahim ; they
had quite given us up for lost, until they heard that
we were at Shooa Moru. A report had reached them
that my wife was dead, and that I had died a few days
"later. A great amount of kissing and embracing took
place, Arab fashion, between the two parties ; and they
all came to kiss my hand and that of my wife, with
the exclamation, that "By Allah, no woman in the
world had a heart so tough as to dare to face what she
had gone through." " El hamd el Illah ! El hamd el
IUah bel salaam ! " ("Thank God— be grateful to God"),
was exclaimed on all sides, by the swarthy throng of
brigands who pressed round us, really glad to welcome
us back again ; and I could not help thinking of the
difference in their manner now and fourteen months
ago, when they had attempted to drive us back from
Gondokoro. On entering the viUage I found a hut prepared for
me by the orders of my vakeel : it was very small, and
I immediately ordered a fence and courtyard to be
constructed. There were great numbers of natives, *
and a crowd of noisy feUows pressed around us that
were only dispersed by a Hberal allowance of the stick,
weU laid, on by the Turks, who were not quite so mild

in their ways as my people. A fat ox was immediately
slaughtered by the vakeel commanding the Turks'
party, and a great feast was soon in preparation, as our
people were determined to fraternize.
Hardly were Ave seated in our hut, when my vakeel
announced that Kamrasi had arrived to pay me a visit.:
In a few minutes he was ushered into the hut. Far
from being abashed, he entered with a loud laugh
totaUy different to his former dignified manner. "WeU,

amused with our wretched appearance, he continued,
"So you have been to the M'wootan N'zige ! weU, you
don't look much the better for it ; why, I should not
have known you ! ha, ha, ha- ! " I was not in a humour
to enjoy his attempts at facetiousness ; I therefore told
him, that he had behaved disgracefuUy and meanly,
and that I should publish his character among the ad
joining tribes as below that of the most petty chief
that I had ever seen. " Never mind," he repUed, " it's
all over now ; you really are thin, both of you ; — it
was your own fault, why did you not agree to fight
Fowooka? You should have been supplied with fat
cows and milk and butter, had you behaved well.
I will have my men ready to attack Fowooka to
morrow ; — the Turks have ten men; you have thirteen;
—thirteen and ten make twenty-three ; — you shaU be

earned if you can't walk, and we will give Fowooka no
chance— he must be killed— only kdl him, and my
brother wdl give you half of his kingdom." He con
tinued, " You shall have supplies to-morrow ; I will
go to my brotlier, who is the great M'Kamma Kamrasi,
and he wiU send you aU you require. I am a little
man, he is a big one ; I have nothing ; he has every
thing, and he longs to see you ; you must go to him
directly, he Hves close by." I hardly knew whether
he was drunk or sober— "my brother the great,
M'Kamma Kamrasi!" I felt bewildered with astonish
ment; then, "If you are not Kamrasi, pray who are
you?" I asked. " Who ami?" he repUed, " ha, ha, ha 1
that's very good ; who am I ? — why, I am M'Gambi, the
brother of Kamrasi, — I am the younger brother, but
he is the King."
The deceit of this country was incredible — I had.
positively never seen the real Kamrasi up to this
moment, and this man M'Gambi now confessed to
having impersonated the king his brother, as Kamrasi
was afraid that I might be in league with Debono's
people to murder him, and therefore he had ordered
his brother M'Gambi to act the king.
I now remembered, that the woman Bacheeta had
on several occasions during the journey told us that
the Kamrasi we had seen was not the true M'Kamma

Kamrasi, but at the time I had paid little attention to
her, as she was constantly grumbling, and I imagined
that this was merely said in iU temper, referring to her
murdered master Sali as the rightful king.
I caUed the vakeel of the Turks, Eddrees : he said,
that he also had heard long since that M'Gambi was
not Kamrasi as we had all supposed, but that he had
never seen the great king, as M'Gambi had always
acted as viceroy ; he confirmed the accounts I had
just received, that the real Kamrasi was not far from
this vdlage, the name of which was " Kisoona." I told.
M'Gambi that I did not wish to see his brother the
king, as I should psrhaps be again deceived and be
introduced to some impostor like himself ; and that as
I did not choose to be made, a fool of, I should decline
the introduction. This distressed him exceedingly ;
he said, that the "king was really so great a man that
he, his own brother, dared not sit on a stool in his
presence, and that he had only kept in retirement as a
matter of precaution, as Debono's people had allied,
themselves with his enemy Rionga in the preceding year
and he dreaded treachery." I laughed contemptuously
at M'Gambi, teUing him that if a woman like my wife,
dared to trust herself far from her own country among
such savages as Kamrasi's . people, their king must be
weaker than a woman if he dare not show himself in

his own territory. I concluded by saying, that I should
not go to see Kamrasi, but that he should come to visit
me. M'Gambi promised to send a good cow on the
foUowing morning, as we had not tasted milk for some
months, and we were in great want of strengthening"
food. He took his leave, having received -a small.
present of minute beads of various colours.
I could not help wondering at the curious combi
nation of pride and abjeGt cowardice that had been.
displayed by the redoubted Kamrasi ever since our
first entrance to his territory. Speke when at Gon-.
dokoro had told me how he had been kept waiting for
fifteen days before the king had condescended to see
him. I now understood that this delay had been oc
casioned more by fear than pride, and that, in his
cowardice, the king feU back upon his dignity as an
excuse for absenting himself.
With the addition of the Turks' party we were
now twenty-four armed men. Although they had not.
seen the real king Kamrasi, they had been well treated
since Ibrahim's departure, having received each a.
present of a young slave girl as a wife, while, as
a distinguishing mark of royal favour, the vakeel
Eddrees had received two wives instead of one; they
had also received regular supplies of flom and beef
— the latter in the shape of a fat ox presented every

seventh day, together with a Hberal supply of plantain
cider. On the following morning after my arrival atKisoonaj
M'Gambi appeared, beseeching me to go and visit the-
king. I replied that "I was hungry and weak from-
want of food, and that I wanted to see meat, and
not the man who had starved me." In the afternoon
a beautiful cow appeared with. her young calf, also a
fat sheep, and two pots of plantain cider, as a present
from Kamrasi. That evening we revelled in milk, a
luxury that we had not tasted for some months. The
cow gave such a quantity that we looked forward to
the establishment of a dairy, and already contemplated
cheese-making. I sent the king a present of a pound
of powder in canister, a box of caps, and a variety of
trifles, explaining that I was quite out of stores and
presents, as I had been kept so long in his country that
I was reduced to beggary, as I had expected to have
returned to my own country long before this.
In the evening, M'Gambi appeared with a message
from the king, saying that. I was his greatest friend,
and.that he would not think of taking anything from
me, as he was sure that I must be hard up ; that he
desired nothing, but would be much obliged if I would
give him the " little double rifle that I always carried,
and my watch, and compass ! " He wanted " nothing"

only my Fletcher rifle, that I would as soon have
parted with as the bone of my arm : and these three
articles were the same for which I had been so perti
naciously bored before my departure from M'rooli. It
was of no use to be wroth ; I, therefore, quietly replied
that " I should not give them, as Kamrasi had failed
in his promise to forward me to Shooa; but that
I required no presents from him, as he always
expected a thousandfold in return." M'Gambi said
that all would be right if I would only agree to pay
the king a visit. I objected to this, as I told him the
king, his brother, did not want to see me, but only to
observe what I had, in order to beg for all that he saw.
He appeared much hurt, and assured me that he would
be himself responsible that nothing of the kind should
happen, and that he merely begged as a favour that
I would visit the king on the foUowing morning,
and that people should be ready to carry me if I
were unable to walk. Accordingly I arranged to be
carried to Kamrasi's camp at about 8 a.m.
At the hour appointed M'Gambi appeared, with a
great crowd of natives. My clothes were in rags, —
and as personal, appearance has a certain effect, even in
Central Africa, I determined to present myself to the
king in as favourable a light as possible. I happened
to possess a full-dress Highland suit that I had worn

174 CARRIED TO THE CAMP OF KAMRASI. [chap. iv.
when I lived in Perthshire many years ago; this I
had treasured as serviceable upon an occasiori like the
present; — accordingly I was quickly attired in kdt,
sporran, and Glengarry bonnet, and to the utter amaze
ment of the crowd, the ragged-looking object that had
arrived in Kisoona now issued from the obscure hut,
with plaid and kilt of Athole tartan. A general shout
of exclamation arose from the assembled crowd; and
taking my seat upon an angarep, I was immediately
shouldered by a number of men, and attended by ten
of my people as escort, I was carried towards the camp
of the great Kamrasi.
In about half- an hour we arrived. The camp com
posed of grass huts extended over a large extent of
ground, and the approach was perfectly black with the
throng that crowded to meet me. Women, children,
clogs, and men all thronged at the entrance of the
street that led to Kamrasi's residence. Pushing our
way through this inquisitive multitude, we continued
through the camp until at length we reached the
dwelling of the king. Halting for the moment, a
message was immediately received that we should
proceed ; we accordingly entered through a narrow
passage between high reed fences, and I found myself
in the presence of the actual king of Unyoro, Kamrasi.
He was sitting in a kind of porch in front of a hut,

and upon seeing me he hardly condescended to look
at me for more than a moment ; he then turned to his
attendants and made some remark that appeared to
amuse them, as they all grinned as little men are wont
to do when a great man makes a bad joke.
I had ordered one of my men to carry my stool ;
I was determined not to sit upon the earth, as the king
would glory in my humdiation. M'Gambi, his brother,
who had formerly played the part of king, now sat
upon the ground a few feet from Kamrasi, who was
seated upon the same stool of copper that M'Gambi
had used when I first saw him at M'rooli. Several of
his chiefs also sat upon the straw with which the porch
was littered. I made a " salaam.," and took my seat
upon my stool. Not a word passed between us for
about five minutes, during which time the king eyed
me most attentively, and made various remarks to the
chiefs who were preserit ; at length he asked me why
I had not been to see him before ? I replied, " Because
I had been starved in his country, and I was too weak
to walk." He said — I should soon be strong, as he
would now give me a good supply of food, but that he
could not send provisions to Shooa Moru, as Fowooka
held that country. Without replying to this wretched
excuse for his neglect, I merely told him that I was
happy to have seen him before my departure, as I was

-not" aware until recently that I had been duped by
M'Gambi. He answered me very coolly, sayirig that
although I had not seen him he had nevertheless seen
me, as he was among the crowd of native escort on the
day that we left M'rooli. Thus he had watched our
start at the very place where his brother M'Gambi had
impersonated the king.
Kamrasi was a remarkably fine man, tall and weU
proportioned, with a handsome face Of a dark brown
colour, but a peculiarly sinister expression ; he was
beautifuUy clean, and instead of wearing the bark
cloth common among the people, he was dressed in a
fine mantle of black and white goat skins, as soft as
* chamois leather. His people sat on the ground at
some distance from his throne ; when they approached
to address him on any subject they crawled upon their
hands and knees to his feet, and touched the ground
with their foreheads.
True to his natural instincts, the king commenced
begging, and being much struck with the Highland
costume, he demanded it as a proof of friendship, saying,
that if I refused I could not be his friend. The watch,
compass, and double Fletcher rifle were asked for in
their turn, all of which I refused to give him. He
appeared much , annoyed, therefore I presented him
with a pound canister of powder, a box of caps, and a

fewbuUets. He repUed, " What's the use of the ammu
nition if you won't give me your rifle ? " I explained
that I had already given him a gun, and that he had
a rifle of Speke's. Disgusted with his importunity I
rose to depart, telling him, that " I should not return
to visit him, as I did not beHeve he was the real Kam
rasi. I had heard that Kamrasi was a great king, but
that he was a mere beggar, and was doubtless an im
postor, Hke M'Gambi." At this he seemed highly
amused, and begged me not to leave so suddenly, as he
could not permit me to depart empty handed. He then
gave certain orders to his people, and after a Httle
delay, two loads of flour arrived, together with a goat
and two jars of sour plantain cider. These presents
he ordered to be forwarded to Kisoona. I rose to take-
leave, but the crowd, eager to see what was going
forward, pressed closely upon the entrance of the-
approach ; seeing which, the king gave certain orders,
and immediately four or five men with long heavy
bludgeons rushed at the mob and belaboured them
right and left, putting the mass to flight pile-mele
through the narrow lanes of the camp.
I was then carried back to my camp at Kisoona,
where I was received by a great crowd of people.

CHAPTER V.

AT HOME IN KISOONA.

It appeared that Kisoona was to be head-quarters
until I should have an opportunity of quitting the
country for Shooa. Therefore I constructed a com
fortable little hut surrounded by a court-yard strongly
fenced, in which I arranged a Rakooba, or open
shed, in which to sit during the hottest hours of the
day. My cow that I had received from Kamrasi gave
plenty of mdk, and every second day we were enabled
to make a smaU cheese about the size of a six-pound
cannon-shot.| jThe abundance of mdk made a rapid
change in our appearance ; and Kisoona, although a
place of complete " ennui,'' was a delightful change
after the privations of the last four months. Every
week the king sent me an ox and a quantity of flour
for myself and people, and the whole party grew fat. "

chap, v.] , SYSTEM OF FATTENING. \JQ
We used the milk native fashion, never drinking it
untd curdled ; — taken in this form it will agree with
the most deUcate stomach, but if used fresh in large
quantities it induces biliousness. The young girls of
thirteen and fourteen that are the wives of the king
are not appreciated unless extremely fat — they are
subjected to a regular system of fattening in order to
increase thefr charms ; thus at an early age they are
compeUed to drink dady about a gallon of curded mdk,
the swaUowing of which is frequently enforced by the
whip ; the result is extreme obesity. In hot climates
milk wiU curdle in two or three hours if placed in a
vessel that has previously contained sour mdk. When
curdled, it should be weU beaten together until, it as
sumes the appearance of cream ; in this state, if seasoned
with a little salt, it is most nourishing and easy of di
gestion. The Arabs invariably use it in this manner
and improve it by the addition of red pepper. The
natives of Unyoro wdl not eat red pepper, as they believe
that men and women become barren by its use.
Although the fever had so completely taken pos
session of me that I was subject to an attack almost
daily, the mdk fattened me extremely, and kept up
my strength, which otherwise must have failed.- The
change from starvation to good food produced a mar

were in a land of plantains, the ripe fruit was in the
greatest scarcity. The natives invariably eat them
unripe, the green fruit when boded being a fair sub
stitute for potatoes — the ripe plantains were used for
brewing plantain cider, but they were never eaten.
The method of cider-making was simple. The fruit
" was buried in a deep hole and covered with straw
and earth ; — at the expiration of about eight days the
green plantains thus interred had become ripe ; — they
were then peeled and pulped within a large wooden
trough resembling a canoe ; this was filled with water,
and the pulp being well mashed and stirred, it was left
to ferment for two days, after which time it was fit to
drink. Throughout the country of Unyoro, plantains in
various forms were the staple article of food upon
which the inhabitants placed more dependance than
upon aU other crops. The green plantains were not
only used as potatoes, but when peeled they were cut
in thin slices and dried in the sun untd crisp ; in this
state they were stored in the granaries, and when
required for use they were boiled into a pulp and
made into a most palatable soup or stew. Flour of
plantains was remarkably good; this was made by-
grinding the fruit when dried as described; it was'

most beautifully packed in long narrow parcels, either
formed of plantain bark or of the white interior of
rushes worked into mats. This bark served as brown
paper, but had the advantage of being waterproof.
The fibre of the plantain formed both thread and cord,
thus the principal requirements of the natives were
suppHed by this most useful tree. The natives were
exceedingly clever in working braid from the plantain
fibre, which was of so fine a texture that it had the
appearance of a hair chain, nor could the difference be
detected without a close examination. Small bags
netted with the same twine were most delicate, and in
all that was produced in Unyoro there was a remark
ably good taste displayed in the manufacture.
The beads most valued were the white opal, the red
porcelain, and the minute varieties generally used for
working on screens in England ; these smaU beads* of
various colours were much esteemed, and were worked
into pretty ornaments, about the shape of a walnut, to
be worn suspended from the neck. I had a smaU
quantity of the latter variety that I presented to Kam
rasi, who prized them as we should value precious
stones. Not only were the natives clever generally in their
ideas, but they were exceedingly cunning in their bar-
* These were given to me'by Speke at Gondokoro.

182 KNAVERY OF NATIVE' BUTTER DEALERS, [chap. v.
gains. Eveiy morning shortly after sunrise, men might
be heard crying their wares throughout the camp —
such as, " Tobacco, tobacco ; two packets going for
either beads or simbis !" (cowrie sheUs). " Milk to sell
for beads or salt!" "Salt to exchange for lance heads!"
" Coffee, coffee, going cheap for red beads !" "Butter
for five jenettos (red beads) a lump !"
The butter was invariably packed in a plantain leaf,
but frequently the package was plastered with cow-
dung and clay, which, when dry, formed a hard coat
ing, and protected it from the air ; this gave it a bad
flavour, and we returned it to the dealer as useless.
A short time after, he returned with fresh butter in a
perfectly new green leaf, and we were requested to
taste it. Being about the size and shape of a cocoa-
nut, arid wrapped carefuUy in a leaf with only the
point exposed, I of course tasted from that portion,
and approving the flavour, the purchase was completed.
We were fairly cheated, as the butter dealer had packed
the old rejected butter in a fresh leaf, and had placed
•a smaU piece of sweet butter on the top as a tasting
point. They constantly attempted this trick.
As retailers they took extraordinary pains to divide
everything into minimum packets, which they sold for
a few beads, always declaring that they had only one
packet to dispose of, but immediately producing another

when that was sold. This method of dealing was
exceedingly troublesome, as it was difficult to obtain
supphes in any quantity. My only resource was to
send Saat to market daily to purchase aU he could find,
and he usually returned after some hours' absence with
a basket containing coffee, tobacco, and butter.
We were comfortably settled at Kisoona, and the
luxury of coffee after so long an abstinence was a
perfect blessing. Nevertheless, in spite of good food,
I was a martyr to fever, which attacked me dady at
about 2 p.m. and continued untd sunset. Being with
out quinine I tried vapour baths, and by the recom
mendation of one of the Turks I pounded and boiled a
quantity of the leaves of the castor-od plant in a large
pot containing about four gaUons : this plant was in
great abundance. Every morning I arranged a bath
by sitting in a blanket, thus forming a kind of tent
with the pot of boding water beneath my stool. Half
an hour passed in this intense heat produced a most
profuse perspiration, and from the commencement of
the vapour system the attacks of fever moderated both
in violence and frequency. In about a fortnight, the
complaint had so much abated that my spirits rose in
equal proportion, and, although weak, I had no mortal
fear of my old enemy.
The king, Kamrasi, had supplied me with provisions,

184 STATE VISIT FROM THE KING. [chap. v.
but I was troubled dady by messengers who requested
me to appear before him to make arrangements for the
proposed attack upon Rionga and Fowooka. My excuse
for non-attendance was my weak state ; but Kamrasi
determined not to be evaded, and one day his headman
Quonga announced that the king would pay me a visit
on the foUowing morning. Although I had but little
remaining from my stock of baggage except the guns,
ammunition, and astronomical instruments, I was
-obliged to hide everything underneath the beds, lest
the avaricious eyes of Kamrasi should detect a rt want."
True to his appointment he appeared with numerous
attendants, and was ushered into my Httle hut. I had
a very rude but serviceable arm-chair that one of my
men had constructed ; in this the king was invited to
,sit. Hardly was he seated, when he leant back, stretched
out his legs, and making some remark to his attend
ants concerning his personal comfort, he asked for the
chair as a present. I promised to have one made for
him immediately. This being arranged, he surveyed
the barren Httle hut, vainly endeavouring to fix his
eyes upon something that he could demand; but so
fruitless was his search, that he laughingly turned to
his people and said, " How was it that they wanted so
many porters, if they have nothing to carry ?" My
interpreter explained, that many things had been

spoded during the storms on the lake, and had been
left behind ; that our provisions had long since been
consumed, and that our clothes were worn out — thus
we had nothing left but a few beads. " New varieties,
no doubt," he repUed ; " give me all that you have of
the smaU blue and the large red !" We had carefully
hidden the main stock, and a few had been arranged
in bags to be produced as the occasion might require ;
these were now unpacked by the boy Saat and laid
before the king. I told him to make his choice, which
he did precisely as I had anticipated, by making pre
sents to his surrounding friends out of my stock, and
monopolizing the remainder for his share : the division
of the portions among his people was a modest way of
taking the whole, as he would immediately demand
their return upon quitting my hut. No sooner were
the beads secured than he repeated the original demand
for my watch and the No. 24 double rifle ; these I
resolutely refused. He then requested permission to
see the contents of a few of the baskets and bags that
formed our worn-out luggage. There was nothing that
took his fancy except needles, thread, lancets, medi
cines, and a small tooth-comb ; the latter interested
him exceedingly, as I explained that the object of the
Turks in coUecting ivory was to seU it to Europeans
who manufactured it into many articles, among which

186 THE KING IN LOVE WITH A TOOTH-COMB. [chap. v.
were smaU tooth-combs such as he then examined. He
could not understand how the teeth could be so finely
cut. Upon the use of the comb being explained, he
immediately attempted to practise upon his wooUy
head ; failing in the operation, he adapted the instru
ment to a different purpose, and commenced scratch
ing beneath the wool most vigorously : the effect being
satisfactory, he at once demanded the comb, which was
handed to each of the surrounding chiefs, all of whom
had a trial of its properties, and, every head having
been scratched, it was returned to the king, who handed
it to- Quonga, the headman that received his presents.
So complete was the success of the comb that he pro
posed to send me one of the largest elephant's tusks,
which I was to take to England and cut into as many
smaU tooth-combs as it would produce for himself and
his chiefs.
The lancets were next admired, and were declared to
be admirably adapted for paring his nads — they were
therefore presented to him.. Then came the investiga
tion of the medicine chest, and every bottle was apphed
to his nose, and a small quantity of the contents was
requested. On the properties of tartar-emetic being
explained, he proposed to swaUow a dose immediately,
as he had been suffering from headache, but as he was
some distance from home I advised him to postpone

the dose untd his return; I accordingly made up
about a dozen powders, one of which (three grains) he
was to take that evening.
The concave mirror, our last looking-glass, was then
discovered ; the distortion of face it produced was a
great amusement, and after it had been repeatedly
handed round, it was added to his presents. More
gunpowder was demanded, and a pound canister and
a box of caps were presented to him, but I positively
refused the desired buUets.
To change the conversation, I inquired whether he
or any of his people knew from whence their race
originated, as their language and appearance was totaUy
different to the tribes that I had visited from the north.
He told me that he knew his grandfather, whose name
was Cherrybambi, but that he knew nothing of the
history of the country, except that it had formerly been
a very extensive kingdom, and that Uganda and
Utumbi had been comprised in the country of Kitwara
with Unyoro and Chopi. The kingdom of Kitwara
extended from the frontier of Karagwe to the Victoria
Nde at Magungo, and Karuma, bounded on aU sides
but the south by that river and the Victoria and the
Albert Lakes ; the latter lake forming the western
frontier. During the reign of Cherrybambi, the province
of Utumbi revolted, and not orily became independent,

.'tese, the king of Uganda, is one of his greatest
temies. It was in vain that I attempted to trace his
iscerit from the GaUas ; both upon this and other
scasions he and his people denied aU knowledge of
Leir ancient history.
He informed me that Chopi had also revolted after
e death of Cherrybambi, and that he had reconquered
only ten or twelve years ago, but that even now the
tives were not to be trusted, as many had leagued

who had been represented to Speke as his brother, and
he concluded by requesting me to assist him in an
attack upon the river islands, promising that if I should
kiU Fowooka and Rionga he would give me a large
portion of his territory.
He suggested that I should stand upon a high cliff
that commanded Fowooka's island; from that point
I could pick off not only the chief, but aU his people,
by firing steadily with the Httle double 24 rifle; he
continued even farther, that if I were too ill to go
myself, I should lend him my Httle Fletcher 24 rifle,
give him my men to assist his army, and he would -
pick off Rionga himself from the cHff above the river :
this was his mild way of securing the rifle which he
had coveted ever since my arrival in his country. I
told him plainly that I could not mix myself up with
his quarrels ; that I traveUed with only one object, of
doing good, and that I would harm no one unless in
self-defence, therefore I could not be the aggressor ;
but that should Fowooka and Rionga attack his position
I should be most happy to lend my aid to repel them.
Far from appreciating my ideas of fair play, he im
mediately rose from his chair, and without taking
leave he walked out of the hut attended by his'
people. The next morning I heard that he had considered-

From that day I received no supphes for myself or
>ople, as the king was affronted. A week passed
ray, and I was obhged to purchase meat and flour
Dm Eddrees, the Heutenant who commanded the
xrks' party of nine men. I gave this man a double-
irrelled gun, and he behaved well.
One day I was lying upon my bed with a fit of
pie, when it was reported that four men had arrived
om M'tese, the king of Uganda, who wished to
e me.
Unfortunately my vakeel delayed the men for so
ng" that they departed, promising to return again,,

The weeks passed slowly at Kisoona, as there was a
Hous monotony in the lack of. incident ;— every day
is a, repetition ofthe preceding. My time was passed
keeping a regular journal ; mapping ; and in writing
ters to friends in Englarid, although there was no
umunication, This task afforded the greatest pleasure, .
I could thus converse in imagination with those far
ay. The thought frequently occurred to me that
jy might no longer exist, and that the separation,, of

years might be the parting for ever ; nevertheless there
was a melancholy satisfaction at thus blankly corre
sponding with those whom I had loved in former years.
Thus the time slowly ebbed away ; the maps were
perfected ; information that I had received was con
firmed by the repeated examination of natives, and a
few Httle black children who were aUowed to run
about our court-yard like so many puppies, afforded a
study of the African savage in embryo. This mo
notony was shortly disturbed.
At about 9 p.m. one night we were suddenly dis
turbed by a tremendous din — hundreds of nogaras
were beating, horns blowing, and natives screaming
in all directions. I immediately jumped out of bed,
and buckling" on my belt I took my rifle and left the
hut. The viUage was aHve with people all dressed for
war, and bearded with cows' tads, dancing and rushing
about with shields and spears, attacking imaginary
enemies. Bacheeta informed me that Fowooka's people
had crossed the Nde and were within three hours'
march of Kisoona, accompanied by a hundred and
fifty of Debono's trading party, the same that had
formerly attacked Kamrasi in the preceding year in
company with Rionga's people. It was reported, that
having crossed the Nde they were marching direct on
Kisoona with the intention of attacking the country

and of kiUing Kamrasi. M'Gambi, the brother of
Kamrasi, whose hut was only twenty yards distant,
immediately came to me with the news : he was in a
great state of alarm, and was determined to run off
to the king immediately to recommend his flight.
After some time I succeeded in convincing him that
this was unnecessary, and that I might be of great,
service in this dilemma if Kamrasi would come per
sonally to me early on the following morning.
The sun had just risen> when the king unceremo
niously marched into my hut ; — he was no longer the
dignified monarch of Kitwara clothed in a beautiful'
mantle of fine skins, 'but he wore nothing but a short
kdt of blue baize that Speke had given him, and a
scarf thrown across his shoulders. He was dreadfuUy
alarmed, and could hardly be persuaded to leave ,his
weapons outside the door, according to the custom of
the country — these were three lances and a double-
barrelled rifle that had been given him by Speke. I
was much amused at his trepidation, and observing
the curious change in his costume, I complimented
him upon the practical cut of his dress, that was better
adapted for fighting than the long and cumbrous
mantle. " Fighting ! " he exclaimed, with the horror of
" Bob Acres," " I am not going to fight ! I have
dressed lightly to be able to run quickly. I mean to

Tun away ! Who can fight against guns ? Those people
have one hundred and fifty guns ; you must run with
me ; we can do nothing against them ; you have only
thirteen men ; Eddrees has only ten; what can twenty-
three do against a hundred and fifty f Pack up your
things and run; we must be off into the high grass and
hide, at once ; the enemy is expected every moment!"
I never saw a man in such a deplorable state of
abject fright", and I could not help laughing aloud at
the miserable coward who represented a kingdom.
Calling my headman, I ordered him to hoist the
English ensign on my tall flag-staff in the courtyard.
In a few moments the old flag was waving in a brisk
breeze and floating over my little hut. There is some
thing that warms the heart in the sight of the Union
Jack when thousands of miles away from the old
country. I now explained to Kamrasi that both he
and his country were under the protection of that flag,
-which was the emblem of England ; and that so long
as he trusted to me, although I had refused to join
him in attacking Fowooka, he should see that I was
his true ally, as I would defend him against aU attacks.
I told him to send a large quantity of supplies into my
cainp, and to procure guides immediately, as I should
send some of my men without delay to the enemy's
camp with a message to the vakeel of Debono's party.

d always been civd and anxious to do his duty both
his master and to me. I summoned' Eddrees, and
dered him to. send four of his men with an equal
imber of mine to the camp of Fowooka, to make a

they were now undeceived, as the first object that
met their view was the English flag on the high flag

where they were introduced to me in person. They
sat in a half-circle around me.
Assuming great authority, I asked them how they
could presume to attack a country under the protection
of the British flag? I informed them that Unyoro be
longed to me by right of discovery, and that I had
given Borahim the exclusive right to the produce of
that country on the condition that he should do nothing
contrary to the will of the reigning king, Kamrasi;
that Thrabim had behaved well ; that I had been guided
to the lake and had returned, and that we were now
actuaUy fed by the king ; and we were suddenly in
vaded by Turkish subjects in connexion with a hostde
tribe who thus insulted the Enghsh flag. I explained
to them that I should not only resist any attack that
might be made upon Kamrasi, but that I should report
the whole affair to the Turkish authorities upon my
return to Khartoum ; and that, should a shot be fired
or a slave be stolen in Kamrasi's country, the leader
of their party, Mahommed Wat-el-Mek, would be
hanged. They repUed that they were not aware that I was
in the country ; that they were aUies of Fowooka,
Rionga, and Owine,the three hostde chiefs ; thatthey
had received both ivory and slaves from them on condi
tion that they should kdl Kamrasi; and that, according

, to the custom of the White Nde trade, they had .agreed
to these conditions. They complained that it was very
hard upon them" to march six , days through an unin
habited wilderness between their station at. Faloro and
..Fowooka's islands and to return empty ihanded In
reply I told them, that they should carry a letter froiri
me to their vakeel Mahommed, in. which I should give
him twelve hours from the. receipt of my order to re
cross the river with his entire party and , their allies
and quit Kamrasi's country.
They , demurred to this alternative; but I shortly
settled their objections, by ordering my vakeel to write
the necessary letter, and desiring them to start before
sunrise on the following; mornings Kamrasi had been
suspicious that I had sent for Mahommed's party
to invade him because he had kept me starving at
Shooa MorjQ. instead of i forwarding me to Shooa as he
had promised. This suspicion placed me in an awkward
position ; I therefore called M'Gambi (his brother) in
presence of the Turks, and explained the whole affair
face to face, desiring Mahommed's people themselves
to explain to him that they would retire from the
country simply because I commanded them to do so,
but that, had' I not been there, they would have
attacked him. This they repeated with "a very bad
grace, boasting, at the completion, that, were it not

for me, they would shoot M'Gambi where he stood at
that moment. The latter, fully aware of their good
intentions, suddenly disappeared  My letter to
Mahommed was deHvered to Suleiman Choush, the
leader of his party, and I ordered a sheep to be kiUed
for their supper. .... At sunrise on the following
morning they aU departed, accompanied by six of my
men, who were to bring a reply to my letter. These
people had two donkeys, and just as they were starting,
a crowd of natives made a rush to gather a heap of
dung that lay beneath the animals ; a great fight and
tussle took place for the possession of this valuable
medicine, in the midst of which the donkey lifted up
his voice and brayed so lustdy that the crowd rushed
away with more eagerness than they had exhibited on
arriving, alarmed at the savage voice of the unknown
animal. It appeared that the dung of the donkey
rubbed upon the skin was supposed to be a cure for
rheumatism, and that this rare specific was brought
from a distant country in the East where such animals
existed.

CHAPTER VI.
KAMRASI BEGS E0R THE BRITISH FLAG.
. ^ Kamrasi, thus freed from his invaders, was almost
stupified with astonishment. He immediately paid me
a visit, and as he entered the court-yard he stopped to
look at the flag that was gady fluttering above him, as
though it were a talisman. He inquired "why the
Turks were awed by an apparent trifle." I explained
that the flag was well known, and might be seen in
every part of the world ; wherever it was hoisted it
was respected, as he had just witnessed, even at so
great a distance from home and unsupported, as in
Unyoro. Seizing the opportunity, he demanded it, saying,
" What shaU I do when you leave my country and
take that with you ? These Turks wiU surely return.
Give me the flag, and they wiU be afraid to attack
me?" I was obUged to explain to him that "the



## p. 199 (#231) ############################################

chap, vi.] THE PERTINACIOUS BEGGAR. 199
respect for the British ensign had not been gained by
running away on the approach of danger as he Had
proposed on the arrival of the enemy, and that its
honour could not be confided to any stranger." True
to his uncontroUable instinct of begging, he replied,
" If you cannot give me the flag, give me at least that
little double-barreUed rifle that you do not require as
you are going home ; then I can defend myself should
the Turks attack me."
I was excessively disgusted; — he had just been
saved by my intervention, and his manner of thanking
me was by begging most pertinaciously for the rifle
that I had refused him on more than twenty occasions.
I requested him never to mention the subject again, as
I would not part with it under any circumstances.
Just at this moment I heard an uproar outside my gate,
and loud screams, attended with heavy blows. A man
was dragged past the entrance of the court-yard bound
hand and foot, and was immediately cudgelled to
death by a crowd of natives. This operation con
tinued for some minutes, untd his bones had been
thoroughly broken up by the repeated blows of clubs.
The body was dragged to a grove of plantains, and
was there left for the vultures, who in a few minutes
congregated around it.
It appeared that the offence thus summarily punished



## p. 200 (#232) ############################################

200 SUMMARY JUSTICE FOR HIGH TREASON, [chap. vi.
was the , simple act of conversirig with "some of the
natives who had attended Mahommed's men from
Fowooka's island to Kisoona : a conversation with one
of the enemy was considered high treason, and was
punished with immediate death; In such cases where
either Kamrasi or his brother M'Gambi determined
upon the. sudden execution of a criminal, the "signal
was given by touching the condemned with the point
of a lance : this sign was the order that was imme
diately obeyed by the guards who were in attendance,
and the culprit was beaten to death upon the spot.
Sometimes the coriderimed was touched by a stick
instead of a lance point ; this was a signal that he
should be kdled by the lance, and the; sentence was
carried out by thrusting hinl through the body with
numerous . spears— thus the instrument used to slay
the criminal was always contrary to the sign.
On the day following this event, drums were beating,
horns blowing, and crowds of natives were singing'
and. dancing in all directioris; pots of plantain cider.
were distributed, arid general festivities proclaimed the,
joy of the people at the news that Mahommed's party.
had retreated across the river, according to then- agree-"
ment with me. My men had returned with a letter,
from Mahommed, stating that he was neither afraid of ,
Ibrahim's people nor of. Kamrasi, but that" as I claimed

the country, he must retire. Not only had he retired
with his thwarted allies, but disgusted at the failure of
his expedition, he had quarrelled with Fowooka, and had
plundered him of all his cattle, together with a number
of slaves; this termination of the affair had so de
lighted Kamrasi that he had ordered general rejoicings:
he kdled a number of oxen, and distributed them among
his people, and intoxicated half the country with pre
sents of maroua, or the plantain cider.
Altogether Mahommed, the vakeel of Debono, had
behaved weU to me in this affair, although rather
shabbdy to his aUies : — he sent me six pieces of soap,
and a few strings of blue beads and jenettos (red glass
beads) as a proof that he parted with no id feeling.
Hardly were the Turks in retreat when Kamrasi
determined to give the finishing stroke to his enemies.
He sent great quantities of ivory to the camp, and one
evening his people laid about twenty tusks at my door,
begging me to count them. I told him to give the
ivory to Ibrahim's men, as I required nothing ; but that
should Ibrahim find a large quantity ready for him on
his return to the country, he would do anything that
he might desire.
A few days later, whole lines of porters arrived,
carrying" enormous elephants' tusks to Eddrees; the
vakeel. Early, the next morning, Kamrasi's eritfre

army arrived laden with provisions, each man carrying
about 40 lbs. of flour in a package upon his head. The
Turks' party of ten men joined them, arid I heard that
an attack was meditated upon Fowooka.-
A few days after the expedition had started, the
Turks and about. 1,000 natives returned. Kamrasi
was overjoyed; they had gained a complete victory,
having entirely routed Fowooka, and not only captured
the islands and massacred the greater number of the
inhabitants, but they had captured all the wives of the
rebel chiefs, together with a number of inferior slaves,
and a herd of goats that had fortunately escaped the
search of Mahommed's retreating party. Fowooka and
Owine had escaped by crossing to the northern shore,
but their power was' irretrievably ruined, their viUages
plundered and burned, and their women and chUdren
captured. A number of old women had been taken in the
general razzia; these could not walk sufficiently fast
to keep up with their victors during the return march,
they had accordingly all been kdled on the road as
being cumbersome : in every case they were kUled by
being beaten on the back of the neck with a club. Such
were the brutaHties indulged in.
On the foUowing morning I went to visit the cap
tives ; the women were sitting in an open" shed, appa-

reutly much dejected. I examined the hands of about
fourteen, all of which were well shaped and beautifully
soft, proving that they were women of high degree
who never worked laboriously: they were for the most
part remarkably good looking, of soft and pleasing
expression, dark brown complexion, fine noses, wooUy
hair, and good figures, precisely simflar to the general
style of women in Chopi and Unyoro.
Among the captives was a woman with a most beau
tiful child, a boy about twelve months old ; aU these
were slaves, and the greater number were in a most
pitiable state, being perfectly unfit for labour, having
been accustomed to luxury as the women of chiefs of
high position. Curiously enough, the woman Bacheeta,
who had accompanied us to visit these unfortunate
captives, now recognised her former mistress, who was
the wife of the murdered SaU ; she had been captured >
with the wives and daughters of Rionga. Bacheeta
immediately feU on her knees and crept towards her
on aU fours, precisely as the subjects of Kamrasi were
accustomed to approach his throne. Sali had held as
high a position as Fowooka, and had been treacherously
kiUed by Kamrasi at M'rooH in the presence of Ba
cheeta. At that time peace had been estabHshed
between Kamrasi and the three great chiefs, who were
invited to a conference at M'rooli with a treacherous

design' on the part ofthe king. Hardly had they
arrived, when Rionga was seized by Kamrasi's : orders,'
and confined in a circular hut with high mudwalls;
and no doorway; the prisoner was hoisted up and
lowered down through an aperture in the roof.' He
was condemned to be burnt alive on the foUowing
morning for some imaginary offence, while ¦ Sali and
Fowooka were to be either pardoned or murdered; as
circumstances might dictate. Sali was a great friend
of Rionga, and determined to rescue him ; accordingly
he plied the guards with; drink, and engaged them in
singing throughout the night on one side of the prison, !
whde his men burrowed like rabbits beneath the wall'
on the opposite side, and rescued Rionga, who escaped.
SaU showed extreme folly in remaining at M'rooli,
and Kamrasi, suspicious of his complicity, immediately
ordered him to be seized and cut to pieces: he was
accordingly tied to a stake, and tortured by having
hisiflhfrbs cut off piecemeal -s- the hands being first

were massacred on the spot, and the woman Bacheeta
was captured by Kamrasi and subsequently sent by
him to the Turks' camp at Faloro, as already described.
From that day unremitting warfare was carried on
between Kamrasi and the island chiefs ; the climax
was their defeat, and the capture of their women,
through the assistance of the Turks.
Kamrasi's deHght at the victory knew no bounds ;
ivory poured into the camp, and a hut was actuaUy
fdled with elephants' tusks of the largest size. Eddrees,
the leader of the Turks' party, knowing that the
victory was gained by the aid of his guns, refused to
give up the captives to the demand of the king,
claiming them as prisoners belonging, to Ibrahim, and
declining any arguments upon the matter untd his
master should arrive in the country. . Kamrasi urged
that, although the guns, had been of great service, no
prisoners could have been captured without the aid of
his canoes that had been brought by land, dragged all
the way from Karuma by hundreds of his people in
readiness for the attack upon the islands.
As usual in aU cases of dispute, I was to be referee.
Kamrasi sent his factotum Cassave" in the night to
my hut to confer with me without the Turks' know
ledge j then came his brother, M'Gambi, and at length,
after being pestered daily by messengers, the great king

206 ADVICE TO KAMRASI. [chap. vi.
arrived in person. He said that Eddrees was exces
sively insolent, and had threatened to shoot him ; that
he had insulted him when on his throne surrounded
by his chiefs, and that, had he not been introduced
into the country by me, he would have killed him and
his men on the spot.
I advised Kamrasi not to talk too big, as he had
lately seen what only ten guns had effected in the fight
with Fowooka, and he might imagine the results that
would occur should he even hint at hostdity, as the
large parties of Ibrahim and the men of Mahommed
Wat-el-Mek would immediately unite and destroy
both him and his country, and place his now beaten
enemy Fowooka upon his throne, should a hair of a
Turk's head be missing. The gaUant Kamrasi turned
almost green at the bare suggestion of this possi
bility. I advised him not to quarrel about straws,
assuring him that, as I had become responsible for the
behaviour of the Turks while in his country, he need
have no fear ; but that, on the other hand, he must be
both just and generous. If he would give them a
supply of ivory, he might always reckon upon them as
valuable allies ; but if he attempted -to quarrel, they
would assuredly destroy his country after my depar
ture. Of course he requested me never to think of
leaving him, but to take up my abode for life in

Kitwara, promising me all that I should require in
addition to a large territory. I replied that the
climate did not agree with me, and that nothing would
induce me to remain, but that, as the boats would not
arrive at Gondokoro for six months (untd February), I
might as weU reside with him as anywhere else. At
the same time, I assured him that his professed friend
ship for me was a delusion, as he only regarded me as
a shield between him and danger. After a long conver
sation, I succeeded in persuading him not to interfere
in matters "regarding prisoners of war, and to look
upon Eddrees only as a vakeel untd Ibrahim should
arrive. He left my hut promising not to mention.
the affair again ; but the next day he sent Cassave" to
Eddrees, demanding two of the prettiest women who
were captives. In reply, Eddrees, who was an extremely
hot-headed feUow, went straight to Kamrasi, and spoke
to him in a most insulting manner, refusing his request.
The king immediately rose from his seat and turned
his back upon the offender. Off rushed Eddrees, boding
with passion, to his camp, summoned his men weU
armed, and marched straight towards the residence
of Kamrasi to demand satisfaction for the affront.

long as I was in the country. In about ten minutes,
both he and his men slunk back ashamed, mutually
accusing each other, as is usual in cases of; failure.
This was an instance of the madness of these Turks
in assuming the offensive, when, in the; event of a fight,
defeat must have been certain. They were positively
without ammunition ! having fired away all their
cartridges except about five rounds for each man in
the attack upon Fowooka. Fortunately, this was
unknown to Kamrasi. • I had a large, supply, as my
men were never perinitted to fire a. shot "without my
special permission.
The party of Turks were now completely in my
. power. I sent for Eddrees, and also for the king : the
latter had already heard from the ¦ natives . of the
approach of the armed Turks, and of my interference.
He refused to appear in person, but sent his brother
M'Gambi, who was,, as usual, the cat's-paw. M'Gambi
was highly offended, arid declared that Kamrasi had
forbidden Eddrees ever to appear again in his presence.
I insisted upon Eddrees apologising, and it was re
solved that all future negotiations should be carried
on through me alone. I suggested that it would be
advisable for aU parties that a message should be sent
without delay to Ibrahim at Shooa, as it was highly
necessary that he should be present, as I should riot

continue responsible for the conduct of the Turks.
When I arrived in Unyoro it was with the intention
of visiting the lake, and returning immediately. I
had been delayed entirely through Kamrasi's orders,
and I could not be held responsible for Eddrees ; — my
agreement had been to guarantee the conduct of the
Turks under Ibrahim, who was the commander of the
party. Eddrees, who, being without ammunition, was
now excessively humble and wished for reinforcements,
offered to send five men to Shooa, provided that
Kamrasi would aUow some natives to accompany
them. This did not suit the ideas of the suspicious
M'Gambi, who suspected that he intended to mis
represent Kamrasi's conduct to prejudice Ibrahim
against him. Accordingly, he declined his offer, but
agreed to give porters and guides, should I wish to
send any of my men with a letter. This suited my
views exactly ; I longed to quit Kamrasi's country, as
Kisoona was a prison of high grass and inaction, and
could I only return to Shooa, I could pass my time
pleasantly in a fine open country and healthy climate,
with the advantage of being five days' march nearer
home than Unyoro. Accordingly, I instructed my
vakeel to write a letter to Ibrahim, caUing him im
mediately to Kisoona, informing him that a large
quantity of ivory was collected, which, should Eddrees

create a disturbance, would be lost. On the following
morning, forir of my men started for Shooa, accompanied
by a number of natives.
Kisoona relapsed into its former monotony — the
war with Fowooka being over, the natives, free from
care, passed their time in singing and drinking ; it was
next to impossible to sleep at night, as crowds of
people all drunk were yelling in chorus, blowing horns
and beating drums from sunset until morning. The
women took no part in this amusement, as it was the
custom in Unyoro for the men to enjoy themselves in
laziness, while the women performed all the. labour
of the fields. Thus they were fatigued, and glad
to rest, while the men passed the night in up
roarious merriment. The usual style of singing was a
rapid chant delivered as a solo, while at intervals the
crowd burstr out in a deafening chorus together with
the drums and horns; the latter were formed of
immense gourds which, growing in a peculiar shape,
with long bottle necks, were easily converted into
musical (?) instruments. Every now and then a cry
of fire in the middle of the night enlivened the ennui
of our existence : the huts were littered deep with
straw, and the inmates, intoxicated, frequently feU
asleep with their huge pipes alight, which, falling in
the dry straw, at once occasioned a conflagration. In



## p. 211 (#243) ############################################

chap, vi.] NATIVE SORCERERS. 21 J
such cases the flames spread from hut to hut with
immense rapidity, and frequently four or five hundred
huts in Kamrasi's large camp were destroyed by fire,
and rebuilt hi a few days. I was anxious concerning
my powder, as, in the event of fire, the blaze of the
straw hut was so instantaneous that nothing could be
saved : should my powder explode I should be entirely
defenceless. Accordingly, after a conflagration in
my neighbom-hood, I insisted upon removing all huts
within a circuit of thirty yards of my dwelling ; the
natives demurring, I at once ordered my men to pull
down the houses, and thereby relieved myself from
drunken and dangerous neighbours.
Although we had been regularly supplied with beef
by the king, we now found it most difficult to procure
fowls ; the war with Fowooka had occasioned the de
struction of nearly all the poultry in the neighbourhood
of Kisoona, as Kamrasi and his kojoors (magicians)
were occupied with daily sacrifices, deducing prognos
tications of coming events from the appearances of the
entrads of the birds slain. The king was surrounded
by sorcerers, both men and women ; these people were
distinguished from others by witch-Hke chaplets of
various dried roots worn upon the head ; some of them
had dried lizards, crocoddes' teeth, lions' claws, minute
tortoise-shells, &c. added to their coUection of charms.

212. IMPLICIT BELIEF IN SORCERERS. [chap. vi.
They could have subscribed to the witches' cauldron

of Macbeth

" Eye of newt and toe of frog,
"Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth, boil and bubble."

On the first appearance of these women, many of
whom were old and haggard, I felt inclined to repeat
Banquo's question : " What are these, so withered and
so wdd in their attire, that look not like the inhabitants
o' the earth, and yet are on't ? Live you ? or are you
aught that man may question ?"
In such witches and wizards Kamrasi and his people
believed implicitly. Bacheeta and also my men told
me that when my wife was expected to die during the
attack of coup de soleil, the guide had procured a
witch, who had kiUed a fowl to question it, " Whether
she would recover and reach the lake ?" The fowl in
its dying struggle protruded its tongue, which sign is
considered affirmative ; after this reply the natives had
no doubt of the result. These people, although far
superior to the tribes on the north of the Nde in general
intelligence, had no idea of a Supreme Being, nor any
object of worship, their faith resting upon a simple

belief in magic like that of the natives of Madi and
Obbo. Some weeks passed without a reply from Shooa to
the letter I had forwarded by my men, neither had
any news been received of their arrival ; we had
relapsed into the usual monotony of existence. This
was happdy broken by a most important event.
On the 6th September, M'Gambi came to my hut in
a great state of excitement, with the inteUigence that
the M'was, the natives of Uganda, had invaded Kamrasi's
country with a large army; that they had already
crossed the Kafoor river and had captured M'rooli, and
that they were marching through the country direct to
Kisoona, with the intention of kdling Kamrasi and of
attacking us, and annexing the country of Unyoro to
M'tes^'s dominions. My force was reduced by four
men that I had sent to Shooa — thus we were a party
of twenty guns, including the Turks, who unfortunately
had no ammunition. There was no doubt about the
truth of the inteUigence ; the natives seemed in great
consternation, as the M'was were far more powerful
than Kamrasi's people, and every invasion from that
country had been attended with the total rout of the
Unyoro forces. I told M'Gambi that messengers must
be sent off at once to Shooa with a letter that I would
write to Ibrahim, summoning him immediately to

214 CONSULTED BY THE KING IN THE EXTREMITY, [chap., vi,
Karuma with a force of 100 men; at the same
time I suggested that we should leave Kisoona and
march with Kariirasi's army direct to Karuma, there
to establish a fortified camp to command the passage
of the river, and to secure a number of canoes to pro
vide a passage for Ibrahim's people whenever they
could effect a junction : — otherwise, the M'was might
destroy the boats and cut off the Turks on their ar
rival at the ferry. Kisoona was an exceedingly dis
advantageous situation, as it was a mere forest of trees
and tangled herbage ten or twelve feet high, in which
the enemy could approach us unperceived, secure from
our guns. M'Gambi quite approved of my advice, and
hurried off to the king, who, as usual in cases of ne
cessity, came to me without delay. He was very excited,
and said that messengers arrived four or five times a
day, .bringing reports of every movement of the enemy,
who were advancing rapidly in three divisions, one by
the route direct from M'rooli to Karuma that I had
foUowed on my arrival at Atada, another direct to
Kisoona; and a third between these two parallels, so as
to cut off his retreat to an island in the Nile, where lie
had formerly taken refuge when his country was in
vaded by the same people. I begged him not to think
of retiring to the island, but to take my advice and
fight it out, in which case I should be happy to assist

him as I was his guest, and I had a perfect right to
repel any aggression. Accordingly I drew a plan of
operations, showing how a camp could be formed on
the cliff above Karuma FaUs, having two sides pro
tected by the river, whde a kraal could be formed in
the vicinity completely commanded by our guns, where
his cattle would remain in perfect security. He listened
with wandering eyes to all mditary arrangements, and
concluded by abandoning aU idea of resistance, but
resolutely adhering to his plan of flight to the island
that had protected him on a former occasion. We
could only agree upon two points, the evacuation of
Kisoona as untenable, and the necessity of despatching
a summons to Ibrahim immediately. The latter de
cision was acted upon that instant, and runners were
despatched with a letter to Shooa. Kamrasi decided
to wait until the next morning for reports from ex
pected messengers on the movements of the enemy,
Otherwise he might run into the very jaws of the danger
he wished to avoid, and he promised to send porters
to carry us and our effects, should it be necessary to
march to Karuma : with this understanding, he de
parted. Bacheeta now assured me that the M'was were
so dreaded by the Unyoro people that nothing would
induce them to fight; therefore I must not depend upon
Kamrasi in any way, but must make "independent

arrangements : she informed me, that the invasion was
caused by accounts given to M'tese by Goobo Goolah,
one of Speke's deserters, who had run away from Kam
rasi shortly after our arrival in the country, and had
reported to M'tese, the king of Uganda, that we were
on our way to pay him a visit with many valuable
presents, but that Kamrasi had prevented us from
proceeding, in order to monopolise the merchandise. .
Enraged at this act of his great enemy Kamrasi, he
had sent spies to corroborate the testimony of Goobo
Goolah (these were the four men who had appeared
some weeks ago), which being confirmed, he had sent
an army to destroy both Kamrasi and his country, and
to capture us and lead us to his capital. This was the
explanation of the affair given by Bacheeta, who, with
a woman's curiosity and tact, picked up information
in the camps almost as correctly as a Times' corre
spondent. This was very enjoyable — the monotony of our
existence had been unbearable, and here was an invi
gorating little difficulty with just sufficient piquancy
to excite our spirits. My men were so thoroughly
drilled and accustomed to complete obedience and
dependence upon my guidance that they had quite
changed their characters., I called Eddrees, gave him
ten rounds of ball cartridge for each of his men, and

chap, vi.] MOCK VALOUR BY UNYOROS. 217
told him to keep with my party should we be obliged
to march ; he immediately called a number of natives
and concealed all his ivory in the jungle.
At about 9 p.m. the camp was in an uproar ; sud
denly drums beat in all quarters, in reply to nogaras
that sounded the alarm in Kamrasi's camp ; horns
bellowed ; men and women yelled ; huts were set on
fire ; and in the blaze of light hundreds of natives all
armed and dressed for war, rushed frantically about, as
xisual upon such occasions, gesticulating and engaging
in mock fight with each other as though full of valour,
and boding over with a desire to meet the enemy.
Bacheeta, who was a sworn enemy to Kamrasi, was
deUghted at his approaching discomfiture. As some of
the most desperate looking warriors, dressed with horns
upon their heads, rushed up to us brandishing then-
spears, she shouted in derision, " Dance away, my boys !
Now's your time when the enemy is far away ; but if
you see a M'wa, as big as the boy Saat, you wUl run
as fast as your legs can carry you."
The M'was were reported to be so close to Kisoona
that their nogaras had been heard from Kamrasi's
position, therefore we were to be ready to march for
Atada before daybreak on the following morning.
There was little sleep that night, as all the luggage had
to be packed in readiness for the early start. Cassave,

218 KAMRASI'S RETREAT. [chap. vi.
who could always be depended upon, arrived at my
hut, and told me that messengers had reported that
the M'was had swept everything before them, having
captured all the women and cattle of the country and
killed a great number of people ; that they had seen
the Hght of burning viUages from Kamrasi's camp, and
that it was doubtful whether the route was open to
Atada. I suggested that men should be sent on in
advance to. report if the path were occupied — this was
immediately done.
Before daybreak on the following morning an im
mense volume of light with dense clouds of smoke in
the direction of Kamrasi's position showed that his
camp had been fired according to custom, and that his
retreat had commenced; — many thousand grass huts
were in flames, and I could not help being annoyed at
the folly of , these natives at thus giving the enemy
notice of their retreat by a signal that could be seen
at many mdes' distance, when success depended upon
rapid and secret movements. Shortly after these signs
of the march, crowds of women, men, cows, goats,, and
luggage appeared, advancing in single file through a
grove of plantains and passing within twenty yards of
us in an endless string. It was pouring with rain, and
women carrying their children were slipping along the
muddy path, while throngs of armed men and. porters

pushed rudely by, until at last the gallant Kamrasi
himself appeared with a great number of women (his
wives), several of whom were carried on Utters, being
too fat to walk. He took no notice of me as he passed
by. M'Gambi was standing by me, and he explained
that we were to close the rear, Kamrasi having con
cluded that it was advisable to have the guns between
' ' him and the enemy. For upwards of an hour the
crowd of thousands of people and cattle filed past ; —
at length the last straggler closed the Hne of march ;
but where were our promised porters ? Not a man was
forthcoming, and we were now the sole occupants of
the deserted vdlage excepting M'Gambi and Cassave\
These men declared that the people were so frightened
that no one would remain to carry us and our effects,
but that they would go to a neighbouring vdlage and
bring porters to convey us to Foweera to-morrow, as
that was the spot where Kamrasi wished us to camp ;
at Foweera there was no high grass, and the country
was perfectly open, so that the rifles could command
an extensive range. The cunning and duplicity of
Kamrasi were extraordinary — he promised, only to
deceive : his object in leaving us here was preme
ditated, as he knew that the M'was, should. they pursue
him, must fight, us before they could follow on his
path ; — we were therefore to be left to defend his rear.



## p. 220 (#252) ############################################

22Q PREPARE FOR RETREAT. [chap, vi:
The order, to camp at Foweera had a similar, motive.
I knew the country, as we had passed it onour march
from Atada to M'rooli ; it was about three miles from
Karuma Falls, and would form a position in Kamrasi's
rear when he should locate himself upon the island.
Foweera was an exceUent military point, as it was
equidistant from the Nile north and east at the angle-
where the river turned to the west from Atada.
I was so annoyed at the deception practised by
Kamrasi that I determined to fraternise with the M'was
should they appear at Kisoona, and I made up my
mind not to fire a shot except in absolute necessity for
so faithless an ally as the king. This I explained to
M'Gambi, and threatened that if porters were not sup
plied I would wait at Kisoona, join the M'was on their
arrival, and with them as allies I would attack the
island which Kamrasi boasted was his stronghold.
This idea frightened M'Gambi, and both he and Cassave
started to procure porters, promising most faithfully
to appear that evening and to start together to Foweera
on the following morning. We were a party of twenty ,
guns, therefore there was no fear in the event of an
attack. I ordered all the huts of the village to be burned
except those belonging to our men; thus we had a clear
space for the guns in case of necessity. *
In the evening, true to his promise, M'Gambi appeared



## p. 221 (#253) ############################################

chap, vi.] LEAVE KISOONA. 221
with a number of natives, but Cassave" had followed
Kamrasi. At sun-rise on the foUowing day we started, my
wife in a litter, and I in a chair. The road was ex
tremely bad, excessively muddy from the rain of. yes
terday, trodden deeply by the hoofs of herds of cattle,
and by the feet of the thousands that had formed
Kamrasi's army and camp followers. There was no
variety in the country, it was the same undulating
land overgrown with impenetrable grass, and wooded
with mimosas ; every swamp being shaded by clumps
of the graceful wdd date. After a march of about
eight mdes we found the route dry and dusty, the rain
on the preceding day having being partial. There was
no water on the road and we were all thirsty, having
calculated on a supply from the heavy rain. Although
many thousand people had travelled on the path so
recently as the previous day, it was nevertheless narrow
and hemmed in by the high grass, as the crowd had
marched in single file and had therefore not widened
the route. This caused great delay to the porters who
carried the Utter, as they marched two deep; thus one
man had to struggle through the high grass. M'Gambi
started off in advance of the party with several natives
at a rapid pace, whde the Turks and some of my men
guarded the ammunition, and I remained in company

222 ARRIVE AT DEANG -NO WATER. [chap, vi,
with the litter and five of my men to bring up the
rear. The progress of the litter was so slow that, after
travelling all day until sunset, we w^ere outmarched,
and just as it was getting dark we arrived at a spot-
where a path branched to the south, while the main
path that we had been following continued E.N.E.
At this point a native was waiting, having been stationed
there by the Turks to direct us to the south ; — he ex
plained that the people had halted at a village close
by. Pushing our way through the narrow path we
shortly arrived at the village of Deang. This con
sisted of a few deserted huts scattered among extensive
groves of plantains. Here we -found Eddrees and the
Turks, with their captives from the attack on Fowooka;
— passing their huts, we took possession of two clean
and new huts in the midst of a well cultivated field of
beans that were about six inches above- the ground, the
cleared field forming an oasis in the midst of the sur
rounding grass jungle. There was no water ; — it was
already dark, and, although we had traveUed through the
heat of the clay no one had drunk since the morning. ,
We were intensely thirsty, and the men searched in
vain among tbe deserted huts in the hope of finding a
supply in the water jars — they were all empty. For
tunately We had a little sour milk in a jar that we
had carried with us, barely sufficient for two persons.



## p. 223 (#255) ############################################

chap, vi.] DESERTED AGAIN BY THE PORTERS. 223
There was nothing to eat except unripe plantains :
these we boiled as a substitute for potatoes. I dis
armed all the porters, placing their lances and shields
under my bedstead in the hut, lest their owners should
abscond during the night. It now appeared that our
party had scattered most disgracefully : those in advance
with the ammunition, who had been ordered not to
quit their charge for an instant, had outmarched the
main body, leaving Eddrees and a few men with the
captive women who could not walk fast, and my small
guard who had attended the litter.
No one ate much that night, as aU were too thirsty.
On the foUowing morning I found to my dismay that
aU of our porters had absconded except two men who
had slept in the same hut with my people ; — we were
for about the hundredth time deserted in this detest
able country. I ordered Eddrees to push on to Foweera,
and to desire my men with the ammunition to wait
there untd I should arrive, and to request Kamrasi to
send porters immediately to assist us. Foweera was
about thirteen mdes from Deang, our present position.
Eddrees and his party started, and I immediately sent
my men with empty jars to search in aU directions for
water ; — they returned in about an hour, having been
unsuccessful. I again ordered them to search in
another direction, and should they find a native, to

force him to be their guide to a drinking place. In
about three hours they returned, accompanied by two
old men, and laden with three large jars of good water;
they had found the old people in a deserted viUage,
and they had guided them to a spring about three
mdes distant. Our chief want being supplied, we had
no fear of starving, as there was abundance of plan
tains, and we had about a dozen cheeses that we had
manufactured while at Kisoona, in addition to a large
supply of flour. A slight touch of fever attacked me,
and I at length fell asleep.
I was awakened by the voices of my men, who were
standing at the door of my hut with most doleful
countenances. They explained that Richarn was miss
ing, and was supposed to have been kUled by the
natives. My vakeel held a broken ramrod in his hand :
this suspicious witness was covered with blood. It
appeared that while I was asleep, Richarn and one of
my men named Mahommed had taken their guns, and
without orders had rambled through the country in
search of a village, with the intention of procuring
porters, if possible, to carry us to Foweera. They had
arrived at a nest of small viUages, and had succeeded
in engaging four men ; these Richarn left in charge
of Mahommed while he proceeded alone to a neigh
bouring vill age. Shortly after his departure Mahommed

heard the report of a gun in that direction about half
a mde distant, and leaving his charge, he ran towards
the spot. On arrival, he found the vdlage deserted,
and on searching the neighbourhood and vainly calling
Richarn, he came upon a large pool of blood opposite
several huts ; lying upon the blood was the broken
ramrod of Richarn's gun. After searching without
success, he had returned with the melancholy report
of this disaster. I was very fond of Richarn ; he had
foUowed me faithfuUy for years, and with fewer faults
than most of his race, he had exhibited many sterling
qualities. I waited for two days in this spot, searching
for him in aU directions. On one occasion my men
saw a number of men and women howling in a vdlage
not far from the place where the accident had hap
pened ; on the approach of my people they fled into
the jungles : thus, there was no doubt that Richarn
must have shot a man before he had been kiUed, as
the natives were mourning for the dead. I was much
distressed at this calamity ; my faithful Richarn was
dead, and the double-barreUed Purdey that he carried
was lost ; this belonged to my friend OsweU, of South
African and Lake Ngami celebrity; it was a much-
prized weapon, with which he had hunted for five years
aU the heavy game of Africa with such untiring zeal
that much of the wood of the stock was eaten away

by the "wait a bit" thorns in his passage on horse
back at full speed through the jungles. He had very
kindly lent me this old companion of his sports, and I
had entrusted it to Richarn as my most careful man ;
both man and gun were now lost.
Having vainly searched for two days, and my men
having seen several village dogs with their mouths and
feet covered with blood, we came to the conclusion
that his body had been dragged into the grass jungle
by the natives, and there, concealed, it had been dis
covered and devoured by the dogs.
No porters had arrived from Kamrasi, neither had
any reply been sent to the message I had forwarded
by Eddrees ;— -the evening arrived, and much dispirited
at the loss of my old servant, I lay down on my
angarep for the night. At about eight o'clock, in the
stillness of our solitude, my men asleep, with the ex
ception of the sentry, we were startled by the sound of
a nogara at no great distance to the south of our huts.
The two natives who had remained with us immediately
woke the men, and declared that the drums we heard
were those of the M'was, who were evidently approach
ing our viUage ;— the natives knew the peculiar sound
of the nogaras of tie enemy, which were different to
those of Kamrasi. This was rather awkward — ouf am
munition was at Foweera, and we had no more than the

each, while 1 carried in my pouch twenty-one. Our
position was untenable, as the drinking place was three
mdes distant. Again the nogara sounded, and the
native guides declared that they could not remain
where we then were, but they would conceal them
selves in the high grass. My wife proposed that we
should forsake our luggage, and march at once for
Foweera and effect a junction with our men and am
munition before daybreak. I was sure that it could
not be less than twelve or thirteen mdes, and in her
weak state it would be impossible for her to accomplish
the distance, through high grass, in darkness, over a
rough path, with the chance of the route being already
occupied by the enemy. However, she was determined
to risk the march. I accordingly prepared to start at
9 p.m., as at that time the moon would be about 30°
above the horizon and would afford us a good light.
I pded all the luggage within the hut ; — packed our
blankets in a canvas bag, to be carried by one of the
natives, and ordered one of our black women'to carry
a jar of water. Thus provided, and forsaking all other
effects, we started at exactly nine o'clock, foUowing our
two natives as guides.
Our course was about E.N.E. The moon was
bright, but the great height of the grass shadowed

the narrow path so that neither ruts nor stones were
visible. The dew was exceedingly heavy, and in
brushing through the rank vegetation we were soon
wet to the skin. This was our first attempt at walking
a distance since many months, and being dreadfully
out of condition, I much feared that one of us might
be attacked by fever before we should have accom
plished the march ; at aU events, there was no alter
native but to push ahead until we should reach Fo
weera, however distant. We walked for about three
hours along a narrow but unmistakeable path, well
trodden by the cattle and people that had accom
panied Kamrasi. Suddenly we arrived at a place
where a path diverged to the right, whde another
led to the left : the former was much trodden by
cattle, and the guides declared this to be the right
direction. Perfectly certain of their mistake, as Fo
weera lay to the east, whde such a course would lead
us due south, I refused to foUow, and ordered the
party to halt while I made a survey of the neigh
bourhood. I shortly discovered in the bright moon-
Hght that the larger path to the south had been caused
by the cattle that had been driven in that direction,
but had again returned by the same route. It was
evident that some viUage lay to the south, at which
Kamrasi and his army had slept, and that they had

returned by the same path to the Foweera main route
on the foUowing morning. I soon discovered cattle
tracks on the smaUer path to the east ; this I deter
mined to foUow. My guides were of little use, and
they confessed that they had only once visited the
Foweera country. We were bound for the principal
viUage that belonged to the chief KaUoe, an excellent
man, who had frequently visited us at Kisoona.
Not far from the branch roads we came suddenly
upon a few huts, the inmates of which were awake.
They gave us the unpleasant inteUigence that the
M'was occupied the country in advance, and that we
should not be able to pass them on our present route,
as they were close to that spot. It was now past
midnight, the country was 'perfectly stUl, and having
no confidence in the guides I led the way.
About a mde from the huts that we had passed I
suddenly observed the Hght of numerous fires, and
a great number of temporary huts formed of green
grass and plantain leaves : this was the camp of the
M'was. I did not observe any people, nor did we
wait long in our present position, but taking, a path
that led to the north, we quietly and stealthdy con
tinued our march through waUs of high grass, until
in about an hour we arrived in a totaUy different
country. There was no longer the dismal grass jungle



## p. 230 (#262) ############################################

230 AT A LOSS FOR DIRECT ROUTE. ' [chap. vi.
in which a man was as much lost as a rabbit in
a field of corn, but beautiful park-Hke glades of rich
and tender grass, like an English meadow, stretched
before us in the pale moonUght, darkened in many
places by the shadows of large isolated trees and
clumps of forest. Continuing along this agreeable
route, we suddenly arrived at a spot where numerous
•well-beaten paths branched into aU directions. This
was extreme confusion. We had left the direct route
to Foweera when we had made the detour to avoid
the M'was' camp. I knew that, as we had then turned
to the north, our course should now be due east. There
was a path leading in that direction ; but just as we
were quietly dehberating upon the most advisable
course, we heard distant voices. Any voice in this
neighbourhood I concluded must be that of an enemy,
therefore I ordered my people. to sit down, while two
men concealed themselves on the borders of a jungle,
about a hundred yards distant, as sentries.
I then sent Bacheeta and one of the guides towards
the spot, from which the sound of voices had pro
ceeded, to Hsten to their language, and to report
whether they were M'was, or people of Foweera. The
spies started cautiously on their errand.
About five minutes passed in utter silence ; the
voices that we had heard had ceased. We were very

chap, vi.] CAPTURE A NATIVE. 231
cold, being wet through with the dew. My wife was
much fatigued, and now rested by sitting on the bag
of blankets. I was afraid of remaining long in inac
tion, lest she should become stiff and be unable to
march. We had been thus waiting for about ten minutes,
when we were suddenly startled by the most fearful
and piercing yeU I ever heard. This proceeded from
the jungle where one of my men was on guard at
about one hundred yards distant. For the moment I
thought that he had been caught by a Hon, and cock
ing my rifle, I ran towards the spot. Before I reached
the jungle I saw one of the sentries running in the
same direction, and two other figures approaching, one
being dragged along by the throat by my man Moosa.
He had a prisoner. It appeared, that whde He was
crouching beneath the bushes at the entrance of the
main path that led through the jungle, he suddenly
observed a man quietly stealing along the forest close
to him. He waited unobserved until the figure had
passed him, when he quickly sprang upon, him from
.behind, seizing his spear with his left hand and grasp
ing his throat with his right. This sudden and unex
pected attack from an unseen enemy had so terrified
the native that he had uttered the extraordinary yell
that had startled our party. He was now trium-

232 RECOVER THE ROUTE. [chap. vi.
phantly led by his captor, but he was so prostrated by
fear that he trembled as though in an ague fit. I
¦endeavoured to reassure him, and Bacheeta shortly
returning with the guide, we discovered the value of
our prize. Far from being an enemy, he was one of
KaUoe's men who had been sent to spy the M'was from
Foweera : thus we had a dependable guide. This httle
incident was as refreshing as a glass of sherry during
the night's march, and we enjoyed a hearty laugh.
Bacheeta had been unsuccessful in finding the origin
of the voices, as they had ceased shortly after she had
left us. It appeared that our captive had also heard
the voices, and he was stealthily endeavouring to
ascertain the cause when he was so roughly seized by
Moosa. We now explained to him our route, and he
at once led the way, reheving the native who had
hitherto carried the bag of blankets. We had made
a considerable circuit by turning from the direct path,
but we now had the advantage of seeing the open
country before us, and marching upon a good and
even path. We walked for about three hours from
this spot at a brisk pace, my wife falling three times
from sheer fatigue, which induced stumbling over
the shghtest inequalities in the road. At length we
descended a vaUey, and crossing a sUght hoUow, we
commenced the ascent of a gentle inclination upon

.chap, vi.] EXHAUSTION OF MRS. BAKER. 233
a beautiful grassy undulation crowned by a clump of
large trees. In the stillness of the night wherever we
had halted we had distinctly heard the distant roar of
the river ; but the sound had so much increased within
the last hour that I felt convinced we must be near
Foweera at the bend of the Victoria Nde. My wife
was so exhausted with the long march, rendered
doubly fatiguing by the dew that had added additional
weight to her clothes, that she could hardly ascend the
hdl we had just commenced. For the last hour our
guide had declared that Foweera was close to us ; but
experienced in natives' descriptions of distance, we
were quite uncertain as to the hour at which we should
arrive. We were nearly at the top of the hid, and
within about two hundred yards of the dense clump of
trees my wife was obUged to confess that she could
go no farther. Just at that moment a cock crowed;
another repUed immediately from the clump of trees
close to us, and the guide, Httle appreciating the bless
ing of his announcement, told us that we had arrived
at KaUoe's viUage, for which we were bound
It was now nearly 5 a.m., and we had marched from
Deang at 9 p.m. There was some caution required in
approaching the viUage, as, should one of the Turks'
sentries be on guard, he would in all probabUity fire at
the first object he might see, without a challenge. I

234 ARRIVE AT FOWEERA. [chap.vi,
therefore ordered my men to shout, whde I gave my
weU-known whistle that would be a signal of our
arrival. For some time we exerted our lungs m
this manner before we received a reply, arid I began
to fear that our people were not at this viUage : at
length a well-known voice replied in Arabic. The
sentries and the whole party were positively asleep,
although close to an enemy's country. They were soon
awake when it was reported that we had arrived, and
upon our entering the vdlage they crowded around us
with the usual welcome. A large fire was lighted in a
spacious hut, and fortunately, the portmanteau having
preceded us together with the ammunition, we were
provided with a change of clothes.
I slept for a couple of hours, and then sent for the
chief of Foweera, Kalloe\ Both he and his son ap-
peared; they said that their spies had reported that
he M'was would attack this vUlage on the foUowing
day ; that they had devastated the entire country and
occupied the whole of Unyoro and Chopi ; that they
had cut off a large herd of cattle belonging to Kamrasi, .
and' he had only just reached the island in time for
security, as the enemy had arrived at the spot and
killed a number of people who were too late to embark.
KaUoe- reported that Kamrasi had fired at the M'was
from the island, but having no bullets his rifle was



## p. 235 (#267) ############################################

ohap. vi.] WELL PREPARED. 235
useless. The M'was had returned the fire, being pro
vided with four guns that they had procured from
Speke's deserters; — they were in the same condition
as Kamrasi, having no buUets ; thus a harmless fusilade
had been carried on by both parties. The M'was had
retired from their position on the bank of the river by
Kamrasi's island, and had proceeded to Atada, which
they had destroyed They were now within three
mdes of us ; nevertheless the foolish KaUo6 expressed
his determination of driving his cattle to Kamrasi's
island for security, about two mdes distant. I endea
voured to persuade him that they would be perfectly
safe if under our protection, but his only reply was to
order his son to drive them off immediately.
That day, KaUoe" and all the natives quitted the vd
lage and fled to an island for security, leaving us masters
of the position. I served out a quantity of ammunition
to the Turks, and we were perfectly prepared. The
drums of the M'was were heard in aU directions both
day and night, but we were perfectly comfortable, as
the granaries were weU fiUed, and innumerable fowls
stored both this and the closely adjoining deserted
villages. On the foUowing day M'Gambi appeared with a
message from Kamrasi, begging us to come and form a
camp on the bank of the river opposite to his island to



## p. 236 (#268) ############################################

236 REFUSE TO ASSIST KAMRASI. [chap. vi.
protect him from the M'was, who would assuredly
return and attack him in canoes. I told him plainly
that I should not interfere to assist him, as he had left
me on the road at Deang; that Richarn had been
kdled by his people, and that one of my guns was still
in their possession, added to which I had been obliged
to forsake all my baggage, owing to the desertion of the
porters ; — for all these errors I should hold Kamrasi
responsible. He replied that he did not think Richarn
was kiUed, but that he had shot the chief of a vdlage
. dead, having got into some quarrel with the natives.
The conversation ended by my adhering to my intention
of remaining independent at Foweera. M'Gambi said
they were very miserable on the island, that no one
could rest day or night for the mosquitoes, and that
they were suffering from famine ; — he had several men
with him who at once set to work to thrash out corn
from the weU-fiUed granaries of the village, and they
departed heavily laden.
During the day a few natives of the district found
their way into the vdlage for a similar purpose. I
had previously heard that the inhabitants of Foweera
were disaffected, and that many were in correspondence
with the enemy. I accordingly instructed Bacheeta to
converse with the people, and to endeavour through
them to get into communication with the M'was,



## p. 237 (#269) ############################################

chap, vi.] RICHARN'S RETURN. 237
assuring them that I should remain neutral unless
attacked, but if their intentions were hostile I was
quite ready to fight. At the same time I instructed
her to explain that I should be sorry to fire at the
servants of M'tes6, as he had behaved weU to my friends
Speke and Grant, but that the best way to avoid a
codision would be for the M'was to keep at a distance
from my camp. Bacheeta told me that this assurance
would be certain to reach the chief of the M'was, as
many of the natives of Chopi were in league with them
against Kamrasi.
In the afternoon of that day I stroUed outside the
viUage with some of my men to accompany the party
to the drinking place from which we procured our
water; — it was about a quarter of a. mde from the
camp, and it was considered dangerous for any one to
venture so far without the protection of an armed
party. We had just returned, and were standing in the
cool of the evening on the lawn opposite the entrance
of the camp, when one of my men came rushing to
wards us shouting, " Richarn ! Richarn's come back ! "
In another moment I saw with extreme deHght the jet
black Richarn whom I had mourned as lost, quietly
marching towards us. The meeting was almost pathetic.
I took him warmly by the hand and gave him a few

238 RICHARN'S STORY. [chap. vi.
words of welcome, but my vakeel, who had never
cared for him before, threw himself upon his neck and
burst out crying Hke a child. How long this sobbing
would have continued I know not, as several of my
Arabs caught the infection and began to be lachrymose,
while Richarn, embraced on aU sides, stood the ordeal
most stoically, looking extremely bewddered, but totally
unconscious of the cause of so much weeping. To
change the current of feeling, I told the boy Saat to
fetch a large gourd-sheU of merissa (native beer), of
which I had received a good supply from KaUoe". This
soon arrived and was by far the most acceptable welcome
to Richarn, who drank like a whale. So large was the
gourd, that even after the mighty draught enough re
mained for the rest of the party to sip. Refreshed by
the much-loved drink, Richarn now told us his story:
When separated from Mahommed at the vdlage he had
found a great number of people, some of whom were
our runaway porters ; on his attempting to persuade
them to return, a quarrel had taken place, and the
chief of the village heading his men had advanced on
Richarn and seized his gun-; — at the same time the
chief called to his men to kiU him. Richarn drew his
knife to release his gun ; seeing which, the chief re
laxed his hold, and stepping a pace back he raised his
lance to strike ; — at the same moment Richarn puUed



## p. 239 (#271) ############################################

chap, vi.] RICHARN'S STORY. 239
the trigger and shot him dead. The natives, panic-
stricken at the sudden effect of the shot* rushed away
and Richarn, profiting by the opportunity, disappeared
in the high grass, and fled. Once in the interminable
sea of grass that was almost impenetrable, he wandered
for two days without water : hearing the distant roar
of the Nde, he at length reached it when nearly
exhausted with thirst and fatigue ; — he then foUowed
up the stream to Karuma, avoided the M'was, — and.
knowing the road thence to M'rooli that we had for
merly travelled, he arrived at Foweera. His ramrod
had been broken in the struggle when the chief seized
his gun, and to his great astonishment I now showed
him the piece that we had picked up on the pool of
blood. He had made an exceUent loading-rod with
his hunting knife by shaping a sapling of hard wood,
and had reloaded his gun ; thus with a good supply
of ammunition he had not much fear of the natives.
Kamrasi had evidently heard the true account of the
affair. Late in the evening we heard from a native that
the whole of Kallo^'s cattle that he had driven from
Foweera had been captured by the enemy on their way
to the river island, and that one of his sons and several
riatives who had driven them were killed ; — this was
the result of his precipitate flight.



## p. 240 (#272) ############################################

240 THE KING IN DISTRESS. [chap. vi.
The M'was foUowed up their advantages with unin
terrupted success, overrunning the entire country even
to the shores of the Albert Lake, and driving off the
cattle, together with all the women that had not taken
refuge upon the numerous islands of the Victoria Nile.
During this time, Kamrasi and his wives, together with
his principal chiefs, resided in the misery of mosquitoes
and malaria on the river ; — great numbers of people
died of disease and starvation. M'Gambi appeared
frequently at our camp in order to procure corn, and
from him we received reports of the distress of the
people ; — his appearance had much changed; he looked
half starved, and complained that he had nothing to
drink but Nde water, as they had neither corn, nor
pots in which they could make merissa, and the M'was
had destroyed aU the plantains, therefore they could
not prepare cider.
Among other losses my two cows were reported by
M'Gambi to have been stolen by the M'was, in company
with the cattle of Kamrasi with which they had been
driven from Kisoona. I did not believe it, as he also
told me that all the luggage that I had left at Deang
had likewise been stolen by the enemy. But I had
heard from Bacheeta that the natives of that neigh
bourhood had carried it (about six loads) direct to.
Kamrasi's island ; thus it was in his possession at the. ,

same time that he declared it to have been stolen by
the M'was. I told him, that I should hold him re
sponsible, and that he should pay me the value of the
lost effects in a certain number of cows. A few days
after this conversation, my cows and the whole of my
luggage were dehvered to me in safety. Kamrasi had
evidently intended to appropriate them, but being
pressed by the M'was and his old enemies on the east
bank of. the Nde (the Langgos), who had made common
cause with the invaders, the time was not favourable
for a quarrel with either me or the Turks.
On the evening of the 19th September, a few days
after this occurrence, inteUigence was brought into
camp that Ibrahim and a hundred men had arrived at
Karuma Falls at the ferry by which we had formerly
crossed the river to Atada. I immediately despatched
ten men to investigate the truth "of the report. In
about two hours they returned in high spirits, having
exchanged greeting with Ibrahim and his party across
the river. Kamrasi had despatched boats to another
ferry above the FaUs to facifitate the passage of the
entire party on the foUowing morning, as he wished
them to attack the M'was immediately.
Not being desirous of such an encounter, the M'was,
who had witnessed the arrival of this powerful rein
forcement, immediately retreated, and by sunrise they

had faUen back about twenty mdes on the road to
M'rooli. On the morning of the 20th Ibrahim arrived, bring
ing with him the post from England; that being
addressed to the consul at Khartoum had been for
warded to Gondokoro by the annual boats, and taken
charge of by Ibrahim on his arrival at that station
last April, with ivory from the interior. My letters.
were of very old dates, none under two years, with the
exception of one from Speke, who had sent me the
Illustrated London News, containing his portrait and
that of Grant ; also Punch, with an illustration of
Punch's discovery of the Nile- sources. For a whole
day I revelled in theJuxury of letters and newspapers.
Ibrahim had very kindly thought of our necessities
when at Gondokoro, . and had brought me a piece of
coarse cotton cloth of Arab manufacture (darmoor) for
clothes for myself, and a piece of cotton print for a
dress for Mrs. Baker, in addition to a large jar of honey,
and some rice and coffee — the latter being the balance
of my old stock that I had been obliged to forsake, for
want of porters at Shooa. He told me that all my
effects that I had left at Obbo , had been returned to-
Gondokoro, and that my two men, whoni I had deft in
charge, had returned with them to Khartoum, on board
the vessel that had been sent, for me from that place,

but which had joined the traders' boats on their return
voyage. Ibrahim had assured the captain that it was
impossible that we could arrive during that year. It
was thus fortunate that we had not pushed on for
Gondokoro after April in expectation of finding the
boat awaiting us. However, "All's weU that ends
well," and Ibrahim was astounded at our success, but
rather shocked at our personal appearance, as we were
thin and haggard, and our clothes had been so fre
quently repaired that they would hardly hold together.
On the 23d September we moved our camp, and took
possession of a viUage within half a mde of the Victoria
Nde. Kamrasi was now very valorous, and returned
from his island to a large viUage on the banks of the
river. He sent. Ibrahim an immense quantity of ivory,
in addition to the store that had been concealed by
Eddrees on our departure from Kisoona ; this was sent
for, and in a few days it was safely deposited in the
general camp. Ibrahim was amazed at the fortune
that awaited him. I congratulated him most heartily
on the success of the two expeditions — the geographi
cal, and the ivory trade; the latter having far more
than fulfilled my promise.
Kamrasi determined to invade the Langgo country
immediately, as they had received Fowooka after his
defeat, and he was now residing with the chief. Ac-

244 INVASION OF THE LANGGO COUNTRY. [chap. vi.
cordingly eighty of Ibrahim's men were despatched
across the river, and in three days they destroyed a
number of villages, and captured about 200 head of
cattle, together with a number of prisoners, including
many women. Great rejoicings took place on their
return ; Ibrahim presented Kamrasi with a hundred
cows, and in return for this generosity the king sent
tHirty immense tusks, and promised a hundred more
within a few days.
Another expedition was demanded, and was quickly
undertaken with similar success; this time Fowooka
narrowly escaped, as a Turk fired at him, but missed
and killed a native who stood by him. On the return
ofthe party, Kamrasi received another present of cattle,
and again the ivory flowed into the camp.
In the meantime, I had made myseh? excessively
comfortable ; we were in a beautiful and highly
cultivated districti in the midst of immense fields of
sweet potatoes. The idea struck me that I could
manufacture spirit from this source, as they were so
excessively sweet as to be disagreeable as a vegetable.
Accordingly I coUected a great number of large jars
that were used by the natives for brewing merissa ; in
these I boded several hundredweight of potatoes to a
pulp. There were jars containing about twenty gaUons ;
these I filled with the pulp mashed with water, to



## p. 245 (#277) ############################################

chap, vi.] THE WHISKY DISTILLERY. 2-15
which I added yeast from a brewing of merissa. While
this mixture was fermenting I constructed my still, by
fixing a jar of about twelve gaUons on a neat furnace •
of clay, and inserting the mouth of a smaller jar upon
the top ; the smaUer jar thus inverted became the dome
of the stiU. In the top of this I bored a hole, in which
I fitted a long reed of about an inch in diameter, which
descended to my condenser ; the latter was the kettle,
sunk by a weight in a large pan of cold water. My
stiU worked beautifully, and produced four or five
bottles of good spirit dady; — this I stored in large
bottle gourds, containing about four gallons each. My
men were excessively fond of attending to the distillery,
especiaUy Richarn, who took a deep interest in the
operation, but who was frequently found dead asleep
on his back ; the fire out ; and the still at a standstdl.
Of course he could not be suspected of having tried the
produce of his manufactory ! I found an extraordinary
change in my health from the time that I commenced
drinking the potato-whisky. Every day I drank hot
toddy. I became strong, and from that time to the
present day my fever left me, occurring only once- or
twice during the first six months, and then quitting me
entirely. Not having tasted either wine or spirits for
nearly two years, the sudden change from total absti
nence to a moderate aUowance of stimulant produced

246 KAMRASI TRIES THE WHISKY. [chap. vi.
a marvellous effect. Ibrahim and some of his men
established stUls, several became intoxicated, which so
delighted M'Gambi, who happened to be present, that
he begged a bottle of spirit from Ibrahim as a sample
for Kamrasi. It appears that the king got drunk so
quickly upon the potent spirit, that he had an especial
desire to repeat the dose— he called it the maroua
(cider) of our country, and pronounced it so far superior
to his own that he determined to establish a factory.
When I explained to him that it was the produce of
sweet potatoes, he expressed his great regret that he
had never sufficiently appreciated their value, and he
expressed a determination to cultivate whole districts.
Ibrahim was requested to leave one of his men who
understood the management of a stiU, to establish and
undertake the direction of "King Kamrasi's Central
African Unyoro Potato-Whisky Company, unlimited."
Ibrahim had brought a variety of presents for Kam
rasi : fifty pounds of beads, a revolver pistol, cotton
cloths, blue' glass tumblers, looking-glasses, &c. These
donations, added to the pleasure afforded by the defeat
of .his enemies, put his majesty into exceUent humour,
and he frequently came to visit us. On one occasion
I gave him the portraits of Speke and Grant : the latter
he recognised immediately; he could not understand
the pictures in Punch, declaring that he {Punch) was

not an Englishman, as he neither resembled me nor
Speke ; but he was exceedingly pleased with the Paris
fashions in the Illustrated London News, which we
cut out with a pair of scissors, and gave him as speci
mens of English ladies in fuU dress.
The war being concluded by the total discomfiture
of his enemies, Kamrasi was determined to destroy aU
those inhabitants of Foweera who had in any way
connived at the attack of the M'was. Daily executions
took place in the summary manner afready described,
the victims being captured, led before the king, and
butchered in his presence without a trial.
Among others suspected as favourable to revolution
was KaUotS, the chief of Foweera ; next to Kamrasi
and M'Gambi he was the principal man in the king
dom ; he was much beloved by the entire population
of Chopi and Foweera, and I had always found him
most inteUigent and friendly. -One night at about eight
o'clock, Ibrahim came to my hut looking very myste
rious, and after assuring himself that no one was
present, he confided to me that he had received orders
from Kamrasi to attack KaUoe's viUage before daybreak
on the foUowing morning, to surround his dweUing,
and to shoot him as he attempted to escape ; Ibrahim
was further instructed to capture the wonien and
chUdren of the viUage as his perquisites. At the very

248 KAMRASI ORDERS THE MURDER OF KALLOE. [chap. vi.
moment that this treacherous compact had been entered
into with Ibrahim, Kamrasi had pretended to be upon
the most friendly terms with KaUo6, who was then in
his camp ; but he did not lay violent hands upon him,
as, many of the natives being in his favour, the conse
quences might have been disagreeable : thus he had
secretly ordered his destruction. I at once desired
Ibrahim at aU hazards to renounce so horrible a design.
Never did I feel so fuU of revolution as at that moment ;
my first impulse was to assist KaUoe to dethrone Kam
rasi, and to usurp the kingdom. Ibrahim had an eye
to business; he knew that should he offend Kamrasi
there would be an end to the ivory trade for the
present. The country was so rich in ivory that it was
a perfect bank upon which he could draw without,
limit, provided that he remained an aUy of the king ;
but no trade could be carried on with the natives, all
business being prohibited by Kamrasi, who himself
-monopolised the profits. In the event of war, not a
tusk would be obtained, as the ivory in possession of
the natives was never stored in their huts, but was
concealed in the earth. The Turks were now mer
cenaries employed by the king to do any bloody work
that he might require. Ibrahim was in a ddemma.
1 offered to take the entire onus upon myself. That
KaUoe" should not be murdered I was determined ; the

old man had on several occasions been very obUging
to me and to my people, and I resolved to save him at
any risk. His son, perfectly unsuspicious of evd, was
at that moment in our camp, having fraternized with
some of my men. I sent for him immediately, and
explained the entire plot, concluding by telling him to
run that instant at fuU speed to his father (about two
mdes distant), and to send away ad the women and
chUdren from the viUage ; but to bring KaUoe' to my
hut, that I would hoist the British flag, as I had
done at Kisoona, and this should protect him from the
bloodthirsty Kamrasi, who would not dare to seize
him. Should he refuse to trust me, he must fly imme
diately, as the Turks would attack the viUage before
daybreak. Away started the astonished son in the
dark night at fuU speed along the weU-known path, to
give the warning.
I now arranged with Ibrahim that to avoid offending
Kamrasi he should make a false attack upon the viUage
at the time appointed ; he would find it deserted, and
there would be an end of the matter should KaUoe
prefer flight to trusting in my protection, which I felt
sure he would. Midnight arrived, and no signs of
KaUoe had appeared ; I went to sleep, satisfied that he
was safe.
Before daybreak eighty men of the Turks' party

started upon- their feigned expedition; in about two
hours they returned, having found the village deserted;
- — the bird had-flown. I was delighted at the success
of this ruse, but I should have been more satisfied had
KaUoe- placed himself in my hands: this I had felt sure
he would decline, as the character of the natives is
generally so false and mistrustful that he would suspect
a snare. At about noon we heard yells ; drums were, beating,
and horns blowing in aU directions. For the moment I
thought that KaUoe had raised the country against
Kamrasi, as I Observed many hundred men dressed
for war, scouring the beautiful open park, like hounds
upon a scent. The Turks beat their drum and called
their men under arms beneath the ensign planted
outside the viUage, — not knowing the intention of the
unusual gathering. It shortly transpired that Kamrasi
had heard of the escape of KaUoe, and, enraged at the
loss of his prey, he had immediately started off about
a thousand men in pursuit:
In the evening I heard that he had been captured.
I sent to Kamrasi directly, to beg him to postpone.
his execution, as I wished to speak with him on
the following morning.
At sunrise I started, and found the king sitting in
his hut, whde Kalloe" was lying under & plantain tree

perfectly resigned, with his leg in the Kamrasi shoe ;
— a block of wood of about four feet long and ten
inches thick (the rough trunk of a tree) ; his left foot
had been thrust through a small hole in the log, while
a peg driven through at right angles just above the
instep effectuaUy secured the prisoner. This was a
favourite punishment of the king ; the prisoner might
thus languish untd released by death; — it was im
possible to sit up, and difficult to lie down, the log
having to be adjusted by an attendant according to
the movement of the body. I told Kamrasi that as I
had saved him from the attack of the Turks at Kisoona
he must grant me a favour, and spare Kalloe"s Hfe :
This request, to my astonishment, he at once granted,*
and added, that he should only keep him in the "shoe"
for a few days untd his people should bring him a
hundred cows as a fine, in which case he should release
him. I had no faith in his promise, as I had before
heard that it was his practice to put the shoe upon any
rich man in order to extract a fine, upon the payment
of which the unfortunate prisoner was on some occasions
kiUed instead of liberated. However, I had done all
in my power; and had KaUoe been a man of deter*-
mination, he could have saved himself by trusting
implicitly to me. As I returned to the camp, I could

252 DEATH OF A HEADMAN. [chap. vi.
not help reflecting on the ingratitude I had experienced
among all the natives ; on many occasions I had exerted
myseh0 to benefit others in whom I had no personal
interest, but in no single instance had I ever received
even a look of gratitude.
Two days after this occurrence I ordered the boy
Saat to go as usual in search of supplies to the neigh
bouring viUages; but as he was starting, Ibrahim advised
him to wait a Httle, as something was wrong, and it
would be dangerous to go alone. A few minutes later,
I heard three shots fired in rapid succession at about
three-quarters of a mde distant. The Turks and my
men immediately thronged outside the vdlage, which
position being on a hdl, we had a panoramic view of
the surrounding country. We shortly perceived a
number of men, including a few of the Turks' party,
approaching from an opposite hdl, carrying something
heavy in their arms. With the telescope I distinguished
a mat on which some object of weight was laboriously
supported, the bearers grasping the corners in then-
hands. "One of our. people is kUled!" murmured
one Turk. "Perhaps it's only a native," said another.
"Who would trouble himself to carry a black feUow
home I " exclaimed a third. The mystery was soon
cleared by the arrival of the party with the dead body
of one of Kamrasi's headmen ;— one ball had struck

him through the chest, another through the right arm,
and the third had passed through the body from side
to side. He had been shot by some Bari slaves who
acted as soldiers belonging to the Turks' party. It ap
peared that the deceased had formerly sent seventy
elephants' tusks to the people of Mahommed Wat-el-
Mek against the orders of Kamrasi, who had prohibited
the export of ivory from his kingdom, as he had agreed
to deal exclusively with Ibrahim. The culprit was
therefore condemned to death, but having some power
ful adherents in his viUage, Kamrasi had thought it
advisable to employ the Turks to shoot him ; — this task
they gladly accepted, as they were minus seventy tusks
through his conduct. Without my knowledge, a small
party had started in open dayHght to his viUage close
to our camp, and on attempting to enter the fence,
several lances were thrown at the Turks ; the deceased
rushed from the hut attempting to escape, and was im
mediately shot dead by three of the Bari soldiers. The
hands were then (as usual in aU these countries) am
putated at the wrists, in order to detach the copper
bracelets ; the body being dragged about two hundred
paces from the viUage, was suspended by the neck to
a branch of the tamarind tree. AU the slave women
(about seventy) and children were then driven down
to the spot by the Turks to view the body as it swung

sight, they were threatened to be served precisely in a
similar manner should they ever attempt to . escape.
Superlatively brutal as this appeared, I could not help
reflecting that our public executions in England con
vey a simdar moral ; the only difference being in the
conduct of the women ; the savages having to be driven
to the sight as witnesses, while European females
throng curiously to such disgusting exhibitions. A few

supreme despot than the king Kamrasi — not only the-
property, but the families of his subjects were at his
disposal; — he boasted . that "all belonged to him."
Thus, when disposed to be liberal, he took from others
and bestowed upon his favourites ; should any sufferer
complain, there were no lawyer's costs, but the " shoe,"

of espionage by which he obtained a knowledge of all
that passed throughout his kingdom; — that being
divided into numerous smaU districts, each governed
by a chief who was responsible for the acts committed
within his jurisdiction, the government was wonderfully
simpHfied. Should a complaint be made against a
governor, he was summoned before the king ; if guUty,
death, or the "shoe!" To be suspected of rebellion,
was to die. A body-guard of about 500 men, who
were aUowed to pdlage the country at discretion,
secured the power of the king, as with this organized
force always at hand he could pounce upon the sus
pected and' extinguish them at once; thus the tyrant
held his sway over a population so timid that they
yielded tamely to his oppression. Having now aUied
himself to the Turks, he had conceived the most am
bitious views of conquering Uganda, and of restoririg
the ancient kingdom, of. Kitwara; but the total absence
of physical courage wdl utterly frustrate such plans
for extension, and Kamrasi the. Cruel wiU never be

CHAPTER VII.
kamrasi's adieu.
It was the middle of November — not the wretched
month that chills even the recoUection of Old England,
but the last of the ten months of rain that causes the
wonderful vegetation of the fertile sod in Equatorial
Africa. The Turks were ready to return to Shooa, and
I longed for the change from this brutal country to the
stiU wdder but less bloody tribe of Madi, to the north.
The quantity of ivory in camp was so large that we
required 700 porters to carry both tusks and provi
sions, &c. for the five days' march through uninhabited
country. Kamrasi came to see us before we parted ;
he had provided the requisite porters. We were to
start on the foUowing day; he arrived with the Blissett
rifle that had been given him by Speke. He told me
that he was sorry we were going ; and he was much

distressed that he had burst his rifle ! — he had ham
mered a large bullet in the endeavour to fit the bore ;
and the lump of lead having stuck in the middle, he
had fired his rifle and split the barrel, which being of
remarkably good metal had simply opened. He told
me that it did not matter so very much after all, as he
had neither powder nor bad — (this was false, as Ibrahim
had just given him a quantity), therefore his rifle would
have been useless if sound ; but, he added, " You are
now going home, where you can obtain all you require,
therefore you wUl want for nothing; give me, before
you leave, the Httle double-barrelled rifle that you
promised me, and a supply of ammunition !" To the
last moment he was determined to persevere in his
demand, and, if possible, to obtain my handy little
Fletcher 24 rifle, that had been demanded and refused
ever since my residence in his country. I was equaUy
persistent in my refusal, teUing him that there were
many dangers on the road, and I could not travel
unarmed. On the foUowing morning our people crossed the
river ; this was a tedious operation, as our party con
sisted of about 700 porters and eighty armed men, as
Ibrahim had arranged to leave thirty men with Kam
rasi to protect him from^the M'was untd he should
return in the foUowing season, when he promised to

bring him a great variety of presents. By 4 p.m. the
whole party had crossed the river with ivory and
baggage. We now brought up the rear, and descended
some fine crags of granite to the water's edge ; ' there
were several large canoes in attendance, one of which
we occupied, and, landing on the opposite shore, we
climbed up the steep ascent and looked back upon
Unyoro, in which we had passed ten months of wretch
edness. It had poured with rain on the preceding
day, and the natives had constructed a rough camp
of grass huts.
On the break of day on the 17th November we
started. It would be tedious to describe the journey,
as, although by a' different route, it was through
the same country that we had traversed on our arrival
from Shooa. After the first day's march we quitted
the forest and entered upon the great prairies. I was
astonished to find after several days' journey a great
difference in the dryness of the climate. In Unyoro
we had left the grass an intense green, the rain having
been frequent-: here it was nearly dry, and in many
places it had been burnt by the native hunting par
ties. From some elevated points in the route I could
distinctly make out the outline of the mountains run
ning from the Albert Lake to the north, on the west
bank of the Nile ; these would hardly have been

observed by a person who was ignorant of their exist
ence, as the grass was so high that I had to ascend a
white ant-hid to look for them ; they were about sixty
mUes distant, and my men, who knew them well,
pointed them out to their companions.
The entire party, including women and chUdren,
amounted to about 1,000 people. Although they had
abundance of flour, there was no meat, and the grass
being high there was no chance of game. On the
fourth day only I saw a herd of about twenty tetel
(hartebeest) in an open space that had been recently
burnt. We were both riding upon oxen that I had
purchased of Ibrahim, and we were about a mde ahead
of the flag in the hope of getting a shot ; dismounting
from my animal I stalked the game down a ravine, but
upon reaching the point that I had resolved upon for
the shot, I found the herd had moved their position to
about 250 paces from me. They were all looking at
me, as they had been disturbed by the oxen and the
boy Saat in the distance. Dinner depended on the
shot. There was a leafless bush singed by the recent
fire ; upon a branch of this I took a rest, but just as I
was going to fire they moved off — a clean miss ! —
whizz went the buUet over them, but so close to the
ears of one that it shook its head as though stung by
a wasp, and capered round and round; the others stood

perfectly stdl, gazing at the oxen in the distance. Crack
went the left-hand barrel of the little Fletcher 24, and
down went a- tetel like a lump of. lead, before the satis
factory sound of the bullet returned from the distance.
Off went the herd, leaving a fine beast kicking on the
ground. It was shot through the spine, and some of
the native porters' having witnessed the sport from a
great distance, threw down their loads and came racing
towards the meat like a pack of wolves scenting blood.
In. a few. minutes the prize was divided, whUe a good
portion was carried by Saat for our own use : the tetel,
weighing about 500 lbs. vanished among the crowd in
a few minutes.
: On the fifth1 day's march from the Victoria Nde we
arrived at Shooa; the change was deUghtful after the
wet and derise vegetation of Unyoro : the country was
dry, and the grass "low and of fine quality. We took
possession of our camp, that had akeady been prepared
for us in a large court-yard well cemented with cow-
dung and clay, and fenced with a strong row of
paHsades. A large tree grew in the centre. Several
huts were erected for interpreters and servants, and a
tolerably commodious hut, the roof overgrown with
pumpkiris, was arranged for our mansion.

our return ; for which exhibition they expected a pre
sent of a cow.
Much to my satisfaction I found that my first-rate
riding ox that had been lamed during the previous
year by falling into a pitfaU, and had been returned to
Shooa, was perfectly recovered'; thus I had a good
mount for my journey to Gondokoro.
Some months were passed at Shooa, during which I
occupied my time by rambling about the neighbour
hood, ascending the mountain, making dupHcates of
my maps, and gathering information, aU of which was
simply a corroboration of what I had heard before,
excepting from the East. The Turks had discovered a
new country caUed Lira, about thirty mdes from Shooa;
the natives were reported as extremely friendly, and
their country as wonderfuUy fertile, and rich in ivory.
Many of the people were located in the Turks' camp ;
they were the same type as the Madi, but wore their
hair in a different form : this was woven into a thick
felt, which covered the shoulders, and extended as low
upon the back as the shoulder-blade. They were not
particular about wearing false hair, but were happy to
receive subscriptions from any source ; in case of death
the hair of the deceased was immediately cut off and
shared among his friends to be added to their felt.
When in full dress (the men being naked) this mass of

felt was plastered thickly with a bluish clay, so as to
form an even surface; this was most elaborately
worked with the point of a thorn, so as to resemble the
cuttings of a file : white pipe-clay was then arranged
in patterns on the surface, whde an -ornament made of
either an antelope's or giraffe's sinew was stuck in the
extremity and turned up for about a foot in length.
This when dry was as stiff as horn, and the tip was
ornamented with a tuft of fur—the tip of a leopard's
tad being highly prized.
I am riot aware that any Lord ChanceUor of Eng

penetrated to Central Africa, therefore the origin of
fashion and the similarity in the wigs is most extra
ordinary ; a weU-blacked barrister in full wig and
nothing else would thoroughly impersonate a native
of Lira. The tribe of Lira was governed by a chief ;
but he had no more real authority than any of the
petty chiefs who ruled the various portions of the Madi
country. Throughout the tribes, excepting the kingdom
of Unyoro, the chiefs had very little actual power, and
so uncertain was their tenure of office that the rule
seldom remained two generations in one famdy. On
the death of the father, the numerous sons generaUy
quarreUed for his property and for the right of succes
sion, ending in open war, and in dividing the flocks

and herds, each settling in a separate district and
becoming a petty chief; thus there was no union
throughout the country, and consequently great weak
ness. The people of Lira were fighting with their
neighbours the Langgos — those of Shooa with the
natives of Fatiko ; nor were there two neighbouring
tribes that were at peace. It was natural that such
unprincipled parties as those of the Khartoum traders
should turn this general discord to their advantage;
thus within the ten months that I had been absent
from Shooa a great change had taken place in the
neighbourhood. The rival parties of Koorshid and
Debono, under their respective leaders, Ibrahim and
Mahommed Wat-el-Mek, had leagued themselves with
contending tribes, and the utter ruin of the country
was the consequence. For many mdes' circuit from
Shooa, the blackened ruins of viUages and deserted
fields bore witness to the devastation committed ; cattle
that were formerly in thousands, had been driven off,
and the beautiful district that had formerly oeen most
fertile was reduced to a wdderness. By these whole
sale acts of robbery and destruction the Turks had
damaged their own interests, as the greater number of
the natives had fled to other countries; thus it was
most difficult to obtain porters to convey the ivory to
Gondokoro. The people of the country had been so



## p. 264 (#298) ############################################

264 LOSS OF CATTLE BY THE TURKS. [chap. vii.
spoded by the payment in cows instead of beads for
the most trifling services, that they now refused to
serve as porters to Gondokoro under a payment of four
cows each; thus, as 1,000 men were required, 4,000
cows were necessary as payment. Accordingly razzias
must be made.
Upon several expeditions, the Turks realized about
2,000 cows; the natives had become alert, and had
driven off their herds to inaccessible mountains.
Debono's people at their camp, about twenty-five mUes
distant, were even in a worse position than Ibrahim ;
they had so exasperated the natives by their brutal
conduct, that tribes formerly hostile to each other now
coalesced and combined to thwart the Turks by declin
ing to act as porters ; thus their supply of ivory could
not be transported to Gondokoro. This led to extra
violence on the part of the Turks, until at last the
chief of Faloro (WerdeUa) declared open war, and
suddenly driving off the Turks' cattle, he retired to
the mountains, from whence he sent an impertinent
message inviting Mahommed to try to rescue them.
This act of insolence united the rival trading parties
against WerdeUa: those of Ibrahim and Mahommed
agreed to join in an attack upon his viUage. They
started with a force of about 300 armed men, and
arriving at the foot of the mountains at about 4 a.m.

they divided thefr force into two parties of 150 men
each, and ascended the rocky hiU upon two sides,
intending to surprise the viUage on one side, whde the
natives and their herds would be intercepted in thefr
flight upon the other.
The chief, WerdeUa, was well experienced in the
affairs of the Turks, as he had been for two or three
years engaged with them in many razzias upon the
adjoining tribes ; — he had learnt to shoot whde acting
as their ady, and having received as presents two
muskets, and two brace of pistols from Debono's
nephew Amabde-, he thought it advisable to supply
himself with ammunition ; he had therefore employed
his people to steal a box of 500 cartridges and a parcel
containing 10,000 percussion caps from Mahommed's
camp. WerdeUa was a remarkably plucky feUow ; and
thus strengthened by powder and baU, and knowing
the character of the Turks, he resolved to fight.
Hardly had the Turks' party of 150 men advanced
halfway up the mountain path in their stealthy manner
of attempting a surprise, when they were assaded by a
shower of arrows, and the leader who carried the flag
feU dead at the report of a musket fired from behind a
rock. Startled at this unexpected attack, the Turks'
party recoded, leaving their flag upon the ground by
the dead standard-bearer. Before they had time to

recover from, their first panic, another shot was fired
from the same shelter at a distance of about thirty
paces, and the brains of one of the Turks' party were
splattered over his comrades, as the ball took the top of
his head completely off. Three Bagara Arabs, first-
rate elephant-hunters, who were with the Turks, now
rushed .forward .and saved the flag and a box of am
munition that the -porter had thrown down in his flight.
These Arabs, whose courage was of a different class to
that of the traders' party > endeavoured to raUy the
panic-stricken Turks* but just as they were feebly and
irresolutely advancing, another shot rang from the
same fatal rock, and a man who carried a box of car
tridges fell dead. This was far too hot for the traders'
people, who usually had it aU their own way, being
alone possessed of fire-arms. A disgraceful flight took
place, but WerdeUa was again too much for them. On
their arrival at the bottom of the hid, they ran round
the base to join, the other division of their party ; this
effected, they were consulting together as to retreat or
advarice, when close above thefr heads from an over
hanging rock another shot was fired, and a man
dropped, shot through the chest. The head of WerdeUa
was distinctly seen grinning in triumph ; — the whole
party fired at him ! " He's down ! " was shouted, as the
head disappeared ; — a puff of smoke from the rock,

and a shriek from one of the Turks at the sound of
another musket shot from the same spot, settled the
question ; — a man feU mortaUy wounded. Four men
were shot dead, and one was brought home by the crest
fallen party to die in two or three days ; — five shots
had been fired, and five kUled, by one native armed
with two guns against 300 men. " Bravo, WerdeUa ! " I
exclaimed, as the beaten party returned to camp and
Ibrahim described the fight. He deserved the Victoria
Cross. This defeat completely cowed the cowardly
Turks ; nor would any persuasions on the part of
Borahim induce them to make another razzia within the
territory of the redoubted chief, WerdeUa.
During the absence of the traders' party upon various
expeditions, about fifty men were left in thefr camp as
head-quarters. Nothing could exceed the brutaUty of
the people ; — they had erected stills, and produced a
powerful corn spirit from the native merissa ; — thefr
entire time was passed in gambling, drinking, and
fighting, both by night and day. The natives were dl
treated, their female slaves and children brutaUy id
used, and the entfre camp was a mere shce from the
infernal regions. My portion of the camp being a
secluded court-yard, we were fortunately independent.
On one occasion a razzia had been made ; and al
though unsuccessful in cattle, it had been productive in

slaves. Among the captives was a pretty young girl
s of about fifteen; she had been sold by auction in the
camp, as usual, the day after the return from the razzia,
and had fallen to the lot of one of the men. Some
days after her capture, a native from the vdlage that
had been plundered confidently arrived at the camp
with the intention of offering ivory for her ransom.
Hardly had he entered the gateway, when the girl, who
was sitting at the door of her owner's hut, caught sight
of him, and springing to her feet, she ran as fast as her
chained ankles would aUow her, and threw herself in
his arms, exclaiming, "My father ! " It was her father,
who had thus risked his life in the enemy's camp to
ransom his chUd.
The men who were witnesses to this scene imme
diately rushed upon the unfortunate man, tore him
from his daughter, and bound him tightly with cords.
Whde this was enacting, I happened to be in my
hut : thus I was not an eye-witness. About an hour
later, I caUed some of my men to assist me in cleaning
some rifles. Hardly had we commenced, when three
shots were fired within a hundred paces of my hut. My
men exclaimed, " They have shot the Abid (native) ! "
"What native?" I inquired. They then related the
story I have just described. Brutal as these blood
thirsty viUains were, I could hardly believe in so cold-

blooded a murder. I immediately sent my people and
the boy Saat to verify it ; they returned with the
report that the wretched father was sitting on the
ground, bound to a tree, — dead ; shot by three
balls. I must do Ibrahim the justice to explain that' he was
not in the camp ; had he been present, this murder
would not have been committed, as he scrupulously
avoided any such acts in my vicinity. A few days
later, a young girl about sixteen, and her mother, who
were slaves, were missing; they had escaped. The
hue and cry was at once raised. Ibrahimawa, the
" Sinbad " of Bornu, who had himseh? been a slave,
was the most indefatigable slave-hunter. He and a
party at once started upon the tracks of the fugitives.
They did not return until the foUowing day ; but where
was the runaway who could escape from so true a
bloodhound? The young girl and her mother were
led into camp tied together by the neck, and were
immediately condemned to be hanged. I happened to
be present, as, knowing the whole affair, I had been
anxiously awaiting the result. I took this opportunity
of explaining to the Turks that I would use any force
to prevent such an act, and that I would report the
names of aU those to the Egyptian authorities who
should commit any murder that I could prove ; neither

would I permit the two captives to be flogged— they
were accordingly pardoned.*
There was among the slaves a woman who had been
captured in the attack upon Fowooka. This woman
I have already mentioned as having a very beautiful
boy, who at the time of the capture was a little more
than a year old. So determined was her character,
that she had run away five times with her child, but on
every occasion she had been recaptured, after having
suffered much by hunger and thirst in endeavouring to
find her way back to Unyoro through the uninhabited
wdderness between Shooa and Karuma. On the last
occasion of her capture, the Turks had decided upon'
her being incorrigible, therefore she had received 144
blows with the coorbatch (hippopotamus whip), and
had been sold separately from her child to the party
belonging to Mahommed Wat-el-Mek. Little Abbai
had always been a great pet of Mrs. Baker's, and the
unfortunate child being now motherless, he was
naturaUy adopted, and led a most happy life.
Although much under two years old, he was quite
equal in precocity to a European child of three ; in
* It will be observed that at this period of the expedition I had
acquired an extraordinary influence over the people, that enabled
me to exert an authority which saved the lives of many unfortunate
creatures who would otherwise have been victims.

form and strength he was a young Hercules, and,
although so young, he would frequently follow me out
shooting for two or three mdes, and return home with
a guinea-fowl hanging over his shoulder, or his hands
fuU of pigeons. Abbai became very civilized ; he was
taught to make a Turkish " salaam " upon receiving a
present, and to wash his hands both before and after
his meals. He had the greatest objection to eat alone,
and he generally invited three or four friends of about
his own age to dine with him ; on such occasions, a
large wooden bowl, about twenty inches in diameter, was
filled with soup and porridge, around which steaming
dish the young party sat, happier in their slavery than
kings in power. There were two lovely girls of three
and eight years of age that belonged to Ibrahim ; these
were not black, but of the same dark brown tint as
Kamrasi and many of the Unyoro people. Thefr
mother was also there, and thefr history being most
pitiable, they were always allowed free access to our
hut and the dinner bowl. These two girls were the
daughters of Owine, one of the great chiefs who were
aUied with Fowooka against Kamrasi. After the
defeat of Fowooka, Owine and many of his people
with thefr famdies quitted the country, and forming
an aUiance with Mahommed Wat-el-Mek, they settled
in the neighbourhood of his camp at Faloro, and budt

a vdlage. For some time they were on the best terms,
but some cattle of the Turks being missed, suspicion
fell upon the new settlers. The men of Mahommed's
party, desired that they might be expeUed, and Ma
hommed, in a fit of drunken fury, at once ordered them
to be massacred. His men, eager for murder and
plunder, immediately started upon thefr bloody errand,
and surrounding the unsuspecting colony, they fired the
huts and kUled every man, including the chief, Owine ;
capturing the women and children as slaves. Ibrahim
had received the mother and two girls as presents from
Mahommed Wat-el-Mek. As the two rival companies
had been forced to fraternize, owing to the now
generaUy hostde attitude of the surrounding tribes,
the leaders had become wonderfully poHte, exchanging
presents, getting drunk together upon raw spirits, and
behaving in a brotherly manner— according to their
ideas of fraternity. There was a pecuUar charm in the
association with chddren in this land of hardened
hearts and savage natures : there is a time in the Hfe
of the most savage animal when infancy is free from
the fierce instincts of race ; even the lion's whelp will
fondle the hand that it would tear in riper years : thus,
separated in this land of horrors' from aU civilization,
and forced by hard .necessity into the vicinity of aU

reHef to be surrounded by those who were yet innocent,
and who clung in their forsaken state to those who
looked upon them with pity. We had now six little
dependents, none of whom could ever belong to us, as
they were all slaves, but who were weU looked after
by my wife ; fed, amused, and kept clean. The boy
Abbai was the greatest favourite, as, having neither
father nor mother, he claimed the greatest care ; he
was weU washed every morning, and then to his great
delight smeared aU over from head to toes with red
ochre and grease, with a cock's feather stuck in his
wooUy pate. He was then a most charming pet savage,
and his todette completed, he invariably sat next to
his mistress, drinking a gourd-sheU of hot milk, while
I smoked my early morning pipe beneath the tree.
I made bows and arrows for my boys, and taught
them to shoot at a mark, a large pumpkin being carved
into a maris head to excite their aim. Thus the days
were passed until the evening ; at that time a large
fire was Hghted to create a blaze, drums were coUected,
and after dinner a grand dance was kept up by the
children, untd the young Abbai ended regularly by
creeping under my wife's chair, and falling sound
asleep : from this protected spot he was carried to his
mat, wrapped up in a piece of old flannel (the best
cloth we had), in which he slept till morning. Poor

little Abbai ! I ofteri wonder what wiU be his fate, and
whether in his dreams he recalls the few months of
happiness that brightened his earliest days of slavery.
Although we were in good health in Shooa, many of
the men were dl, suffering generally from headache ;
also from ulcerated legs ; — the latter was a peculiar
disease, as the ulcer generally commenced upon the
ankle bone' and extended to such a degree that the
patient was rendered incapable of walking. The treat
ment for headache among all the savage tribes was a
simple cauterization of the forehead in spots burnt with
a hot iron close to the roots of the hair. The natives
declared that Ahe water was unwholesorrie from the
small stream at the foot of the hill, and that all those
who drank from the well were in good health. I went
clown to examine the spring, which I found beautifully
clear, while the appearance of the stream was quite
sufficient to explain the opposite quahty. As I was
walking, quietly along the bank, I sawa bright ray of
light in the grass upon the opposite side ; in another
moment I perceived the head of a crocodUe who was
concealed in the grass, the brightness of the sun's
reflexion upon the eye having attracted my attention.
A shot with the little 24 rifle struck just above the
eye and killed it; — it was a female, from which we
extracted seven large eggs, all with hard shells.

The shooting that I had whde at Shooa was confined
to antelopes ; of these there was no variety excepting
waterbuck and hartebeest. Whenever I shot an animal,
the Shooa natives would invariably cut its throat, and
drink the hot blood as it gushed from the artery. In
this neighbourhood there was a great scarcity of game;
the natives of Lira described their country as teeming
with elephants and rhinoceros ; a fine horn of the latter
they brought with them to Shooa. There is only one

two-horned black rhinoceros is extremely vicious. I
have remarked that they almost invariably charge any
enemy that they smell, but do not see ; they generally
retreat if they observe the object before obtaining the
wind. In my rambles in search of game, I found two
varieties of cotton growing indigenous to the country ;
one with a yellow blossom was so short in the staple
as to be worthless, but the other (a red blossom) pro
duced a fine quality that was detached with extreme
ease from the seeds. A sample of this variety I brought
to England, and deposited the seed at the Eoyal Bo
tanical Gardens at Kew. A large quantity was reported
to be grown at Lira, some of which was brought me
by the chief ; this was the inferior kind. - I sketched
the old chief of Lira, who when in full dress wore a
curious ornament of cowrie-sheUs upon his felt wig
that gave him a most comical appearance, as he looked
like the caricature of an English judge. The Turks
had extended thefr excursions in thefr search for ivory,
and they returned from an expedition sixty miles east
of Shooa, bringing with them two donkeys that they
had obtained from the natives. This was" .an interesting
event, as for nearly two years I had heard from the
natives of Latooka, and from those of Unyoro, that
donkeys existed in a country to the east. These animals

CHAPTER VIII.
THE NATIVES IN MOURNING.
The hour of deliverance from our long sojourn in
Central Africa was at hand ; — it was the month of
February, and the boats would be at Gondokoro. The
Turks had packed" thefr ivory; the large tusks were
fastened to poles to be carried by two men, and the
camp was a perfect mass of this valuable material. I
counted 609 loads of upwards of 50 lbs. each ; thirty-
one loads were lying at an out-station : therefore the
total results of the ivory campaign during the last
twelve months were :about 32,000 lbs., equal to about
£9,630 when delivered in Egypt. This was a perfect
fortune for Koorshid.
We were ready to start. My baggage was so un
important that I was prepared to forsake everything
and to march straight for Gondokoro independently
with my own men, but this the Turks assured me was



## p. 279 (#313) ############################################

chap, viii.] RESULTS OF THE IVORY CAMPAIGN. 279
impracticable, as the country was so hostUe in advance
that we must of necessity have some fighting on the
road ; the Bari tribe would dispute our right to pass
through their territory. The porters were all engaged
to transport the ivory, but I observed that the greater
number were in mourning for either lost friends or
cattle, having ropes twisted round their necks and
waists, as marks of sorrow. About 800 men received
payment of cattle in advance ; — the next day they had
aU absconded with thefr cows, having departed during
the night. This was a planned affair to " spoil the
Egyptians :" a combination had been entered into some
months before by the Madi and Shooa tribes, to receive
payment and to abscond, but to leave the Turks help
less to remove their stock of ivory. The people of
Mahommed Wat-el-Mek were in a similar dilemma ;
not a tusk could be delivered at Gondokoro. This was
not my affair. The greater portion of Ibrahim's im
mense store of ivory had been given to him by Kamrasi, ;
I had guaranteed him a hundred cantars (10,000 lbs.)
should he quit Obbo and proceed to the unknown
south ; — in addition to a large quantity that he had
coUected and dehvered at Gondokoro in the past year,
he had now more than three times that amount. Al
though Kamrasi had on many occasions offered the
ivory to me, I had studiously avoided the acceptance

of a single tusk, as I wished the Turks to beheve that
I would not mix myself up with trade in any form,
and that my* expedition had purely the one object that
I had explained to Ibrahim when I first won him over
on the road to EUyria more than two years ago, — " the
discovery of the Albert Lake." With a certain number
of presents of first-class forty-guinea rifles and guns,
&c. &c, to Ibrahim, I declared my intention of starting
for Gondokoro. My trifling articles of baggage were
packed ; a few of the Lira natives were to act as
porters, as, although the ivory could not be transported,
it was necessary for Ibrahim to send a strong party to
Gondokoro to procure ammunition and the usual sup
phes forwarded annuaUy from Khartoum ; — the Lira
people who carried my luggage would act as return
porters. The day arrived for our departure ; — the oxen were
saddled and we were ready to start. Crowds of people
came to say " good bye," but dispensing with the hand-
kissing of the Turks who were to remain in camp, we
prepared for our journey towards home. Far away
although it was, every step would bring us nearer.
Nevertheless there were ties even in this wild spot,
where aU was savage and unfeeUng — ties that were
painful to sever, and that caused a sincere regret to
both of us when we saw our little flock of unfortunate

slave children crying at the idea of separation. In this
moral desert, where all humanized feelings were withered
and parched Hke the sands of the Soudan, the guile-
lessness of the chdcfren had been welcomed Idee springs
of water, as the only refreshing feature in a land of sin
and darkness. " Where are you going ? " cried poor
Httle Abbai in the broken Arabic that we had taught
him. "Take me with you, Sitty! " (lady,) and he fol
lowed us down the path as we regretfully left our
proteges, with his fists tucked into his eyes, weeping
from his heart, although for his own mother he had not
shed a tear. We could not take him with us ; — he
belonged to Ibrahim ; and had I purchased the child to
rescue him from his hard lot and to rear him as a
civilized being, I might have been charged with slave
deahng. With heavy hearts we saw him taken up in
the arms of a woman and carried back to camp, to
prevent bim from following our party, that had now
started. We had turned our backs fairly upon the south, and
we now traveUed for several days through most beau
tiful park-Hke lands, crossing twice the Un-y-Ame
stream, that rises in the country between Shooa and
Unyoro, and arriving at the point of junction of this
river with the Nde, in latitude 3° 32' N. On the north
bank of the Un-y-Ame, about three miles from the

embouchure of that river where it flows into the Nile,
the tamarind tree was shown me that forms the limit
of Signor Miani's journey from Gondokoro, the ex
treme point reached by any traveUer from the north
untd the date of my expedition. This tree. bore the
name of " Shedder-el-Sowar " (the traveUer's tree), by
which it was -known by the traders' parties. Several
of the men belonging to Ibrahim, also Mahommed
Wat-el-Mek, the vakeel of Debono's people, had ac
companied Signor Miani on his expedition to this spot.
Loggo, the Bari interpreter, who had constantly acted
for me during two years, happened to have been the
interpreter of Signor Miani ; — he confessed to me. how
he had been compeUed by his master's escort to deceive
him, by pretending that a combined attack was to be
made upon them by the natives. Upon this excuse,
Miani's men refused to proceed, and determined to turn
back to Gondokoro ; — thus ended his expedition. I re
garded the tree that marked the limit of his journey with
much sympathy. I remembered how I had formerly
contended with similar difficulties, and how heart-break
ing it would have been to have returned, baffled by the
misconduct of my own people, when the determination
of my heart urged me forward to the south ; — thus I
appreciated the disappointment that so enterprising a
traveUer must have felt in sorrowfully cutting his name

upon the tree, and leaving it as a record of misfortune.
With a just tribute to the perseverance that had
carried him farther than any European traveller had
penetrated before him, we continued our route over a
most beautifid park of verdant grass, diversified by
splendid tamarind trees, the dark foliage of which
afforded harbour for great numbers of the brilliant
yeUow-breasted pigeon. We shortly ascended a rocky
mountain by a stony and difficult pass, and upon
arrival at the summit, about 800 feet above the Nile,
which lay in front at about two rndes' distance, we
halted to enjoy the magnificent view. " Hurrah for the
old Nile !" I exclaimed, as I reveUed in the scene
before me : here it was, fresh from its great parent, the
Albert Lake, in aU the grandeur of Africa's mightiest
river. From our elevated point we looked down upon a
broad sheet of unbroken water, winding through marshy
ground, flowing from W.S.W. The actual breadth of
clear water, independent of the marsh and reedy banks,
was about 400 yards, but, as usual in the deep and flat
portions of the White NUe, the great extent of reeds
growing in deep water rendered any estimate of the
positive width extremely vague.- We could discern the
course of this great river for about twenty miles, and
distinctly trace the line of mountains on the west bank
that we had seen, at about sixty miles' distance when

284 KOSHI AND MADI. [°HAP- vm-
on the route from Karuma to Shooa ;— the commence
ment of this chain we had seen when at Magungo,
forming the Koshi frontier of the Nile, The country
opposite to the point on which we now stood was
Koshi, which, forming the west bank of the Nile,
extended the entire way to the Albert Lake. The
country that we occupied was Madi, which extended
as the east bank of the Nile to the angle of the
Victoria Nile (or Somerset river) junction opposite
Magungo. These two countries, Koshi and Madi, we
had seen from Magungo when we had viewed the exit
of the Nile from the lake, as though a tail-like con
tinuation of the water, until lost in the distance of
the interminable valley of high reeds. Having, from
Magungo, in lat. 2° 16', looked upon the course of the
river far to the north, and from the high pass, our
present point, in lat. 3° 34' N., we now comprised an
extensive view of the river to the south ; the extremi
ties of the limits of view from north and south would
almost meet, and leave a mere trifle of a few miles not
actuaUy inspected.
Exactly opposite the summit of the pass from wdiich
we now scanned the country, rose the precipitous moun
tain known as Gebel Kookoo, which rose to a height of
about 2,500 feet above the level of the Nile, and formed
the prominent feature of a chain which bordered the



## p. 285 (#319) ############################################

chap, viii.] GEBEL KOOKOO. 285
west bank of the Nile with few breaks to the north,
untd within thirty mdes of Gondokoro. The pass upon
which we stood was the southern extremity of a range
of high rocky hills that formed the east cliff of the
Nile ; — thus the broad and noble stream that arrived
from the Albeit Lake in a sheet of unbroken water
received the Un-y-Ame river, and then suddenly en
tered the pass between the two chains of hiUs, — Gebel
Kookoo on the west, and the ridge that we now occu
pied upon the east. The mouth of the Un-y-Ame'
river was the Hmit of navigation from the Albert Lake.
As far as the eye could reach to the south-west, the
country was dead flat and marshy throughout the
course of the river ; this appearance proving the cor
rectness of the information I had received from the
natives of Unyoro, and from Kamrasi himself, that the
Nde was navigable for some days' journey from the
Albert Lake. Precisely the same information had
been given to Speke, and the river level at this point
showed by his thermometer so great a difference be
tween that of Karuma, that he had concluded the faU
of 1,000 feet must exist between the foot of Karuma
FaUs and the Albert Lake ; — this, as already described,
I proved to be 1,275 feet.
It would be impossible to describe the calm enjoy
ment of the scene from this elevated pass, from which

286 ON SPEKE AND GRANT'S ROUTE. [chap, viii
we confirmed the results of our own labours and of
Speke's well-reflected suggestions. We were now on
the track by which he and Grant had returned ; but I
believe they had rounded the foot of the hill that we
had ascended ; — the two routes led to the same point,
as our course brought us at right angles with the Nile
that flowed beneath us. Descending the pass through
a thorny jungle, we arrived at. the river, and turning
suddenly to the north, we followed its course for about
a mile, and then bivouacked for the evening. The Nile
having entered the vaUey between Gebel Kookoo and
the western range, was no longer the calm river that
we had seen to the south : numerous rocky islands
blocked its course, and mud-banks covered with
papyrus rush so obstructed the stream that the river
widened to about a mile, — this width was composed
of numerous channels, varying in breadth between the
obstructing rock and island. Upon one of the rush-
covered islands a herd of elephants was discovered,
almost concealed by the height of the vegetation.
As they approached the edge of the water and became
exposed, I tried about twenty shots at them with the
Fletcher rifle, sighted to 600 yards, but in no instance
could I either touch' or disturb them by the bullets ; —
this wiU afford some idea of the width of the river, the
island appearing to be in the middle of the stream.

A short distance below this spot, the Nile rapidly
contracted, and at length became a roaring torrent,
passing through a narrow gorge between perpendicular
cliffs, with a tremendous current. In some places the
great river was pent up between rocks, which confined
it to a width of about 120 yards, — through such
channels the rush of water was terrific, but to a casual
observer approaching from the north, the volume of
the Nde would have been underrated, unless calculated
by the velocity of the stream.
From this point we foUowed the bank of the Nile
over a difficult route, down steep ravines and up
precipitous crags, by a winding path along the foot of
the range of syenite hdls that hemmed in the river on
the west bank. Several considerable waterfalls added
to the grandeur of the pass, through which for many
mdes the angry Nde chafed and roared Hke a lion in
its confined den.
At length we arrived at a steep descent, and dis
mounting from our oxen after a walk of about a
quarter of a mde over rough stones, we reached
the Asua river, about a quarter of a mile above
its junction with the Nde. The bed was rocky ;
but although the Atabbi had subscribed its waters
above the point where we now crossed, there
was merely a trifling stream occupying about a

quarter of the river's bed, with a current of about
two and a half mdes an hour. Crossing this on
foot, the water in the deepest part reached to the-
middle of my thighs. The Asua river, as already
described, at the time that I crossed it on the route
from Farajoke to Shooa, is a mountain torrent formid
able during the rains; quickly flooding and quickly
emptying from its rapid inclination, it is exhausted
during the dry season.
The crossing of this river was a signal . for extra
precaution in the arrangement of our march : we had
entered the territory of the ever hostile Bari tribe ;
we had been already warned that we could not pass to
Gondokoro without being attacked.
We slept on the road, about seven miles to the
north of the Asua. On the foUowing morning we
started. The route led over' a fine country parallel
with the Nile, that still continued in a rock-bound
channel on the west of the march. Throughout the
route from the Un-y-Ame junction, the soil had been
wretchedly poor, — a mass of " rock and decomposed
granite forming a sand that quickly parched during
the dry season. The level of the couritry being about
200 feet above the Nile, deep gullies cut the route at
right angles, forming the natural drains to the river.
In these ravines grew dense thickets' of bamboos.

chap, viii.] SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE NATIVES. 28f>
Having no native guide, but trusting solely to the
traders' people, who had travelled frequently by this
/oute, we lost the path, and shortly became entangled
amongst the numerous ravines. At length we passed
a village, around which were assembled a number of
natives. Having regained the route, we observed the
natives appearing in various directions, and as quickly
disappearing only to. gather in our front in increased
numbers. Their movements exciting suspicion, in a
country where every man was an enemy, our party
closed together ;— we threw out an advance guard, —
ten men on either flank, — the porters, ammunition, and
effects in the centre ; whde about ten men brought up
the rear. Before us lay two low rocky hiUs covered
with trees, high grass and brushwood, in which I
distinctly observed the bright red forms of natives
painted according to. the custom of the Bari tribe.
We were evidently in for a fight. The path lay in
a gorge between the low rocky hills in advance. My
wife dismounted from her ox, and walked at the head
of our party with me, Saat foUowing behind with the
gun that he usuady carried, while the men drove
several riding-oxen in the centre. . Hardly had we
entered the pass, when — whizz went an arrow over
our heads. This was the signal for a repeated dis
charge. The natives ran among the rocks with ' the.

agdity of monkeys, and showed a considerable amount
of daring in standing within about eighty yards upon
the ridge, and taking steady shots at us with their ^
poisoned arrows. The flanking parties now opened fire,
and what with the bad shooting of both the escort and
the native archers, no one was wounded on either side
for the first ten minutes. The rattle of musketry, and
the wild appearance of the naked vermiUon-coloured
savages, as they leapt along the craggy ridge, twanging
their bows at us with evil but ineffectual intent, was a
charming picture of African Hfe and manners. Fortu
nately the branches of numerous trees and intervening
clumps of bamboo frustrated the good intentions of the
arrows, as they glanced from thefr aim ; and although
some fell among our party, we were as yet unscathed.
One of the enemy, who was most probably a chief,
distinguished himself in particular, by advancing to
within about fifty yards, and standing on a rock> he
dehberately shot five or six arrows, aU of which missed
their mark; the men dodged them as they arrived in thefr
uncertain flight : the speed. of the arrows was so inferior,
owing to the stiffness of the bows, that nothing was
easier than to evade them. Any halt was unnecessary.
We continued our march through the gorge, the men
keeping up an unremitting' fire until we entered upon
a tract of high .grass and forest; this being perfectly

dry, it would have been easy to set it on fire, as the
enemy were to leeward ; but although the rusthng in
the grass betokened the presence of a great number of
men, they were invisible. In a few minutes we
emerged in a clearing, where corn had been planted ;
this was a favourable position for a decisive attack
upon the natives, who now closed up. Throwing out
skirmishers, with orders that they were to coyer them
selves behind the trunks of trees, the Baris were driven
back. One was now shot through the body and feU ;
but recovering, he ran with his comrades, and feU dead
after a few yards.
What casualties had happened during the passage
of the gorge, I cannot say, but the enemy were
now utterly discomfited. I had not fired a shot, as
the whole affair was perfect chdd's play, and any one
who could shoot would have settled the fortune of the
day by half a dozen shots ; but both the traders' people
and my men were "shooters, but not hitters." We
now bivouacked on the field for the night.
During the march on the foUowing day, the natives
watched us at a distance, foUowing in great numbers
paraUel with our route, but fearing to attack. The
country was perfectly open, being a succession of fine
downs of low grass, with few trees, where any attack
against our guns would have been madness.

292- CAMP SURROUNDED -BY NATIVES.- . [chap. viii.
In- the evening we arrived at two smaU deserted
viUages ; these,, Hke most- in the Bari country, were
circular, and surrounded by a -live and impenetrable
fence- of euphorbia, having only one entrance. The
traders' people camped in one, while I took up my
quarters in the other. The sun had sunk, and the.
night being pitch dark, we had a glorious fire, around
which we placed our angareps opposite the narrow
entrance of the camp, about ten yards distant. I.
stationed Eicharuas sentry outside the -gateway, as he
was the most dependable of my men, and I thought it
extremely probable that we might be. attacked during
the riight : three other sentries I placed on guard at
various. stations. Dinner being concluded, Mrs. .Baker
lay. down on her angarep for. the night. I drew the
balls from a double No. 10 smooth bore, and loaded
with cartridge containing each twenty large-mould
shot (about a hundred to the pound)"; putting this
under my piUow I went to sleep. Hardly had I begun
to rest, when my men woke me, saying that the camp
was surrounded by natives. Upon inquiry I found
this to be correct ; it was so dark that they could not be
seen without stooping to the ground, and looking along
the surface. I ordered the. sentries not to fire unless
hostiHties should commence on the side of the natives,
and in no case to draw trigger without a challenge.



## p. 293 (#327) ############################################

chap, viii.] POISONED ARROWS SHOT INTO CAMP. 293
Returning to the angarep I laid down, and not
wishing to sleep, I smoked my long Unyoro pipe. In
about ten minutes — bang ! went a shot, quickly fol
lowed by another from the sentry at the entrance of
the camp. Quietly rising from my bed, I found Richarn
reloading at his post. " What is it, Richarn ? " I asked.
" They are shooting arrows into the camp, aiming at
the fire, in hopes of hitting you who are sleeping there,"
said Richarn. " I watched one feUow," he continued,
" as I heard the twang of his bow four times. At each
shot I heard an arrow strike the ground between me
and you, therefore I fired at him, and I think he is
down. Do you see that black object lying on the
ground ? " I saw something a little blacker than the
surrounding darkness, but it could not be distinguished.
Leaving Richarn with orders not to move from his
post, but to keep a good look-out until reheved by the
next watch, I again went to sleep.
Before break of day, just as the grey dawn sHghtly
improved the darkness, I visited the sentry ; he was at
his post, and reported that he thought the archer of
the preceding night was dead, as he had heard a sound
proceeding from the dark object on the ground after I
had left. In a few minutes it was sufficiently Hght to
distinguish the body of a man lying about thirty paceg
from the camp entrance. Upon examination, he proved

to be a Bari ; — his bow was in his hand, and two or
three arrows were lying by his side ; — thirteen mould
shot had struck him dead; — one had cut through the
bow. We now searched the camp for arrows, and as
it became Hght, we picked up four in various places,
some within a few feet of our beds, and all horribly
barbed and poisoned, that the deceased had shot into
the camp gateway.
This was the last attack during our journey. We
marched weU, generaUy accompHshing fifteen mUes of
latitude daily from this point, as the road was good
and well known to our guides. The country was gene
raUy poor, but beautifuUy diversified with large trees,
the tamarind predominating. Passing through the
smaU but thickly-populated and friendly little province
of Moir, in a few days we sighted the well-known
mountain BeHgnian, that we had formerly passed on
its eastern side when we had started on our uncertain
path from Gondokoro upwards of two years ago. The
mountain of Beligriian was now N.E. from our point of,
observation. We had a splendid view of the Ellyria
Mountain, and of the distant cone, Gebel el Assul
(Honey Mountain),- between EUyria and Obbo. AU
these curiously-shaped crags and peaks were well
known to us, and we welcomed them as old friends
after a long absence ; they had been our companions

in times of doubt and anxiety, when success in our
undertaking appeared hopeless. At noon on the follow
ing day, as we were as usual marching paraUel with
the Nde, the river, having made a slight bend to the
west, swept round, and approached within half a mile
of our path; — the smaU conical mountain, Regiaf,
within twelve mdes of Gondokoro, was on our left,
rising from the west bank of the river. We felt
almost at home again, and marching untd sunset, we
bivouacked within three miles of Gondokoro. That
night we were fuU of speculations. Would a boat be
waiting for us with supphes and letters ? The morning
anxiously looked forward to at length arrived. We
started ; — the English flag had been mounted on a fine
straight bamboo with a new lancehead specially arranged
for the arrival at Gondokoro. My men felt proud, as
they would march in as conquerors ; — according to
White Nde ideas such a journey could not have been
accompHshed with so smaU a party. Long before
Ibrahim's men were ready to start, our oxen were
saddled and we were off, longing to hasten into
Gondokoro and to find a comfortable vessel with a few
luxuries, and the post from England. Never had the
oxen traveUed so fast as on that morning; — the flag
led the way, and the men in exceUent spirits followed
at double quick pace. " I see the masts of the vessels !"

exclaimed the boy Saat. " El hambd el Illah ! " (Thank
God!) shouted the men. " Hurrah!" said I — "Three
cheers for old England and the Sources of the Nile!
Hurrah ! " and my men joined me in the wild, and to
thefr ears savage, Enghsh yeU. " Now for a salute ! Fire
away aU your powder if you like, my lads, and let the
people know that we're alive !" This was aU that was
required to complete the happiness of my people, and
loading and firing as fast as possible, we approached
near to Gondokoro. Presently we saw the Turkish
flag emerge from Gondokoro, at about a quarter of a
mile distant, followed by a number of the traders'
people, who waited to receive us. On our arrival,
they immediately approached and fired salutes
with ball cartridge, as usual advancing close to us
and discharging thefr guns into the ground at our
feet. One of my servants, Mahomet, was riding
an ox, and an old friend of his in the crowd
happening to recognise him, immediately advanced
and saluted him by firing his gun into the earth
directly beneath, the belly of the ox he was riding ;
— the effect produced made the crowd and ourselves
explode with laughter. The nervous ox, terrified
at the sudden discharge, between his legs, gave a
tremendous kick, and continued madly kicking and
plunging, untd Mahomet was pitched over his head,

minated the expedition.
Dismounting from our tired oxen, our first inquiry
was concerning boats and letters. What was the
reply ? Neither boats, letters, supplies, nor any intel-
Hgence of friends or the civihzecl world ! We had long
since been given up as dead by the inhabitants of
Khartoum, and by aU those who understood the diffi
culties and dangers of the country. We were told
that some people had suggested that we might possibly
have gone to Zanzibar, but the general opinion was
that we had aU been killed. At this cold and barren
reply, I felt almost choked. We had looked forward
to arriving at Gondokoro as to a home ; we had ex
pected that a boat would have been sent on the chance
of finding us, as I had left money in the hands of an
agent in Khartoum — but there was Hterally nothing to
receive us, and we were helpless to return. We had
worked for years in misery, such as I have but faintly
described, to overcome the difficulties of this hitherto
unconquerable exploration ; we had succeeded — and
what was the result ? Not even a letter from home to
welcome us if alive! As I sat beneath a tree and
looked down upon the glorious Nde that flowed a few
yards beneath my feet, I pondered upon the value of

mystery that had ever shrouded its origin was dissolved.
I no longer looked upon its waters with a feeling
approaching to awe, for I knew its home, and had
visited its cradle. Had I overrated the importance
of the discovery ? and had I wasted some of the best
years of my life to obtain a shadow ? I recalled to
recoUection the practical question of Commoro, the
chief of Latooka,-^-" Suppose you get to the great lake,
what will you do with it ? What will be the good of

CHAPTER IX.
THE LATEST NEWS FK0M KHARTOUM.
The various trading parties were assembled in Gon
dokoro with a total of about three thousand slaves ; but
there was a general consternation depicted upon every
countenance. Only three boats had arrived from Khar
toum—one diahbiah and two noggors — these belonged
to Koorshid Aga. The resume of news from Khartoum
was as foUows : —
" Orders had been received by the Egyptian autho
rities from the European Governments to suppress the
slave-trade. Four steamers had arrived at Khartoum
from Cairo. Two of these vessels had ascended the
White NUe, and had captured many slavers ; their
crews were imprisoned, and had been subjected to the
bastinado and torture ; — the captured slaves had been
appropriated by the Egyptian authorities.
" It would be impossible to deliver slaves to the

Soudan this season, as an Egyptian regiment had been
stationed in the ShiUook country, and steamers were
cruising to intercept the boats ' from the interior in
their descent to Khartoum ; — thus the army of slaves
then at Gondokoro would be utterly worthless.
" The plague was raging at Khartoum, and had killed
15,000 people ; — many of the boats' crews had died on
their passage from Khartoum to Gondokoro of this
disease, which had even broken out in the station
where we then were : people, died dady
" The White Nile was dammed up by a freak of
nature, and the crews of thirty vessels had been
occupied five weeks in cutting a ditch through the
obstruction, wide enough to admit the passage of
boats." Such was the inteUigence received by the latest arrival
from Khartoum. No boats having been sent for me, I
.engaged the diahbiah that had arrived for Koorshid's
ivory ; — this would return empty, as rio ivory could be
delivered, at Gondokoro. The prospect was pleasant, as
many men had died of the plague on board our vessel
during the voyage from Khartoum ; thus we should be
subject to a visitation of this fearful complaint as a
wind-up to the difficulties we had passed through
during our long exile in Central Africa. I ordered the
vessel to be thoroughly scrubbed with boiling water

and sand, after which it was fumigated with several
pounds of tobacco, burnt within the cabin.
Three days were employed in ferrying the slaves
across the river in the two noggors, or barges, as they
must be returned to their respective stations. 1 re
joiced at the total discomfiture of the traders, and,
observing a cloud of smoke far distant to the north, I
spread the alarm that a steamer was approaching from
Khartoum ! Such wras the consternation of the traders'
parties at the bare idea of such an occurrence that
they prepared for. immediate flight into the interior, as
they expected to be captured by Government troops
sent from Khartoum to suppress the slave-trade. Pro
fiting by this nervous state of affairs, I induced them to
aUow the boat to start immediately, and we concluded
ad our arrangements, contracting for the diahbiah at
4,000 piastres (£40). The plague having broken out
at Gondokoro, the victims among the natives were
dragged to the edge of the chff and thrown into the
river ; — it is impossible to describe the horrible efflu
vium produced by the crowds of slaves that had been
confined upon the limited area of the station. At
length the happy moment arrived that we were to quit
the miserable spot. The boat was ready to start — we
were aU on board, and Ibrahim and his people came to
say good-bye. It is only justice to Ibrahim to say,



## p. 302 (#336) ############################################

302 INFLUENCE GAINED OVER TRADER'S PEOPLE, [chap. ix.
that, although he had been my great enemy when at
Gondokoro in 1863, he had always behaved well since
peace was estabUshed at EUyria; and, although by
nature and profession a slave-hunter, like others of the
White Nde, he had frequently yielded to my inter
ference to save the lives of natives who would other
wise have been massacred without pity.
I had gained an extraordinary influence over all
these ruffianly people. Everything that I had promised
them had been more than performed ; aU that I had
foretold had been curiously realized. They now ac
knowledged how often I had assured them that the
slave-trade would be suppressed by the interference of
European powers,- and the present ruin of thefr trade
was the result ; they all beheved that I was the cause,
by having written from Gondokoro to the Consul-
general of Egypt in 1863, when the traders had
threatened to drive me back. Far from retaHating
upon me, they were completely cowed. The report had
been spread throughout Gondokoro by Ibrahim and
his people that their wonderful success in ivory hunt
ing was chiefly due to me ; that thefr, sick had been
cured ; that good luck had attended thefr party ; that
disaster had befallen all who had been against me;
and that no one had suffered wrong at our hands.
With the resignation of Mahommedans they yielded to



## p. 303 (#337) ############################################

chap, ix.] SAIL FROM GONDOKORO* 303
their destiny, apparently without any iU-feeHng against
us. Crowds lined the cliff and the high ground by tho
old ruins of the mission-station to see us depart. We
pushed off from shore into the powerful current ; the
Enghsh flag that had accompanied us through aU our
wanderings now fluttered proudly from the mast-head
unsuUied by defeat, and amidst the rattle of musketry
we gHded rapidly down the river, and soon lost sight
of Gondokoro.
What were our feelings at that moment ? Overflow
ing with gratitude to a Divine Providence that had
supported us in sickness, and guided us through all
dangers. There had been moments of hopelessness
and despair; days of misery, when the future had
appeared dark and fatal ; but we had been strengthened
in our weakness, and led, when apparently lost, by a
unseen hand. I felt no triumph, but with a feeling
of calm contentment and satisfaction we floated down
the Nde. My great joy was in the meeting that I
contemplated with Speke in England, as I had so
thoroughly completed the task we had agreed upon.
Sdently and easily we floated down the river; the
oars keeping us in mid-stream. The endless marshes
no longer looked so mournful as we glided rapidly past,
and descended the current against which we had
so arduously laboured on our. ascent to Gondokoro.

304 THE NILE. CLEARED OF. ITS -MYSTERY, [chap. ix.
As we thus proceeded on our voyage through the"
monotonous marshes and vast herds of hippopotami
that at this season thronged the river, I had ample
leisure to write my letters for England, to be posted on
arrival at Khartoum, and to look back upon the results.
of the last few years.
The Nde, cleared of its mystery, resolves itself into
comparative simplicity. The actual basin of the Nde
is included between about the 22° and 39° East longi-
tudej and from 3° South to 18° North latitude. The
drainage . of that vast area is monopolized by the
Egyptian river. The Victoria and Albert lakes, the
two great equatorial reservoirs, are the recipients
of aU affluents south of the Equator ; the Albert lake
being the grand reservoir in which are concentrated
the entire waters from the south, in addition to
tributaries from the Blue Mountains, from the north
of the Equator.. The Albert N'yanza is the great
basin of the Nile ; the distinction between that and
the Victoria N'yanza is, that the Victoria is a reser
voir, receiving the eastern affluents, and it becomes
a t starting point or the most elevated source at the
point where the river -issues from it at the Ripon
Falls : the Albert is a reservoir not only receiving
the. western and southern affluents direct from the
Blue. Mountains, but it also, receives the supply from



## p. 305 (#339) ############################################

chap, ix.] THE VICTORIA SOURCE. 305
the Victoria and from the entire equatorial Nile
basin. The Nile, as it issues from the Albert N'yanza,
is the entire Nde ; prior to its birth from the Albert
lake it is not the entfre Nde. A glance at the map
wiU at once exemplify the relative value of the two
great lakes. The Victoria gathers aU the waters on
the eastern side and sheds them into the northern
extremity of the Albert : while the latter, from its
character and position, is the direct channel of the Nile
that receives aU waters that belong to the equatorial
Nile basin. Thus the Victoria is the first source ; but
from the Albert the river issues at once as the great
White NUe.
It is not my intention to claim a higher value
for my discovery than is justly due, neither would
I diminish in any way the lustre of the achievements
of Speke and Grant ; it has ever been my object to
.confirm and support their discoveries, and to add my
voice to the chorus of praise that they have so justly
merited A great geographical fact has through our
joint labours been most thoroughly established by the
discovery of the Sources of the NUe. I lay down upon
the map exactly what I saw, and what I gathered from
information afforded by the natives most carefully
examined. My exploration confirms aU that was asserted by
VOL. II. x



## p. 306 (#340) ############################################

306 PTOLEMY'S THEORY. [chap. ix.
Speke and Grant : they traced the country from
Zanzibar to the northern watershed of Africa, com
mencing at about 3° south latitude, at the southern
extremity of the Victoria N'yanza. They subsequently
determined the river at -the Ripon Falls flowing from
that lake to be the highest source of the Nde. They had
a perfect right to arrive at this conclusion from the
data then afforded. They traced the river for a con
siderable distance to Karuma Falls, in lat. 2° 15' N;
and they subsequently met the NUe in lat. 3° 32' N.
They had heard that it flowed into the Luta N'zige,
and that it issued from it ; thus they were correct in
aU their investigations, which my discoveries have
confirmed. Their general description of the country
was perfect, but not having visited the lake heard of
as the Luta N'zig6, they could not possibly have been
aware of the vast importance of that great reservoir in
the Nile system. The task of exploring that extraor
dinary feature having been accomplished, the geo
graphical question of the sources of the Nile is explained.
Ptolemy had described the Nile sources as emanating
from two great lakes that received the snows of the
mountains in Ethiopia. There are many ancient maps
existing upon which these lakes are marked as positive :
although there is a wide error in the latitude, the fact
remains, that two great lakes were reported to exist

in Equatorial Africa fed by the torrents from lofty
mountains, and that from these reservoirs two streams
issued, the conjunction of which formed the Nile. The
general principle was correct, although the detail was
wrong. There can be little doubt that trade had
been carried on between the Arabs from the Red Sea
and the coast opposite Zanzibar in ancient times, and
that the people engaged in such enterprise had pene
trated so far into the interior as to have obtained a
knowledge of the existence of the two reservoirs ; thus
may the geographical information originally have been
brought into Egypt.

as given by him upon that map, I also adhere to the
name Somerset river for that portion of the Nile be
tween the Victoria and the Albert Lakes ; this must
be understood as Speke's Victoria Nile source; bearing
the name of Somerset, no confusion wdl arise in speaking
of the Nile, which would otherwise be ambiguous, as
the same name would apply to two distinct rivers, the
one emanating from the Victoria and flowing into the
Albert; the other the entire river Nile as it leaves
the Albert lake. The White Nile, fed as described by
the great reservoirs supphed by the rains of equatorial
districts, receives the foUowing tributaries. : —
From the East bank — The Asua, important from
15th April till 15th November : dry after that date.
From West bank — The J"6, third class ; full from
15th April till 15th November.
Ditto — Another smaU river, third class ; fuU from
15th April tiU 15th November.
Ditto — The Bahr el Gazal ; little or- no water
suppHed by this river.
From East bank — The Sobat, first class ; fuU from
June to December.
The Bahr Giraffe I omit, as it is admitted by the
natives to be a branch of the White NUe that leaves
the main river at the Aliab country and re-unites in
lat. 9° 25' between the Bahr el Gazal and the Sobat.

The latter river (Sobat) is the most powerful affluent of
the White Nile, and is probaby fed by many tributaries
from the GaUa country about Kaffa, in addition to re
ceiving the rivers from the Berri and Latooka countries.
I consider that the Sobat must be supplied by con
siderable streams from totaUy distinct countries east
and south, having a rainfaU at. different seasons, as it is
bank-fuU at the end of December, when the southern
rivers (the Asua, &c.) are extremely low. North from
the Sobat, the White Nde has no other tributaries until
it is joined by the Blue Nde at Khartoum, and by its
last affluent the Atbara in lat. 17° 37'. Those two
great mountain streams flooding suddenly in the end
of June, fed by the rains of Abyssinia, raise the volume
of the Nde to an extent that causes the inundations of
Lower Egypt.
The basin of the Nde being thus understood, let us
reflect upon the natural resources of the vast surface
of fertile sod that is comprised in that portion of
Central Africa. It is difficult to beheve that so mag
nificent a sod and so enormous an extent of country is
destined to remain for ever in savagedom, and yet it
is hard to argue on the possibdity of improvement in
a portion of the world inhabited by savages whose
happiness consists in idleness or warfare. The advan

the transport of any merchandise unless of extreme
value, as the expenses would be insupportable. The
natural productions are nil, excepting ivory. The
soil being fertile and the climate favourable to cul
tivation, aU tropical produce would thrive; — cotton,
coffee, and the sugar-cane are indigenous; but although
both climate and soil are favourable, the conditions
necessary to successful enterprise are wanting; — the
population is scanty, and the material of the very
worst ; the people vicious and idle. The climate,
although favourable for agriculture, is adverse to the
European constitution ; thus colonization would be out
of the question. What can be done with so hopeless
a prospect ? Where the climate is -fatal to Europeans,
from whence shall civUization be imported ? The heart
6f Africa is so completely secluded from the world, and
the means of comriiunicatiori are so difficult, that al

and bows her down beneath all other nations ? It is
the infernal traffic in slaves, — a trade so hideous, that
every heart of slave and owner becomes deformed, and
shrinks Hke a withered Hmb incapable of action. The
natural love of offspring, shared with the human race
by the most savage beast, ceases to warm the heart of
the wretched slave. Why should the mother love her
chdd,if it is born to become the property of her owner?
— to be sold as soon as it can exist without the mother's
care. Why should the girl be modest, when she knows.
that she is the actual property, the slave, of every
purchaser ? Slavery murders the sacred feeling of love;
that blessing that cheers the lot. of the poorest man;
that speU that binds bim to his wife, and chdd, and home:

improvement. Nothing would be easier than to suppress this
infamous traffic, were the European Powers in earnest.
Egypt is in favour of slavery. I have never seen a
Government official who did not in argument uphold
slavery as an institution absolutely necessary to Egypt,
—thus any demonstration made against the slave-trade
by the Government of that country wiU be simply a pro
formd movement to blind the European Powers. Their
eyes thus closed, and the question shelved, the trade
wdl resume its channel. Were the reports of European
consuls supported by their respective Governments,
and were the consuls themselves empowered to seize
vessels laden with slaves, and to Hberate gangs of
slaves when upon a land journey, that abominable
traffic could not exist. The hands of the European
Consuls are tied, and jealousies interwoven with the
Turkish question act as a bar to united action on the
part of Europe ; — no Power wdl be the first to disturb
the muddy pool. The Austrian consul at Khartoum,
Herr Natterer, told me, in 1862, that he had vainly
reported the atrocities of the slave-trade to his Govern
ment; — NO REPLY HAD BEEN RECEIVED to his report.
Every European Government knows that the slave-

trade is carried on to an immense extent in Upper
Egypt, and that the Red Sea is the great Slave Lake
by which these unfortunate creatures are transported
to Arabia and to Suez, — but the jeidousies concerning
Egypt muzzle each European Power. Should one
move, the other would interfere to counteract undue
influence in Egypt. Thus is immunity insured to the
vdlanous actors in the trade. Who can prosecute a
slave trader of the White Nde ? What legal evidence
can be produced from Central Africa to secure a con
viction in an English Court of Law ? The English
consul (Mr. Petherick) arrested a Maltese, the nephew
of Debono ; — the charge could not be legally supported.
Thus are the consuls fettered, and thefr acts minified
by the impossibihty of producing rehable evidence ; —
the facts are patent ; but who can prove them legaUy ?
Stop the White Nde trade ; prohibit the departure
of any vessels from Khartoum for the south, and let
the Egyptian Government grant a concession to a
company for the White Nde, subject to certain con
ditions, and to a special supervision. There are
already four steamers at Khartoum. Establish a
mditary post of 200 men at Gondokoro ; an equal
number below the ShiUook tribe in 13° latitude, and
with two steamers cruising on the river, not a slave
could descend the White Nile.

314 CENTRAL AFRICA OPENED TO NAVIGATION. [chap. ix.
Should the slave-trade be suppressed, there will be a
good opening for the ivory trade ; the conflicting
trading parties being withdrawn, and the interest of
the trade exhibited by a single company, the natives
would no longer be able to barter ivory for cattle"; thus
they would be forced to accept other goods in exchange.
The newly-discovered Albert Lake opens the centre of
Africa to navigation. Steamers ascend from Khartoum
to Gondokoro in latitude 4Q 55'. Seven days' march
south from that station, the navigable portion of the
Nde is reached, where vessels can ascend direct to the
Albert lake, — thus an enormous extent of country is
opened to navigation, and Manchester goods and
various other articles would find a ready market in
exchange for ivory, at a prodigious profit, as in those
newly-discovered regions ivory has a merely nominal
value. Beyond this commencement of honest trade,
I cannot offer a suggestion, as no produce of the
country except ivory could afford the expense of
transport to Europe. If Africa is to be civdized, it
must be effected by commerce, which once established,
wiU open the way for missionary labour ; but all ideas
of commerce, improvement, and the advancement of
the African race that philanthropy could suggest must
be discarded untd the traffic in slaves shaU have ceased
to exist.

chap, ix.] TRIBES OF CENTRAL AFRICA. 315
Should the slave-trade be suppressed, a field would
be opened, the extent of which I will not attempt to
suggest, as the future would depend upon the good
government of countries now devoted to savage anarchy
and confusion.
Any Government that would insure security would
be the greatest blessing, as the perpetual hostilities
among the various tribes prevent an extension of
cultivation. The sower knows not who will reap, thus
he limits his crop to his bare necessities.
The ethnology of Central Africa is completely beyond
my depth. The natives not only are ignorant of
writing, but they are without traditions — their thoughts
are as entirely engrossed by their dady wants as those
of animals ; thus there is no clue to the distant past ;
history has no existence. This is much to be deplored,
as pecuUarities are specific in the type of several tribes
both in physical appearance and in language. The
Dinka ; Bari ; Latooka ; Madi ; and Unyoro or Kit
wara, are distinct languages on the east of the Nile,
comprising an extent of country from about 12° north
to' the Equator. The Makkarika have also a distinct
language, and I was informed in Kamrasi's country,
that • the MaUegga, on the west of the Albert lake,
speak a different tongue to that of Kitwara (or Unyoro)

31 6 VESTIGES OF A PRE-ADAMITE CREATION? [chap. ix.
of which I have had no experience by comparison.
Accepting the fact of five distinct languages from the
Equator to 12° N. lat., it would appear by analogy that
Central Africa is divided into numerous countries and
tribes, distinct from each other in language and phy
sical conformation, whose origin is perfectly obscure.
Whether the man of Central Africa be pre- Adamite is
impossible to determine ; but the idea is suggested by
the following data. The historical origin of man, or
Adam, commences with a knowledge of God. Through
out the history of the world from the creation of Adam,
God is conriected with mankind in every creed, whether
worshipped as the universal sublime Spirit of omni
potence, or shaped by the forms of idolatry into repre
sentations of a deity. From the creation of Adam,
mankind has acknowledged its inferiority, and must
bow down and worship either the true God or a graven
image ; or something that is in heaven or in earth.
The world, as we accept that term, was always actu
ated by a natural rehgious instinct. Cut off from that
world, lost in the mysterious distance that shrouded
the origin of the Egyptian Nile, were races unknown,
that had never reckoned in the great sum of history —
races that we have brought to Hght, whose existence
had been hidden from mankind, and that now appear
before us like the fossil bones of antediluvian animals.

chap, ix.] GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. 317
Are they vestiges of what existed in a pre- Adamite
creation ?
The geological formation of Central Africa is primi
tive ; showing an altitude above the sea-level averaging
nearly 4,000 feet. This elevated portion of the globe,
budt up in great part of granitic and sandstone rocks,
has never been submerged, nor does it appear to have
undergone any changes, either volcanic or by the action
of water. Time, working through countless ages, with
the slow but certain instrument of atmospheric influ
ence, has rounded the surface and split into fragments
the granite rocks, leaving a sandy base of disintegrated
portions, while in other cases the mountains show as
hard and undecayed a surface as though fresh from
Nature's foundry. Central Africa never having been
submerged, the animals and races must be as old, and
may be older, than any upon the earth. No geological
change having occurred in ages long anterior to man,
as shown by Sir R. I. Murchison theoretically so far
back as the year 1852, when Central Africa was utterly
unknown, it is natural to suppose that the races that
exist upon that surface should be unaltered from thefr
origin. That origin may date from a period so dis
tant, that it preceded the Adamite creation. Historic
man beheves in a divinity; the tribes of Central
Africa know no God. Are they of our Adamite

318 HYPOTHESIS OF EQUATORIAL LAKES. [chap, ix,
race? The equatorial portion of Africa at the Nile
sources, has an average altitude above the sea-level
of about 4,000 feet ; this elevated plateau forms the
base of a range of mountains, that I imagine extends,
like the vertebrae of an animal, from east to west,
shedding a drainage to the north and south. Should
this hypothesis be correct, ,the southern watershed
would fiU the Tanganika lake ; whde farther to the
west another lake, supplied by the southern drainage,
may form the head of the river Congo. On the north
a simdar system may drain into the Niger and Lake
Tchad : thus the Victoria and the Albert lakes, being
the two great reservoirs or sources of the Nile, may
be the first of a system of African equatorial lakes
fed by the northern and southern drainage of the
mountain range, and supplying all the principal rivers
of Africa from the great equatorial rainfaU. The fact
of the centre of Africa at the Nile sources being
about 4,000 feet above the ocean, independently of
high mountains rising from that level, suggests that the
drainage of the Equator from the central and elevated
portion must find its way to the lower level and reach
the sea. Wherever high mountain ranges exist, there
must also be depressions ; these situated in an equa
torial rainfall must receive the drainage from the high
lands and become lakes, the overflow of which must

form the sources of rivers, precisely as exemplified in
the som-ces of the Nile from the Victoria and the
Albert lakes.
The fact that Sir Roderick Murchison, as a geologist,
laid down a theory of the existence of a chain of lakes
upon an elevated plateau in Central Africa, which
theory has been now, in great measure confirmed by
actual inspection, induces me to quote an extract from
his address at the anniversary meeting of the Royal
Geographical Society, 23d May, 1864. In that address,
he expressed opinions upon the geological structure, and
the races of Central Africa, which preceded those that
I formed when at the Albert lake. It is with intense
interest that I have read the foUowing extract since my
return to England : —
" In former addresses, I suggested that the interior
mass and central portions of Africa constituting a great
plateau occupied by lakes and marshes, from which
the waters escaped by cracks or depressions in the
subtending older rocks, had been in that condition
during an enormously long period. I have recently been
enabled, through the apposite discovery of Dr. Kirk,
the companion of Livingstone, not only to fortify my
conjecture of 1852, but greatly to extend the inferences
concerning the long period of time during which the
central parts of Africa have remained in thefr present

condition, save their degradation by ordinary atmcf-
spheric agencies. My view, as given to this Society
in 1852, was mainly founded on the original and
admirable geological researches of Mr. Bain, in the
colony of the Cape of ' Good Hope. It was, that,
inasmuch as in the secondary or mesozoic age of
geologists, the northern interior of that country was
occupied by great lakes and marshes, as proved by the
fossil reptde discovered by Bain, and named Dicyno-
don by Owen, such it has remained for countless ages,
even up to the present day. The succeeding journeys
into the interior, of Livingstone, Thornton and Kirk,
Burton and Speke, and Speke and Grant, have all
tended to strengthen me in the belief that Southern
Africa has not undergone any of those great submarine
depressions which have so largely affected Europe, Asia,
and America, during the secondary, tertiary, and quasi
modern periods.
" The discovery of Dr. Kirk has confirmed my
conclusion. On the banks of an affluent of the Zam
besi, that gentleman coUected certain bones, apparently
carried down in watery drifts from inland positions,
which remains have been so fossilized as to have all
the appearance of antiquity which fossds of a tertiary
or older age usuaUy present. One of these is a portion
of the vertebral column and sacrum of a buffalo, undis-

tinguishable from that of the Cape buffiilo ; another
is a fragment of a crocodde, and another of a water-
tortoise, both undistinguishable from the forms of those
animals now living. Together with these, Dr. Kirk
found numerous bones of antelopes and other animals,
which, though in a fossil condition, all belonged, as he
assured me, to species now Hving in South Africa.
" On the other hand, none of our explorers, including
Mr. Bain, who has dihgently worked as a geologist,
have detected in the interior any limestones containing
marine fossd remains, which would have proved that
South Africa had, Hke other regions, been depressed
into oceanic conditions, and re -elevated. On the
contrary, in addition to old granitic and other igneous
rocks, all explorers find only either innumerable un
dulations of sandstones, schistose, and quartzose rocks,
or such tufaceous and ferruginous deposits as would
naturaUy occur in countries long occupied by lakes
and exuberant jungles, separated from each other by
sandy hills, scarcely any other calcareous rocks being
found, except tufas formed by the deposition of land-
springs. It is true that there are marine tertiary
formations on the coasts (around the Cape Colony,
near the mouth of the Zambesi opposite Mozambique,
and again on the coasts of Mombas opposite Zanzibar),
ancl that these have been raised up into low -coast

ranges, foUowed by rocks of igneous origin. But in
penetrating into the true interior, the traveller takes a
final leave of all such formations ; and in advancing to
the heart of the continent, he traverses a vast region
which, to all appearance, has ever been under terrestrial
and lacustrine conditions only. Judging, indeed, from
all the evidences as yet collected, the interior of South
Africa has remained in that condition since the period
of the secondary rocks of geologists ! Yet, whilst none
of our countrymen found any evidences of old marine
remains, Captain Speke brought from one of the ridges
which lay between the coast and the lake Victoria
N'yanza a fossil shell, which, though larger in size,
is undistinguishable from the Achatina perdix now
flourishing in South Africa. Again, whilst Bain found
fossil plants in his reptiliferous strata north of the
Cape, ancl Livingstone and Thornton discovered coal
in sandstone, with fossd plants, like those of our old
coal of Em-ope and America, — yet both these mesozoic
and palaeozoic remains are terrestrial, and are not
associated with rilarine limestones, indicative of those
oscUlations of the land which are so common in other
countries. '" It is further to be observed, that the surface of
this vast interior is entirely exempt from the coarse
superficial drift that encumbers so many countries, as

glaciers or great torrential streams have descended.
In this respect, it is also equaUy unlike those plains of
Germany, Poland, and Northern Russia, which were
sea-bottoms when floating icebergs melted and dropped
the loads of stone which they were transporting from
Scandinavia and Lapland.
" In truth, therefore, the inner portion of Southern
Africa is, in this respect, as far as I know, geologically
unique in the long conservation of ancient terrestrial
conditions. This inference is further supported by the
concomitant absence, throughout the larger portion of
aU this vast area, i.e. south of the Equator, of any
of those volcanic rocks which are so often associated
with oscUlations of the terra firma*
" With the exception of the true volcanic hdls of the
Cameroons recently described by Burton, on the west

possibly may advance southwards towards the Gaboon

of Africa south of the Equator. If the elements for

precisely that on which we should expect to find such
volcanic vents, if we judge by the analogy of all
volcanic regions where the habitual igneous eruptions
are not distant from the sea, or from great internal
masses of water. The absence, then, both on the coasts
and in the interior, of any eruptive rocks which can
have been thrown up under the atmosphere since the
period when the tertiary rocks began to be accumulated,
is in concurrence with all the physical data as yet
got together. These demonstrate that, although the
geologist finds here none of those characters of Htholo-
gical structure and curiously diversified organic remains,^
which enable him to fix the epochs of succession in
the crust of the earth in other quarters of the globe,
the interior of South Africa is unquestionably a grand
type of a region which has preserved its ancient ter
restrial conditions during a very long period, unaffected
by any changes except those which are dependent on
atmospheric and meteoric influences.

articles are of the same age as the fossd bones. In
other words, we stiU require from Africa the same
proofs of the existence of links which bind together
the sciences of Geology and Archaeology which have
recently been developed in Europe. Now, if the un
questioned works of man should be found to be coeval
with the remains of fossilized existing animals in
Southern Africa, the traveUed geographer, who has con
vinced himself of the ancient condition of its surface,
must admit, however unwillingly, that although the
black man is of such very remote antiquity, he has
been very stationary in civilization and in attaining
the arts of Hfe, if he be compared with the Caucasian,

with the aborigines of Polynesia."*

CHAPTER X.

THE BLACK ANTELOPE.

We continued our voyage down the Nile, at times
scudding along with a fair wind and stream, when a
straight portion of the river aUowed our men respite
from the oars. This was the termination of the dry
season, in this latitude 7° (end of March) ; — thus, al
though the river was nearly level with the banks, the
marshes werertolerabjy firm, and in the dryer portions
the reeds had been burnt off by the natives. In one
of these cleared places we descried a vast herd of
aritelopes, numbering several thousands. The males
were black, and carried fine horns, while the females
Were reddish-brown and without horns. Never having
shot this species, I landed from the boat, which I
ordered to wait in a sheltered nook, while, accom
panied by the boy Saat and Richarn, I took the little
Fletcher 24 rifle and commenced a stalk.
The antelopes did not evince thefr usual shyness,

and with a tolerable amount of patience I succeeded
in getting within about 120 paces of two splendid
black bucks that were separated from the herd ; — a
patch of half-burnt reeds afforded a good covering
point. The left-hand buck was in a good position for
a shoulder shot, standing with his flank exposed, but
with his head turned towards me. At the crack of the
rifle he sprang upon his hind legs, — gave two or three
convulsive bounds, and feU. His companion went off
at fuU speed, and the left-hand barrel unfortunately
broke his hind leg as the half-burnt reeds hindered a
correct aim. Reloading, while my men bled the dead
buck, I fired a long shot at the dense mass of antelopes
who were now in fuU retreat at about 600 yards
distance crowded together in thousands. I heard, or
fancied I heard, the bad strike some object, and as the
herd passed on, a reddish object remained behind that
we could hardly distinguish, but on nearer approach I
found a doe lying dead — she had been by chance

distance. The game being at full speed in retreat, my
sport would have been over had we not at that moment
heard shouts and yeds exactly ahead of the vast herd
of antelopes. At once they halted, and we perceived
a number of natives, armed with spears and bows, who
had intercepted the herd in their retreat, and who now

turned them by their shouts exactly towards us. The
herd came on at full speed; but seeing us, they slightly
altered thefr line, and rushed along, thundering over
the ground almost in single file, thus occupying a con
tinuous Hne of about half a mile in length. Running
towards them at right angles for about1 a quarter of a
mde, I at length arrived at a white ant-hid about ten
feet high ; behind this I took my stand within about
seventy yards of the string of antelopes that were
filing by at fuU galop. . I waited for a buck with fine
horns. Several passed, but I observed better; heads iri
their rear ; — they came bounding along. " Crack ! '•
went the rifle ; and a fine buck pitched upon his head;
Again the little Fletcher spoke, and down went another
within ten yards of the first. " A spare gun, Richarn ! "
and Oswell's Purdey was slipped into my hand. " Only
one barrel is loaded," said Richarn. I saw a splendid buck
coming along with a doe by his side ; — she protected
him from the shot as they came on at right angles with
the gun ; but knowing that the ball would go through
her and reach him on. the other side, I fired at her
shoulder, — she fell dead to the shot, but he went off
scatheless. I now found that Richarn had loaded the
.gun with twenty mould shot instead of ball ; — these
were confined in a cartridge, and had kiUed her on the
spot.

I had thus bagged five antelopes ; and cutting off
the heads of the bucks we left the bodies for the
natives,- who were anxiously watching us from a
distance, but afraid to approach. The antelope first
shot that was nearer to the boat, we dragged on board,
with the assistance of ten or twelve men. The buck
was rather larger than an average donkey ; — colour,
black, with a white patch across the withers ; — a
white crown to the head ; white round the eyes ;
chest black, but beUy white ; the horns about two
feet four inches long, "and bending gracefuUy back
wards. A few days after this incident we arrived at the
junction of the Bahr el Gazal, and turning sharp to the
east, we looked forward to arriving at the extraordinary
obstruction that since our passage in 1863 had dammed
the White Nde.
There was considerable danger in the descent of the
river upon nearing this pecuUar dam, as the stream
plunged below it by a subterranean channel with a
rush Hke a cataract. A large diahbiah laden with ivory
had been carried beneath the dam on her descent from
Gondokoro in the previous year, and had never been
seen afterwards. I ordered the reis to have the anchor
in readiness, and two powerful hawsers ; should we
arrive in the evening, he was to secure the vessel to

330 ARRIVE AT THE NILE DAM. [chap. x.
the bank, and not to attempt the passage through the
canal until the following morning.
We anchored about half a mile above the dam.
This part of the Nile is boundless marsh, portions
of which were at this season terra firma. The river
ran from west to east ; the south bank was actual
ground covered with mimosas, but to the north and
west the flat marsh covered with high reeds was inter
minable. At daybreak we manned the oars and floated down
the rapid stream. In a few minutes we heard the rush
of water, and we saw the dam stretching across the
river before us. The marsh being firm, our men imme
diately jumped out on the left bank and' manned the
hawsers — one fastened from the stern, the other from
the bow ; this arrangement prevented the boat from
turning broadside on to the dam, by which accident
the shipwrecked. diahbiah had been lost. As we ap
proached the dam I perceived the canal or ditch that
had been cut by the crews of the vessels that had
ascended the river ; it was about ten feet wide, and
would barely allow the passage of our diahbiah. This
canal was already choked with masses of floating vege
tation and natural rafts of reeds and mud that the
river carried with it, the accumulation of which had
originaUy formed the dam.

chap, x.] CHARACTER OF THE OBSTRUCTION. 331
Having secured the vessel by carrying out an anchor
astern and burying it on the marsh, whde a rope fas
tened from the bow to the high reeds kept her stern to
the stream, aU hands jumped into the canal and com
menced dragging out the entangled masses of weeds,
reeds, ambatch wood, grass, and mud that had choked
the entrance. Half a day was thus passed, at the expi
ration of which time we towed our vessel safely into the
ditch, where she lay out of danger. It was necessary
to discharge aU cargo from the boat, in order to reduce
her draught of water. This tedious operation completed,
and many bushels of corn being pded upon mats spread
upon the reeds beaten flat, we endeavoured to prish
her along the canal. Although the obstruction was
annoying, it was a most interesting object.
The river had suddenly disappeared ; there was
apparently an end to the White Nde. The dam was
about three-quarters of a mde wide ; it was perfectly
firm, and was already overgrown with high reeds and
grass, thus forming a continuation of the surrounding
country. Many of the traders' people had died of the
plague at this spot during the delay of some weeks in
cutting the canal ; the graves of these dead were upon
the dam. The bottom of the canal that had been cut
through the dam was perfectly firm, composed of sand;
mud, and interwoven decaying Vegetation. The river

332 PASSAGE THROUGH THE DAM. [chap. x.
arrived with great force at the abrupt edge" of the
obstruction, bringing with it all kinds of trash and
large floating islands. None of these objects hitched
against the edge, but the instant they struck, they
dived under and disappeared. It was in this manner
that the Vessel had been lost — having missed the
uarrow entrance to the canal, she had struck the dam
stem on ; the force of the current immediately turned
her broadside against the obstruction ; the floating
islands and masses of vegetation brought down by the
river were heaped against her, and heeling over on her
side she was sucked boddy under and carried beneath
the dam ; her crew had time to save themselves by
leaping upon the firm barrier that had wrecked thefr
ship. The boatmen told me that dead hippopotami
had been found on the other side, that had been carried
under the dam and drowned
Two days' hard work from morning tiU night brought
us through the eanaL and we once more found our
selves on the open Nde on the other side of the dam.
The river was in that spot perfectly clean, not a vestige
of floating vegetation could be seen upon its waters ;
in its subterranean passage it had passed through a
natural sieve, leaving aU foreign matter behind to add
to the bulk of the already stupendous work.

days two or three of our men had been complaining of
severe headache, giddiness, and violent pains in the
spine and between the shoulders. I had been anxious
when at Gondokoro concerning the vessel, as many
persons had died on board of the plague during the
voyage from Khartoum. The men assured me that the
most fatal symptom was violent bleeding from the nose ;
in such cases no one had been known to recover. One
of the boatmen, who had been ailing for some days,
suddenly went to the side of the vessel and hung his
head over the river ; his nose was bleeding !
Another of my men, Yaseen, was dl ; his uncle, my
vakeeL came to me with a report that " his nose was
bleeding violently !" Several other men feU dl : they
lay helplessly about the deck in low muttering delfrium,
their eyes as yeUow as orange-peeL In two or three
days the vessel was so horribly offensive as to be
unbearable ; the plague had broken out ! We floated
past the river Sobat junction ; the wind was fair from
the south, thus fortunately we in the stem were to
windward ofthe crew. Vaseen died ; he was one who
had bled at the nose. We stopped to bury him. The
funeral hastily arranged, we again set sail. Mahommed

more we set sad and hurried down the Nde. Several

appeared. I had given each man a strong dose of
calomel at the commencement of the disease ; I could
do nothing more, as my medicines were exhausted.
All night we could hear the sick, muttering and raving
in delirium, but from years of association with dis
agreeables we had no fear of the infection. One morn
ing the boy Saat came to me with his head bound up,
and complained of severe pain in the back and limbs,
with all the usual symptoms of plague : in the after
noon I saw him leaning over the ship's side ; his nose
was bleeding violently! At night he was delirious.
On the following morning he was raving, and on the
vessel stopping to coUect firewood he threw himself
into the river to cool the burning fever that consumed
him. His eyes were suffused with blood, which, blended
with a yeUow as deep as the yolk of egg, gave a horrible
appearance to his face, that was already so drawn and
changed as to be hardly recognised. Poor Saat ! the
faithful boy that we had adopted, and who had formed
so bright an exception to the dark character of his race,
was now a victim to this horrible disease. He was a
fine strong lad of nearly fifteen, and he now lay help
lessly on his mat, and cast wistful glances at the face of
his mistress as she gave him a cup of cold water mixed
with a few lumps of sugar that we had obtained from
the traders at Gondokoro.

chap. x.J ENTERTAINED BY OSMAN BEY. 335
We arrived at Fashoder, in the ShiUook country,
where the Egyptian Government had formed a camp of
a thousand men to take possession of the country. We
were well received and hospitably entertained by Osman
Bey, to whom our thanks are due for the first civilized
reception after years of savagedom. At Fashoder we
procured lentUs, rice, and dates, which were to us great
luxuries, and would be a blessing to the plague-smitten
boy, as we could now make some soup. Goats we had
purchased in the Shir country for molotes (iron hoes)
that we had received in exchange for corn at Gondo
koro from Koorshid's agent who was responsible for the
supply I Had left in depot. We left Fashoder, and
continued our voyage towards Khartoum.
Saat grew worse and worse : nothing would relieve
the unfortunate boy from the burning torture of that
frightful disease. He never slept, but night and day
he muttered in delirium, breaking the monotony of his
malady by occasionaUy howling like a wdd animal.
Richarn won my heart by his careful nursing of the
boy, who had been his companion through years of
hardship. We arrived at the viUage of Wat Shely, only
three days from Khartoum. Saat was dying. The
night passed, and I expected that all would be over
before sunrise ; but as morning dawned a change had
taken place, — the burning fever had left him, and

although raised blotches had broken out upori his chest
and various parts of his body, he appeared much
better. - We now gave him stimulants ; a tea-spoonful
of araki that we had bought at Fashoder was adminis
tered every ten minutes on a lump of sugar. This he
crunched in his mouth, whUe he gazed at my wife
with an expression of affection, but he could 'not speak.
I had him well washed, and dressed in clean clothes,
that had been kept most carefuUy during the voyage,
to be worn on our entree to Khartoum. He was laid
down to sleep upon a clean mat, and my wife gave him
a lump of sugar to moisten his mouth and to relieve
his thickly-furred tongue. His pulse was very weak,
and his skin cold. "Poor Saat," said my wife, "his
life hangs upon a thread. We must nurse him most
.carefully ; should he have a relapse, nothing wdl save
him." An hour passed, and he slept. Karka, the fat,
good-natured slave woman, quietly went to his side :
gently taking him by the ankles and knees, she stretched
his legs into a straight position, and laid his arms
parallel with his sides. She then covered his face with
a cloth, one of the few rags that we still possessed.
" Does he sleep stiU V we asked. The tears ran down
the cheeks of the savage but good-hearted Karka, as
she sobbed, " He is dead ! "
We stopped the boat. It was a sandy shore ; the

banks were high, and a clump of mimosas grew above
high water-mark. It was there that we dug his grave.
My men worked silently and sadly, for all loved Saat :
he had been so good and true, that even their hard
hearts had learnt to respect his honesty. We laid him
in his grave on the desert shore, beneath the grove of
trees. Again the sail was set, and, fiUed by the breeze,
it carried us away froin the dreary spot where we had
sorrowfuUy left aU that was good and faithful.' It
was a happy end — most merciful, as he had been taken
from a land of iniquity in aU the purity of a child con
verted from Paganism to Christianity. He had Hved
and died in our service a good Christian. Our voyage
was nearly over, and we looked forward to home
and friends, but we had stUl fatigues before us :
poor Saat had reached his home and rest. Two
faithful foUowers we had buried, — Johann Schmidt
at the commencement of the voyage, and Saat at its
termination. A few mdes from this spot, a head wind delayed us
for several days. . Losing patience, I engaged camels
from the Arabs ; and riding the whole day, we reached
Khartoum about half an hour after sunset on the 5th
of May, 1865.
On the foUowing morning we were welcomed by the
entire European population of Khartoum, to whom are

due my warmest thanks for many kind attentions.
We were kindly offered a house by Monsieur Lombrosio,
the manager of the Khartoum branch of the " Oriental
and. Egyptian Trading Company."
I now heard the distressing news of the death of my
poor friend Speke. I could not realize the truth of
this melancholy report untd I read the details of his
fatal accident in the appendix of a French translation
of his work. It was but a sad consolation that I could
confirm his discoveries, and bear witness to the tenacity
and perseverance with which he had led his party
through the untrodden path of Africa to the first Nde
source. This being the close of the expedition, I wish
it to be distinctly understood how thoroughly I support
the credit of Speke and Grant for their discovery of
the first and most elevated source of the Nile in the
great Victoria N'yanza. Although I call the river be
tween the two lakes the " Somerset," as it was named
by Speke upon the map he gave to me, I must repeat
that it is positively the Victoria Nile, and the name
" Somerset " is only used to distinguish it, in my de
scription, from the entire Nile that issues from the
Albert N'yanza.
Whether the volume of water added by the latter
lake be greater than that suppHed by the Victoria,
the fact remains unaltered : the Victoria is the highest

and first-discovered source ; the Albert is the second
source, but the entire reservoir of the Nile waters.
I use the term source as applying to each reservoir
as a head or main starting-point of the river. I am
quite aware that it is a debated point among geo
graphers, whether a lake can be caUed a source, as
it owes its origin to one or many rivers ; but, as the
innumerable torrents of the mountainous regions of
Central Africa pour into these great reservoirs, it would
be impossible to give preference to any individual
stream. Such a theory would become a source of great
confusion, and the Nde sources might remain for ever
undecided ; a thousand future traveUers might return,
each with his particular source in his portfolio, some
stream of insignificant magnitude being pushed forward
as the true origin of the Nde.
I found few letters awaiting me at Khartoum : all
the European population of the place had long ago
given us up for lost. It was my wish to start without
delay direct for England, but there were extraordinary
difficulties in this wretched country of the Soudan. A
drought of two years had created a famine throughout
the land, attended by a cattle and camel plague, that
had destroyed so many camels that all commerce was
stagnated. No merchandise could be transported from
Khartoum ; thus no purchases could be made by the

was ruined.
' The plague, or a malignant typhus, had run riot in
Khartoum : out of 4,000 black troops, only a remnant.
below 400 remained alive ! This frightful malady, that,
had visited our boat, had revelled in the filth and
crowded alleys of the Soudan capital.
The Blue Nde was so low that even the noggors

river. .Thus, the camels being dead, and the river im
passable, no corn could be brought from Sennaar and

unable to procure either camels or boats, I was com

sufficiently to enable us to pass the cataracts between
that town and Berber.'55
We remained two months at Khartoum. During
this time we were subjected to intense heat and con
stant dust-storms, attended with a general plague of
boils. Verily, the plagues of Egypt remain to this day
in the Soudan. On the 26th June, we had the most

extraordinary dust-storm that had ever been seen by
the inhabitants. I was sitting in the court-yard of my
agent's house at about 4.30 p.m. : there was no wind,
and the sun was as bright as usual in this cloudless
sky, when suddenly a gloom was cast over aU, — a dull
yeUow glare pervaded the atmosphere. Knowing that
this effect portended a dust-storm, and that the present
calm would be followed by a hurricane of wind, I rose
to go home, intending to secure the shutters^ Hardly
had I risen, when I saw approaching, from the S.W.
apparently, a soHd range of immense brown mountains,
high in air. So rapid was the passage of this extra
ordinary phenomenon, that in a few minutes we were
in actual pitchy darkness. At first there was no' wind,
and the pecuUar calm gave an oppressive character to
the event. We were in " a darkness that might be
felt." Suddenly the wind arrived, but not with the
violence that I had expected. There were two persons
with me, Michael Latfalla, my agent, and Monsieur
Lombrosio. So intense was the darkness, that we tried
to distinguish our hands placed close before our eyes ; —
not even an outHne could be seen. This lasted for
upwards of twenty minutes : it then rapidly passed
away, and the sun shone as before ; but we had. felt the
darkness that Moses had inflicted upon the Egyptians.

342 HORRIBLE SLAVE CARGO. Echap. x.
pressed by some of the European Powers to take
measures for the suppression of the . slave-trade : a
steamer had accordingly been ordered to capture all
vessels laden with this infamous cargo. Two vessels
had been seized and brought to Khartoum, containing
850 human beings! — packed together Hke anchovies,
the living and the dying festering together, and the
dead lying beneath them. European eye-witnesses
assured me that the disembarking of this frightful
cargo could not be adequately described. The slaves
were in a state of starvation, having had nothing to
eat for several days. They were landed in Khartoum ;
the dead and many of the dying were tied by the
ankles, and dragged along the ground by donkeys
through the streets. The most malignant typhus, or
plague, had been engendered among this mass of filth
and misery, thus closely packed together. Upon landing,
the women were divided by the Egyptian authorities
among the soldiers. These creatures brought the plague
to Khartoum, which, like a curse visited upon this
country of slavery and abomination, spread like a fire
throughout the town, and consumed the regiments
that had received this horrible legacy from the dying
cargo of slaves. Among others captured by the authori
ties on a charge of slave-trading, was an Austrian
subject, who was then in the custody of the Consul. A

French gentleman, Monsieur Garnier, had been sent to
Khartoum by the French Consulate of Alexandria on
a special inquiry into the slave-trade ; he was devoting
himself to the subject with much energy.
WhUe at Khartoum I happened to find Mahommed
Her! the vakeel of Chenooda's party, who had insti
gated my men to mutiny at Latooka, and had taken
my deserters into his employ. I had promised to
make an example of this feUow ; I therefore had him
arrested, and brought before the Divan. With extreme
effrontery, he denied having had anything to do with
the affair, adding to his denial aU knowledge of the
total destruction of his party, and of my mutineers by
the Latookas. Having a crowd of witnesses in my
own men, and others that I had found in Khartoum
who had belonged to Koorshid's party at that time, his
barefaced He was exposed, and he was convicted. I
determined that he should be punished, as an example
that would insure respect to any future English
traveUer in those regions. My men, and aU those with
whom I had been connected, had been accustomed to
rely most impHcitly upon aU that I had promised, and
the punishment of this man had been an expressed
determination. I went to the Divan and demanded that he should
be flogged. Omer Bey was then Governor of the

Soudan, in the place of Moosa Pasha deceased. He
sat upon the Divan, in the large hall of justice by the
river. . Motioning me to take a seat by his side, and
handing me his pipe, he caUed the officer in waiting,
and gave the necessary orders. In a few minutes the
prisoner Avas led into the hall, attended by eight
soldiers. One man carried a strong pole about seven
feet long, in the centre of which was a double chain,
riveted through in a loop. The prisoner was imme
diately thrown down with his face to the ground, while
two men stretched out his arms and sat upon them ;
his feet were then placed within the loop of the chain,
and the pole being twisted round untU firmly secured, it
was raised from the ground sufficiently to expose the
soles of the feet. Two men with powerful hippo
potamus whips stood, one on either' side. The prisoner
thus secured, the order was given. The. whips were
most .scientifically appHed, and after the first five dozen,
the slave-hunting scoundrel howled most lustily for
mercy. How often had he flogged unfortunate slave
women to excess, and what murders had that wretch
committed, who now howled for mercy? I begged
Omer Bey to stop the punishment at 150 lashes, and to
explain to him publicly in the Divan, that he was thus
punished for attempting to thwart the expedition of an
English traveller, by instigating my escort" to mutiny.

chap, x.] NEARLY WRECKED. 345
This affair over — aU my accounts paid — and my
men dismissed with thefr hands fuU of money, — I was
ready to start for Egypt. The Nile rose sufficiently to
enable the passage of the Cataracts, and on the 30th
June we took leave of aU friends in Khartoum, and of
my very kind agent, Michael LatfaUa, well known as
Halhl el Shami, who had most generously cashed all
my bills on Cairo, without charging a fraction of
exchange. On the morning of the 1st July, we saUed
from Khartoum to Berber.
On approaching the fine basalt lulls through which
the river passes during its course from Khartoum, I
was surprised to see the great Nile contracted to a
trifling width of from eighty to a hundred and twenty
yards. WaUed by high cUffs of basalt upon either
side, the vast volume of the NUe flows grandly through
this romantic pass, the water boiling up in curHng
eddies, showing that rocky obstructions exist in its
profound depths below.
Our voyage was very nearly terminated at the
passage of the . Cataracts. Many skeletons of- wrecked
vessels lay upon the rocks in various places : as we
were flying along in full saU before a heavy gale of
wind, descending a cataract, we struck upon a sand
bank, fortunately not upon a rock, or we should have
gone to pieces like a glass bottle. The tremendous

force of the stream, funning at the rate of about ten or
twelve mdes per hour, immediately drove the vessel
broadside upon the bank. About sixty yards below us
was a ridge of rocks, upon which it appeared certain
that we must be driven should we quit the bank upon
which we were stranded. The reis and crew, as usual
in such cases, lost their heads. I emptied a large
waterproof portmanteau, and tied it together with
ropes, so as to form a life-buoy for my wife and
Richarn, neither of whom could swim; the maps,
journals, and observations, I packed in an iron box,
which I fastened with a tow line to the portmanteau.
It appeared that we were to wind up the expedition
with shipwreck, and thus lose my entfre collection of
hunting spoils. . Having completed the preparations
for escape, I took command of the vessel, and sdenced
the chattering crew.
My first order was to lay out an anchor up stream.
This was done : the water was shadow, and the great
weight of the anchor, carried on the shoulders of two
men, enabled them to resist the current, and to wade
hip-deep about forty yards up the stream upon the
sand-bank. Thus secured, I ordered the crew to haul upon the
cable. The great force of the current bearing upon
the broadside of the vessel, whde her head was an-

chored up stream, bore her gradually round. AU hands
were now employed in clearing away the sand, and
deepening a passage : loosening the sand with then-
hands and feet, the powerful rapids carried it away.
For five hours we remained in this position, the boat
cracking and hah0 fiUed with water : however, we
stopped the leak caused by the strain upon her
timbers, and having, after much labour, cleared a
channel in the narrow sand-bank, the moment arrived
to shp the cable, hoist the sad, and trust to the heavy
gale of wind from the west to clear the rocks, that lay
within a few yards of us to the north. " Let go !" and,
aU being prepared, the sad was loosened, and filling
in the strong gale with a loud report, the head of the
vessel swung round with the force of wind and stream.
Away we flew ! — for an instant we grated on some
hard substance : we stood upon the deck, watching the
rocks exactly before us, with the rapids roaring loudly
around our boat as she rushed upon what looked Hke
certain destruction. Another moment, and we passed
within a few inches of the rocks within the boiling- ^
surf. Hurrah, we are aU right ! We swept by the
danger, and flew along the rapids, hurrying towards
Old England.
We arrived at' Berber, the spot from which we had
started upwards of four years ago for our Atbara

expedition. Here we were most hospitably received
by Monsieur and Madame Laffargue a, French gentle-'
man and his charming wife, who had for many years
been residents in the Soudan. It is with feelings of
gratitude that I express my thanks to all Frenchmen
that I have met in those wdd countries, for courtesies
and attention, that were appreciated by me Hke un
expected flowers in a desert. I can only hope that
Frenchmen may, when in need, receive the same kind
ness from my countrymen, when traveUing in lands
far distant from la belle France.
I determined upon the Red Sea route to Egypt,
instead of passing the horrible Korosko desert during
the hot month of August. After some delay I pro
cured camels, and started east for Souakim, from
whence I hoped to procure a steamer to Suez.
This route from Berber is not the usual caravan
road : the country was in rather a disturbed state,
owing to the mutiny of all the black troops in the
Egyptian service in the Taka province ; and the Haden-
dowa Arabs, who are at no time the best of their race,
were very excited. The first eight days' journey are
devoid of water, except at two stations,— the route
being desert. Our party consisted of my wife, Richar^
Achmet, and Zeneb ; the latter was a six-foot girl of
the Dinka tribe, with whom Richarn had fallen in love

chap, x.] A ROW IN THE DESERT. 349
and married during our sojourn at Khartoum. Zeneb
was a good girl, rather pretty, as strong as a giraffe, and
a good cook ; a very valuable acquisition for Richarn.
Her husband, who had been my faithful foUower, was
now a rich man, being the owner of thirty napoleons,
the balance of his wages. Achmet was an Egyptian
servant, whom I had recently engaged in Khartoum.
I had also offered a Swiss missionary the protection
of our party.
One day, during the heat of noon, after a long march
in the burning sun through a treeless desert, we descried
a solitary tree in the distance, to which we hurried as
to a friend. Upon arrival, we found its shade occupied
by a number of Hadendowa Arabs. Dismounting from
our camels, we requested them to move and to give
place for our party — as a tree upon the desert is like a
weU of water, to be shared by every traveUer. Far
from giving the desired place, they most insolently
refused to aUow us to share the tree. Upon Richarn
attempting to take possession, he was rudely pushed
on one side,- and an Arab drew his knife. Achmet had
a coorbatch (hippopotamus whip) in his hand, that he
had used on his camel ; the act of raising this to
threaten the Arab who had drawn his knife, was the
signal for hostiHties. Out flashed the broadswords
from their sheaths ! and the headman of the party

350- COMBAT WITH THE ARABS, [chap. x.
aimed a well-intended cut at my head. Parrying the
cut with my sun umbreUa, I returned with a quick
thrust directly in the mouth, the point of the peaceful
weapon penetrating to his throat with such force that
he fell upon his back. Almost at the same moment I
had to parry another cut from one of the crowd that
smashed my umbrella completely, and left me with my
remaining weapons, a stout Turkish pipe- stick about four
feet long, and my fist. Parrying with the stick, thrust
ing in return at the face, and hitting sharp with the
left hand, I managed to keep three or four of the party
on and off upon their backs, receiving a slight cut with
a sword upon my left arm in countering a blow which
just grazed me as I knocked down the owner, and dis
armed him. My wife picked up the sword, as I had
no time to stoop, and she stood well at bay with her
newly-acquired weapon that a disarmed Arab wished
to wrest from her, but dared not close with the naked
blade. I had had the fight all my own way, as, being
beneath the tree (the boughs of which were very near
the ground), the Arabs, who do not understand the Use
of the point, were unable to use their swords, as their
intended cuts were intercepted by the branches. Vigorous
thrusting and straight hitting cleared the tree, and the
party were scattered right and left, followed up by
Richarn and Achmet, armed with double-barrelled



## p. 351 (#385) ############################################

CHAP. x.] " BRAVO, ZENEB !" 351
rifles. I was determined to disarm the whole party, if
possible. One of the Arabs, armed with a lance, rushed
up to attack Richarn from behind ; but Zeneb was of
the warlike Dinka tribe, and having armed herself with
the hard wood handle of the axe, she went into the
row Hke " Joan of Arc," and hastening to the rescue of
Richarn, she gave the Arab such a whack upon the
head that she knocked him down on the spot, and
seizing his lance she disarmed him. Thus armed, she
rushed into the thickest of the fray.
" Bravo, Zeneb ! " I could not help shouting. Seizing
a thick stick that had been dropped by one of the
Arabs, I caUed Richarn and our Httle party together,
and attacking the few Arabs who stiU offered resistance,
they were immediately knocked down and disarmed.
The leader of the party who had been the first to draw
his sword, and had received a mouthful of umbreUa,
had not moved from the spot where he feU, but amused
himself with coughing and spitting. I now ordered
him to be bound, and threatened to tie him to my'
camel's tad and lead him a prisoner to the Governor
of Souakim, unless he called aU those of his" party who
had run away. They, were now standing at a distance
in the desert, and I insisted upon the delivery of
their weapons. Being thoroughly beaten and cowed,
he conferred with those whom we had taken prisoners,



## p. 352 (#386) ############################################

352 DISARM THE ARAB'S. [chap. x.
and the affair ended by aU the arms being delivered
up. We counted six swords, eleven lances, and a heap
of knives, the number of which I forget.
I ordered the entire party to stand in a line ; and I
gave them their choice, whether the ringleaders would
receive a flogging from me, or whether I should tie
them to the tails of camels and lead them to the Turkish
Governor of Souakim ? They immediately chose the
former ; and, caUing them from the rank, I ordered
them to He down on the ground to receive punishment.
They submitted like dogs ; Richarri and Achmet
stood over them with their whips, ready for the word.
At this moment an old white-headed Arab of my
caravan came to me : kneeling down, he stroked my
beard with his dirty hands, and implored pardon for
the offenders. Thoroughly understanding the Arab
character, I replied, " They are miserable sons of dogs,
and thefr swords are like the feathers of a fowl ; they
deserve flogging, but when a white head asks for
pardon, it should be granted. God is merciful, and we
are aU his children." Thus was the affair ended to the
satisfaction of our side. I broke aU the lances into
fragments upon a rock, — ordered Zeneb to make a fire
with the wood of the handles, to boil some coffee-; and
tying the swords into a bundle, we packed the lance-
heads and knives in a basket, with the understanding



## p. 353 (#387) ############################################

chap, x.] CROSS THE MOUNTAINS. 353
that they should be dehvered to their owners on our
arrival at the last weU, after which point there would be
water. on the route every day. From that place, there
would be no fear of our camels being stolen, and of
our being deserted in the desert.
On arrival at the well a few days later, I delivered
the weapons to thefr owners as promised, they having
foUowed our party. Souakim is about 275 mUes from
the Nde at Berber. At Kokreb, about half-way, we
entered the chain of mountains that extends from Suez
paraUel with the Red Sea to the south ; many portions
of this chain are four or five thousand feet above the
sea-level. The mountains were exceedingly beautiful,
their precipitous sides of barren rock exhibiting superb
strata of red and grey granite, with vast masses of
exquisite red and green porphyry. Many hills were
of basalt, so black, that during an entire day's journey
the face of the country appeared luce a vast desert of
coal, in broken hills and blocks strewed over the surface
of the ground. Kokreb was a lovely oasis beneath the
high mountains, with a forest of low mimosas in full
leaf, and a stream running from the mountains, the
produce of a recent storm. Throughout this country
there are no rivers that should be noticed on a map, as
the torrents are merely the effects of violent storms,
which, falling upon the mountains' several times during

354 FIRST VIEW OF THE SEA. [chap, x.'
the rainy season from June to the end of August, tear
their boisterous way along their stony course and dry
up in a few hours, becoming exhausted in the sand of
the deserts. For some days our course lay along a deep
ravine between stupendous cliffs ; this was the bed of
a torrent, that, after heavy storms, flowed through the
mountains, inclining to the east; in this were pools
of most beautifuUy clear water. In many places the
nooks among the cliffs were fringed with lovely green
trees. It was extraordinary to observe the activity of
the camels in climbing the most difficult passes, and in
picking thefr way among the rocks and stones that
obstructed the route. In many places camels might
be seen grazing upon the green mimosa bushes, that
growing among the rocks high upon the mountains
had tempted the animals into places that I should not
have beheved they could have reached.
After a journey of twenty-four days from the Nile
at Berber, we emerged from the mountain-pass, and
from the elevated .embouchure we obtained a sudden
and most welcome view of the Red Sea. We now
quickly descended : the heat increased every hour ; and
after a long day's march, we slept within a few miles
of Souakim. On the following ^ morning we entered
the town.
Souakim is a considerable town ; the houses are all

buUt of coral. The principal dweUings, and the custom
house and Government offices are situated on an island
ia the harbour. We were received with much atten
tion by the Governor, Moomtazze Bey, who very
kindly offered us a house. The heat was frightful, the
thermometer 115° Fahr., and in some houses 120°.
There is no doubt that Souakim should be the port
for aU exports and imports for the Soudan provinces.
Were a Hne of steamers estabUshed from Suez, to caU
regularly at Souakim, at a moderate freight, it would
become a most prosperous town, as the geographical
position marks it as the nucleus for all trade with the
interior. At present there is no regularity : the only
» steamers that touch at Souakim are those belonging to
the Abdul Azziz Company, that trade between Suez
and Jedda. Although advertised for distinct periods,
they only visit Souakim when they think proper, and
their rates are most exorbitant.
There was no steamer upon our arrival. After wait
ing in intense heat for about a fortnight, the Egyptian
thirty-two gun steam frigate, Ibrahvmeya, arrived with
a regiment of Egyptian troops, under Giaffer Pasha, to
queU the mutiny of the black troops at Kassala, twenty
days' march in the interior. The General Giaffer Pasha,
and Mustapha Bey the captain of the frigate, gave us
an entertainment on board in Eriglish style, in honour

of the completion of the NUe discovery. Giaffer Pasha
most kindly placed the frigate at our disposal to convey.
us to Suez, and both he and Mustapha Bey endeavoured
in every way to. accommodate us. For their extreme
courtesy I take this opportunity of making niy acknow
ledgment. Orders for sading had been received, but suddenly a
steamer was signalled as arriving : this was a transport
with troops. As she was to return immediately to
Suez, I preferred the dirty transport rather than incur
a further delay. We started from Souakim, and in five
days' voyage we arrived at Suez. Landing from the
steamer, I once more found myself in an English hotel.
The spacious inner court was arranged as an open
conservatory ; in this was a bar for refreshments, with
" Allsopp's Pale Ale" on draught, with an ice accompani
ment. What an Elysium ! The beds had sheets and
pillow-cases ! neither of which I had possessed for
years. The hotel was thronged with passengers to India,
with rosy, blooming Enghsh ladies, and crowds of my
own countrymen. I felt inclined to talk to everybody.
Never was I so in love with my own countrymen and
women ; but they (I mean the ladies) all had large
balls of hair at the backs of their heads! What
an extraordinary change ! I _ called Richarn, my pet

savao-e from the heart of Africa, to admire them. " Now,
Richarn, look at them ! " I said. " What do you think
of the Enghsh ladies? eh, Richarn? Are they not
lovely ? "
"Wah IUahi!" exclaimed the astonished Richarn,
" they are beautiful ! What hair ! they are not Hke
the negro savages, who work other people's hair into
their own heads ; theirs is aU real — aU their own —
how beautiful !"
" Yes, Richarn," I repUed, " all their own !" This
was my first introduction to the " chignon."
We arrived at Cairo, and I estabUshed Richarn and .
his wife in a comfortable situation, as private servants
to Mr. Zech, the master of Sheppard's Hotel The cha
racter I gave him was one that I trust has done him
service: he had shown an extraordinary anaount of
moral courage in totaUy reforming from his original
habit of drinking. I left my old servant with a heart
too fuU to say good-bye ; a warm squeeze of his rough,
but honest black hand, and the whistle of the train
sounded, — we were off!
I had left Richarn, and none remained of my people.
The past appeared Hke a dream — the rushing sound of
the train renewed ideas of civUization. Had I reaUy
come from the Nde Sources ? It was no dream. A
witness sat before me ; a face stUl young, but bronzed

like an Arab with years of exposure to a burning sun ;
haggard and worn with toil and sickness, and shaded
with cares, happily now past ; the devoted companion
of my pilgrimage to whom I owed success and life —
my wife.
I had received letters from England, that had been
waiting at the British Consulate ; — the first I opened
informed me, that the Royal Geographical Society had
awarded me the Victoria Gold Medal, at a time when
they were unaware whether I was alive or dead, and
when the success of my expedition was unknown.
This appreciation of my exertions was the warmest
welcome that I could have received on my first entrance
into civilization after so many years of savagedom :. it
rendered the completion of the Nile sources doubly
grateful, as I had fulfilled the expectations that the
Geographical Society, had so generously expressed by
the presentation of their medal before my task was
done.

The above heights will be found to differ considerably
from those given by Mr. Baker in his letter, written from
Khartoum in May, 1865, and published in the Times newspaper
in June. This arises Irom Mr. Baker having corrected his
observations, whilst in the interior of Africa, from what have
since proved erroneous data : the above are the correct com
putations of the same observations.

Remarks on the Thermometer B. W. used by Mr. S. W. Baker in
determining Heights. By Staff-Commander C. George,
Curator of Maps, Royal Geographical Society.
This thermometer was one of the three supplied by the
Royal Geographical Society to Consul Petherick, in 1861, and
was made by Mr. .Casella.
At Gondokoro, in March, 1862, it was lent to Mr. Baker,
who made all his observations with it and brought it back
safe : it has, therefore, been in use about 4f years.
On November 9th, 1865, Mr. Baker returned it to the
Royal Geographical Society, and it was immediately taken
to Mr. Casella, who tested its accuracy by trying its boiling
point, in nearly the same manner as Mr. Baker had made
his observations. The result by two independent observers
was that the boiling point had increased in its reading by
0°'75 in 4f years, or 08-l 72 yearly. .



## p. 363 (#397) ############################################

APPENDIX. 363
On November 23d the thermometer was again tested by
Mr. Baker at the Kew Observatory. The observation was
made under the same conditions as those near the Albert
Nyanza, as nearly as it was possible to make it.* The result
gave the thermometer 0o-80 too much at the boiling-point.
The readings of the thermometer have, therefore, been too
much ; and by reducing the readings, it elevates all positions
at which observations were made.
Table No. 1. — In this Table the error obtained at Kew
Observatory has been treated like that of a chronometer, the
error being assumed increasing and regular.
Table No. 2 is to correct the height, computed by Mr.
Dunkin, using the quantity taken from Table No. 1.
Table No. 3 is the final result of the observations for
height, corrected for instrumental error.
