THE HINDUS.
[...] We have been particularly
struck with the following noble testimony to the power of the Gospel,
delivered by a native Teacher, of the name of Gungaram, when
on a Missionary tour in Gujerat with the Rev. W. Clarkson, of the
London Missionary Society, early in the present year—
"We do not want you to receive what we offer on our mere word. We
have tried the power of this medicine for the sin of the world, and, having
found it effectual to ourselves, offer it to you. Look at me. I was formerly
a great liar, and was always deceiving and telling lies in my trade.
I was also little conscious that in doing so I was committing great sin.
This word came to me. As I received it, and understood it, I learned to
hate lying. Still, I did not at once abandon it, as the habit was so
strong. But as I learned still more and more, and prayed more and
more, and knew the death of Christ for sin more and more thoroughly,
I was enabled to leave off the sin. I do not say that I am yet free from
the sin; but this I say, that if I lie I sincerely repent of it, and am made
very unhappy till I have obtained pardon. And so, likewise, with other
sins. I do not say that I am perfect; but I do say that I have actually
left off those sins which formerly I practised, so that if I were to do what
is sinful I should be rendered miserable.
"Now, I never learned purity from reading about Krishna's wicked
conduct, as recorded in the Shasters. I never learned to hate any sin,
from all my knowledge of the gods of India, but from this word. The
word of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of sinners, who died for us, I have
learned, and hope to go on learning till I shall be taken away from sin
altogether."
