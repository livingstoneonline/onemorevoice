DAY-SPRING IN THE FAR WEST.
Sketches of Mission Work in British North America.
III.—EXTENSION OF THE MISSION
WESTWARD.
[...]
In a letter dated August 19, 1871, Mr. Budd writes thus:—
The growing population of Devon, and the endeavours
of the people
towards improvement in temporal as well as spiritual matters, give me
full employment on the spot,
and leave little room for
visiting and seeing the Indians
at other places. We
see here new houses putting
up every year, the soil
ploughed up, the seed put
in, parks and fences rising
up here and there, until
very little land is left for
the cattle to graze upon.
All this spring I was delighted
to see them, each
one trying to break up his
own piece of land, and
planting his potatoes in it,
and now they have potatoes
growing up nicely, and there
is promise of a good harvest.
The people have effectually
put down the sale of any
spirituous liquors among
themselves, and now that
the law has passed forbidding
it, we trust we shall never
see any more of that soul-destroying
article of trade
among our people.
The Sunday services have
been regularly attended by
all the people when they are
at home. It is seldom that
all our people are at home
together. Most of the strong
and able go about hunting
during winter, leaving their
families sometimes, and at
other times taking them
with them. During the
summer months the strong
men are away tripping in
the boats; but as the population
is yearling increasing,
we still have plenty at home
who fill the church Sabbath
by Sabbath. I am always
particularly encouraged at
the Sunday duties; for I feel
that I am preaching to a
people that understand me.
The Sunday-school is not
less encouraging. Here we
have children and young
people attending, many of
them reading with fluency
the Word of God in their
own language. They manage
to read it in their own language
so much quicker than
in English, and of course at
once understand what they
are reading about. This and
the day-school I have to
conduct myself, with the
help of a young man whom
I am training for a teacher.
