  <h5 style="text-align:center;">INDIAN SNAKE-CATCHER.</h5>
  <p>A British-Guiana Missionary writes—</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">It has been my lot to witness, on more than one
    occasion, the effects of
    the bite of the labaria; and there is perhaps no person who has lived for
    years in the interior who has not been in imminent danger at times from
    the proximity of some of these creatures. I have, however, only heard
    of one instance in which a full-grown man has been seized by one of the
    boa species. This occurred in the swamps of the Akawini. The reptile,
    a large camudi, sprang upon him, and coiled round his body, confining
    one of his arms. Providentially, before it could master the other,
    his wife, who was near, handed him a knife, with which he inflicted a
    deep cut, causing the snake to quit him, and make its retreat. The
    Indians, also, once told me of a large camudi having been killed in a
    state of torpidity, which had just swallowed a boy of the Caribi nation.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">To any one who knows what destructive creatures
    abound in these
    forests, it is surprising that accidents of this kind do not more frequently
    occur. But the great characteristic of the Indian is caution, and his
    keen eye and acute hearing are constantly exercised by the nature of his
    situation. He displays a subtilty of artifice in capturing these reptiles
    equal to that which is usually assigned to the serpent himself. I have
    seen an Indian creep under a low bush on his hands and knees, and
    capture a kolokonaro by means of a noose, which he dropped over its
    head with a forked stick as it raised it to look at the intruder: the stick
    being then quickly placed on its neck, and the noose drawn tight, the
    reptile was hauled forth, and its capture completed. In this manner the
    Indians catch such snakes as they wish to preserve alive for sale. If the
    snake be not too large or venomous, the man grasps it tightly by the
    neck, and allows it to coil itself round his arm [see the engraving], until
    he is able to place it in secure confinement. The kolokonaro was only
    about five feet in length, but so thick and strong that the Indian who
    carried it was soon obliged to call for assistance, to remove the snake,
    and release his arm from its pressure. This species is beautifully marked
    with brown, orange, white, and other colours. It is sometimes called the
    <em>land</em>-camudi or boa, to distinguish it from the other camudi, which takes
    to the water, and is found in damp places. They both attain to a great size.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">Some of the larger snakes are said to attain to
    upwards of thirty feet
    in length. I never saw any near that size. The largest that I knew of
    was about twenty feet, and was captured by some of our Indians in a
    similar manner to that related above, while gorged with food. They
    then tied it to the stern of a canoe, and towed it through the water to
    the residence of a settler, to whom they disposed of it alive.<a href="#note1"
