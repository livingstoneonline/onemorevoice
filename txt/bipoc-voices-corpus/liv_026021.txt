TAMAHANA TE RAUPARAHA.
[...]
On April the 29th our ship came near the south of England, to the town
of Plymouth. When I saw England I was very happy. I thought it
was a very beautiful country. On May 1st I came to London in the
railway. I feared at first, for it went very, very quick. But after we
had gone some way my fear left me. I was happy to see the railway.
When I was in the railway my heart thought, "Where shall I go?" and
I prayed to God in my heart in the railway to lead me right. Mr.
Williams found a house for me to live in. On May the 6th I went to the
very great meeting in the large room. It was the first time I had seen
an English great meeting. I was happy at seeing it, and happy also
on thinking how I would tell my people about it. When I saw England
and London first I feared to lose my way—so many people, so many
houses; but after two weeks I did not fear. In the middle of May Mr.
Williams came to me to talk about my going to the college. I said,
"Oh! I should very much like to go to the college to learn the good
ways of God, and your language, that I may be able to talk to the
Committee about doing the work of God in New Zealand, my land."
On May the 15th I came to the college. This has been my home in
England, and I have been very happy, very happy indeed here. I have
seen and learned many things. My heart is very full of love to all my
dear friends in Christ in the college.
Many are the good works I have seen in your land, but I have seen
some bad ones also. I will tell them to you. One bad thing I have seen
is, the people who sell on Sunday in the streets, and some who do not
shut up their shops. I was very sorry to see it. If I had seen my own
people doing it, I should have turned over their baskets and sent them
away. I thought, "Why are not the chiefs of England strong to send
the policemen to stop those people in their bad ways?"
I will tell you another thing, also, that has made my heart very dark.
When I went to a church, I saw some candlesticks on the communion
table. My heart was frightened, for I had seen that thing before in a
Romish church in New Zealand. The Romans said it was the [sign of
the] Holy Spirit. I thought, "Oh, why should the Protestants keep
the things of the Romans? why should they not throw them all
away?" The Protestants say the Romans go wrong. When the Romans
see such things they will think, "Ah! the Protestants are coming
our way;" and many Protestants, also, will go to the Romans, for they
will think both ways are alike. New Zealanders did not pray to their
idols: they only looked at the things, to make them think of their gods.
I think that the Romans do just like the Maories used to do, with their
candles, and their pictures, and their images. I was sorry to see those
things, for I wish England to do right, to teach all the nations of the
world right; and when England goes wrong she will lead the other
people wrong. If I saw candlesticks in my church in New Zealand I
should throw them down. Why do not the English chiefs do so?
Now, my dear friends in Christ, that is all about those things. Now I
will tell you the thoughts of my heart. In the beginning, New Zealand
dwelt in darkness. The Maories did the works of darkness. But then
the light came, the darkness fled away before it, and we threw away our
bad gods, our bad ways. Then we believed in God, we held fast the
faith of the gospel. Then it was the wish of the Maories to leave off our
old customs, and come in the way of the English. Now, my dear friends,
that is why I have come to England, to learn those ways more, to teach
my people. I hope English people will be kind to give me money to
make a college to teach my people these good works and ways, and to
teach them to be ministers, to preach the gospel of God in our own
tongue, and to teach them also to make English clothes, to carpenter, to
build, to print—every thing it would please God the Maories should do—and
also to make a hospital for the sick people. It is the wish of my
heart, also, that, now that the light has come to New Zealand, we should
carry it to Chatham's Island, New Caledonia, and our brothers in all the
islands round, who are yet very dark, and fight like we did before. My
heart is dark for them: it longs to send Maories there to teach them.
Four years I have been wishing it, but New Zealand is very poor: we
have not been able to do it. Now I have come to England. England
is rich. Perhaps English people will help us. It is not my work,
only the work of God. I will give plenty of land, plenty of food, plenty
of wood. Will not you be kind to give money to buy clothes, plates,
knives, all things, for the young men who learn, to make it like an English
college; and will you ask all the good people who love the work
of God to give money to that work in New Zealand? When I heard
from my dear father, Mr. Childe, that you had been kind to give me a
schoolmaster, to teach my young men, my heart was very happy indeed.
I love you very much. You are the Committee who sent the first Missionaries
to teach us. All the Maories love you too. That is why I
wish you to be the nursing father to my college. Do not forget me or
my people, my dear fathers in Christ. Let us, the children of the far-distant
land, be taken care of by you for Christ; for your God is our God,
your Father our Father. The God of England is the God of New Zealand
and all the world. Pray for me also, my dear brothers in Christ, that
when I go back I may be strong to teach my people. My heart does not
stay among the good things of England. Every day, every hour, it goes
up to God first, and then down to New Zealand. My body lives in England,
but my heart still lives in New Zealand. And yet I think, when I go
back to New Zealand, while my body lives there my heart will remain
in England, with my dear, good friends in Christ here, whom I love
very much indeed in the Lord. My heart will go up to God in prayer
for them, and then I hope my prayer will come down in blessing upon
my friends in England. I will tell my people also to pray for them to
our God.
And now, my dear fathers in Christ, good bye. I thank you again
for all your love in taking care of the souls of my people in New Zealand,
and of my body while I have been in your land. Soon I am going
back to home. God bless you all. Good bye. You pray for me: I
will pray for you. You will not see my face again. My eyes will see
you no more. But we shall meet again in our home in heaven.
