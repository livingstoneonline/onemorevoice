<lb/><p rend="center italic">Statement in regard to the Condition of the <term type="collective">Natives in <region><geogName>Lake Mantumba</geogName> region</region></term> during the period of 
the Rubber Wars which began in <date when="1893">1893</date>.</p>

<lb/><p>THE disturbance consequent on the attempt to levy a rubber tax in this district, a tax which 
has since been discontinued, appears to have endured up to <date when="1900">1900</date>.</p>

<p>The population during the continuance of these wars diminished, I estimate, by some 60 per 
cent., and the remnant of the inhabitants are only now, in many cases, returning to their destroyed 
or abandoned villages.</p>

<p>During the period <date from="1893" to="1901">1893-1901</date> the <country>Congo State</country> commenced the system of compelling the 
<term type="collective">natives</term> to collect rubber, and insisted that the inhabitants of the district should not go out of 
it to sell their produce to traders.</p>

<p>The population of the country then was not large, but there were numerous villages with an 
active people&#8212;very many children, healthy looking and playful.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They had good huts, large planta- 
tions of <term type="foodstuff">plaintains</term> and <term type="foodstuff">manioc</term>, and they were evidently rich, for their women were nearly all 
ornamented with brass anklets, bracelets, and neck rings, and other ornaments.</p>

<p>The following is a list of towns or villages&#8212;giving their approximate population in the 
year <date when="1893">1893</date> and <date when="1903">at the present time</date>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These figures are very carefully estimated:&#8212;</p>

<lb/>

<p>This list can be extended to double this number of villages, and in every case there has been 
a great decrease in the population.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This has been, to a very great extent, caused by the extreme 
measures resorted to by <term type="collective">officers of the <orgName>State</orgName></term>, and the freedom enjoyed by the soldiers to do just 
as they pleased.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There are more people in the district near the villages mentioned, but they are 
hidden away in the bush like hunted animals, with only a few branches thrown together for 
shelter, for they have no trust that the present quiet state of things will continue, and they have 
no heart to build houses or make good gardens.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In all the villages mentioned there are very few 
good huts, and when the <term type="collective">natives</term> are urged to make better houses for the sake of their health, 
the reply is, that there is no advantage to them in building good houses or making extensive 
gardens, as these would only give the <orgName>State</orgName> a greater hold upon them and lead to more exorbitant 
demands.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The decrease has several causes:&#8212;</p>

<p>1. O* was deserted because of demands made for rubber by <persName>M. N O</persName><!-- Could also be orgName; same for other instances below. AW --> and several others 
were similar cases.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">natives</term> went to the <region><term type="collective">French</term> territory</region>.</p>

<p>2. “War,” in which children and women were killed as well as men.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Women and children 
were killed not in all cases by stray bullets, but were taken as prisoners and killed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Sad to 
say, these horrible cases were not always the acts of some <term type="collective">black soldier</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Proof was laid 
against one officer who shot one woman and one man, while they were before him as prisoners 
with their hands tied, and no attempt was made by the accused to deny the truth of the 
statement.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>To those killed in the so-called “war” must be added large numbers of those <lb/>



    <pb facs="liv_020058_0071" n="0071"/>
<fw><seg rend="center">71</seg></fw>
who died while kept as prisoners of war.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Others were carried to far distant camps and have 
never returned.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Many of the young were sent to <orgName>Missions</orgName>, and the death-rate was enormous.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Here is one example:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Ten children were sent from a <orgName>State</orgName> steamer to a <orgName>Mission</orgName>, and in spite 
of comfortable surroundings there were only three alive at the end of a month.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The others had 
died of dysentery and bowel troubles contracted during the voyage.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Two more struggled on for 
about fifteen months, but never recovered strength, and at last died.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In less than two years only 
one of the ten was alive.</p>

<p>3. Another cause of the decrease is that the <term type="collective">natives</term> are weakened in body through insufficient 
and irregular food supply.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They cannot resist disease as of old.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In spite of assurances that 
the old state of things will not come again, the <term type="collective">native</term> refuses to build good houses, make 
large gardens, and make the best of the new surroundings&#8212;he is without ambition because 
without hope, and when sickness comes he does not seem to care.</p>

<p>4. Again a lower percentage of births lessen the population.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Weakened bodies is one cause 
of this.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Another reason is that women refuse to bear children, and take means to save themselves 
from motherhood.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They give as the reason that if “war” should come a woman “big with 
child,” or with a baby to carry, cannot well run away and hide from the soldiers.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Confidence will 
no doubt, be restored, but it grows but slowly.</p>

<p>There are two points in connection with the “war” (so-called):&#8212;</p>

<p><space extent="3" unit="words"/>(1.) The cause.</p>

<p><space extent="3" unit="words"/>(2.) The manner in which it was conducted.</p>

<p>(1.) The <term type="collective">natives</term> never had obeyed any other man than their own Chiefs.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When <persName>Leopold II</persName> 
became their King they were not aware of the fact, nor had they any hand in the making of the 
new arrangement.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Demands were made on them, and they did not understand why they 
should obey the stranger.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Some of the demands were not excessive, but others were simply 
impossible.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>From the <term type="collective">G H* people</term> and the <region>O* group of towns</region><!-- Not sure about a better way to code this. AW --> large demands of rubber 
were made.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There was not much within their reach, and it was a dangerous thing to be a 
stranger in a strange part of the forests.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">O* people</term> offered to pay a monthly tribute of 
<term type="animal">goats</term>, <term type="animal">fowls</term>, &amp;c., but <persName>M. N O</persName> would have rubber, so they left.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">G H*</term> had to bear the 
scourge of war frequently and many were killed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Now they supply what they probably would 
have supplied without the loss of one person, <term type="foodstuff">kwanga</term><!-- fermented bread --> and <term type="foodstuff">fresh meats</term>, and roofing materials and 
mats.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Rubber was demanded from some others and war resulted.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>These are now providing 
the <orgName>State</orgName> with <term type="foodstuff">fish</term> and <term type="foodstuff">fowls</term>.</p>

<p>Another fertile source of war lay in the actions of the <term type="collective">native soldiers</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Generally speaking 
their statements against other <term type="collective">natives</term> were received as truth that needed no support.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Take the 
following as an example:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>One morning it was reported that <term type="collective">State soldiers</term> had shot several 
people near the channel leading from <settlement>H K*</settlement> to the <geogName>Congo</geogName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Several canoes full of <term type="foodstuff">manioc</term> had 
been also seized, and the friends of the dead and owners of two of the canoes asked that they 
might have the canoes and food, and that they might take the bodies and bury them.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>But 
this was refused.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was alleged the people were shot in the act of deserting from the <orgName>State</orgName> into 
<region><term type="collective">French</term> territory</region>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The Chief who was shot was actually returning from having gone with a 
message from <persName>M. O P</persName> to a village, and was killed east of the camp and of his home, while 
“<region>France</region>”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>lay to the west.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers said that the people had been challenged to stop and 
that they refused, and that they had been shot as they paddled away.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>But really they had 
landed when called by the soldiers; they had been tied hand and foot, and then shot.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>One 
woman had struggled when shot, and had broken the vines with which her feet were tied, and 
she, though wounded, tried to escape.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A second bullet made her fall, but yet she rose and ran 
a few steps, when a third bullet laid her low.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Their hands had all been taken off&#8212;i.e., the 
right hand of each&#8212;for evidence of the faithfulness of the soldiers.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>M. O P</persName> shot two of the 
soldiers, but the leader of the party was not shot, though the whole matter was carried through 
by him, and he it was that gave <persName>M. O P</persName> the false report.</p>

<p>A Chief complained that certain soldiers had taken his wives and had stolen all of his 
belongings that they cared to have.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He made no complaint against the “tax” that the soldiers 
had gone there to secure, but told of the cruelty and oppression of the soldiers carried on for 
their own gain.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white officer</term> kicked him off the verandah and said that he told many lies.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
The Chief turned round with fury written on his face, stood silently looking at the <term type="collective">white 
man</term>, and then stalked off; two days later there was a report that all the soldiers with their 
wives and followers had been killed in that Chief’s town.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A little later the <term type="collective">white officer</term> who 
refused to set matters right, along with another <term type="collective"><term type="collective">Belgian</term> officer</term>, were killed with a number of 
their soldiers in an expedition for the purpose of punishing the <term type="collective">Chief and his people</term> for killing 
the first lot of soldiers.</p>

<p>After the rubber demand was withdrawn, in some places labour was demanded.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A very large 
proportion of the women from this village had to go to <settlement>P*</settlement> every week and work there two days.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
They returned here on the third day.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Nearly every week there were complaints made that 
someone’s wife had been kept by a soldier, and when it was suggested that the husband 
should himself go and report the matter to the <term type="collective">white man</term>, they would reply:<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>“We dare not.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Their fear was not so much of the <term type="collective">white man</term> but of the <term type="collective">black soldiers</term>.</p>

<p>(2.) The manner in which this war was conducted was very objectionable to any one with 
<term type="collective">European</term> ideas.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">natives</term> attacked <settlement>P*</settlement> and <settlement>O*</settlement>, but that was only after numerous 
expeditions had been made against them, and the whole population roused against the “<term type="collective">white 
man</term>.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In 99 per cent. of the “wars” in this district the cause was simply failure on the part of 
the people to supply produce, labour, or men, as demanded by the <orgName>State</orgName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There was the long 
struggle with <persName>L L L</persName> in his long resistance to <term type="collective"><orgName>State</orgName> authority</term>; but he at first was known as a

quiet man who tried to please the <orgName>State</orgName>, and he only started on his career as a fighting man after 
he had been out to help <persName>M. N O</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After the departure of <persName>M. N O</persName> to <settlement>Coquilhatville</settlement>, he went back 
and made demands and fought the people as he had done with <persName>M. N O</persName> as his Chief.</p>

<p>When this matter was reported to <persName>M. N O</persName>, he was angry, and called the Chief a “brigand,” 
and said that he would be punished.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>For numerous offences he was put “on the chain,” and some 
time after his release the fight occurred (in which fight the <term type="collective">two white men</term> were killed) and he 
joined with others in an ineffectual attempt to drive out the <term type="collective">white man</term>.</p>

<p>In most of the fights then the <term type="collective">natives</term> were merely trying to defend themselves and their 
homes from attacks made on them by <term type="collective">black soldiers</term> sent to “punish them for some failure to 
do their duty to the State;” and if the cause for war was weak, the way in which it was carried 
on was often revolting.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was stated that these soldiers were often sent out to make war on a 
village without a <term type="collective">white officer</term> accompanying them, so that there was nothing to keep them 
from awful excesses.</p>

<p>It is averred that canoes have been seen returning from distant expeditions with no <term type="collective">white 
man</term> in charge, and with human hands dangling from a stick in the bow of the canoe&#8212;or in 
small baskets&#8212;being carried to the <term type="collective">white man</term> as proofs of their courage and devotion to duty.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
If one in fifty of <term type="collective">native</term> reports are true, there has been great lack on the part of some 
<term type="collective">white men</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They, too, are accused of forgetting the subjects and conditions of war.</p>

<p>Statements made to me by certain <term type="collective">natives</term> are appended.</p>

<p>Many similar statements were made to me during the time I spent at <geogName>Lake Mantumba</geogName>, some 
of those made by <term type="collective">native men</term> being unfit for repetition.</p>

<lb/><p>I was born at <settlement>K K*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After my father died my mother and I went to <settlement>L L*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When 
we returned to <settlement>K K*</settlement> soon after that <persName>P Q</persName> came to fight with us because of rubber.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
<settlement>K K*</settlement> did not want to take rubber to the <term type="collective">white man</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We and our mothers ran away very 
far into the bush.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <orgName><foreign>Bula Matadi</foreign> soldiers</orgName> were very strong and they fought hard, 
one soldier was killed, and they killed one <term type="collective"><settlement>K K*</settlement> man</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then the <term type="collective">white man</term> said let us go 
home, and they went home, and then we, too, came out of the bush.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This was the first fight.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
After that another fighting took place.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I, my mother, grandmother, and my sister, 
we ran away into the bush.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers came and fought us, and left the town and followed 
us into the bush.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When the soldiers came into the bush near us they were calling my 
mother by name, and I was going to answer, but my mother put her hand to my mouth to stop 
me.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then they went to another side, and then we left that place and went to another.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When 
they called my mother, if she had not stopped me from answering, we would all have been killed 
then.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A great number of our people were killed by the soldiers.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The friends who were left 
buried the dead bodies, and there was very much weeping.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After that there was not any fighting 
for some time.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then the soldiers came again to fight with us, and we ran into the bush, but they 
really came to fight with <settlement>M M*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They killed a lot of <term type="collective"><settlement>M M*</settlement> people</term>, and then one soldier came 
out to <settlement>K K*</settlement>, and the <term type="collective"><settlement>K K*</settlement> people</term> killed him with a spear.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>And when the other soldiers 
heard that their friend was killed they came in a large number and followed us into the bush.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Then the soldiers fired a gun, and some people were killed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After that they saw a little bit of 
my mother’s head, and the soldiers ran quickly towards the place where we were and caught my 
grandmother, my mother, my sister, and another little one, younger than us.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Several of the 
soldiers argued about my mother, because each wanted her for a wife, so they finally decided to 
kill her.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They killed her with a gun&#8212;they shot her through the stomach&#8212;and she fell, and 
when I saw that I cried very much, because they killed my mother and grandmother, and I was 
left alone.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>My mother was near to the time of her confinement at that time.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>And they killed my 
grandmother too, and I saw it all done.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They took hold of my sister and asked where her older 
sister was, and she said: “She has just run away.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They said, “Call her.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She called me, but I was 
too frightened and would not answer, and I ran and went away and came out at another place, 
and I could not speak much because my throat was very sore.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I saw a little bit <term type="foodstuff">kwanga</term> lying 
on the ground and I picked it up to eat.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At that place there used to be a lot of people, but when 
I got there there were none.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>My sister was taken to <settlement>P*</settlement>, and I was at this place alone.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>One 
day I saw a man coming from the back country.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He was going to kill me, but afterwards he 
took me to a place where there were people, and there I saw my step-father<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He asked to buy me from this man, but the man would not let him.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He said, “She is my slave 
now; I found her.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>One day the men went out fishing, and when I looked I saw the soldiers 
coming, so I ran away, but a string caught my foot and I fell, and a soldier named <persName>N N N</persName> 
caught me.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He handed me over to another soldier, and as we went we saw some <term type="collective"><settlement>Q*</settlement> people</term> 
fishing, and the soldiers took a lot of <term type="foodstuff">fish</term> from them and a <term type="collective"><settlement>Q*</settlement> woman</term>, and we went to <settlement>P*</settlement>,

have finished the first part of the story.</p>

<p>We stayed a long time at our town, then the <term type="collective">white man</term> who fought with <settlement>N N*</settlement> first 
went and told <persName>R S</persName> that the <term type="collective"><settlement>N N*</settlement> people</term> were very strong, so <persName>R S</persName> made up his mind to come

<term type="collective">white man</term> came he did not try to fight them during the day, but went to the back and waited 
for night to come.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When the soldiers came at night the people ran away, so they did not kill 
anybody, only a sick man whom they found in a house, whom they (the soldiers) killed and 
disfigured his body very much.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They hunted out all the <term type="collective">native</term> money they could get, and in 
the morning they went away.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After they went away we came back to the town, but we found 
it was all destroyed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We remained in our town a long time; the <term type="collective">white man</term> did not come back

told them the name of the town.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then we went into the bush to look for people, and we heard 
children crying, and a soldier went quickly over to the place and killed a mother and four

As she went past she heard her mother calling to her, but she told her to run away in another

night came on she tried to find the road again and follow the people who had passed her, but she

saw one of the soldier’s boys sitting at the door of the house, and then also she could not quite

away in another direction from where she had put her sister.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After she had reached the outside

town.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term>’s name was <persName>C D</persName>.<ref target="#note_02">&#8224;</ref> The soldiers gave <persName>S S</persName> something to eat on the 
way.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When they came to this next town they found that all the people had run away.</p>

<p>In the morning the soldiers wanted <persName>S S</persName> to go and look for <term type="foodstuff">manioc</term> for them, but she was 
afraid to go out as they looked to her as if they wanted to kill her.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers thrashed her very 
much, and began to drag her outside, but the corporal (<persName>N N N</persName>) came and took her by the hand and 
said, “We must not kill her; we must take her to the <term type="collective">white man</term>.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then they went back to the 
town where <persName>C D</persName> was, and they showed him <persName>S S</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>C D</persName> handed her over to the care of a 
soldier.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At this town she found that they had caught three people, and among them was a 
very old woman, and the <term type="collective">cannibal soldiers</term> asked <persName>C D</persName> to give them the old woman to eat, 
and <persName>C D</persName> told them to take her.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Those soldiers took the woman and cut her throat, and 
then divided her and ate her.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>S S</persName> saw all this done.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In the morning the soldier who was 
looking after her was sent on some duty by <persName>C D</persName>, and before the soldier went out he had 
told <persName>S S</persName> to get some <term type="foodstuff">manioc leaves</term> not far from the house and to cook them.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After he left 
she went to do as he had told her, and those <term type="collective">cannibal soldiers</term> went to <persName>C D</persName> and said that 
<persName>S S</persName> was trying to run away, so they wanted to kill her; but he told them to tie her, so the 
soldiers tied her to a tree, and she had to stand in the sun nearly all day.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When the soldier who 
had charge of her came back he found her tied up.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>C D</persName> called to him to ask about <persName>S S</persName>, 
so he explained to <persName>C D</persName> what he had told <persName>S S</persName> to do, so he was allowed to untie her.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They 
stayed several days at this place, then <persName>B D</persName> asked <persName>S S</persName> if she knew all the towns round 
about, and she said yes, then he told her to show them the way, so that they could go and catch 
people.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They came to a town and found only one woman, who was dying of sickness, and the 
soldiers killed her with a knife.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At several towns they found no people, but at last they came to 
a town where several people had run to as they did not know where else to go, because the 
soldiers were fighting everywhere.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At this town they killed a lot of people&#8212;men, women, and 
children&#8212;and took some as prisoners.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They cut the hands off those they had killed, and brought 
them to <persName>C D</persName>; they spread out the hands in a row for <persName>C D</persName> to see.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After that they left to 
return to <settlement>Bikoro</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They took a lot of prisoners with them.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The hands which they had cut off 
they just left lying, because the <term type="collective">white man</term> had seen them, so they did not need to take them to 
<settlement>P*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Some of the soldiers were sent to <settlement>P*</settlement> with the prisoners, but <persName>C D</persName> himself and the other

<persName>S S</persName> was about two weeks at <settlement>P*</settlement>, and then she ran away into the bush at <settlement>P*</settlement> for

<lb/><p rend="center italic"><persName>T T</persName>’s Statement.</p>

<lb/><p>States she belonged to the village of <settlement>R*</settlement>, where she lived with her grandmother.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><settlement>R*</settlement> 
was attacked by the <term type="collective"><orgName>State</orgName> soldiers</term> long ago.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was in <persName>S T</persName>’s time.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She does not know if 
he was with the soldiers, but she heard the bugle blow when they were going away.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was in 
the afternoon when they came, they began catching and tying the people, and killed lots of them.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
A lot of people&#8212;she thinks perhaps fifty&#8212;ran away, and she was in the crowd with them, but 
the soldiers came after them and killed them all but herself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She was small, and she slid into the 
bush.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The people killed were many, and women&#8212;there were not many children.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The children 
had scattered when the soldiers came, but she stayed with the big people, thinking she might 
be safe.</p>

<p>When they were all killed she waited in the grass for two nights.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She was very frightened, 
and her throat was sore with thirst, and she looked about and at last she found some water in a 
pot.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She stayed on in the grass a third night, and <term type="animal">buffaloes</term> came near her and she was very 
frightened&#8212;and they went away.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When the morning came she thought she would be better to 
move, and went away and got up a tree.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She was three days without food, and was very hungry.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
In the tree she was near her grandmother’s house, and she looked around and, seeing no soldiers, 
she crept to her grandmother’s house and got some food and got up the tree again.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The 
soldiers had gone away hunting for <term type="animal">buffaloes</term>, and it was then she was able to get down from the 
tree.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers came back, and they came towards the trees and bushes calling out: s
“Now we see you; come down, come down!”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This they used to do, so that people, thinking 
they were really discovered, should give themselves up; but she thought she would stay on, and 
so she stayed up the tree.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Soon afterwards the soldiers went, but she was still afraid to come 
down.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Presently she heard her grandmother calling out to know if she was alive, and when she 
heard her grandmother’s voice she knew the soldiers were gone, and she answered, but her voice 
was very small&#8212;and she came down and her grandmother took her home.</p>

<p>That was the first time.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Soon afterwards she and her grandmother went away to another 
town called <settlement>U U*</settlement>, near <settlement>V V*</settlement>, and they were there some days together, when one night the 
soldiers came.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term> sent the soldiers there because the <term type="collective"><settlement>U U*</settlement> people</term> had not taken 
to the <orgName>State</orgName> what they were told to take.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Neither her own people nor the <term type="collective"><settlement>U U*</settlement> people</term> knew 
there was any trouble with the <orgName>Government</orgName>, so they were surprised.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She was asleep.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Her 
grandmother&#8212;her mother’s mother&#8212;tried to awaken her, but she did not know.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She felt the 
shaking, but she did not mind because she was sleepy.</p>

<p>The soldiers came quickly into the house&#8212;her grandmother rushed out just before.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When 
she heard the noise of the soldiers around the house, and looked and saw her grandmother not 
there, she ran out and called for her grandmother; and as she ran her brass anklets made a noise, 
and some one ran after and caught her by the leg, and she fell and the soldiers took her.</p>

<p>There were not many soldiers, only some boys with one soldier (Note.&#8212;She means a corporal 
and some untrained men.&#8212;<persName>R. C.</persName>), and they had caught only one woman and herself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In the 
morning they began robbing the houses, and took everything they could find and take.</p>

<p>They were taken to a canoe, and went to <settlement>V V*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldier who caught her was the sentry 
at <settlement>V V*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At <settlement>V V*</settlement> she was kept about a week with the sentry, and when the <settlement>V V*</settlement> people took 
their weekly rations over to <settlement>P*</settlement> she was sent over.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The other woman who was taken to <settlement>V V*</settlement> 
was ransomed by her friends.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They came after them to <settlement>V V*</settlement>, and the sentry let her go for 
750 rods.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She saw the money paid.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Her friends came to ransom her too, but the sentry refused, 
saying the <term type="collective">white man</term> wanted her because she was young&#8212;the other was an old woman and 
could not work.</p>

<lb/><p>When we began to run away from the fight, we ran away many times.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They did not catch 
me because I was with mother and father.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Afterwards mother died; four days passed, father 
died also.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I and an older sister were left with two younger children, and then the fighting came 
where I had run to.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then my elder sister called me: “<persName>U U</persName>, come here.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I went.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She said: 
“Let us run away, because we have not any one to take care of us.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When we were running 
away we saw a lot of <term type="collective"><settlement>W W*</settlement> people</term> coming towards us.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We told them to run away, war 
was coming.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They said: “Is it true?”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We said: “It is true; they are coming.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective"><settlement>W W*</settlement> 
people</term> said: “We will not run away; we did not see the soldiers.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Only a little while they 
saw the soldiers, and they were killed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We stayed in a town named <settlement>X X*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A male relative 
called me: “<persName>U U</persName>, let us go;” but I did not want to.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers came there; I ran away 
by myself; when I ran away I hid in the bush.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>While I was running I met with an old man who 
was running from a soldier.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He (the soldier) fired a gun.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I was not hit, but the old man died.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Afterwards they caught me and two men.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers asked: “Have you a father and mother?”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
I answered, “No.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They said to me, “If you do not tell us we will kill you.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I said:


    <pb facs="liv_020058_0076" n="0076"/>
<fw><seg rend="center">76</seg></fw>
“Father and mother are dead.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After that my oldest sister was caught, too, in the bush, and 
they left my little brother and sister alone in the bush to die, because heavy rain came on, and 
they had not had anything to eat for days and days.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At night they tied my hands and feet for 
fear that I should run away.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In the morning they caught three people&#8212;two had children; they 
killed the children.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Afterwards I was standing outside, and a soldier asked me, “Where are you 
going?”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I said, “I am going home.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He said, “Come on.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He took his gun; he put me in 
the house; he wanted to kill me.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then another soldier came and took me.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>We heard a big 
noise; they told us that the fighting was over, but it was not so.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When we were going on 
the way they killed ten children because they were very, very small; they killed them in the 
water.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then they killed a lot of people, and they cut off their hands and put them into baskets 
and took them to the <term type="collective">white man</term>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He counted out the hands&#8212;200 in all; they left the hands 
lying.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term>’s name was “<persName>C D</persName>.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After that <persName>C D</persName> sent us prisoners with soldiers 
to <settlement>P*</settlement> to <persName>S T</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>S T</persName> told me to weed grass.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When I was working outside a soldier came and 
said: “Come here;” and when I went he wanted to cut my hand off, and so I went to the <term type="collective">white 
man</term> to tell him, and he thrashed the soldier.</p>

<p>On our way, when we were coming to <settlement>P*</settlement>, the soldiers saw a little child, and when they 
went to kill it the child laughed so the soldier took the butt of the gun and struck the child with 
it, and then cut off its head.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>One day they killed my half-sister and cut off her head, hands, 
and feet because she had on rings.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Her name was <persName>Q Q Q</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Then they caught another sister, and 
they sold her to the <term type="collective"><settlement>W W*</settlement> people</term>, and now she is a slave there.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When we came to <settlement>P*</settlement> 
the <term type="collective">white man</term> said to send word to the friends of the prisoners to come with goats to buy off 
some of their relatives.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A lot were bought off, but I had no one to come and buy me off because 
father was dead.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term> said to me, “You shall go to....”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term> 
(<persName>S T</persName>) gave me a small boy to care for, but I thought he would be killed, so I helped to get
