<p><em>Oct. 28, 1850</em>�This morning I went with the Rev. H. Townsend to see 
a sick Candidate, who had sent to him earnestly requesting to have the 
sacrament of baptism administered to him, as he found his sickness 
gradually gaining the mastery.</p><br>

<p>His answers to several questions proposed 
to him by Mr. Townsend were such that it would have been unjustifiable 
to refuse him his request, especially under such pining disease. "Why 
do you wish to be baptized?" asked Mr. Townsend. "Because Jesus 
has commanded it to be done to every one that believes in Him."�
"It is, then, answerable to the heathen amulets, as a means by 
which you hope to be preserved from sickness, death, and other 
evils?" "By no means: it is only an outward sign of an inward 
operation by the Spirit of God."�"Administered to you, will 
your salvation be then completed?" "It will by no means be profitable 
to me without true faith in Jesus the Savior."�"Do you, then, believe 
in Jesus?" "O yes! with all my heart; and I hope that He will enable 
me more to trust in Him. I know that I am unfit; but as I cannot tell 
how it will fare with me in this sickness, I therefore wish to receive the 
sign which Christ has appointed as a means for salvation." After this, 
he was baptized by Mr. Townsend, in the presence of more than a dozen 
individuals, Communicants and Candidates, who went with us, and some 
of the household. After this, some words were spoken to those of his 
unconcerned and careless relatives present for about an hour; by which 
an emigrant who came with us from Sierra Leone was so convinced of 
the utmost necessity of casting his lot with the people of God, that he 
quitted the residence of his heathen relatives the same day, to live with 
one of the Native Communicants who went with us, where he would be 
able to attend to these things without molestation.</p>
<p><em>Nov. 24</em>: <em>Lord's-day</em>�The above sick young man was brought to 
the yard this morning. The most influential man among his relatives 
sent to Mr. Townsend about a fortnight ago to take the young man to 
our premises. To ascertain the real cause of this message, Mr. Townsend 
sent Mr. A. Wilhelm and myself to make inquiries. He assigned no other 
reason than that, as the young man refused their making sacrifices for 
him, they knew not what assistance would be rendered to him. His 
language, he said, was not understood by them, as their words were 
contrary to his. We inquired how this could be, since the young man 
knows and speaks no other but the same common language. "His 
views," said he, "are contrary to us, neither can any in the house understand
him. As long as he refuses to worship Ifa, I know not what 
other help could be rendered him, neither will I show him any favour. 
Tell the gentleman that I am quite sincere in what I said. If he is 
better, he may remain with him in his yard; but should the sickness 
terminate in death, he may bury him: we cannot help it." What provoked
them to be so much disgusted with the sick man, I am informed, 
was the violent insult he once offered to Ifa, when, in spite of all his 
remonstrances, this head man of their family determined to consult 
Ifa on his behalf. On a certain day, when the babbalawo, whom the 
head man brought for the purpose, had taken his seat, and spread Ifa 
and all the instruments, the sick man was requested to come forward and 
perform his adoration by prostration on the ground before the priest, 
and by touching the nuts with his forehead, all which are to precede the 
act of divination. But the young man refused. As he would not rise, 
it was then proposed that Ifa should be handed to him, in order to touch
it with his forehead, but even with this they could not get him to comply. 
His relative, the employer, then remarked, that as they could easily 
perform the ceremonies were the sufferer to be absent, they might 
deal with this case just in the same way, and therefore bade the priest to 
proceed. At this crisis, the sick man, who in the mean while was contemplating
how to put an end to all their imposing cheats, nimbly got 
up, on which they supposed he was now inclined to comply with their 
wishes; but on the contrary, to the astonishment and displeasure of all, 
he took hold of the nuts, and scattered the whole in the yard. Enraged 
by such daring conduct, the chief relative threw the sick young man down 
by such a violent push that those present supposed him to be dead. The 
whole party being in confusion were then dispersed. The babbalawo, 
without a word to his employer, departed in haste. The poor man, 
coming to himself after a while, got up and went into the house. This 
is the source of their animosity to him, from which even his mother is 
not exempted, but seems, as it were, to be hardened against her own son. 
They troubled him greatly after this to give up his faith, but, finding they 
could not prevail, their hatred to him was the more increased. But the 
young man, instead of being shaken in faith, was firm and resolute; 
and, far from being sorry for the proposal made by the head man, he 
was rather much pleased to come to the yard. Their bitter hatred to 
him has given him sufficient reason to suspect that, in case of danger, 
such as outbreak of fire, they might leave him to perish. The poor 
man, since his entrance into the yard, has met with parental care and 
attention from Mr. and Mrs. Townsend. How forcibly is the Saviour's 
saying verified in the case of this young man�"I am not come to 
send peace on earth, but rather division!" Neither is David's saying 
less applicable to him�"When my father and my mother forsake me, 
then the Lord will take me up."</p>
<p>This poor fellow has since entered into rest. During his illness 
he was often cast down under the deep sense of his unworthiness; 
yet at other times he was enabled to rejoice in the hope place 
before him by the Gospel of Jesus. On one occasion, when asked 
by Mr. King what he thought of the Lord's dealings with him, he 
replied, "Oh, very kind and loving indeed is He to me�more than 
any parents." "What! is it kindness to suffer you to be thus 
afflicted, while many of your companions are in full vigour and 
strength?" "O yes! very indeed;" and then he entered into a long 
detail of all that he had passed through since the commencement of 
his sickness: how, when in ignorance of the promise of mercy in 
Christ, he was repeatedly tempted to commit suicide, but, being 
discovered, was providentially prevented. That he should have been 
spared to hear the glad tidings of salvation, appeared to him an 
uncommon mercy; and heartily did he bless God that he had 
not been suffered to plunge himself into endless misery. His 
mother, finding that there was no hope of his recovery, wished to 
have him removed to his grandmother's place, that there, taking 
advantage of his weakness, they might practise their idolatrous 
rites. Mr. King questioned him, to see whether he felt disposed to 
go. "Do  not," he said, "entertain any fears for me: not while 
there is breath in me shall I go there." Most grateful was he for 
any thing that was done for him. Entering his room suddenly, 
Mr. King on several occasions found him on his knees. Often, 
with deep interest, did he speak of the rest to be found in 
Jesus, and as long as he had the power of utterance continued to 
express his hope in Christ. "The last time," says Mr. Townsend, 
"that I saw him alive, when almost past consciousness, he had lying 
by his side his books, which I understood from his mother were 
placed there at his desire�doubtless, a last testimony that he continued
'a book-man' and a Christian."</p>
