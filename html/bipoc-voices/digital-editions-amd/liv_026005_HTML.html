  <h5 style="text-align: center">THE AMAZONS</h5>
  <p>I<small>N</small> our Number for November last we mentioned the King of Dahomey was intending
    to attack Abbeokuta. Letters recently received from that city inform us that he was then within
    a few days' march, and that the Abbeokutans were preparing to defend themselves</p>
  <p>The regular army of Gezo, the King of Dahomey, consists of 12,000 troops, of whom 5000 are
    female soldiers, called Amazons. We present a sketch of one of them.<a href="#note1"
      id="note1back"><sup>1</sup></a> The Amazon is dressed "in a blue and white striped cotton
    surtout, the stripes about one and a half inch wide, of stout native manufacture, without
    sleeves, leaving freedon for the arms. The skirt or tunic reaches as low as the kilt of the
    Highlanders. A pair of short trowsers is worn underneath, reaching two inches below the knees."
    A girdle, with a cartouch-box attached, tightens the dress around the waist. On the head is a
    skull-cap of white cotton, with devices of various kinds. The device of the regiment to which
    the soldier belongs is that of an alligator. They are all armed with long Danish guns, a short
    sword, and a sort of club. Many are the sufferings which the fierce soldiers of Gezo have
    inflicted on the surrounding nations.</p><br>

      style="width: 455px;"></div><br>
  <p>Their usual mode of proceeding is by surprise. Having arrived during the night in the
    neighbourhood of the town which they intend to assault, they make a rush on it about two hours
    before daybreak. It is probably defended by "a broad close-growing fence of very dangerous
    prickly bush, about fifteen feet high." This the Amazons soon break through, although their feet
    are without shoes. The inhabitants, surprised in their sleep, are completely in their power.
    Such as resist are slain. "The others are tied around the neck with a small grass-rope, each
    soldier having that article, as well as a piece of chalk. Each soldier uses his own private mark
    on the back of as many slaves as he may capture, and also secures the scalps of as many as he
    murders in attack. After all is over, these slaves and scalps are presented to the King or
    Chief, who gives each soldier, according to the amount of his capture, a sum of cowries, as well
    as allows him to attach a cowry to the stock of his gun, which is reckoned an honourable
    distinction, and is given medals to civilized armies."<a href="#note2"
