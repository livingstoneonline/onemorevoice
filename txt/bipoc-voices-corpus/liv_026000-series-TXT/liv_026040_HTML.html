  <h5 style="text-align:center;">The Missionary Bee-Hive.</h5>
  <p>The bookcase also contains a photographic album, with many interesting portraits of
    Missionaries and Missionary scenes; also a letter-book containing interesting letters from
    Missionaries, converts, and others, from various parts of the great Mission field. One letter we
    may be allowed to copy: it is from a little negro boy, addressed to his Missionary when leaving
    his station for England. The little fellow says,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">"Please, sir,
    when you go England, make you tell all schoolboys that live in England
    I hope they quite well. I live in Church Missionary School. If I be a
    good boy, master will give me something like a little book and other
    things which Church Missionary Society sent, for master make he must
    give all school-boys and school-girls."</p>
