</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Y Y</span>, with many of the townsmen and a few women and children, also present.
</p>
<p class="p ">A lad, about 14 or 15 years of age, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span> by name, whose left hand had been cut off, the
stump wrapped up in a rag, the wound being yet scarcely healed, appears, and, in answer
to
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>’s question, charges a sentry named <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> (placed in the town by the local agent of the
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">La Lulanga Society</span> to see that the people work rubber) with having done it.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This sentry is
called, and after some delay appears with a cap-gun.
</p>
<p class="p ">The following inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the loss of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>’s hand then
takes place:—
</p>
<p class="p ">The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>, through <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">W W</span>, speaking in E F*, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">X X</span> repeating his utterances both in
F G* to the sentry and in the local dialect to the others, asks <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>, in the presence of the accused:
</p>
<p class="p ">“Who cut off your hand?”</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“The sentry there.”
</p>
<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<span class="pb-title">0079</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center ">79</span></span>
<p class="p ">The sentry denies the charge (interrupting), and stating that his name is <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">T T T</span> and not
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> requests him to keep silence—that he can speak later.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Y Y</span> is called and questioned by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> through the interpreters.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After being exhorted to
speak the truth without fear or favour, he states:
</p>
<p class="p ">“The sentry before us cut off <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>’s hand.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Did you yourself witness the act?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answer:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Yes.”
</p>
<p class="p ">Several of the Headmen of the town called upon by the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> to testify.
</p>
<p class="p ">To the first of these, who gave his name as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Z Z</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> asked, pointing to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>’s mutilated
wrist-bone:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Who cut off this boy’s hand?”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Z Z</span> (pointing to the sentry):<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“That man did it.”
</p>
<p class="p ">The second, who gave his name as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">A A A</span>, asked by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Who cut off this boy’s
hand?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answers:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span>.”
</p>
<p class="p ">The third, giving his name as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">B B B</span>, asked by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Who cut off this boy’s hand?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answers:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“This man here, the sentry.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Z Z</span> (re-questioned):<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Did you yourself see this sentry cut off this boy’s hand?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answer:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Yes, I saw it.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">A A A</span> (re-questioned):<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Did you yourself see this sentry cut off this boy’s hand?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answers:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“I should think so.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Did I not get this wound here” (pointing to a cut by the
tendon <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Achilles</span> on the left heel) “the same day, when running away in fright?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My own knife
wounded me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I let it fall when I ran away.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> questions <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“How long ago was it your hand was cut off?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answer:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“He is not sure.”
</p>
<p class="p ">Two fellow-villagers—young men, named <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">C C C</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D D D</span>—step out and state that
they remember.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The act occurred when the clay was being dug over at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">C D</span>, when the
slip-place for the steamers was begun.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">E E E</span>, of <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">E*</span>, another section of the village of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">R**</span>, questioned by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Did you
see this lad’s hand cut off?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answer:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Yes.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I did not actually see it being cut off.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I came up and saw the severed
hand and the blood lying on the ground.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The people had run away in all directions.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> asked interpreters to ask if there were others who had seen the crime and charged
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> with it.
</p>
<p class="p ">Nearly all those present, about forty persons, nearly all men, shouted out with one
voice that
it was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> who did it.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“They are all sure it was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> here?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Universal response:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Yes; he did it.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> asked the accused <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Did you cut off this boy’s hand?”
</p>
<p class="p ">This question was put in the plainest language, and repeated six times, with the request
that
a plain answer—“yes” or “no”—should be given.
</p>
<p class="p ">The accused failed to answer the question, beginning to talk of other things not relevant
to the
question, such as that his name was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">T T</span> and not <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> and that the people of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">R**</span> had done
bad things to him.
</p>
<p class="p ">He was told to confine himself to the question put to him, that he could talk of other
things
later, but that now it was his place to answer the questions put, just as simply and
plainly
as the others had answered.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He had heard those answers and the charge they levied against
him, and he should answer the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>’s questions in just the same way.
</p>
<p class="p ">The accused continued to speak of irrelevant subjects, and refused or failed to give
any
answer to the question put to him.
</p>
<p class="p ">After repeated attempts to obtain answer to the question:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Did you or did you not cut off
this boy <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>’s hand?”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> states:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“You are charged with this crime.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You refuse to answer the questions I
put to you plainly and straightforwardly as your accusers have done.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You have heard their
accusation.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your refusal to reply as you should reply—viz., yes or no—to a direct and simple
question leaves me convinced that you cannot deny the charge.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You have heard what has been
charged against you by all these people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since you decline to answer as they did, you may
tell your story your own way.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I shall listen to it.”
</p>
<p class="p ">Accused began to speak, but before his remarks could be translated to me through <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">X X</span>
first, to whom he spoke direct, and then through <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">W W</span>, a young man stepped out of the crowd
and interrupted.
</p>
<p class="p ">There was noise and then the man spoke:—</p>
<p class="p ">He stated he was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">F F F</span> of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">R**</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He had shot two antelopes, and he had brought two
of their legs to this sentry as a gift.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The sentry refused to accept them, and tied his wife up.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
The sentry said they were not a sufficient present for him, and he kept <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">F F F</span>’s wife tied up
until he, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">F F F</span>, paid him 1,000 brass rods for her release.
</p>
<p class="p ">Here a young man giving his name as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">G G G</span> stepped into the ring and accused the sentry
of having robbed him openly of two ducks and a dog.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They were taken from him for no
reason save that the sentry wanted them and took them by force.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> again turned to the sentry and invited him to tell his story, and to give his answer
to
the charge against him in his own way.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> enjoined silence on all, and not to interrupt
the sentry.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> stated that he did not take <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">G G G</span>’s ducks.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The father of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">G G G</span> gave him a duck.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
(All laughed.)<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is true that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">F F F</span> killed two antelopes and gave him the two legs as a gift
but he did not tie up his wife or require money for her release.

<span class="fw "><span class="seg center ">80</span></span>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“That is all right.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That finishes the ducks and the antelopes’ legs; but now I want
to hear about <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>’s hand.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tell me what you know about <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>’s hand being cut off.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">K K</span> again evaded the question.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Tell him this.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He is put here by his master in this town, is he not? This is his
town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now, does he say he does not know what goes on here where he lives?”
</p>
<p class="p ">The sentry states:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It is true that this is his town, but he knows nothing about <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>’s hand
being cut off.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Perhaps it was the first sentry here before he came, who was a very bad man and
cut people’s hands off.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That sentry has gone away—it was he who cut hands off, not himself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
He does not know anything of it.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“What was the name then of this bad sentry, your predecessor, who cut people’s
hands off?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You know it?”
</p>
<p class="p ">The sentry gives no direct answer, and the question is repeated.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He then gives a statement
about several sentries, naming three, as predecessors of himself here at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">R**</span>.
</p>
<p class="p ">Here a man named <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">H H H</span> jumped up, interrupting, and asserted that those three sentries
did not reside at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">R**</span>, but had been stationed in his own town—his, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">H H H</span>’s, town.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> (to the sentry):<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“How long have you been in this town?”
</p>

<p class="p ">Answer:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Five months.”
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Do you, then, know this boy <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>?<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Have you seen him before?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answer:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“I do not know him at all.”
</p>
<p class="p ">Here the entire auditory roared with laughter, and expressions of admiration at the
sentry’s
lying powers were given vent to.
</p>
<p class="p ">The sentry, continuing, stated that possibly <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span> comes from <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">H H H</span>’s town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Anyhow, he
(the sentry) does not know <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>; he does not know him at all.
</p>
<p class="p ">Here <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">F F F</span> stepped out and said he was full brother of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span>; they had lived here always.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Their father was <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">U U U</span>, now dead; their mother is also dead.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> (to the sentry):<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Then it is finished.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You know nothing of this matter.”
</p>
<p class="p ">The sentry:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It is finished.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have told you all.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I know nothing of it.”
</p>
<p class="p ">Here a man giving his name as <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I I</span> , of <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">K K*</span>, the neighbouring section of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">R**</span>, came
forward with his wife.
</p>
<p class="p ">He stated that the other sentries in their town were not so bad, but that this man
was a
villain.
</p>
<p class="p ">The sentry had tied up his wife—the woman he brought forward—and had made him
pay 500 rods before she was released.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He had paid the money.
</p>
<p class="p ">Here <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> asked <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">I I</span> how his hand had been cut off.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">C C C</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">D D D</span> stated that
he had first been shot in the arm, and then when he fell down the sentry had cut his
hand off.
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span>:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Did you feel it being cut off?”
</p>
<p class="p ">Answer:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Yes, I felt it.”
</p>
<p class="p ">This terminated the inquiry.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul</span> informed <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Y Y</span> and the people present that he
should report what he had seen and heard to the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="country" title="A country.">Congo</span> Government</span>, and that he should beg them
to investigate the charge against the sentry, who deserved severe punishment for his
illegal and
cruel acts.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The things that the sentry was charged with doing were quite illegal, and if the
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span> of his country knew of such things being done, the perpetrators of such crimes
would, in all cases, be punished.
