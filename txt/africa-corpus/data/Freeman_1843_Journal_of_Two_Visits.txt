INTRODUCTION.
ASHANTI* is a powerful kingdom contiguous to the
Gold Coast, in Western Africa. Kumási, the capital,
it has been calculated, is more than one hundred and
thirty miles from Cape-Coast Castle in an horizontal
direction, but the distance is much greater by the path-
way through the forest. It is a very considerable place,
and is surrounded by numerous towns and villages,
which contain a great number of inhabitants. The
entire population of Ashánti, with all its dependencies,
has been estimated at upwards of four millions.
The martial exploits of the Ashántis in the countries
on the coast, since the commencement of the present
century, have rendered their national name familiar in
Europe. The Fantis, who were originally an inland
people, subject to the Ashánti crown, having, in the
year 1807, afforded protection to Chibbu and Apoutai,
two of the vassal Chiefs of Osai Tutu Quamina, King
of Ashánti, who had rebelled against his authority, the
King invaded Fanti with a powerful army. In the
first instance, he appeared solicitous to obtain possession
of the two rebel Chiefs by amicable means ; but he
* Although we retain the aspirate and the initial A in Ashánti,
they are scarcely sounded by the natives, who pronounce the
name of their country very nearly as the English would express
S-a-n-t-y.
The vowel signs of the Ashánti alphabet have the same sounds
as in Italian.

INTRODUCTION.
became so exasperated by the insults and indignities
which were offered to him, that he formed the resolution
entirely to extirpate the Fantis. Orders were accord-
ingly issued to spare neither man, woman, nor child ; and
the country in the rear of the advancing army became,
in consequence, a scene of utter desolation. Having
signally wreaked his vengeance upon Abrah, the seat of
Government, where his messengers had been barbar-
ously murdered, the King, with one half of his army,
pursued the retreating enemy towards the coast; while
the other half were employed in destroying the towns
as they passed along, leaving none of the people alive,
except some of the highest rank, who were reserved to
experience more refined cruelties on the return of the
conqueror to Kumási.
The advanced guard of the army, led on by the
Viceroy or Tributary King of Denkera, first obtained
sight of the sea in the neighbourhood of Cormantine.
This town was destroyed, and the Dutch fort taken
possession of, by the Ashántis. The successes of the
invaders now began to excite uneasy apprehensions at
Anamabu; and Mr. White, the Governor of the fort,
humanely endeavoured to put a stop to the further
effusion of blood, by friendly explanations. But vain
was the attempt. The King had bound himself by “the
great oath,” that he would not go back to his capital
without the heads of Chibbu and Apoutai ; who, after
the destruction of Abrah, had, in the first instance,
taken refuge at Anamabu, which was then the largest
town upon that part of the coast. As the Ashántis
approached, they, however, retired to Cape Coast, on
the invitation of the natives of that place. When the
King presented himself before Anamabu, he found
that the inhabitants had drawn out their forces to meet
him; but they soon gave way, and were pursued to the

INTRODUCTION.
very walls of the fort, which afforded them only slender
protection. The cannon were shortly rendered useless,
as the Ashánti marksmen picked off the soldiers as fast
as they appeared at an embrasure, or showed their heads
above the ramparts; and, before the close of the day,
the efforts of the little garrison were exclusively confined
to the defence of the gate, which the enemy attempted
to force or burn. At least eight thousand of the natives
perished in the contest, and Mr. White, the Governor of
the fort, was severely wounded. After two or three
days, the King prepared to renew the attack upon the
fort, with six thousand men selected for the occasion ;
but in the morning of the day on which he had vowed
to seat himself, “ by the help of his gods,” in the Go-
vernor's chair, a white flag was lowered from the walls.
A negotiation ensued. The Chief Governor, Torrane,
went over from Cape-Coast Castle, and concluded a
treaty of peace. Apoutai made his escape, but Chibbu
was delivered up to the King, who withdrew his army,
carrying with him many of the surviving inhabitants, as
his prisoners. In the rejoicing which afterwards took
place at the capital, the wretched Chibbu suffered the
most exquisite torments, and his head became one of
the principal decorations of the death-drum of the
King.
In the year 1811, Fanti experienced a second in-
vasion from the Ashántis; and a third in 1816, when
Cape Coast underwent a long blockade. These re-
peated attacks inflicted great miseries upon the Fantis,
and thousands were dragged into the interior to be
sacrificed to the superstitions of the conquerors.
To avert a continued succession of such calamities,
an embassy was sent to Kumási ; and Mr. Bowdich,
who was placed at its head, after the recall of Mr. James,
concluded a treaty with the King. Mr. Hutchinson

was left behind as Resident in Ashánti, but returned
to Cape Coast on the eve of the war with Gaman.
After this, Mr. Dupuis was sent by the British Govern-
ment to Kumási, invested with consular powers. He
concluded a second treaty, and returned to Cape Coast
with numerous presents, accompanied by Ambassadors
to the King of England.
New misunderstandings however arose, and an Ashánti
army again marched towards the coast, at the close of
the year 1823. Sir Charles M'Carthy took the field
against them, with the most encouraging prospect of
success; for, besides a strong body of regular troops
which was under his command, many Chiefs threw off
their allegiance to Ashánti, and all the districts on the
sea-coast, west of the Volta, were in arms, to the amount
of thirty thousand warriors. But disastrous was the result
of the first campaign. The Governor, with a division of
the army, having crossed the Prah, advanced into the
Wassaw country, where he engaged the Ashántis, and
experienced a complete defeat. Sir Charles himself,
after having been severely wounded, fell into the hands
of the enemy, who cut off his head, and preserved it in
the usual manner. His heart was eaten by the prin-
cipal Ashánti Chiefs, in order that they might, as they
imagined, imbibe his bravery; and his flesh, having
been dried, was divided, together with his bones,
amongst the men of consequence in the army, who kept
their respective shares about their persons, as charms to
inspire them with courage.
In the month of May following, the new King, Osai
Ockoto, (the brother of Osai Tutu Quamina, who had
died soon after the commencement of the war,) came
down to his army, at the head of a strong reinforce-
ment, with the avowed intention to destroy Cape-Coast
Castle, and drive the English into the sea. After some

hard fighting, and when the Ashánti army had suffered
the loss of many thousands of men, by the ravages of
disease, and the want of provisions, the King drew off
his forces in the direction of Anamabu. The last and
decisive battle was fought about the middle of the year
1826, twenty-four miles north-east of Akráh ; when the
British and their allies gained the victory, and took the
Ashánti camp and baggage. After this battle, nego-
tiations were commenced; but, owing to various causes,
it was not until the month of April, 1831, that a treaty
of peace was signed, when the King sent one of his
sons, and a son of the preceding King, as hostages, with
six hundred ounces of gold, to be lodged at Cape-Coast
Castle, as a security for the performance, on his part, of
the conditions of the treaty, for the term of six years.
At the end of six years, the gold was returned ; and the
present King, Quako Duah, who had in the mean time
succeeded his brother, Osai Ockoto, consented that his
nephews, who had been given up as hostages, should be
sent to England for education.
It was shortly after the execution of this treaty, that
the land which had been so awfully desolated by war,
was visited, in the order of Divine Providence, with
the blessings of the Gospel of peace. The Wesleyan
Missionary Committee were led to accept the generous
offer of Captain Potter, of Bristol, to take a Missionary
in his vessel, free of expense to the Society; and, in
the year 1834, the Rev. Joseph Dunwell was sent on a
visit of observation to Cape-Coast Castle. He was
welcomed by many of the natives with gratitude and
affection; and his faithful labours among them were
crowned with signal success. The work which thus so
auspiciously commenced, since his lamented death has
extended along the Gold Coast eastward, as far as
Akráh, and westward to Discove ; several chapels have

INTRODUCTION.
been built; and upwards of six hundred converts from
Heathenism have been united in church-fellowship.
Interesting as this Mission appears, when viewed in
its beneficial effects upon the natives of the Gold Coast,
it, however, rises in importance when regarded as the
means by which the way has been opened for the in-
troduction of the Gospel into Ashánti. A beneficial
influence was exerted by Mr. Dunwell's ministry upon
the two Ashánti hostages, before they were brought by
the Government to this country, where they completed
their education under the care of the Rev. Thomas
Pyne, a Clergyman of the Established Church. And
the establishment of the Mission at length furnished the
facilities by which the Rev. Mr. Freeman was enabled
to visit Kumási, in the commencement of the year 1839.
- On the receipt, at the Wesleyan Mission-House in
London, of Mr. Freeman's Journal of his visit, the
question, “What shall be done?” became the subject
of grave consideration on the part of the Missionary
Committee, under whose direction Mr. Freeman acted.
The ordinary annual income of the Society was already
pledged for the support of existing Missions; and yet
the Committee durst not take upon themselves the re-
sponsibility of refusing to attempt, at least, the estab-
lishment of a Mission in Ashánti. It was at length
resolved, that Mr. Freeman should be allowed to return
home for a time, partly for the purpose of recruiting his
health, but more particularly with a view to a special
effort being made, in order to raise the funds neces-
sary for the new undertaking; and two Missionaries
were immediately sent to relieve him, for a time, from
his laborious duties at the Gold Coast. On the arrival
of the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Mycock, and the Rev. Mr.
Brooking, Mr. Freeman, therefore, came to England,
accompanied by Mr. William De Graft, a native convert,


## p. 7 (#21) ###############################################

INTRODUCTION.
and was the bearer of a message from the King of
Ashánti, who requested that his two nephews might
be immediately sent home; the contemplated establish-
ment of a Christian school at Kumási having rendered
him very anxious to see them.
The results of Mr. Freeman's visit to several of the
principal towns in Great Britain and Ireland were of the
most gratifying description. Members of the Church
of England, some of whom are in the higher walks of
life, and Christians of other religious denominations, as
well as the members of the Wesleyan community, re-
sponded to the novel and deeply-interesting appeal ;
and, by these united exertions, the proposed sum of
£5,000 was placed at the disposal of the Wesleyan
Committee, to enable them to send with Mr. Freeman,
on his return, six additional Missionaries, in order to
strengthen the existing establishments at the Gold
Coast, and to commence a new Mission in the kingdom
of Ashánti. Arrangements were made in due season
for their outfit and departure; and, at Mr. Freeman's
suggestion, the Committee agreed so far to comply with
the established African custom of offering presents, as
to send for the King's acceptance and use, a suitable
carriage, which was noticed with approbation by Her
Most Gracious Majesty and His Royal Highness Prince
Albert, to whose inspection it was submitted by Mr.
Sims, the builder. In the month of December, 1840,
the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Freeman embarked at Gravesend,
on board the “Osborne,” accompanied by the Rev. Mr.
and Mrs. Hesk, the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Shipman, the
Revs. Messrs. Watson, Walden, and Thackwray, and
Mr. William De Graft, whom the Committee had re-
ceived as a regular agent of the Society, to be hereafter
wholly employed in the work of the Mission; and, after
a few days, the party left the Channel, followed by the

INTRODUCTION.
best wishes and ardent prayers of thousands who had
become deeply interested in their arduous enterprise.
On their arrival at the Gold Coast, Mr. Freeman
began to make the necessary preparations for proceeding
to Kumási, at the proper season of the year. While
thus employed, he received a severe shock from the
decease of his beloved wife, who was eminently calcu-
lated, by her piety and talents, to aid him in his import-
ant operations; and this bereavement was followed by
other inroads of disease and death into the Mission
family. At the close of the rainy season, he was
enabled to complete his arrangements, and started
for the Ashánti capital, accompanied by the two Ashanti
Princes, William Quantamissah and John Ansah, (who
had returned to the Coast in one of the vessels of the
Niger expedition,) Henry Smith, Esq., a resident at
Cape-Coast, and the Rev. Mr. Brooking.
The results of this journey, as detailed in Mr.
Freeman's Second Journal, are of a very gratifying cha-
racter. The Mission in Ashánti has been commenced
under circumstances still more satisfactory than could
have been reasonably anticipated, from the narrative,
encouraging as it was, of his former visit to Kumási ;
circumstances which warrant the hope, that a consider-
able measure of success will be realized at no distant
period. After the reader has perused the heart-stirring
description which Mr. Freeman gives of his reception,
and the opening prospects of the new Mission, he will
not be surprised that Mr. Freeman should manifest an
intense desire, that adequate means should be provided
to improve the opportunities which present themselves.
He will not wonder that the Missionary who nobly
“jeopards his life unto the death in the high places of
the” West African Mission “field," and who has the
most vivid perception of the glorious victories which are

likely, with suitable aid, to be effected in furtherance
of the kingdom of Christ, should thus give expression
to his benevolent feelings, in one of his recent letters
addressed to the Wesleyan Missionary Committee:-
“O that we had more help here! What distressing
obstacles it throws in the way of our usefulness !
England is doing nothing, as yet, compared with what
she ought to do. O that God would raise up another
successful ‘Peter the Hermit,' to call Christian England,
and her Christian allies of Europe, to engage more
effectually in a grand spiritual warfare ; not in order to
rescue a lifeless sepulchre from the hands of heretics,
but to snatch millions of immortal spirits, in Africa,
from the iron grasp of Satan, and thus transform the
ancient chivalry of Britain into burning zeal for the
glory of the God of heaven, in the evangelization of
the degraded posterity of Ham! In this, success would
be certain; and the Christian Crusader, if I may be
allowed to call him by that name, would enjoy a present
reward, in the happy consciousness that he was saving
souls from death. I trust the day is not far distant
when some mightier movements will take place in the
Christian camp, and when England will do something
for Africa worthy of her knowledge, her piety, and her
greatness. Her energies are inexhaustible, and she is at
present doing comparatively nothing."

REV. AND DEAR SIRS,
ACCORDING to the promise in my last, I embrace the
opportunity of sending you, per brig“ Maclean," a copy
of my Journal during my recent Mission to Ashanti,
with a few accompanying remarks.
Before I commence, however, I beg leave briefly to
state my object in undertaking such a work, and the
prospects I had at my setting out.
Ever since my arrival on this Station, I had felt
very anxious to visit Kumási, the capital of Ashánti, and
residence of the King. The tales of horror, wretched-
ness, and cruelty which I had often heard respecting
the Ashántis, wrought in my mind the deepest com-
miseration, and a constant restlessness to commence
Missionary operations among them.
Opposed to this project were, First, The fears of a
large majority of our members, as to the results of such

FIRST JOURNAL OF
an enterprise, concerning my health. Secondly, The
very heavy expenses attending such a journey. Thirdly,
The doubts of many with whom I conversed on the
subject, that I should not succeed even in an attempt to
get to Kumási, on account of the almost unconquerable
jealousies of the King. Fourthly, The strong claims of
our societies on the coast ; from which, in the event of
my undertaking the journey, I must in all probability
be absent from two to three months. And, lastly, The
importance of my being at Cape Coast on the arrival of
a fellow-labourer, whom I had for several weeks been
expecting.
The first obstacle was removed by our members
gaining a steady and increasing confidence, that God
would preserve me, (if I endeavoured to take care of
my health,) and bring me back in safety.
The second obstacle was removed by a promise, on
the part of our societies on the coast, to render me all
possible assistance by their prayers and contributions.
The third obstacle was removed by a promise of all
necessary assistance on the part of His Excellency
President Maclean.
My fourth obstacle was removed, by the expectation
that a new Missionary would arrive in the course of a
few weeks at the latest; and also by my obtaining the
assistance of an excellent young man, (Mr. W. De
Graft,) who was ready to take charge of the Mission-
house, of our societies, &c., during my absence; and,
My fifth obstacle was, in a measure, removed by
considering that I could write a long letter, by way of
information and instruction, and leave it at the Mission-
house for my fellow-labourer on his arrival.
Having, therefore, determined on commencing my
journey without delay, I immediately began to prepare
myself, by packing up a supply of provisions, hiring

hammock-men, carriers, &c. ; while President Maclean
kindly provided me with two soldiers, (a Sergeant and
a private,) to conduct me; and also placed in my hand
a letter of recommendation to the King of Ashánti.
Deeply sensible of the difficult and dangerous nature
of my undertaking, and not forgetful of that eternal
Source from whence I must receive all my strength,
both physical and spiritual, I took an affectionate leave
of our society at Cape Coast, on Tuesday evening;
January 29th, 1839; and on the following morning,
January 30th, at half-past seven, I left Cape Coast
for Kumási, and reached Anamabu at noon.
In the afternoon I made arrangements for starting
for Domonási the following morning. Domonási is not
in the direct road to Ashánti ; but as it is not far out of
the way, I chose to call and visit our societies there,
before I left the Circuit.
Thursday, 31st.— At eight, A. M., I proceeded on my
way to Domonási, where I arrived early in the afternoon,
a little unwell; the heavy anxieties which I had felt
for several days, on account of leaving for the interior,
having brought on a slight fever. Here I rested until
the following afternoon, hoping to recover strength.
February 1st, Friday.—At three, P. M., I proceeded
to Yankumási, where I arrived at a quarter past five,
and immediately repaired to the residence of Asín
Chibbu, the Chief of the town and surrounding country.
He received me very kindly, provided me with lodgings
for the night, and made me a present of a sheep and
some green plantains.
Saturday, 2d.--At ten, A. M., I again resumed my
journey, Asín Chibbu providing me with four men and
a boy, to assist in carrying my luggage to my next
lodging-place, gratis.

yet seen in Fanti, and it is kept remarkably clean.
Asín Chibbu is a young man of more respectable ap-
pearance than many of the Chiefs of the country.
During my short stay, I had some conversation with
him concerning the worship of the true God. He
paid attention to what I said, and appeared to be void
of that obstinacy which characterizes many of the Fanti
Chiefs and Kabosirs, when conversed with on religious
subjects. There are many hundreds of souls in Yan-
kumási, to whom much lasting good might be done, by
a Teacher residing among them, who is zealous for the
glory of God, in the eternal welfare of the people.
At three, P. M., I reached the town of Mansu, and
was very kindly received by the Chief and his Captains.
Finding myself feverish, with a violent headache, I
thought it prudent to have recourse to medicine. Before
I retired to rest, Gabri (the Chief) sent me a present, con-
sisting of a good sheep, some plantains, and pine-apples.
His mother also sent me some yams and plantains.
Sunday, 3d.—Much better in health, and my fever
nearly gone. At four, P. M., I preached the word of
life to the Chief and his Captains, and to many of the
people, on, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature.” Considering their ignorant
condition, they behaved very well. I do not remember
that I ever witnessed a more soul-refreshing and interest-
ing scene, than that which took place at the close of the
sermon. The sublime truths concerning the mysterious
plan of human redemption,—God becoming incarnate
and dying to save his rebellious creatures, and to bring
them to eternal glory,—made such an impression on
the minds of the Chief and his Captains, that they could
not contain themselves; but spreading abroad their
hands, and lifting up their voices, they acknowledged
the lovingkindness of God, and declared before many of

their people who were present, that they would worship
Him; and I verily believe they would, if they could be
watched over, and attended to continually, by a Mis-
sionary or Teacher. “The harvest truly is great, but
the labourers are few.” O God of love! wilt thou not
undertake for these souls ? Save them from the power
of the enemy, and strengthen the hands of the few, very
few, labourers in this extensive vineyard! Is it not of
thine own planting ?
“Art thou the God of Jews alone,
And not the God of Gentiles too?
To Gentiles make thy goodness known;
Thy judgments to the nations show;
Awake them by the Gospel call:
Light of the world, illumine all!”.
They are as the dry bones in the valley. But, O, thou
Fountain of Life! thou Spirit of eternal truth! breathe
upon these slain, that they may live !
Monday, 4th.–At a quarter past seven, A. M., I left
Mansu, and proceeded on my way to Fessu. Our path
lay through a dense forest, abounding in lofty silk-
cotton and other trees, and many handsome varieties of
Fern. Many small rivulets nearly dried up by the long
drought, remind me that I am in a torrid clime. At
five, P. M., I reached Fessu.
Tuesday, 5th.—At seven, A. M., I left Fessu, and
reached my next resting-place, Beraku, at five, P. M.
Fessu and Beraku are both small crooms, or villages,
belonging to Mansu.
Wednesday, 6th.—At a quarter past six, A. M., I
started from Beraku for the river Prah,* which I
reached nine minutes before nine. The river, the
largest I have yet seen in Africa, with its thickly-

wooded banks, abounding in Palm-trees and Mimosæ,
presented a beautifully picturesque and interesting
scene. When it is at its greatest height, its depth may
be about thirty or forty feet, and its breadth about
ninety yards. Near the crossing-place, its bed is rocky.
As it was very low, I could see many large pieces of
granite above the surface of the water. The river Prah
forms the boundary, between the Fanti country, and the
dominions of the King of Ashánti. On the Fanti side
of the river is a small town, called Prahsu. Here I
halted until the following morning, that my people
might have an opportunity of refreshing themselves by
bathing, &c.
In the course of the day, my interpreter had the
misfortune to cut his foot with an oyster-shell, while
bathing in the river, which made him almost incapable
of walking for two or three days. I was, therefore,
obliged to relieve him, by walking more than usual
myself, that he might ride in my travelling-chair. I
was soon, however, obliged to hire four extra men, to
carry him in a basket, which I had the precaution to
take with me, besides ny chair, as my heels became
so sore with boils, occasioned by the intensity of the
heat, that I was little able to walk myself. The road
also was exceedingly bad, being in many places not
more than nine inches wide, full of holes, and roots of
trees rising above the ground.
The whole of the Fanti country through which I
passed, from within a mile or two of Cape-Coast Castle,
as far as the river Prah, a distance of about eighty-five
miles, is covered with luxuriant vegetation, consisting of
Plantains, Bananas, Palms, Bamboos, Pines, many large
forest-trees, covered with climbers, Epiphytical Orchi-
deæ, and Ferns. Among the shrubs and herbaceous
plants, I noticed a very pretty variety of Croton ; also

Lantana Odorata, and a species of Gardenia Hedychium,
or garland-flower, Canna Indica, and a handsome blue va-
riety of Maranta, the leaves of which were, on the upper
side, of a pale green colour, and underneath a bright
purple. My ears were charmed with the notes of some
of the feathered songsters of the forest ; * and my atten-
tion was also arrested by the well-known sound of the
woodman's hook and axe, employed to clear small tracts
of ground in the forest, for the cultivation of yams, &c.
Thursday, 7th.—At seven, A. M., I crossed the Prah
in a large, heavy canoe, and journeyed through a country
formerly inhabited by the Asins, a people who were
incorporated with Ashánti, until the late war between
the Ashántis and the British, when they threw off their
allegiance, and took refuge in Fanti, under the protec-
tion of the latter. In the evening I reached Anso, a
small croom, where I halted for the night.
Throughout the day the harmattan was very strong,
painfully affecting my eyes, and producing a sensa-
tion like what is felt with a violenţ cold in the head.
During the night I slept in a small hut; and having
nothing but thin strips of Bamboo tied close together, to
supply the place of walls, I felt the cold damps severely,
although I lined this frail dwelling with a blanket and
sheet. I was also mortified in the morning, to find that
a rat had eaten some of my hammock-strings, which
almost rendered it unfit for use.
Friday, 8th.—At seven, A. M., I started for Quisah,
the first town of any importance on the Ashánti side
of the Prah, where I arrived at five, P. M. Immedi-
ately before entering Quisah, I passed over a hill, the

ascent of which occupied seventeen minutes. This
hill is, I think, the highest of a long chain, which
forms the boundary between Ashánti Proper, and the
Asín country. Were it not for the thick bush which
covers the summit of this hill, a very extensive prospect of
part of the Ashánti and Asín countries might be obtained.
Its soil is very rich, consisting of a mixture of yellow loam
and clay. A spring of the most delicious water I ever
tasted, rises about half-way up the hill, as far as I could
judge ; and after tumbling down its rocky bed of granite,
flows by the small town of Quisah. The Asín country,
though possessing a very rich and fertile soil, and covered
with luxuriant vegetation, presents one unbroken scene
of desolation, except here and there a few huts occupied
by Ashántis, whom the King sends to take care of the
path.*
I had not been in Quisah more than an hour, when
I was informed by the Chief, that I could proceed no
farther into the Ashánti country without obtaining
permission from the Chief of Adansi, who resides at
Fomunah, a neat little town, about a mile distant from
Quisah. Being provided with a lodging-place, I halted
here for the night. I was delighted to find in Quisah
several Fantis, members of our society, who had come
hither for trading purposes.
Saturday, 9th.—This morning the Chief informed
me that Korinchi, the Chief of Fomunah, had sent
for him, in order to converse with him respecting me;
and shortly afterwards a messenger arrived requesting
* If we compare this brief account of Fanti and Asin with that
given by Bowdich, (pages 23, 24,) we shall perceive, that the

doned by its rightful owners, is in ruins.

me to go over and visit him, which I immediately
prepared to do. When I entered the town, Korinchi
was sitting before the front of his house, under his large
umbrella, waiting to receive me; his Captains and
people occupying the ground on his right and left.
After the usual compliments on meeting, he asked me
what object I had in view, in wishing to pass up to
Kumási. I told him I had nothing to do with trade
or palavers, but was come into the country to promote
the best interests of the King of Ashánti and his people,
by directing them in the way of peace and happiness,
through the preaching of the Gospel. He said he
should like to hear the Gospel in his town, before I
proceeded any farther into the country. I hereupon
proceeded to speak to him, and all present, on the being
of a God. I commenced, by taking into my hand a
leaf which had fallen from a Banyan-tree, under which
I was standing, and asking them if they could make
one like it; and they answered, Debida, "No." I
then asked them, if they thought it possible for all
the wisdom, power, and genius in the world, united,
to make such a leaf : they answered again, Debida.
Having brought them to this conclusion, I directed
their attention to the almighty power, mercy, and truth
of “God, who made the world and all things therein ;”
and spoke to them on the nature of the Christian
religion. They readily assented to all I said ; and
Korinchi requested me to pay them a visit on the
morrow, that they might hear more from me concern-
ing the Christian religion. On my remarking, that as
I was a Minister of Christ, I could not prudently make
them presents according to the usual custom, it being
beneath the dignity of Christianity, so truly excellent in
itself, that it requires no recommendation, except a
conviction of its value; he answered, “We do not

FIRST JOURNAL OF
desire any of the customary presents from you, but
wish rather to become acquainted with the Gospel.” I
then asked him, when I could proceed to Kumási, to
which he answered that I should know more about it
on the morrow.
Sunday, 10th.—At three, P. M., I again went over to
Fomunah to preach the word of life, followed by the
Chief of Quisah. I took my station in the same place
on which I stood the preceding day. Korinchi and
his people soon made their appearance, and I com-
menced divine service, by giving out some verses of the
hymn,-
“Plunged in a gulf of dark despair,” &c.
I had a goodly number of our people with me, who
assisted in singing the praises of God. After a short
prayer in Fanti by my interpreter, we sung the first
verse of the hymn,-
“Lord over all, if thou hast made,
Hast ransom'd, every soul of man;"
after which I preached from Mark xvi. 15; when I
explained more fully the nature of the Gospel, and
gave them many arguments to prove the divine origin
of the Bible. Solemnity sat on their faces, and the
deepest attention was paid to the grand and awful
truths which were laid before them: every minute
almost did they utter a hearty Eou, “ Yes,” by way of
giving their assent. At the conclusion of the sermon,
Korinchi and his Captains said it was a “good palaver.”
On my telling them, that I had not laid before them a
thousandth part of the sublime truths contained in the
Bible, they said they should like to hear more of them;
and especially what Yankumpon, “God,” liked, and what
he disliked; and seemed much pleased when I told them,

21
that I should be happy to preach to them again when-
ever they pleased.
Knowing their jealous disposition, I thought it pru-
dent to make them as sensible as I possibly could of
the disinterested character of my Mission. I therefore
told them, that it was my love to God, and the souls of
my fellow-creatures, which caused me to leave my
happy native land, and come among them; and that
this love was the fruit of my having embraced Chris-
tianity, as I was once as ignorant of practical religion
as they were, and did not feel the desire to benefit my
fellow-men, until I had repented of my own sins, and
turned to God. On hearing this, they were struck
with astonishment, and said that the religion which I
thus recommended to them from practical experience
was good. There were about five hundred persons
present.
Monday, 11th.--I am still detained at Quisah, wait-
ing for an answer from the King of Ashánti, to the
information sent him the other day concerning me. I
find this delay to be a heavy trial, as I am anxious to
return to our societies on the coast as early as possible.
I trust, however, that it is the Lord's doing, and will
be productive of future good.
· Tuesday, 12th.—The harmattan is very strong, and
the air so cold, that the thermometer has been down as
low as 66° (Fahrenheit) at eight o'clock in the morning
for several days past. This į find very trying to my
constitution; my lodging-place being a small hut, or
open shed, with a thatch of Palm-leaves, so thin, that I
can see through it in many places. I am continually
taking cold; but I trust that I shall be preserved for
usefulness in this dangerous climate. I often see many
of my people shivering with cold at six o'clock in the
morning, mụch more than I have seen in England in

the month of January. To-day Korinchi again sent
for me; and shortly after my arrival at his residence, a
messenger arrived from Kumási with the King's com-
pliments ; also a present of nine ackies of gold-dust,
£2. 5s. currency, and a promise from the King, that he
would send for me in a few days, during which time
the messenger is to stay with me. Korinchi having
made me the offer of waiting the King's pleasure at
Fomunah, instead of Quisah, I readily embraced it, as
Fomunah is much larger, more open, and healthy. I.
consequently removed to Fomunah in the evening.
Wednesday, 13th.—Since my arrival in Ashánti, the
Fetishmen seem to have taken the alarm. A day or
two back, the Quisah Fetishman said, that the town
was in danger of being destroyed by fire, and that they
must make Fetish to ward off the danger. On my way
to Fomunah on Sunday last, I saw the path literally
strewed with offerings to Fetish; consisting of boiled
eggs, beads, plantains, &c. This is the work of those
wretched Fetishmen, whose employment is to impose
on the ignorance and weakness of the poor deluded
people.
Thursday, 14th.–At eight, A. M., Korinchi sent to
my lodgings, requesting me to pay him a visit. I
immediately repaired to his house, where I found him
seated with his Captains, ready to receive me. He
informed me that they were waiting to hear me explain
some of the truths of Christianity. Knowing the in-
jurious effects of talking much in this climate with an
empty stomach, I asked Korinchi to excuse me for a
few minutes, while I stepped home to take my break-
fast, which I was about to do at the moment he sent
for me. After hastily doing this, I again repaired to
Korinchi's house, and conversed with him and his
Captains on the doctrine of the general resurrection ;

on which subject their minds seemed very much con-
fused. By divine assistance I succeeded in convincing
them of the possibility of such an event; after which I
directed their attention to the doctrine of future rewards
and punishments.
Friday, 15th.--About eight, A. M., Korinchi sent to
make every inquiry respecting my Mission, as he was
about to send another messenger to the King; upon
which I furnished him with all necessary information,
and handed to him my letter of recommendation from
President Maclean to the King, with which he des-
patched the messenger in the course of the day.
Saturday, 16th.–At eight, A. M., Korinchi paid me
a visit at my lodgings. I swung my hammock (having
repaired it, so as again to be fit for use) under a large
Banyan-tree in the principal street in the town; where
a group of the natives soon collected around me. I fell
into conversation with them concerning some super-
stitious offerings, which consisted of soup made with
the palm-nut, eggs, &c., which I saw preparing near
me, for a present to the Fetish. Upon my questioning
them on the subject, they seemed confident that it was
just and right for them to do so; but when I pointed
out to them the folly of these heathenish observances,
&c., they seemed convinced of it, and said their Fetish-
men told them nonsense, and deceived them.
Sunday, 17th.— Blessed be God, through whose good
providence I was born in a Christian country!
“ Thine's the sabbath-peace, my land !
And thine the guarded hearth.”
How amazing the difference between England and
Ashánti! Here no village bell, sweetly sounding “ across
the daisied mead,” invites the humble Christian to the
sanctuary of God! Here it may be presumed) no

hymn of praise ascends from the natives of this country
to their Creator ; no house of prayer is seen standing
with its doors wide open, inviting man to share in its
sacred immunities! May the happy day soon arrive,
when even over this sanguinary country, the olive-wand
of sacred peace shall be triumphantly extended !
In the afternoon I sent to inform Korinchi that we
were about to commence the worship of God at my
lodgings; and that I should be glad if he would join
us. He immediately came, attended by his Captains,
&c. God was present with us, by the gracious influence
of his Holy Spirit on our hearts, and the minds of
many present appeared deeply impressed with the
solemnity of the service.
Monday, 18th. In the evening, one of Korinchi's
Captains made me a present of a pot of palm-wine.
Tuesday, 19th.- Last night a sister of Korinchi died,
after a long sickness. Her death was announced by
the firing of muskets, and the “mourners going about
the streets.” When an Ashánti of any distinction dies,
several of the deceased's slaves are sacrificed. This
horrible custom originates in some shadowy ideas of a
future state of existence; in which they imagine that
those who have departed hence, stand in need of
food, clothing, &c., as in the present world ; and that
as a vast number of concubines, slaves, &c., are the
chief marks of superiority among them here, so it
must also be in a future state. Accordingly, as I
walked out early in the morning, I saw the mangled
corpse of a poor female slave, who had been beheaded
during the night, lying in the public street. It was
partially covered with a common mat, (made from the
stem of the Plantain-tree,) and, as this covering is
unusual, I concluded that it was thrown over, in order
to hide it from my view. In the course of the day I

THE REV. T. B. FREEMAN.
25
saw groups of the natives dancing round this victim of
superstitious cruelty, with numerous frantic gestures,
and who seemed to be in the very zenith of their
happiness. In the evening I was informed, that as
Korinchi and his Captains did not wish me to see any
more headless trunks lying in the streets, they have not
sacrificed others during the day, but would most pro-
bably do so in the night. I am happy to say, how-
ever, that I could not ascertain that any more sacrifices
were made. That only one person was immolated, I
believe, resulted entirely from my presence in the town.
In the afternoon I received a present of palm-wine,
plantains, yams, and pine-apples, from one of the King
of Ashánti's sisters, who is paying a visit in a distant
croom, her place of general residence being Kumási.
Throughout the day, I saw females fantastically dressed,
with their faces and shoulders daubed over with red
ochre, parading the town as mourners for Korinchi's
sister.
Friday, 22d.-My interpreter informed me, that, as
he was going from Fomunah to Quisah, he saw the
mangled trunk of the poor female slave lying in a ditch,
a few hundred yards from the town; and that at the time
she was beheaded, she was in the prime of her days
Thus exposed to public view, in a ditch near the
common road, the corpse, deprived of its head, must
lie and putrefy, unless the turkey-buzzards, or some
beast of prey, devour it.
Othou God of Missions, who willest not that any
should perish, but that all should come to the know-
ledge of the truth, have mercy upon these benighted
people! May thine everlasting Gospel speedily spread
itself through the length and breadth of this land, and
chase the demon from these his dark abodes of cruelty !

tune was played through the town, to collect the people
together for the finishing of the “custom” for Korinchi's
sister. In the afternoon, nearly all the principal persons
in the town were dressed in their gayest attire: a large
group of them was collected under the Fetish-tree, to
see and hear the Fetishman, while he made his orations,
and danced to the sound of several drums, which were
played by females. The appearance of the Fetishman
was very much like that of a “clown :" his face was
daubed with white clay; he had a large iron chain
hanging around his neck,* which seemed to be worn
as a necklace; around his legs were tied bunches
of Fetish; and he held in his hand an immense
knife, about fifteen inches long, and two and a half
broad. Sometimes he danced with many frantic ges-
tures ; and at other times stood, gazing around him
with every indication of a vacant mind. While I was
at a distance, looking at him, he set out, and ran to a
distance of about a hundred yards. Anxious to keep
him in sight, I walked forward, past a small shed, which
would have concealed him from me, and saw him
standing with a musket at his shoulder, taking aim at a
turkey-buzzard on a tree hard by. Having fired with-
out hitting his mark, he returned to the tree from
whence he started, and began to make a speech to the
people.
It is at these public meetings, that such men deliver
to the poor credulous people, the messages which they
pretend to have received from the Fetish ; which mes-
sages are esteemed by the great body of the inhabitants
as sterling truth. O man, into what an awful state of
degradation art thou fallen!
* I tried some time afterwards to get this chain of the Fetish-
man as a curiosity, but could not succeed.

Sunday, 24th.–At a quarter past seven, A. M., I
conducted divine service at my quarters. Several of
our members from Cape Coast (who are trading in the
neighbourhood) attended. During the service, Korinchi
came to pay me a visit, but did not stay until the con-
clusion. He looked wild and confused, having been up
during the whole of the last night, finishing the "custom"
for his sister. I believe that almost every person in the
town was up also. All whom I saw, as I walked out
in the evening, had a sottish appearance. At half-past
four, I again conducted divine service at my place
of abode. To screen myself from the oppressive heat
of the day, I went to my usual spot for retirement, on
the skirts of the forest, intending to swing my hammock
to some of the trees, and remain there until towards
evening. As I approached the place, I found that the
air had a putrid smell ; which reminded me, that I was
not far from the ditch where the body of the sacrificed
female was thrown : prudence, therefore, obliged me to
return, as I could find no other place sufficiently quiet
on the one hand, and free from large ants and snakes
on the other.
Tuesday, 26th. I went into the forest, where I saw
some large monkeys, and several kinds of birds of the
most exquisitely-beautiful plumage.
Wednesday, 27th.—I had a long conversation with
some of the natives on the subject of the general resur-
rection, and of the injury done to their country by
human sacrifices. Many of them seem to have an utter
dislike to this horrid practice; while others are sunk into
such a state of apathy, that they are altogether indif-
ferent about it, though their lives, as well as others', are
continually in danger.
Thursday, 28th.—I paid Korinchi a visit, and rea- .
soned with him closely on the painful consequences of
c 2

human sacrifices, and"customs” for the dead. He readily
acknowledged the evil, and expressed himself ready to
abolish it, if he were at full liberty so to do; but he
feared the King. The only reason he could give for
making “customs” in addition to human sacrifices, for
the dead, was, that they felt very unhappy when they
lost their relatives and friends, and were glad to have
recourse to drunkenness, or any thing which would
drive gloomy thoughts from their minds for a season:
As he thus gave me a good opportunity of directing
him to the only refuge for a troubled mind,—the con-
solations of true religion,-I told him, God alone was
able to sustain under afflictions and bereavements. He
seemed affected with what I said to him. In the even-
ing he sent me a present, consisting of a sheep, yams,
and plantains.
March 1st, Friday.- Early last evening the Fetish-
man called many of the people together, and continued
beating his drum all night; the noise of which disturbed
me so much, that I had little sleep; consequently, I
arose this morning so unwell, that I was under the
necessity of retiring to bed immediately after breakfast.
Saturday, 2d.-To-day another human victim was
sacrificed, on account of the death of a person of rank.
As I was going out of the town, in the cool of the even-
ing, I saw the poor creature lying on the ground. The
head was severed from the body, and lying at a short
distance from it: several large turkey-buzzards were
feasting on the wounds, and rolling the head in the
dust. He appeared to be about eighteen years of age ;
a strong, healthy youth, who might, in all probability,
have lived forty, fifty, or even sixty years longer. As I
returned into the town, I found that they had dragged
the body to a short distance, and put it into the ditch
where the female was thrown the other day. On my

conversing with the natives concerning the horrible
nature of human sacrifices, they said, they did not like
them, and wished they could be done away. While
the body was lying in the public street, many of the
people were looking on, with the greatest indifference :
indeed, they are so familiar with these awful and bloody
scenes, that they think as little of them, yea, not so
much, as they would of seeing a dead sheep, monkey,
or dog.
Sunday, 3d.--About half-past seven, A. M., I con-
ducted divine service at my lodgings, and also at half-
past four, P. M. God was in the midst of us.
Tuesday, 5th.—This afternoon I received letters, con-
taining some very interesting intelligence concerning
our societies on the coast. Blessed be God, all is well
with them.
Thursday, 14th. As I was returning home from my
afternoon exercise, (a walk in the forest,) I saw a
splendid species of Epidendrum clinging to a tree, at
a considerable height from the ground. Anxious to
obtain it, I sent a person up the tree for that purpose,
who, while in the act of pulling it off, espied a venomous
snake in a hole nearly close to his hand. It did not,
however, attempt to bite him, (though one of the worst
kind of snakes,) and the man, having obtained the plant,
descended in safety. The country abounds in such
reptiles.

APPETITE FOR BLOOD — PREACHING, AND FURTHER PROCEEDINGS AT
FOMUNAH -OBSTACLES TO ADVANCING FURTHER IN ASHANTI-RETURN
TO QUISAH.
SATURDAY, 16th.— The Ashántis are very fond of
eating the blood of beasts. This I learned from a scene
which I witnessed this morning. Having agreed to
purchase part of an ox, which was brought into the
town for sale, I felt curiosity to see their method of
slaughtering. Soon after break of day, the owner sent
to inform me, that they were ready to slaughter the
ox; but as I was afraid of the damps, (much rain
having fallen during the night,) I sent my interpreter
to see it killed, who returned to inform me, that the
beast was too strong for them; and that, instead of
tying it down, and cutting the throat, they would be
obliged to shoot it. I put on my cloak, and repaired to
the place where the beast was, to see how they would
proceed : it was standing about twenty yards from the
man who was preparing to shoot it. The first shot
was fired without effect; the second wounded it in the
shoulder; which they no sooner perceived, than forty
or fifty men surrounded it; some caught it by the
horns, others by the tail, and endeavoured to drag it
along the ground to a convenient place for cutting it
up. The beast, however, soon recovered strength, and,
rising up, kicked one man down, and made the others
escape in every direction. On seeing this, I loaded my
fowling-piece with a ball, and shot it in the head, which
soon arrested its progress. It was no sooner on the
ground, than the greatest uproar ensued. A number

of them (ten or twelve) stood over the animal with
immense knives, which they flourished around them,
while quarrelling about the blood; a few of them wished
to cut off the head immediately, while the others were
desirous of catching as much blood as they could
before it died. I verily believe, for the sake of the
blood, they would have allowed the ox to bleed and
suffer for half an hour, if I had not been present urging
them to kill it. On inquiring why they clamoured for
the blood in such a manner, I learned that they are
fond of it, and make stews with it. Their chief food,
however, is soup made from the palm-nut, boiled with
dried fish, or the flesh of the monkey ; to which they
add a kind of pudding, (native name, foofoo,) made
with the green fruit of the Plantain-tree, (Musa Para-
disiaca,) which they first boil, and then pound with a
large wooden pestle in a mortar. These mills are to be
heard going in almost every house, during certain hours
of the day. This work is generally performed by fe-
males, one of them using the pestle, and the other
keeping the food in a lump, by plying it with her hands,
that the pestle may act more effectually. The same
method is practised in Fanti ; but the Fantis are not
obliged to use the Plantain so much as the Ashántis,
as they have plenty of Indian corn, (Zea Mays,) with
which they make both bread and puddings. The
Ashántis have a tolerable supply of sheep, which they
seldom use for any other purposes, than making sacri-
fices to Fetish. They have also much fine poultry,
which they keep for the sake of the eggs, abundance
of which they also offer to Fetish. While travelling
through the sombre gloom of the forest, the crowing of
chanticleer, a sure indication that a croom is at hand, is
very pleasing. The average price of a fowl in Ashánti
is ls. 3d., of an ox £5, and of a sheep, £1. 15s.

Sunday, 17th.–At half-past nine, A. M., I conducted
divine service at my lodgings : after which I'felt the air
so cold, (occasioned by a strong harmattan, *) that I was
obliged to put on a warm dress. In the afternoon I
again conducted divine service, and preached from
Matthew xix. 17: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep
the commandments.” Korinchi and several of his
Captains were present, and appeared much excited
during the sermon; but more especially during that
part, in which I explained to them the Commandments
contained in the Decalogue. They often stopped me in
my discourse, to ask questions, among which was the
following :-“Is the offering of human sacrifice mur-
der?” I answered, “It is even so; and you will
henceforth be left without excuse, if you persist in
that horrible practice.” After I had directed their
attention to the excellency of the Ten Commandments,
especially describing the temporal and spiritual blessings,
which the consecration of the Christian Sabbath is
calculated to introduce among mankind, I proposed to
them the following question : “Who are the happiest
persons; those who conscientiously keep God's com-
mandments, or those who wilfully break them?"
They answered, without hesitation, “ Those who keep
them;" and I verily believe, that this answer was
given in sincerity, as they appeared to be deeply
impressed with the solemnity of the discourse.
Monday, 18th.—“How excellent is thy loving-kind-
ness, O God!” Truly God is good. Although I am in a
sickly clime, and exposed to many peculiar dangers, yet
how trifling are my sufferings! Indeed, they are not
worthy to be mentioned. “Bless the Lord, O my soul!"
* A keen easterly wind which prevails in December, and the
early months of the year.—ED.

Tuesday, 19th.-Korinchi came to pay me a visit,
when I embraced the opportunity of refreshing his
memory concerning the discourse which he heard on
Sunday. Remembering the Fourth Commandment, he
said, he had always thought that God had appointed
different days, to be kept sacred by different nations ;
such as one day for the Ashántis, another for the
Fantis, another for the Wassaws, &c.; and if so, the
keeping of the Christian Sabbath was not binding upon
the Ashántis. I told him, there is now but one day
which God has consecrated, and set apart for his special
worship; and that the observance of that day is binding
upon all who are favoured with information concerning it.
Wednesday, 20th. This morning Korinchi paid me
another visit, when the subject on which we conversed
yesterday, was resumed. During our conversation, he
appeared more deeply convinced of the truth, than he did
yesterday, and requested me to accompany him to his
residence. After we had taken our seats in his house,
our former topic of discourse was discussed. While we
were thus engaged, several of his Captains, and the
King's messenger, (a respectable old man,) joined us.
As some of them thought yet, that the Christian Sab-
bath was not intended for them, I asked them to prove
the truth of what Korinchi stated yesterday, namely,
“That God had set apart different days for different
nations.” They said, that there was a person in the
interior, who had lived ever since the creation of the
world, and that he knew these things, and could prove
them. I told them, I should very much like to see him.
On their observing, that they feared they would expose
themselves to much danger, as a nation, by giving up
their Fetish days, and keeping the Sabbath, I endea-
voured to convince them, that their fears were ground-
less, and that so far from bringing a curse upon the

nation, God would abundantly bless them; and referred
them to England, as a proof of my assertion. I told them
what England was once, in its state of heathen barbarism,
and of the mighty change which has been experienced
since the introduction of Christianity. This argument
was too strong for them, and they gave up the point.
Thursday, 21st. This morning I paid Korinchi a
visit, and found him seated in company with several of
his Captains, and the King's messenger. I entered into
conversation with them concerning my long detention
at Fomunah, and the importance of my seeing the King,
and returning to Cape Coast, before the commencement
of the rainy season. I told them, that I fancied some
bad persons about the King, were endeavouring to
frighten him, by telling him that I was come into the
country as a spy; and that it would be my duty to turn
aside, and carry the glad tidings of salvation to another
nation, if I found them averse to receiving the truth.
At this they seemed very much concerned, and said,
they felt no disposition to oppose the introduction of
Christianity among them, and that they believed the
King would also be glad to hear the truths of the
Gospel, and that he would wish me to stay a long time
in Kumási, after my arrival and first interview.
In the afternoon, I rambled through the thicket to
the summit of a distant hill, where one of the most
splendid pieces of scenery I ever saw, burst on my
view. The bush on the summit being rather low, I had
an opportunity of viewing the surrounding country, in
some directions, to an extent of several miles. Down
the sloping sides of the hill, the splendid Plantain-tree
was luxuriating, and waving its beautiful foliage before
the balmy zephyrs which whispered around. Then
followed the delightful vale, winding to the right and
left, studded with gigantic Silk-cotton trees, Acaciæ

Mimose, with an endless variety of climbers, (chiefly
papilionaceous,) running up and reclining on the top-
most branches, descending and embracing the earth, and
again ascending to the top,—that portion of their stems
between the ground and the high branches of the trees,
appearing like immense cables.* Beyond the valley
were seen other hills in the distance, clothed with most
beautiful verdure to their very summits, except here and
there a small spot, cleared by the natives, for the
purpose of cultivating yams, &c. While I stood gazing
on this scene of splendid, though wild luxuriance, “I
felt an inward bliss spring o'er my heart.” Even the
Fantis who were with me, whose ideas of the beauties of
nature are generally bounded by the skirts of the forest
which girt their little crooms, expressed their partici-
pation in the satisfaction which I enjoyed, by exclaiming,
in the native tongue, Oya fieu doodo, “ It is very hand-
some.” “ These are thy glorious works, Parent of
good! Almighty.” But, alas! how painful is the re-
fection, “Man seems the only growth that dwindles
here!” What dark lines on these fair colours are the
habitations of cruelty, superstition, and death! In vain
do the pretty Jessamine, (Jasminum Gracile,) and other
odoriferous flowers, perfume the air, while man murders
his brother, and taints the atmosphere with the noxious
effluvia arising from the putrefying carcase of the
mangled victim of his superstition and cruelty.

joy, and be led forth with peace;” when these “moun-
tains and hills shall break forth before them into sing-
ing;” and, when “all the trees of the field shall clap
their hands."
During this interesting ramble, I found a pretty
variety of Amaryllis Albus in full bloom. I also saw a
tree, or rather a shrub, at a short distance, which I
could not conveniently approach, on account of the thick
underwood, but which appeared, by its almost naked
stem, and beautiful scarlet flowers, to be a species of
Crythrina. At the foot of the hill is a small rivulet,
overhung by trees covered with Mosses and Ferns,
some of the latter being very fine.
Friday, 22d.--I informed Korinchi that I should soon
be under the necessity of returning to the coast. In
answer to this, he said, that he expected a messenger
down from Kumási on Tuesday; but was not quite
certain of his coming so early. I consequently agreed
to wait until after Sunday, before I made any arrange-
ments for returning.
Saturday, 23d.—How true and faithful is the Lord !
In what a large degree do I realize the truth of the
promise, “ As thy days, so shall thy strength be!”
Notwithstanding my long detention in this place, I feel
no tedium :-
“With me no melancholy void,
No period lingers unemploy’d.”
Sunday, 24th.–At half-past nine, A.M., I read prayers
and preached from Prov. xii. 21. Our little congre-
gation was very attentive. In the afternoon I held a
long conversation with several Heathens and Christians,
(who are travelling with me,) concerning the salvation of
their souls. It was a solemn and delightful service, and
lasted about two hours. In the evening I administered

37
the holy sacrament of the Lord's Supper to the members
of our society. In this sacred ordinance I found my
soul strengthened ; and I believe many felt it to be a
refreshing service. A heavy tornado was raging around
us, and the lightning was glaring into our little sanctuary;
but while the elements were raging, we were in peaceful
and happy serenity.
Monday, 25th.—I called on Korinchi, and informed
him, that I had made up my mind to commence my
return on Wednesday morning, if I did not see a mes-
senger from the King before that time. As he appeared
careless about what I said, I began to suspect him of a
treacherous intention to keep me longer on the way than
was really necessary, and therefore deemed it prudent to
teach him, that I would not be detained and trifled with
in such a manner. Consequently, in the course of the
day, I packed my boxes, and put myself in a state of
readiness for returning. In the evening he (Korinchi)
came with his two linguists and some of his Captains, to
intreat me to wait another day or two, before I made up
my mind to leave; which I agreed to do, on the condition,
that he should provide a messenger, who should accom-
pany the Sergeant to Kumasi, with a letter which I
intended to write to the King, on the following morn-
ing; and after he had used every means to persuade me
to the contrary, he consented with much reluctance.
Tuesday, 26th.—Early on this day I wrote a letter
to the King, ordered the Sergeant to prepare for starting
to Kumási, and sent to Korinchi to inquire if his mes-
senger were ready. In answer to this, he said, he had
sent to Quisah for the King's path-keepers, and as soon
as they arrived, he would consult with them, and let me
have a messenger. Shortly after this, I sent a second
time, and received the same answer. Feeling satisfied
that this delay was intended for the purpose of frus-

trating my design, I thought it prudent to act with as
much promptitude as the circumstance of the case
would allow, and therefore repaired to Korinchi's house,
and inquired for him, but was informed that he was not
within. Every thing which I saw confirmed my sus-
picions. I went from thence to the residence of the
King's messenger, and inquired of him the reason of
the delay; in answer to which he said, that they were
waiting for the linguists belonging to other Chiefs on
the way to Kumási, to speak with them also, before they
prepared a messenger. At this I felt displeased, seeing
plainly that all this was said on purpose to hinder me
from sending to the King, or from going either back-
ward or forward. I returned to my lodgings, and
ordered my people to make ready for going to Cape
Coast immediately; and then repaired to Korinchi's
house again, taking the precaution of sending one of
my attendants towards the back-door of his house, to
see if he would attempt to make his escape from me
in that direction, as I went in at the front.* When I
arrived at the door, I saw one of the linguists, who
said Korinchi was not within. Not satisfied with this
answer, I stepped into the house, before any one could
get to the Chief to tell him that I was coming; when I
found him leisurely taking his breakfast. I upbraided
him for his unjust conduct, and requested a messenger
as soon as he had finished his repast. On his promising
to settle the matter immediately, I withdrew into another
apartment, and waited for him nearly half an hour : I
then sent my interpreter to see if he was ready, who

returned to inform me, that Korinchi had finished his
breakfast, and had escaped. Finding that he was trying
to get the mastery over me, I saw the necessity of
securing his compliance with my wishes, by coming to
the determination, that if he would not let messengers
go forwards, I would immediately return. Accordingly
I sent to one of the linguists to inform him of my in-
tention, returned to my lodgings, and began to send
my people off with the luggage. While I was busily
engaged in doing this, one of the linguists came, and
begged of me to stop ; promising that a messenger
should be immediately despatched to Kumási. I an-
swered, “Let me see him ready to commence his
journey without delay, or I will soon be out of the
town.” He then left, saying he would get one imme-
diately; but I did not believe him, and therefore
continued sending off my luggage. He came again,
saying, “ The messenger is nearly ready.” I answered,
“Let me see him :" but none came. Having sent off
all my people, informing them where I wished them to
wait for me on the road, I again walked to Korinchi's
house, to take my leave of him : he appeared stupid,
brutal, and sullen, and would not give me his hand : I
consequently turned from him, and waited a moment to
tell the King's messenger I was going. Before I parted
with him, I asked whether he did not think forty-six
days a sufficient length of time for me to wait patiently,
especially as I was getting short of provisions, and the
rainy season was fast approaching. He candidly ac-
knowledged that I had been detained too long, and that
he could not blame me for returning. I had proceeded
but a short distance on my way, when Korinchi sent,
begging me to stop and speak with him; to which
message I thought it right to pay no attention.
When I arrived at Quisah, I found my people waiting

for me in the street; and I again desired them to pro-
ceed. While so doing, the Chief (one of Korinchi's
Captains) came to entreat me to stay a day or two at
Quisah. This I should have had no objection to do,
had I not been aware that it was a scheme of Korinchi,
devised on purpose to hinder me from proceeding home-
wards : being aware of this, I proceeded, and began to
ascend the high hill, which separates the Ashánti and
Asín countries. When about half way up the hill, one
of Korinchi’s linguists came running after me, entreating
me to return, saying that his master was very sorry for
what he had done; that if I would go back, the mes-
senger should be provided instantly; and that he should
travel to Kumási during the night by torch-light :* but
as I thought he was not sufficiently frightened, I still
proceeded on my way. Korinchi no sooner found out
his mistake, in supposing that I would allow myself to
be played with, than he became very much alarmed,
and applied to a Fanti residing in Quisah, whom I
knew well, entreating him to follow after me, and to
tell me, that he sincerely begged my pardon, and hoped
I would forgive him, and return ; and that he would
send messengers to conduct me back. Notwithstanding
this, I still went forward, and took up my lodgings for
the night in a small croom, about nine miles and a half
from Fomunah. I had scarcely arranged my people
for the night, when several messengers arrived from
Fomunah and Quisah, (among whom were Korinchi's
two linguists,) entreating me to return in the morning.
The croom in which I lodged was very small, con-
taining about eight or nine little huts, scarcely affording
us shelter from a tornado, which commenced soon after

our arrival. The hut which I had chosen to sleep in,
was little more than six feet square. Into this place I
received the messengers, to screen them from the rain,
and to hear their tale. They represented Korinchi as
very unhappy because I had gone from the town ; * and
said that all their lives would be in danger, if I left the
country. They also reminded me, that I came into the
country on purpose to promote their happiness; and
hoped I would think of the thousands of their fellow-
countrymen who would be benefited by the introduction
of Christianity among them, rather than of the insult
which Korinchi had offered me. These were, of course,
my own feelings : personally I cared nothing about that
man's bad conduct; but I knew very well, that if they
saw anything in my behaviour like indecision, they
would give me a great deal of trouble, and consequently
thought I had better put a stop to their trifling at once.
I therefore continued to conceal as much as possible any
wish on my part to return with them, and told them, I
would still proceed homeward, until I had crossed the
Prah, and entered Fanti; which I thought of doing,
and there waiting for a message from the King.
Fearing lest I should put this design into execution
the following morning, they said, that if I would return,
Korinchi would allow me to proceed to within a few
miles of Kumási. This satisfied me that he was at last
sincerely sorry for what he had done, and that he would
behave better for the future. I now agreed to go
back, on the condition that they (the messengers) should
provide people to carry my luggage, so that my

that Korinchi had actually made “custom,” and had sat up
during the whole night, playing his drums, drinking, dancing, &c.,
on purpose to keep the thought of my departure out of his mind.

hammock-men might be at liberty to bear me to the
base of the hill, as the journey on foot would otherwise
have been exceedingly trying to me, on account of the
immense hill over which I must walk, it being too steep
to admit of my being carried over it.* To this they
readily consented; and further, as a proof of their sincere
anxiety to get me back, they were ready even to carry
my luggage themselves, thanking me very much for my
kindness in returning with them.
* The labour of ascending this hill is so great, that I was
obliged to clothe myself in flannel, to avoid taking cold from the
violent perspiration, occasioned by exertion, being checked by the
keen wind on the summit; which I had no sooner reached, than I
found it necessary, in addition to the flannel, to wrap myself in a
cloak.

KING-HUMAN SACRIFICES-APOKO-TOWN OP KUMASI DESCRIBED.
WEDNESDAY, 27th.-Early after break of day, I re-
turned with Korinchi's messengers, and had only been
in the town half an hour, when a despatch arrived from
the King, requesting me to proceed, and with him two
or three persons whom Korinchi had expressly sent to
Kumási as soon as he found me determined to go back,
if I were not permitted to proceed. Korinchi having
personally acknowledged his fault, I, of course, freely
forgave him; and every thing was finally arranged for
my starting for Kumási the following morning. Though
Korinchi was evidently deserving of censure in this
affair, I believe that much of his conduct arose from
jealousy on the part of the King ; who is not so much
to be blamed, when we consider the confused notions
which he must entertain concerning the real objects of a
Missionary, together with the fact, that he is surrounded
by Moors, whose great object would be, without doubt,
to poison his mind, and to put a false construction on
every thing connected with the idea of introducing
Christianity into his dominions.
Thursday, 28th.—About eight, A. M., I commenced
my journey, and travelled through a fine fertile country
of hill and dale, full of luxuriant vegetation, and studded
with immense Silk-cotton and other forest trees, covered
with many varieties of Orchidee and Cryptogamiæ.
At nine, A. M., I halted in a pretty little town called
Dumpási, to take my breakfast. I had no sooner taken

my seat, than a large group of the natives collected
around me; but on my taking a telescope to look at
some Orchideæ on a distant tree, they all began to run
away, supposing that I was going to shoot at them.
At half-past three I reached the small town of Ak-
wankowási, and took lodgings for the night.
Friday, 29th.–At a quarter past eight, A. M., I
proceeded on my way through a country very similar
to that over which I passed yesterday, crossing several
small rivers, the largest of which was about nine yards
broad, and three feet deep. About half-past four, P. M.,
I passed through Eduabin, one of the largest towns I
have hitherto seen in Ashánti; but in a very dilapidated
state, many of the houses being tenantless, and tumbling
down. At half-past five, P. M., we reached the small
croom of Esargu, about nine miles distant from Kumási,
having had a long and trying day's journey, which had
tired the carriers, &c., so much, that several of them
appeared quite exhausted. As for myself, I am mer-
cifully blessed with extraordinary strength, so that I
could have proceeded several miles farther, though I
had already walked many, in order to rest the ham-
mock-men. A Missionary passing up to Kumási, is
so strange an occurrence, that nearly all the people in
the different towns and crooms through which I go,
come out to see me; and so totally ignorant are they
of Christianity, or rather, of any reasonable way of
worshipping God, that they actually run away, when
they see us engaging in that solemn duty. On my
arrival at this place, a female relative of the King
brought me some palm-wine in a calabash ; and being
very thirsty, I took a hearty draught. It was, I think,
the best palm-wine I have tasted since I have been in
Africa. Many of the natives are truly kind. Every
day I receive presents from some of them, consisting of

palm-wine, yams, plantains, bananas, ground-nuts, &c.
The banana is a delicious fruit, and not so likely to
cause indisposition as some other fruits.
Saturday, 30th.—No travelling to-day. Preparing
for the Sabbath, and for starting forward, immediately
after the arrival of another message of invitation from
the King. I do not expect to leave this place until
Monday morning, the King being fully aware, that I
will not travel on the Sabbath-day.
Sunday, 31st. — At half-past eight, A.M., I conducted
divine service. During the day, which was excessively
hot, I saw troops passing up to Kumási, from different
parts of the country. The presence of these soldiers,
together with a heavy tornado in the evening, hindered
us from holding any afternoon or evening service.
About six, P.M., a messenger arrived to inform me, that
His Majesty wished me to proceed early the following
morning.
April 1st, Monday.-- Throughout the night I was
disturbed by the noise made by the troops as they
passed up to the capital. At four, A.M., we commenced
our journey. The morning was so very moist, that a
thick November fog in England could scarcely equal it;
notwithstanding which, the heat was so great, that I
could scarcely bear a light Mackintosh thrown over me,
which was necessary to keep out the damps, though I
was only clothed in a light linen dress.
About eight, A.M., we reached Franfraham, a small
croom, about a mile and a half from Kumasi, (built for
the accommodation of strangers travelling to the capital,)
having halted an hour, at least, on the road. Here I
took some refreshment, and waited for another invitation
from the King. While we remained, we held a prayer-
meeting, for the purpose of imploring the blessing of
the God of Missions upon our undertaking.

FIRST JOURNAL OF
For several days past I have felt an indescribable
sensation, best known, I presume, to those whose awful
employment it is to bear the standard of the Cross, " to
proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day
of vengeance of our God.” “Simon, Simon, behold,
Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as
wheat; but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail
not.” “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end."
At two, P.M., a messenger arrived from the King,
requesting me to proceed as early as possible. I imme-
diately dressed myself; and while so doing, three
others arrived, each bearing a gold sword, requesting
me to hasten forward. I then advanced towards the
town, preceded by the messengers and some soldiers
bearing arms. Having reached the outskirts, we halted
under a large tree, and there waited for another royal
invitation. In a short time, His Majesty's chief lin-
guist, Apoko, came in a palanquin, shaded by an
immense umbrella, and accompanied by messengers
bearing canes nearly covered with gold, to take charge
of my luggage, and to see it safely lodged in the resi-
dence intended for me. All these things being properly
arranged, another messenger arrived, accompanied by
troops, and men bearing large umbrellas, who requested
me to proceed to the market-place. “ The King's
commandment” being “urgent,” we pushed along with
speed, preceded by a band of music. As soon as we
arrived at the market-place, I got out of my travelling
chair, walked through the midst of an immense con-
course of persons, a narrow path being kept clear for
me, and paying my respects to the King and his
numerous Chiefs and Captains, who were seated on

them large enough to screen twelve or fourteen persons
from the burning rays of the sun, crowned with images
of beasts covered with gold, and surrounded by their
troops and numerous attendants. I was occupied for
half an hour in walking slowly through the midst of
this immense assembly, touching my hat and waving
my hand, except before the King, in whose presence I
of course stood for a moment uncovered. I then took
my seat at a distance, accompanied by my people and
several respectable Fanti traders, who are staying in
the town, to receive the compliments of the King, &c.,
according to their usual custom. After I was seated,
the immense mass began to be in motion : many of
the Chiefs first passed me in succession, accompanied
by their numerous retinue, several of them cordially
shaking me by the hand. Then came the officers of the
King's household, his Treasurer, Steward, &c., attended
by their people ; some bearing on their heads massive
pieces of silver-plate, others carrying in their hands
gold swords and canes, native chairs and buffets, neatly
carved and almost covered with gold and silver, and
tobacco-pipes richly decorated with the same precious
materials. Amidst this ostentatious display, I saw what
was calculated to harrow up the strongest and most
painful feelings,—the royal executioners, bearing the
blood-stained stools on which hundreds, and perhaps
thousands, of human victims have been sacrificed by
decapitation, and also the large death-drum, which is
beaten at the moment when the fatal knife severs the
head from the body, the very sound of which conveys a
thrill of horror.* This rude instrument, connected with

which are most dreadful associations, was literally
covered with dried clots of blood, and decorated with
the jaw-bones and skulls of human victims. Then
followed the King, Quako Duah, under the shade of
three splendid umbrellas, the cloth of which was silk-
velvet of different colours, supported by some of his
numerous attendants. The display of gold which I
witnessed, as His Majesty passed, was astonishing.
After the King, followed other Chiefs, and lastly the
main body of the troops. This immense procession
occupied an hour and a half in passing before me.
There were several Moors in the procession, but they
made by no means a conspicuous appearance. While I
was sitting to receive the compliments of some of the
first Chiefs who passed, His Majesty made me a present
of some palm-wine.
I suppose the number of persons which I saw col-
lected together exceeded forty thousand, including a great
number of females. The wrists of some of the Chiefs
were so heavily laden with golden ornaments, that they
rested their arms on the shoulders of some of their
attendants.
The appearance of this procession was exceedingly
grand and imposing. The contrast between the people
themselves, and their large umbrellas, seventy in number,
and of various colours, which they waved up and down
in the air, together with the dark green foliage of the
large Banyan-trees, under and among which they passed,
formed a scene of that novel and extraordinary character,
which I feel unable to describe.
spot. While the King was making sacrifices during the “custom”
for his brother, I was in a distant part of the town, conversing with
my interpreter, who, knowing the fatal meaning of the sound of the
drum, said, “ Hark! do you hear the drum ? A sacrifice has just
been made, and the drum says, “ King, I have killed him !""

. I gazed on this concourse of Heathens with feelings
of sorrow and joy. I sorrowed in the reflection, that
most (perhaps all) of them were totally ignorant of the
great Author of their being, and without one ray of
divine consolation, to cheer them amid the changing
scenes of this visionary world. Are they laid on a bed
of languishing ? They have nothing to comfort them,
or to buoy up their drooping spirits. Does death,
which stalks through the land in such horrid forms, rob
them of their friends ? Alas! they must sorrow as men
without hope! They do not see, with the eye of faith,
the blood-bought throng standing in the presence of
God, “clothed with white robes, and palms in their
hands.” Does death stare them in the face ? Alas !
they have no prospect beyond the grave, blooming with
immortality! Is it not so ? Tell it, ye murdered
human victims, whose blood disfigures the streets, and
whose putrefying bodies taint the air! Tell it, ye mid-
night revellers, who vainly strive to banish the agony
from your hearts, by the fumes of intoxication! Tell it,
ye carnivorous birds, and ye wild beasts of the forest,
that feed on the mangled corpses of thousands of these
victims of superstitious cruelty! And, lastly, tell it, ye
human bones, that lie bleaching in the open day!
Have these poor sufferers no voice? no tale of woe to
relate ? Methinks I hear them crying to British Chris-
tians especially, “ Come, pray come, and look on our
unhappy country! See how it groans beneath the iron
despotism of the prince of darkness! True, it is a
beautiful country, its fertile soil produces an hundred
fold! but what avails its beauty or fertility, when it is
converted into one immense slaughter-house? O ye who
enjoy the high blessings of Christianity, allow us to
entreat you to direct your energies towards this scene
of moral desolation !” Brooding in melancholy over

the blood-stained wilds, fancy carries me to my native
land, where, entering a well-known place in the metro-
polis, I hear the cause of Christian Missions advocated,
in the presence of thousands, whose hearts burn with
love towards their perishing fellow-creatures. I hear
them speaking of unhappy, degraded Africa ; of the
pressing wants of its millions; and of the vital im-
portance of increased exertions on the part of British
Christians, for the extension of the blessings of Chris-
tianity among this mass of immortal men. I hear a
Resolution moved and supported, that much more shall
be immediately done for Africa ; and especially for
Guinea. Returning again to this immense field of
labour, I feel encouraged to cry,“ O ye dry bones, hear
the word of the Lord !” “The captives of the mighty
shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall
be delivered.” Yea, “He that sitteth upon the circle
of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grass-
hoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain,
and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in,” He hath
said, “Ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto God.”
“Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch
forth the curtains of thine habitations ; spare not,
lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes. For
thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the
left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make
the desolate cities to be inhabited.” O ye dry bones,
hear the words of the Lord's people! Their prayer for
you to God our Saviour is,-
“The servile progeny of Ham
Seize, as the purchase of thy blood.”
Yes, for Africa they pray, and over Africa they weep!

drum shall give place to the heralds of the cross; and,
instead of feeling the terror and dismay conveyed by
the footsteps of the bloody executioner, the peaceful
native shall exclaim, “How beautiful upon the moun-
tains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings,
that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of
good, that publisheth salvation ; that saith unto Zion,
Thy God reigneth!”.
“The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ :
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
And deserts learn the joy."
The arduous duties of the day being over, I imme-
diately repaired to my quarters; and, spreading a cloth
upon the floor, sunk, tired and weary, into the arms of
sleep.

in my new apartments.

I heard nothing from him. Two Moors visited me,
and told me they came from Mosu.
Thursday, 4th. This morning the King sent his
linguists (some of whom were heavily laden with golden
ornaments) to make every inquiry as to my object in
visiting him. I gave them all necessary information ;
but found much difficulty in making them understand
me, And no wonder ; for how can those who are
buried in superstition, and who witness scarcely any
thing, but scenes of cruelty arising from that supersti-
tion, form any just idea of the motives which stimulate
the Christian Missionary to visit them? “O that they

This morning I received information, that the King
had lost one of his relations by death, and that, in conse-
quence, four human victims were already sacrificed, and
their mangled bodies lying in the streets. I therefore
concluded that I should not have an opportunity of
seeing the King for a day or two. Shortly afterwards
I saw Apoko, the chief linguist, and told him, I was
aware that there was bloody work going on, as I saw a
number of large hawks and turkey-buzzards hovering
over a certain spot, where I judged these poor creatures
were lying. “Wheresoever the carcase is, there will
the eagles be gathered together.” He said it was even
so, and, in consequence thereof, I should not have an
opportunity of seeing the King to-day, and perhaps
not to-morrow. I told him, that I did not like being
confined to one place, in a low, unhealthy part of the
town; and that I must walk out and take exercise,
otherwise my health would suffer. I also said, that
I was anxious to commence my journey home to the
coast on Monday next. On hearing this, he went
immediately to the King, and informed him of what I

of the average size of six feet by seven, each having only one
opening, and that into a yard, about nine or ten feet square, in
which no breeze could be felt. Surrounding one of these yards,
there are generally from two to four of these sheds, the whole
premises being connected by narrow doors leading out of one yard
into another. In this contracted place I had about twenty per-
sons; such as carriers, hammock-men, &c. And what tended to
increase the heat was, that they were obliged to make their fires
for dressing food, &c. This place, bad as it was, was one of the
best that could be procured for me, unless I had gone up into the
very heart of the town, which, for many reasons, would not have
been prudent.

had stated; shortly after which, he returned, accom-
panied by two messengers, (one of them bearing in
his hand an immense gold sword, to which was fastened
a golden decanter, holding about a pint,) informing
me, that His Majesty begged of me not to go out into
the town to-day, as he was making a “custom” for a
departed relative, and he knew Europeans did not
like to see human sacrifices; that he did not wish to
keep me from seeing his capital ; that he was fully
satisfied my object was to do good; and that he would
see me as soon as the “custom” was over. I, of course,
complied with his wishes, and made up my mind to
wait patiently.
Throughout the day I heard the horrid sound of the
death-drum, and was told in the evening, that about
twenty-five human victims had been sacrificed, some in
the town, and some in the surrounding villages; the
heads of those killed in the villages being brought into
the town in baskets. I fear there will be more of this
awful work to-morrow.
Saturday, 6th.–This morning I again talked of
going out into the capital, when Apoko informed me,
that more sacrifices would be made during the day, and
that I must not do so until to-morrow. I therefore re-
mained where I was until the afternoon, when, finding
myself in an unhealthy state for want of exercise, I
insisted upon walking out at one end of the town for
half an hour. In the evening I learned that several
more human victims had been immolated during the
day, but could not ascertain the exact number. The
most accurate account I could obtain was, that fifteen
more had suffered ; making a total of FORTY, IN TWO
DAYS !!
While speaking to Apoko, I did not fail to remind
him, that the law of God forbids this fearful practice;

and that they were under great error, in supposing that
the persons sacrificed would attend on the deceased
relative of the King, in some other state of existence.
These poor victims were allowed to lie naked and
exposed in the streets, until they began to decompose ;
and such is the callous state of mind in which the people
live, that many were walking about, among the putrefying
bodies, smoking their pipes, with amazing indifference.
Sunday, 7th.-At nine, A.M., I conducted divine
service at my abode: many Ashántis were present,
some of whom paid deep attention. At four, P.M., I
again commenced the worship of God, but was com-
pelled abruptly to close the service by a tornado.
Monday, 8th.—This morning His Majesty sent me a
handsome present, consisting of a cow, a sheep, a pig, a
quantity of palm-nuts, yams, and plantains, and one
ounce and four ackies of gold-dust, (£5 currency,) also
three ackies for my interpreter, and five ackies for my
other attendants. The gold was brought in a golden
blow-pan, weighing several ounces.
Having asked His Majesty to allow me to see the
town to-day, he readily gave me liberty to go wherever
I pleased. I therefore embraced the opportunity of
looking over it, which occupied about an hour. The
streets are large, and more clean and uniform than I
have seen in any other native town since my arrival in
Africa. The breadth of some of them is at least thirty
yards, and the average length from three hundred to
six hundred yards. The town is situated on a bed of
granite ; fragments of which are strewed in abundance
over the finest streets ; the average size of them being
about twenty inches square (cube). A row of splendid
Banyan-trees, planted at a considerable distance from
each other, occupies some of the large streets, affording
a delightful shade from the burning rays of the sun.

The streets differ also in appearance from those of other
towns which I have seen in the interior, by the houses
on each side having open fronts, the floor being raised
from two to three feet above the level of the ground.
The space between the ground and the level of the
floor, and in some houses a foot or two even above
that level, presents a front of carved work, beautifully
polished with red ochre. In several, the carved work
is continued up to the roof; and where that is the case,
it is covered with white clay, which has the appearance
of a lime white-wash. The roofs are made chiefly with
bamboo-poles, or sticks, with the bark stripped off, and
thatched with palm-leaves.
Behind each of these open fronts, are a number of
small houses, or rather, open sheds, in which the people
dwell, (the room open to the street being more of a
public seat, than a private room,) averaging in number
from thirty to forty. These small dwellings in the back-
ground are in many cases entirely hidden from the
observation of any one passing along the streets; the
only indication of them being, a small door on the left
or right of the open front. The houses are all erected on
the same plan, from that of the King, down to the lowest
rank of Captains ; and these are, with a few exceptions,
the only persons who are allowed to build in any public
situation. The rocky bed on which the town is placed,
is, in many parts, very irregular and unlevel. Some of
the streets are so full of holes, occasioned by the heavy
rains washing the earth out of the fissures of the rocks
during the rainy season, that any one attempting to walk
through them in the dark, would place his neck in danger.
There is only one stone-built house in the town,
which stands on the royal premises, and is called the
“Castle." All the other buildings are of wood and
swish, and by no means durable.

The market-place is a large open space, about three-
quarters of a mile in circumference. There is no
regularity in its form, but it approaches nearest to that
of a parallelogram. On one side of it, is an extensive
dell, surrounded by large trees and high grass,* into
which they finally throw the dead bodies of sacrificed
human victims. As I passed by this dell, I smelt a
most intolerable stench, proceeding from the poor
creatures who were thrown there on Saturday last.
My feelings would not permit me to look into this horrid
receptacle of the dead; but the very idea of it is dreadful.
Yet even “ there the prisoners rest together; they hear
not the voice of the oppressor.”
There are no regularly-built stalls in the market-
place. Many articles of merchandise were laid on
the ground; and others, on little temporary railings,
which might be put up, or taken down, in a few moments.
Among the commodities exposed for sale, I saw Man-
chester cloths, silks, muslins; roll-tobacco from the
interior ; large cakes of a kind of pomatum, made from
the fruit of a tree found in the centre of the country,
and used by the Ashántis for anointing their bodies, to
give a polish to their skins; native tobacco-pipes, of
very neat manufacture; cakes of a kind of whiting, used
by the natives for marking their bodies; kankie, (native
bread,) yams, plantains, bananas, pines, ground-nuts,
fish, and the flesh of monkeys and elephants.
* There is a kind of grass in the immediate neighbourhood of
Kumási, which grows to the enormous height of twenty feet, the
stalk of which is about three-quarters of an inch in diameter.

LEAVES KUMASI - EMANCIPATION OF A SLAVE-FOMUNAH-CONDUCT OF
KORINCHI-JOURNEY TO THE COAST-PRACTICABILITY OF A MISSION TO
ASHANTI-LETTER OF PRESIDENT MACLEAN.
In the afternoon I asked His Majesty to allow me to
visit Bantama, or the “Back Town;" to which he
readily consented. I found it to be a small place,
nearly one mile distant from Kumási, and connected
with it by a long street, which runs from one town to
the other. The only difference between the two towns
is, that the streets of Bantama are much more noiseless
than those of Kumási ; which difference arises from the
former being looked upon as sacred, on account of the
Fetish-house, which contains the bones of the former
Kings. Very few Europeans, or even Ashántis, are
allowed to visit Bantama. Some of Apoko's men, who
conducted me thither, informed me, that I was the only
European who has been permitted to visit it during the
reign of His present Majesty ; and that the people of
Kumási are only allowed to go there, when the King
himself goes (which he does every forty days) to visit the
tombs of his ancestors. Several splendid Banyan-trees
are luxuriating in the centre of the main street; on one
of which I saw a pretty variety of Epiphytical Orchideæ,
in full bloom.
Before I left Bantama, I visited the Chief, (one of the
greatest men in the kingdom,) who received me very
kindly, and regaled me with some palm-wine.
As we were proceeding homewards, two or three men,

belonging to the Chief, came running after us, requesting
us to stop. As soon as they came up, I learnt that they
had been watching to see if we gathered anything from
the Banyan-trees as we passed under them; and, on
seeing my interpreter (who was riding in a palanquin)
raise his hand to protect his face from the leaves, &c.,
they thought he had plucked some by my direction,
and that I intended to make a medicine from them, for
the purpose of poisoning the King! They seemed fully
satisfied, however, from an explanation on the part of
my attendant, that they were under a mistake. I
believe their jealousy was excited by seeing me look up
into one of the Banyans, where a variety of the Orchidee
was flowering; and as they have scarcely any idea of
the beauty of a flower, they thought I must have some
sinister intention in thus closely examining the tree,
As I passed by the King's residence on my way
home, a small group of Physic-nut trees, thirteen in
number, was pointed out to me as being the memorials
of the former Kings; an additional tree being planted
at the decease of every Monarch.
On arriving at my habitation, which is on Apoko's
premises, I told him of the affair at Bantama, con-
cerning the Banyan-leaves, &c., and asked him if they
saw anything in my conduct, which authorized them to
suspect me of any evil motive in visiting Bantama. He
answered, “No;” and seemed to pay very little atten-
tion to the matter. However, to convince him more
fully, I showed him some drawings of different varieties
of Orchideæ in flower; and told him that the English
are very fond of cultivating flowers from all parts of the
world, and that I was very fond of studying their
nature, character, &c. Apoko seemed much pleased
with the plates, as they were laid open before him.

on Sunday last being very great, (from 91° Fahrenheit,
in the shade, to about 74°, or 75°,) accompanied with
heavy rain, I caught a violent cold, although I took the
precaution to cover myself partially with a cloak, as soon
as the transition took place. I began to feel the evil
effects of the cold this morning.
About half-past nine this forenoon, I went to the
King's residence, to thank him for the handsome present
which he made me yesterday. He appears to be about
thirty-six years of age. He is of middle stature; his
complexion is not so dark as that of many of his sub-
jects ; his manners are pleasing and agreeable. He has
an aversion to drinking and smoking, a quality quite
unusual among the Ashántis. *
Thursday, 11th.– Feeling better to-day, I walked
out for air and exercise. As I passed the end of one of
the streets, I saw a group of persons surrounding a large
Kabosir's umbrella. A band of music was playing, and
a human victim was lying on the ground before them,
exposed to public view. I turned from the sickening
sight with painful feelings. Coming round to the further
end of the same street, I saw it crowded with people,
and numbers more joining them in rapid succession.
The King was seated in the street under his umbrellas,
to drink palm-wine with his Chiefs, &c., previous to a
week's partial retirement in his palace, immediately after
the conclusion of the “custom” for his relation, who
died on the 4th instant; this being the last day of the
ceremony.
I reminded A poko of my anxiety to obtain an
While I was staying at Fomunah, I reproved Korinchi for
drunkenness; when he said, that the King had checked him for it
once; and since I also had done it, which was the second reproof
he had received, he would endeavour to avoid it for the future.

answer from His Majesty, respecting the establishment
of Schools, &c., in Ashánti; who replied, “The King
will speedily give you an answer; and we hope you will
come to Kumási again, and pay us another visit, for we
shall be always glad to see you. The King believes
that you wish to do him and the people good.”
Saturday, 13th.—I again reminded Apoko, that I
must speedily return to the coast, as the rains were
becoming frequent and very heavy. He immediately
went to tell the King; and returned to inform me, that
His Majesty had been so busily engaged throughout the
morning, that he could not see me and make me ready
to start to-day, but that he would do so to-morrow.
From the general aspect of things, I became sensible,
that though I should not meet with anything to dis-
courage me, yet it would cost me another journey to
Kumási, before the confidence of the King would be
fully secured; his jealous disposition being of such a
nature, as to require a considerable length of time, and
much patience and perseverance, before it will be over-
come.
Sunday, 14th.—At half-past seven, A. M., I con-
ducted divine service at my abode, and found it to
be a time of spiritual refreshment. I continued in
anxious expectation of a message from the King, until
about eleven o'clock, when I found, on inquiry, that
Apoko had not reminded His Majesty of seeing me
to-day, because he thought I would not like to transact
any kind of business on the Sabbath-day. (This idea
was the result of a previous consultation with Apoko ;
during which, I explained to him the nature and claims
of the Christian Sabbath.) I told him that my business
with His Majesty was entirely of a religious nature, and
that I had no objection to see him immediately. It
was too late, however, to hope for an interview to-day.

Early this evening I held a prayer-meeting, which
was no sooner concluded, than the rain, which had been
threatening for several hours, commenced with awful
violence. In a few minutes, the small yard in the
centre of my residence was covered with water, to the
depth of twelve or fifteen inches; and as the thatch of
my sleeping-shed (I cannot call it a room) was in bad
repair, the rain poured in, almost in a stream, upon my
pillow. I soon began to feel the evil effects of the
damps, and had some fears as to the consequences;
which fears were heightened by the consideration, that
my provisions were so nearly exhausted, that I could
not make myself a cup of tea or coffee, having no
sugar left; neither had I any flour, bread, or biscuit.
Trusting, however, in the mercy of God, I partook of
some native food, to satisfy the cravings of hunger, and
slept in peace.
Monday, 15th.-I arose from my bed, determined to
make an attempt to set out upon my journey back
to the coast to-day, if possible; the commencement of
the rains, of the violence of which a stranger to a
tropical climate can form but a faint idea, together with
the sickly state of several of my people, and the pressing
claims of nearly seven hundred members of our society,
rendering my speedy return imperative. I therefore
began to pack up my things, while Apoko,* (whose
attachment to me has daily increased,) true to the
promise which he made me yesterday, repaired to His
* Apoko is the only person who is allowed to visit the King at
any time he wishes. I therefore enjoyed many advantages, from
being placed by the King under his care. I was informed that,
had it not been so, I should have had much greater difficulties to
contend with, in holding intercourse with His Majesty. Apoko is
a fine-looking man, about thirty-six years of age, and seems to have
great influence with him.

Majesty's residence, to remind him of the necessity of
allowing me to leave.
In about two hours Apoko returned, accompanied by
a host of attendants, linguists, and messengers, with a
present from His Majesty, consisting of two ounces and
four ackies of gold-dust, (£9 currency,) and a slave for
myself;* also eight ackies (£2 currency) for my inter-
preter and other attendants. He also gave me the
following message from the King :-"His Majesty
knows that you cannot stop longer, on account of the
rains; and as the thing which you have mentioned to
him requires much consideration, he cannot answer you
in so short a time: but if you will come up again, or
send a messenger, after the rains are over, he will be
prepared to answer you.” With this message I was
pleased, and said, that I would certainly either come
again, or send a messenger at the time mentioned. I
then repaired to His Majesty's residence, to take my
leave, and found him seated in one of his apartments,
surrounded by an immense number of attendants; when
he requested me, with a courtesy which one could
scarcely expect from a person in his circumstances, to
present his compliments to His Excellency President
Maclean, and take a message to him.
Having taken my leave, I commenced my journey at
noon, preceded by an escort of troops. After I had
proceeded a short distance along the street, Apoko came
to testify his affection, by a hearty shake of the hand.
When I reached Franfraham, the troops left me, and
I stopped a few minutes to emancipate the slave, whom
His Majesty had given to me. This poor fellow is a
native from the depth of the interior, and is now in the

prime of his life. On my informing him, that he was
now a free man, he appeared overwhelmed with gra-
titude; and almost fell on the earth before me, in
acknowledgment of the boon. He had not all the
pleasure to himself, however; for while I enjoyed the
luxury of doing good, many of my people looked on
him with delight; and our satisfaction was heightened,
when he told us, that he had twice been brought out for
the purpose of sacrifice, during the recent “custom,”
and had twice been put in irons, and sent back alive ;
and, that when he was brought out this morning, he
expected to be sacrificed in the course of the day.
Happy change ! instead of having his head cut off, and
- his body thrown to the fowls of the air, he now finds
himself in the enjoyment of liberty, safely proceeding
with us, far away from the scenes of his bondage.
I journeyed with speed, and reached the town of
Eduabin about five, P. M., where I took my rest for the
night.
Tuesday, 16th.At six, A. M., I again proceeded. In
the course of the morning a tornado, which had for a
long time been grumbling in the distance, overtook us.
We took shelter for a short time, and then ventured
onward; as I chose rather to expose myself to the
rains, however pernicious, than to the alternative of
swimming across the rivers, which were swelling very
fast.
The soil being clayey, the rain made the roads so
very slippery, that nearly all my carriers, &c., were
tumbling down with the boxes; and, while I was riding
in my chair to rest myself a little, the hammock-men
stumbled with me twice, notwithstanding great care on
their part. During the whole of the day, I did not stop
to take any food, but pushed onwards, like a man
escaping for life.

Night closed in nearly an hour before I reached my
resting-place; but we kept our path through the forest
without much difficulty, and reached Fomunah at a
quarter after seven o'clock, wet, weary, and hungry. I
immediately repaired to Korinchi's residence. He
seemed overjoyed to see me, gave me a hearty shake with
both hands, put his arms around my neck in transport,
and made me a present of palm-wine, and a mess of
soup, made with the flesh of the monkey. I then re-
tired to my lodgings, and thankfully partook of the
Chief's monkey-soup, to satisfy the cravings of hunger,
having little else to eat.
Wednesday, 17th.—Early this morning, Korinchi came
to my quarters, shook me cordially by the hand, and
testified his delight at seeing me safely returned from
Kumási. On my telling him, that I should want him
to assist me in holding farther intercourse with the King,
by sending messengers, &c., and, perhaps, in returning
to the capital in the course of the next dry season, he said,
he would readily do any thing which I requested of him.
. One of my attendants being so ill as to be unable to
walk over the Adansi hills, I applied for assistance to
Korinchi; who immediately supplied me with four
strong men, to assist in carrying the invalid. About
half-past eleven, A.M., I again proceeded, crossed the hills,
and travelled through the forest until four, P.M.; when,
finding the people weary, I was obliged to stop in a
small croom, and take up my abode for the night.
Thursday, 18th.—At seven, A.M., I resumed my jour-
ney, under rather trying circumstances; being almost
without food. About noon, I halted to rest the carriers,
&c., and took some refreshment, consisting of a piece of
boiled yam and a little butter, with heavy and sour
pudding, made from Indian corn, having nothing better
to eat.

About half-past four, P.M., I rested for the night, at a
small croom, about seven miles from the river Prah. On
my arrival at this place, I felt tired and hungry, and the
God of Providence kindly “furnished me a table in the
wilderness.” A wild hog had been killed in the neigh-
bourhood, a portion of which I purchased, and found it
very delicious. “Thy bread shall be given thee; thy
water shall be sure.” My sleeping-place, it is true, was
a very bad one, into which an Englishman would scarcely
place a pig ; but I laid me down with humble confidence,
and slept in peace.
“How do thy mercies close me round!
For ever be thy name adored !
I blush in all things to abound:
The servant is above his Lord.
“Inured to poverty and pain,
A suffering life my Master led ;
The Son of God, the Son of Man,
He had not where to lay his head.
“But lo! a place he hath prepared
For me, whom watchful angels keep;
Yea, He himself becomes my guard,
He smooths my bed, and gives me sleep.”
Friday, 19th.–At six, A.M., I started for the Prah,
which I reached in about two hours. I breakfasted at
Prahsu, on the Fanti side of the river; and after resting
the people, and allowing them time to refresh themselves,
by bathing in the river, I again proceeded at one, P.M.,
and reached the small croom of Beraku about five
o'clock, when I halted for the night.
Saturday, 20th.—At six, A.M., I set out for Fessu ;
which place I reached at noon; and as the day was ex-
cessively hot, and the people very weary, I determined
on remaining here, and spending the Sabbath.
Sunday, 21st.-At half-past seven, A.M., I conducted

divine service, and preached from Mark viii. 36, 37.
Many of the natives were present, and some of them
paid deep attention. About five, P.M., we had a prayer-
meeting.
Monday, 22d.---At a quarter before six, A.M., I started
for Mansu. Arriving at a neat little croom on the way,
I was pleased to find that a carrier, bearing provisions,
whom I had been expecting several days, had just
entered the place. Thus I was enabled to take a com-
fortable breakfast, consisting of suitable food ; the want
of which I had felt severely, during the last seven or
eight days. My people, who had seen with regret the
privations I suffered, sat at a distance, looking upon me
while I was taking my breakfast, with countenances which
told how happy they were in seeing my wants supplied,
After breakfast, I again proceeded, and reached Mansu
at one, P.M. Gabri, the Chief, welcomed me back, and
entreated me to stay with him until the morrow, as I
had already travelled a fair day's journey; but, as I was
extremely anxious to reach Cape Coast as early as
possible, I told him I could not remain, but would pay
him a visit at the earliest opportunity. On my inquiring
whether he would like a Mission to be established at
Mansu, he said, “ Yes ;” and he should feel very happy,
if he had a Missionary residing with him. Gabri is one
of the most respectable Chiefs in Fanti.
Mansu and the adjacent villages contain a population
of at least ten thousand souls; and they are admirably
situated for the establishment of a Mission.*
* Many important advantages would, in all probability, result
from our having a School-house and Teacher at Mansu. It is
two days' journey on the road to Kumási ; and would, con-
sequently, facilitate our operations in Ashánti. The situation
also is open and healthy; and would, in due time, be a very
eligible place for the residence of a Missionary.

Leaving Mansu, I proceeded to Wankwasu, a small
croom, about nine miles from the last-mentioned place ;
where we rested for the night.
Tuesday, 23d.--At six, A.M., I again resumed my
journey, and reached Yankumási at nine, where I
stopped to breakfast. Asín Chibbu, the Chief, received
me very kindly, and asked me to stay with him a day or
two; but our societies on the coast acted as a powerful
magnet, which seemed to draw me with almost irresisti-
ble force towards them. I therefore promised Chibbu a
visit at some future opportunity, and hastened on my
way with all speed. The road was so much overgrown
with luxuriant vegetation, that I was literally dragged
through the bushes, and was soon compelled to walk.
The morning sun was also intensely hot, and the path so
narrow, that an umbrella was of little use. Instead of
passing through Domonási as I did on my journey up to
Kumási, I left it on my left, and took a shorter road to
Cape Coast.
About noon I reached Dunquah, (“Payntree's croom" of
Bowdich,) where I rested my carriers, &c., a few minutes ;
after which I proceeded about four miles, took some
refreshment, and then pushed forward to within about
nine miles of Cape Coast. Finding that many of my
people were unable to proceed any further, I left them
in a little croom for the night, and urged on my way;
taking with me only the hammock-men, (whom I had
rested the greater part of the day by walking about
twenty-five miles,) and also a soldier. As I approached
nearer to Cape Coast, the roads were much better; and,
having the advantage of a fine moonlight night, I
reached the Mission-house in safety, about nine, P.m., and
obtained a refreshing view of the “deep, deep sea,"
which unites Cape Coast with my native land, with
feelings of humble gratitude to Almighty God who had

mercifully preserved me in the midst of so many dangers,
not imaginary but real, and brought me home in health,
peace, and safety.
I trust, my dear Sirs, that these copious extracts from
my Journal will convince you, that God, in his infinite
mercy, is gently opening before us our way into the
interior of this vast continent. Future difficulties will
doubtless arise ; but I am fully confident that they will
not be of such a nature as to hinder the Christian Mis-
sionary from pressing on in the glorious conflict. It is
true, that this spiritual Jericho at present stands strong,
and that Satan, its monster king, still has the triumph of
seeing thousands of helpless men, for whom Christ died,
dashed into the dust in dishonour: but Israel shall
surely triumph ; the mystical rams' horns shall not be
blown in vain; the enemy shall be taken in his strong-
hold, and the Redeemer shall have these “ Heathen"
for his “inheritance,” and the “uttermost parts of the
earth” for his “possession.”
I believe that my long detention at Fomunah, on my
way to Kumási, was the Lord's doing. The great
length of time which I remained there, gave me an ex-
cellent opportunity of becoming acquainted with the
people, and of gaining their affections. I also became
accustomed, by gentle degrees, to those horrid and
awful scenes, which are every-day occurrences in that
place.
Fomunah is a much more desirable place for the
establishment of a Mission, at the present time, than
Kumási. The people are more prepared for the re-
ception of the Gospel; and their Chief, Korinchi, is
exceedingly well-disposed towards us. Nevertheless, I
should have no hesitation in attempting the establishment
of a Mission even in the capital itself.

To carry on the
will require mene
I also deem
To carry on this glorious work in Ashanti, and other
parts of the interior, will require men of great nerve,
patience, forbearance, and perseverance. I also deem
it necessary to remind you of the importance of sending
persons who are rather light than heavy in weight, as
the hammock-men will not carry them, if they are very
heavy. Yet, on the other hand, they must not be too
small and weak: if so, they will never (humanly speak-
ing) bear the heavy toils of travelling in this climate.
If I were a little larger than I am, I should meet with
almost insuperable difficulties in this respect. If I were
not very strong, I could not have borne half the toils
through which I have passed.
I have no doubt as to getting up to Ashánti for the
future with much less expense than has been incurred in
my first visit. The King would not make so much ado
the second time, as I am no longer a stranger. I also
think, that even with a stranger he would not adopt the
same course as he did with me, inasmuch as the novelty
is over.
While I was staying at Fomunah, the King sent a
messenger to see what kind of a person I was. When
the messenger returned, he asked him what he had
seen, in language something like the following: -
The King.—You have seen the Fetishman?
MESSENGER.— Yes.
King.-Had he plenty of drums with him?
MESSENGER.-I saw no drums.
King.–Why! he is a Fetishman : he must have
drums with him.
MESSENGER.-I saw no drums. He has plenty of
boxes ; but I cannot say what they contain.
King. Why did you not endeavour to learn whether
the boxes contained drums or not?
I was informed that the King was exceedingly angry

with the man because he could not give him a satisfactory
answer. At another time the King said, “Never since
the world began, has there been an English Mission-
ary in Ashánti. What can he want?” As I have
been to Kumasi, and not only so, but have visited him
in his own residence; as well as having been a fortnight
under the watchful care of his chief linguist, Apoko,
who has his entire confidence; his jealousies are, doubt-
less, so far removed, that he will not be likely to detain
a Missionary so long on the road again, while perplexing
and puzzling himself with questions of the before-
mentioned character.
It was manifest, that a great change had taken place
respecting me in the mind of the King, after I had been
a few days in Kumási ; for he seemed very anxious to
detain me, if possible ; and I believe he would have kept
me several weeks longer, thereby placing my life in the
greatest danger from the rains, &c., but for the kindness
of President Maclean, who, knowing the probable con-
sequences of my being detained in that manner, wrote
to the King, some time after I left Cape Coast, request-
ing him to allow me to leave Kumási whenever I thought
proper.
I deeply regretted the necessity of leaving so early ;
but had I stayed longer, I must, in all probability, have
remained until the rainy season was over, which I was
not prepared to do.
Doubtless, there has been a great advantage gained
by this enterprise; and I trust, my dear Sirs, you will,
by the liberality of British Christians, and especially
those of our own body, be enabled to follow up that ad-
vantage, by sending out, as early as possible, three or
four Missionaries, at least, that more attention may be
paid to Ashánti.
I intend sending up a messenger to the King, to

keep the communication open, as soon as the rains are
over; and shall wait with great anxiety for an answer
from you, as to what steps are to be taken. If it were
practicable, a handsome present, of the description I
mentioned in my last, [namely, a pony-phaeton, and
harness, suitable to the country,] would be well received
by the King, and be of much importance, in influencing
his mind in our favour.
After I had prepared the preceding extracts from my
Journal, I felt it my duty to hand them over to His
Excellency, President Maclean ; who, after he had pe-
rused them, returned them with the following letter,
which he has kindly permitted me to annex to them :-
“MY DEAR SIR,
"I HEREWITH return your narrative of your journey
to Ashánti, which I have perused with very great interest.
“I would fain hope that, from the manner in which
you were received in your avowed character as a Mis-
sionary, throughout the whole of your arduous journey,
there will not exist many obstacles to the accomplishment
of the first object-getting a locus standi in the country.
Certainly I think there will be no insuperable obstacle.
“I hope and trust the Wesleyan Missionary Com-
mittee will be satisfied, that there is such an opening as
will justify them, in pushing the advantage gained by
your indefatigable zeal. I would almost go so far as to
say, that if they have the means, a serious responsibility
will rest upon them, and on Christian England, if so
glorious an opening into interior Africa,—if so rich a
harvest, be neglected. But I hope better things. And
I do not despair of yet witnessing the peaceful triumph
of the cross, even in that stronghold of Satan, Kumási.

Extract of a Letter from the Rev. T. B. Freeman to the Secre-
taries of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, dated Cape-Coast
Castle, September 17th, 1839.
Your letter of July 23d is very encouraging. I feel
thankful that the Committee has authorized me to pur-
chase the house which I recommended. I will take
care to proceed judiciously and cautiously, in making the
purchase.
I am delighted to hear that you intend to send us two
additional Missionaries, and one of them married. I need
not tell you with what joy we shall receive them. May
the God of Missions grant them a prosperous voyage !
I am very glad that you have received my letter of
May 7th ; and hope, ere this reaches you, you will have
received my Journal and other papers. The results of
my Mission to Ashánti are now beginning to be manifest.
The King, I hear, from good authority, is becoming
anxious respecting the establishment of a school in Ku-
mási, and is expecting me to pay him another visit; and
many of the Ashántis who became acquainted with me
during my late visit, call at the Mission-house to see
me, when they come down to Cape Coast. A brother
of Korinchi has this morning paid me a visit, presenting
his regards, and stating that they will be very happy to
see me in Ashánti again. If the advantage already
gained can be followed up, I have no doubt that, under
the blessing of the God of Missions, we shall, in due
time, meet with abundant success in Ashánti.

Letter from the same.
REV. AND DEAR SIRS,
I am happy to inform you, that our new chapel at
Anamabu is in a sufficient state of forwardness for con-
stant use. The foundation was laid August 14th, 1838.
It is built with stone, to the height of one foot above the
ground: the remaining part of the walls are swish, and
are two feet thick, very strong and durable, and carried
to the height of sixteen feet. The roof is made with
deal, purchased at a reasonable price in the neighbour-
hood, and thatched. The dimensions of the chapel are
fifty-three feet by thirty, and it will seat from four to
five hundred persons. The floor is of the same material
as the greater part of the walls. A pulpit and com-
munion-rails are erected, and the whole of the remaining
part is fitted up with fixed benches. Had not the people
exerted themselves exceedingly, it could not have been
so forward; but I am glad to say, they assisted nobly,
both in labour and contributions; and the happy con-
sequence is, that it is placed out of all danger from the
rains, which have been very destructive this season.
A few days after my arrival from the interior, I went
down to Anamabu, taking with me carpenters, brick-
layers, &c., to prepare it for opening as early as possible.
All things being ready, on Sunday, May 26th, 1839, I
opened it for divine worship.
At seven, A. M., I read prayers, and preached to an
attentive congregation, from, “Know ye that the Lord,
he is God,” &c. (Psalm c. 3, 4.) Many felt it to be a
delightful service, and the tear of gratitude to Almighty
God was shed. Our members at Cape Coast came

APPENDICES.
75
down, though the distance is twelve miles and a half, to
congratulate their Anamabu friends, and share with them
in the solemn and sacred blessings of the day.
At three, P. M., I again preached to a large congrega-
tion, amounting to about one thousand persons, from
Heb. iv. 9—13. The chapel would not hold the whole:
several hundreds of Heathens crowded the windows.
At seven, P. M., I again preached from Heb. iv.
14–16. We had a large and serious congregation.
Many present felt it “good to wait on the Lord.” The
collections amounted to £10. 3s. 9d., notwithstanding
the previous 'exertions on the part of the people.
It affords me pleasure to state, that I called upon the
gentlemen residing in Anamabu, a few days before the
chapel was opened, to solicit their aid, and succeeded in
every application. Several at Cape Coast also rendered
us timely and friendly aid. The sum thus raised at
Cape Coast and Anamabu amounts to £32 currency; for
which we feel thankful.
Our cordial thanks are due especially to Henry Barnes,
Esq.,-in whose house I always find a hearty welcome,
and a comfortable home, whenever I visit Anamabu,- for
his kind assistance, not only in liberally contributing,
but also in superintending the work during my absence;
and in sending his workmen (carpenters and bricklayers)
to assist at various times, gratuitously. .
During the building of the chapel, many of our people
at Anamabu, not excepting some of the most respectable
among them, were often seen busily engaged in carrying
swish, &c., as early as two or three o'clock in the
morning.
Since the chapel has been opened, our kind friend
Mr. Barnes has, at his own expense, painted the pulpit
and communion-rails, &c.; and as the inside of the
chapel has had one coat of white-wash, it has a very neat

appearance. Blessed be God, who thus prospers the
work of our hands !
I have also the satisfaction of informing you, that our
chapel at Winnebah is also opened for divine worship.
The foundation-stone was laid July 5th, 1838. Our
little society there exerted themselves to the utmost of
their power; stimulated and led on by Mr. William De
Graft, who is now residing with me in the Mission-house,
as provisional Assistant. The walls are built with swish,
on a stone foundation, and carried to a height of fourteen
feet. The roof is made with native wood, and thatched.
Its dimensions are thirty-four feet by nineteen.
After I had opened the Anamabu chapel, I proceeded
to Winnebah, for the purpose of fitting up, and opening
the chapel in that place. Finding, however, that it was
scarcely ready, I sent up to Cape Coast for an extra
carpenter; and then journeyed to British Akrah, (a
distance of forty miles,) to visit our society, &c., recently
established there.
During my short stay at Akrah, I received much
kindness from the gentlemen and authorities; especially
from J. W. Hanson, Esq., the Commandant, and from
J. Bannerman, Esq., with whom I have always found a
cordial welcome.
Having no convenient place for meeting the society
while staying at Akrah, Mr. Hanson kindly lent me the
large hall in the Fort for that purpose ; and I am glad to
say, that I found the society and schools in a flourishing
condition. There are thirty-five members in society ;
and in the schools are sixty-five boys and twenty girls.
The boys' school has been established six months, and
the girls' two months. The local Government having
undertaken to bear half of the expenses of the boys'
school, the Commandant has kindly made comfortable
arrangements for the Schoolmaster and Mistress to reside,


## p. 77 (#95) ##############################################

APPENDICES,
and for both the schools to be kept in the Fort, until I
can make some permanent provision concerning them.
The Government takes no part in the general manage-
ment of the boys' school, that being entirely left to us.
Several of the scholars, who knew not the alphabet when
they entered the school, can now read lessons in the
New Testament. God be praised, our prospects at
British Akrah are of the most encouraging nature.
Pray send a Missionary there without delay.
Having stayed at Akrah a few days, I returned
to Winnebah, and proceeded to finish the chapel without
delay. In eight days after my return, we had a neat
pulpit erected, the floor fitted up with fixed benches,
and every arrangement made for opening it on Sunday,
June 23d, 1839.
At seven, A. M., we held a prayer-meeting in the
chapel, and at eleven I read prayers and preached
to an attentive and serious congregation, from, “For
thy Maker is thine husband, the Lord of hosts is his
name,” &c. (J.saiah liv. 5-8.) God was in the midst
of us, and blessed us. The Chief, and many of the most
respectable Heathens in the town, were present; many
of whom paid deep attention to the word spoken.
At three, P. M., I again preached to a large con-
gregation, from, “ It is appointed unto men once to
die,” &c. (Heb. ix. 27.) The Chief and his Captains,
&c., again attended, and behaved well. The respect-
able conduct of these Heathens reminded me of the
great change which has taken place in the character of
the Winnebah people, during the last few years. Some
time ago there was a small English fort in the centre of
the town. Misunderstandings having arisen between
the natives and the Commandant, the former rebelled
against the latter, and slew him. The consequence was,
that some British men-of-war fired on the town as they

APPENDICES.
sailed past it, and battered the fort to the ground ;
causing the refractory inhabitants to retreat into the
forest. On the very spot where the fort stood, and
where these unhappy events took place, stands our
chapel; and here also were collected together, peacefully
listening to the words of eternal life, the descendants of
those who had, in former days, been collected together
to shed blood. This happy change has taken place,
partly through the instrumentality of the local Govern-
ment of Cape Coast; and partly by the introduction of
that incomparable blessing, Christianity.
After the conclusion of the afternoon service, I spoke
to the people concerning opening a school for the
instruction of their children. They readily consented
to send them, as soon as I could make arrangements for
commencing.
The rains are now violent, and travelling is difficult;
but as soon as they are over, (which will be, I hope, in
a few days,) I intend sending down one of the youths
whom I have had in training at the Mission-house, to
commence the school. Winnebah is a place of great
importance to us, being about midway between Cape
Coast and British Akrah. While toiling along the coast
for a distance of nearly one hundred miles, visiting our
societies, I find Winnebah a delightful retreat from the
heavy sandy beach, the burning rays of an almost
vertical sun, and the strong breeze from the Atlantic.
I hope to see much lasting good result from the erection of
the chapel, and the establishment of a school at that place.
Our little chapel, or rather schoolroom, at Domonási,
I am happy to say, is also fit for use.
I must here beg leave to insert a few extracts from
my Journal for the last year, 1838.
November 22d, Thursday.-At five, A. M., I left
Anamabu for Domonási. As I was passing through the

glens, I saw a splendid production of nature : several
large trees from thirty to forty feet high covered with
blossoms nearly as large as a tulip, of a fine scarlet
colour, ornamented round the lamina with a golden
fringe, courted my attention. On examination, I found
them to belong to the class “ Dydinamia,” of Linnæus.
Amidst the various beauties of Flora, on which I have
feasted my eyes, both in England and Africa, I have
seen nothing comparable to this splendid tree : even the
horse-chestnut, the glory of Mount Pindus, cannot vie
with this production of the glen.
About half-past twelve I reached Domanási, and, to
my great satisfaction, found our society increasing in
divine knowledge, and in number.
Saturday, 24th.--I was engaged in levelling the floor
of the little swish-chapel, which our people have built
nearly at their own expense, intending to preach in it on
the morrow, although it is in such an unfinished state.
Sunday, 25th.–At seven, A. M., a prayer-meeting
was held in the new chapel. I felt greatly encouraged
in seeing this African temple full of persons, joining in
one general burst of praise to God. How applicable,
spiritually, to this scene are the words of our hymn !
“Hark! the wastes have found a voice,
Lonely deserts now rejoice,
Gladsome hallelujahs sing,
All around with praises ring.
“Lo! abundantly they bloom,
Lebanon is hither come;
Carmel's stores the heavens dispense,
Sharon's fertile excellence.
“See, these barren souls of ours
Bloom, and put forth fruits and flowers,
Flowers of Eden, fruits of grace,
Peace, and joy, and righteousness !"

At eleven, A. M., I preached to an attentive con-
gregation on the “one thing needful.”
Monday, 20th.–At half-past seven, A. M., I left
Domonási for Abasang, and travelled through the glens
until ten o'clock, when I halted in a small croom, and
took breakfast.
Having swung my hammock to some trees, and
rested awhile, I again proceeded on my way through a
marshy country, where I found the heat from the sun
to be almost insupportable.* After travelling a few
miles in this burning heat, I felt sick and weary, and
again swung my hammock, to rest under a large tree,
from half-past one until a quarter after three. I then
resumed my journey, and reached Abasang at a
quarter past five, P. M. On my arrival I was directed
to the Chief's residence, who met me in the yard' with
a hearty welcome, and offered me the best apartments
in his house, during my stay. In the course of the
evening, some of the Kabosirs, and our little society,
came to visit me. I soon retired to rest, much fatigued
with the toils of the day, in travelling through the worst
road I ever saw.
Tuesday, 27th.- About seven, A. M., I walked into
the yard, where I found the Chief and one of his Captains
waiting to receive me. After the usual compliments,
the Chief presented me with a sheep, a goat, and
sixteen yams.
In the course of the day, the Chief privately informed
me, that he felt very anxious to embrace Christianity,
but found the Captains averse to it, and he could not do

as he wished in the matter : he therefore desired me to
talk to them about it; which I promised to do. In the
evening, I preached in the Chief's court-yard : * all the
Captains, and many of the people of the town, attended.
Wednesday, 28th.—Sick. Two of the Captains came
to make me a present of goats and yams.
Thursday, 29th.— Still very weak. Under medicine.
Friday, 30th.-I saw all the Captains, save one who
is out of town, and had a long conversation with them in
the presence of the Chief, respecting their opposition to
Christianity. They acknowledged that they had op-
posed it; but said, that, since I had come to pay them
a visit, and explained to them more fully the nature of
Christianity, they believed it to be palaver papa, “a
good palaver ;” and that they freely withdrew their
opposition.
Having, by the blessing of God, accomplished my
object in visiting Abasang, I prepared for leaving it
early the following morning.
Abasang is a native town of considerable importance,
situated on a gently-rising hill, about twenty-four miles
from the sea-coast. The number of its inhabitants is
from fifteen hundred to two thousand. The chief article
of trade is palm oil : the palm which bears the nut,
from which the oil is extracted, growing in great
abundance in the beautiful glens in its immediate
neighbourhood. In the town, and about the skirts of it,
there are many sheep and goats, and plenty of poultry.

* I sent a native Teacher to this place some months ago, who
informed me that several of the townspeople would willingly attend
divine worship, &c., but were afraid, as some of the Captains had
opposed them; they had even gone so far, as to put some of them
in irons, because they worshipped the true God.

for Domonási. Several of our members (now amounting
to thirteen in number) accompanied me to the first croom
on the road, where I took an affectionate leave of them.
During my journey I passed through a small village,
where the people worship the devil, or bad spirit. I
inquired after the Fetishman, but could not see him,
being informed that it is his custom to go into the bush
on Saturday mornings, where he conceals himself during
the day.* I also crossed a small river, called the
Amissah. It is about twenty yards wide at the ford, and
four and a half feet deep. During the rainy season it
may, in all probability, rise to seven or eight feet, or more.
At half-past two, P. M., I reached Domonási in safety.
Sunday, 2d.-At half-past ten, A. M., I preached
from Isaiah lv. 6, 7. At three, P. M., I examined some
candidates for baptism, At four, P. M., I preached from
Colossians iv. 2 ; and, after the sermon, baptized six
adults and seven children.
Monday, 3d.—At half-past seven, P. M., I held a
Class-Leaders' meeting.
Tuesday, 4th.–At six, A. M., I started for Anamabu,
which place I reached at half-past two, P. M.
It is with pleasure I also inform you, that we have a
small society at a large croom called Salt-pond, (which
takes its name from a salt-pond near it,) situated on the
beach, about eight miles below Anamabu; and that they
are very anxious to build a little chapel, which they will
accomplish themselves; the laying of the foundation, the
doors and window-shutters, excepted. Consequently,
* In every town or croom of importance, there is one of
these Fetishmen to be found, whose employment is to delude these
benighted people, and to keep them in a state of servile bondage,
to answer their own base purposes. O Africa! Africa!

two or three place me title to the
as soon as the rains are over, I intend to go down
and commence the building for them, and then to have
the doors and windows made at Cape Coast, and to send
them down in a canoe. Without chapels very little can
be done on this Station.
I trust, my dear Sirs, that you will not blame me for
drawing upon you for £25 for the Anamabu chapel,
£15 for the Winnebah chapel, and £5 for the Domonási
chapel, as I have done so from pure necessity. A coat
of plaster and white-wash, on the outside is nearly all
that any of the above-mentioned buildings will require ;
and that I hope we shall be able to accomplish, without
further assistance from you.
The heavy rains have done some damage to the
vestry at Cape Coast, which will place me under the
necessity of employing two or three bricklayers for some
time in repairing it, after this season is over.
I had but just returned from Winnebah to Anamabu,
and was resting myself a few days, when I received
information that the vestry had suffered materially from
the rains. This unpleasant news arrived as I was taking
my dinner. I speedily packed up my things, and came
to Cape Coast the same afternoon, fearing lest the
chapel should sustain any injury. I am happy, however,
to state, that it has taken no harm, neither is it in danger.
The two old native houses, which stood near the
chapel at Cape Coast, I have purchased, and pulled
down, to avoid any accident by fire. I have only drawn
on you for the payment for one of them, as I am not
prepared, at present, to give you a statement of the exact
amount of the purchase, some trifling things in con-
nexion therewith not being finally settled. I also hope
to make some arrangements for removing the female
school to the present Mission-house, as soon as I obtain
your permission to purchase it for a permanent resi-

dence; and then there will be a year or two's rent of
the house (the old Mission-house taken by Mr. Wrigley)
in which the female school is now kept, which would
nearly or quite pay for the purchase of the old house in
question.
There will always be perplexities and expenses arising
on this Station about houses, until a purchase is made,
and the school kept on the same premises.
.
At Yankumási, a large native town in Fanti, about
twenty-eight miles inland, is an excellent opening for
the establishment of a school, &c. Asín Chibbu, the
Chief, called on me at the Mission-house a few weeks
after I passed through the town on my return from
Ashánti; and on my asking him if he would assist us
in erecting a chapel in his town, he answered, “Yes;
if you will send a person or two to direct, I will find
men to do the greater part of the work." For further
remarks on the kindness of Asín Chibbu, and the cha-
racter, &c., of his town, see my Ashánti Journal.
I verily believe, that, ere another rainy season arrives,
there will be three or four new chapels erected in this
neighbourhood by the Christian zeal of our native
societies. The amount of good done here during the
short time your Missionaries have visited the Station, is
much greater in extent than that in Fanti country,
though that is considerable.
The trading habits of many of our members cause
them to travel hundreds of miles into the interior.
To these parts they carry the word of life; and I
am glad to say, that the Lord blesses their humble
exertions in giving them “souls for their hire.” In-
credible as the following incident may appear, the fact is
not the less certain. While I was in Kumási, one of the
converts to Christianity from the interior, applied to me
for Christian baptism. As I found, during his exami-

nation, every proof of a sincere desire and purpose to live
as a true disciple of Christ, I granted his request; and
publicly baptized him in the presence of many Ashántis.
Surely Ethiopia is stretching out her hands to God.
As I know that the bare statement of these facts will
have more weight with you than any observations I can
make, I need not cry, “Men of Israel, help!” I there-

Visit of the Rev. Thomas B. Freeman to England; and
preparations for the Ashánti Mission.
June 18th, 1840.
We have much pleasure in stating, that the Rev.
Thomas Birch Freeman, the senior Wesleyan Missionary
on the Gold Coast in Western Africa, whose Journal of
his recent tour to Ashánti has justly excited so deep
and universal interest, arrived in London on Thursday
last. Mr. Freeman is accompanied in his temporary
visit to this country by Mr. William De Graft, a native
Local Preacher, and a valuable assistant in the African
Mission. Their stay in England is expected to be very
short; not exceeding, probably, four months, when
Mr. Freeman hopes to return to the scene of his evan-
gelical labours, accompanied by six other Missionaries.
Four of these are intended to be his companions, in the
glorious enterprise of attempting to establish a Mission
among the four millions of men, who constitute the

population of the powerful kingdom of Ashánti, and its
dependencies; and thus to introduce Christianity,
education, and civilization into one important portion of
that great continent, to which Britain owes so vast a
debt of reparation, for the wrongs and miseries of the
accursed slave-trade. This Mission may now be con-
sidered as fully determined upon by the Wesleyan
Missionary Society, in accordance with the resolution of
the late Annual Meeting in London ; and it will
certainly be undertaken as soon as the Special Fund, now
raising for that purpose, shall have reached the amount
of, at least, Five Thousand Pounds; being the sum
deemed requisite for outfits, passages, the expenses of
introducing and establishing a new Mission in a heathen
country, and the support of the agents to be employed for
the first three years. The General Fund of the Society
being already pledged for other existing and older
Missions, to more than the extent of its present ordinary
means, the Committee have been obliged to have recourse
to the formation of a Special Fund for Ashánti and the
Gold Coast, as the only plan at present available, for
enabling them to meet this new and important opening
in Western Africa. We earnestly commend it to the
prompt and liberal support of the Christian public.

Ordination and Valedictory Services. Departure of the
Rev. Thomas B. Freeman and party.
On Monday, the 1st of December, 1840, a special
service was held at Great Queen-street chapel, London,
connected with the departure of the Missionaries ap-
pointed to Ashánti and the coast of Guinea; and
notwithstanding the limited extent to which previous

notice of the Meeting had been circulated, the chapel
was well filled with a very attentive and devout audience.
The service was conducted by the Rev. Drs. Bunting,
Hannah, and Alder, and Messrs. Beecham and Hoole.
The newly-appointed Missionaries, Messrs. Hesk, Watson,
Shipman, Thackwray, and Walden, were introduced to
the Meeting ; and the three former gave a brief detail
of the circumstances by which, under divine Pro-
vidence, they had seen it their duty to offer themselves
for the arduous services of a Mission to Africa. The
five Missionaries were then solemnly ordained to the
office and work of the Christian ministry. Dr. Bunting
conducted the Ordination service; and the other
Ministers above-mentioned assisted in the “laying on
of hands.” The Rev. John Beecham next addressed
the Missionaries, on the peculiar circumstances and
duties of the Mission to which they had been solemnly
designated. He then introduced the Rev. Thomas B.
Freeman, who, with deep feeling, acknowledged the
kindness he had experienced during his visit to this
country; and expressed his thankfulness for the success
he had met with, in his endeavours to awaken a more
lively interest and active exertion, in behalf of that part
of Africa which it was his business to represent. Mr.
De Graft, a native Fanti Assistant on the Mission, who
had accompanied Mr. Freeman to this country, took his
farewell of the Christian public, by a most appropriate and
interesting address ; at the close of which Dr. Bunting, in
the name of the Committee, presented to him a Bible, as a
token of their regard and affection, and expressed a hope,
that he would still successfully study and publish those
blessed and important truths which that holy book reveals.
The Rev. Dr. Hannah, Theological Tutor of the
Wesleyan Institution, delivered to the Missionaries a
very instructive and impressive charge ; and, at the

close of the service, the whole congregation appeared to
unite most fervently in the prayer which was offered up
in the behalf of the Missionaries, and for the success of
the Mission, by the Rev. Dr. Bunting.
On Wednesday, the 2d of December, the Missionaries
and Mr. De Graft took their formal leave of the General
Committee of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and of
the Wesleyan Ministers of London and its vicinity, a
great number of whom were present on the occasion in
Hatton-Garden.
The sailing of the “Osborn,” by which vessel the
Missionaries were to proceed to Cape-Coast, was delayed
until Thursday, the 10th of December : on that day the
whole party embarked at Gravesend, and immediately
set sail. They are, in all, eleven persons; namely,
Mr. and Mrs. Freeman, and native boy; Mr. De Graft;
Mr. and Mrs. Hesk; Mr. Watson; Mr. and Mrs.
Shipman; Mr. Thackwray; and Mr. Walden. Never
was a Missionary party dismissed from the shores of
England with a more intense feeling of interest and
sympathy. All acknowledge the very arduous and
difficult character of the Mission, as well as its important
bearings on the welfare of the human race, and one of
the boldest efforts yet made by the Church, in modern
times, to introduce Christianity and its attendant blessings
to the independent Negro states of interior Africa.
Thousands of prayers have been offered in behalf of
these Missionaries and their undertaking ; and we do
not doubt that they will be constantly remembered at
the throne of grace, by those who are concerned for
the prosperity and extension of the kingdom of Christ.
[The party, having been favoured with a safe voyage,
landed at Cape-Coast Castle, on Monday the 1st of
February; all in the enjoyment of good health.]

Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Thomas B. Freeman,
dated Anamabu, May 5th, 1841.
All the brethren, except Mr. Thackwray, have pro-
ceeded to occupy their different posts; and I have made
arrangements for proceeding to Domonási with Mr.
Thackwray early to-morrow morning. Mr. Brooking is
now residing at Mansu, and making preparations for
our enterprise in Ashánti. Mansu will be a place of
great importance to us, while carrying on our operations
in Ashánti; and I think we shall find it to be a very
healthy situation. I have received an encouraging
message from the King of Ashánti, from which I learn,
that he entertains friendly feelings towards us, and will
be very glad to see us in Kumási. On the 29th of
March, we held our Missionary Meeting, which had
been postponed for several weeks on account of our
whant Macon with his
party not having arrived : President Maclean, with his
usual kindness, occupied the chair. The Meeting was
one of some interest; and the collection, including the
subscriptions of our worthy chairman and other friends,
and £14 from the societies in sheep, goats, &c., amounted
to £51. 11s. 3d.
I trust that, ere this reaches you, an ample Special
Fund for the support of the Gold Coast Mission will
have been realized ; and that you will send us out
another Missionary without delay, as we shall very
much need another brother to occupy Cape Coast,
while Messrs. Brooking, Walden, and myself are in
Ashánti.

Extract of a Letter from the late Rev. William Thackwray,
Wesleyan Missionary, dated Anamabu, May 5th, 1841.
I am just on the point of leaving for Domonási, most
of my boxes and household requisites having arrived
there already. I would not forget to mention to you
with pleasure, that a native merchant here, Mr. Parker,
has made me a present of a lathe, not of the first-rate
kind, it is true, but still useful, which I immediately
devoted to the Mission, and it has gone off to Domonási
this morning, with other things. Mr. and also Mrs.
Freeman are here at present; the former designing to
accompany me to-morrow morning to Domonási. With
respect to Ashánti we can say as yet but little or nothing.
Mr. Freeman, as perhaps he will inform you, has had a
very friendly and gratifying correspondence with the
King of Ashánti; and we confidently hope, that, by the
favour of an overruling Providence, the Gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ will be happily introduced, and
established, among the barbarous and warlike Ashántis.
Yes, I trust the blessing of heaven will descend upon
them like showers upon the mown grass; that the moral
wilderness may be glad for English Christian Mission-
aries, and that the intellectual and spiritual “ desert” of
Ashánti, will “ blossom as the rose.” True it is, that
the national character of the Ashántis has been pro-
minently distinguished by ferocity, and (perhaps some-
times not without cause) by political jealousy; and that,
therefore, this great and critical enterprise should be
undertaken with the utmost prudence, and managed
with the utmost caution. Even at this moment, owing,
I believe, to the death of one of the King's relatives,

there is a great "custom" being made in Kumási, which
is to last for several weeks, and in which perhaps one
hundred and fifty, or two hundred, or perhaps more,
will unhappily, by this blood-thirsty religion of the
devil, lose their lives. Yet far be it from us to be
discouraged. Other tribes and other people, as fierce as
the fierce Ashántis, have been tamed and subdued,
converted and evangelized, by the preaching of “the
cross of our Lord Jesus Christ :" and does He still
live? Yes, “He ever liveth.” And are his will, and
willingness, and power the same? Without controversy,
“He changeth not;" and I delight, even on African
ground, to remember, that it is declared, it is written in
the volume of infallible inspiration, that the “Gospel of
the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a
witness unto all nations ;' yea, and that another pro-
phecy of the same volume is, “ The kingdoms of this
world shall become the kingdoms of our God and of
his Christ.” We will not, then, by the grace of
God, be faint-hearted. Rather, we will be highly ani-
mated and encouraged in our blessed and soul-cheering
work. The Lord has enabled me to introduce the
Gospel into Egá, a croom on the beach about a
mile from Anamabu. It was formerly visited by Mr.
Wrigley, but it was afterwards relinquished, and in that
sense neglected; and hence the partial success gained,
had gradually vanished away. Mr. Hesk has been
too ill to visit Egá, so that the interpreters and I
have had it to ourselves. We did not hold regular
service, (this would have been premature,) but cate-
chetical conversations; and the effects are pleasing and
promising.

Extract of a Letter from President Maclean, dated
Cape-Coast Castle, September 11th, 1841.
Mr. Freeman's letters, and Mr. Hesk personally,
will make you acquainted with the melancholy loss
which your Mission in this quarter has sustained, by the
late deaths of Mrs. Freeman and Mrs. Hesk. As Mr.
Freeman will, doubtless, have detailed to you very fully
the apparent causes which led to those lamented losses,
I need not enter into them ; but, as every death of a
European, which occurs in this country, is invariably
ascribed, in England, to the effects of climate, and as
the late deaths, added to those of Messrs. Thackwray
and Walden, will, I fear, cast a damp on the exertions
of our Christian friends in England, I feel anxious to
remove, in some measure, from your mind, the idea
that these deaths have been caused solely by the climate.
In point of fact, each of the lamented individuals in
question had passed safely through the seasoning fever ;
and I do think, that, with sufficient prudence and care,
their lives might have been preserved. I ought, indeed,
to except Mrs. Freeman's case ; for her death was
occasioned by. an hereditary and peculiar complaint. I
am far, however, from taxing the others with positive
imprudence or recklessness of life ; but when persons
have arrived at a certain age, their habits and opinions
on the subject of health become generally fixed, and
they will not readily forego those habits and opinions,
however earnestly urged by those who are much better
acquainted with the country and climate, than they can
possibly be. While, then, I would fain hope that the
friends of West African Missions will not be cast down
by the late events, but will continue their generous

sertions in the liberty of susted for the ons not being
exertions in a cause so sacred, I would, at the same
time, take the liberty of suggesting that young persons
should, if possible, be selected for the work of the
Mission in this country. Their constitutions not being
fully formed, they would become more readily and easily
acclimated, than persons more advanced in life; and
they would more willingly listen to, and adopt, the
suggestions of persons more experienced than them-
selves.
In conclusion, I beg to assure you, that my poor
services may be made at all times available, for the
furtherance of the great cause, to which you and so many
others have devoted their lives and means.

Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Thomas B. Freeman,
dated British Akrah, September 10th, 1841.
While the Expedition was staying at Akrah, we were
visited by President Maclean, accompanied by Captain
Tucker, Commander of Her Majesty's frigate “Iris,”
and the two Captains Allen, of the “Soudan” and
“Wilberforce.” Captain Tucker informed us of an
opening for Missionary enterprise on the banks of the
Gaboon, where some of the natives are very anxious for
religious instruction; and have told him, that if a
Teacher could be sent to them, they would furnish him
with a house, and undertake to support him. Captain
Tucker said he was so fully satisfied that the establish-
ment of Missions, &c., in the slave-dealing states, would
be the most effectual means of destroying the slave-
trade, that he would embrace an early opportunity of
taking one of us down in the "Iris" to visit these

people, and see what can be done; after which he
would bring him back again to the Station. This is a
noble offer, of which, I trust, we shall be able to avail
ourselves.*
With the Niger Expedition came the Ashánti
Princes, and I am glad to find them promising young
men. They will be exposed to many dangers on
their arrival in Kumási. O God, preserve them! Mr.
Brooking and I shall leave for Kumási in company with
them. We start for that capital of Ashánti, God
willing, early in October. Our prospects all around
are cheering, and we are expecting much success and
prosperity in our work. The mind of the King of
Ashánti seems to be still favourably disposed towards
us. May the Lord turn his heart as the “rivers of
water!"
Though my opportunities of becoming acquainted,
since my return, with the spiritual state of our societies,
have been rather limited, yet I rejoice to say, that I
find many things of a very encouraging character..
There is a marked attention paid to the preaching of
the word of life. Our seasons of grace at the Lord's
table have been of the most hallowed description.
The prayer-meetings are very exhilarating means of
grace, and the congregations are generally good.
* Can you send us out a Missionary for this enterprise ? Our
party is now so small, that we could only spare one for a few
months, or, at the longest, on a Mission of observation to the
Gaboon. A man of great MORAL COURAGE, and PRUDENCE OF
THE HIGHEST ORDER, would be required.

HAVING but a very short notice of the sailing of the
“New Times,” I simply write to state, that Messrs.
Freeman and Brooking left this for Kumási on Saturday
last, the 6th instant, accompanied by the two Ashanti
Princes. They were all in the enjoyment of good health
and spirits, and are daily commended by us all to the
blessing and protection of God our heavenly Father.
As the suspicions and jealousies of the King appear
greatly removed, no delay is expected from him, such
as Mr. Freeman experienced before, but they hope to
arrive in Kumási in a fortnight from the time of leaving
Cape Coast.
You will be aware that the societies on the coast are
now left under the care of Mr. Watson and myself. We
have both, especially of late, been the subjects of much
affliction, and are not yet able to undertake our work
fully. Our health, however, is improving daily, as the
latter rains have ceased, and the fine weather is setting
in. Mrs. Shipman continues also to enjoy better health.
We expect and are looking for a reinforcement soon.

the coast. The “ African Queen” sails this day at four
o'clock; and it will probably be three weeks or a month
before another vessel leaves the coast for England. Mr.
and Mrs. Shipman, and myself, are all quite well, and
enjoying excellent health and spirits. The former are
intended to remain here, and the latter is expected to
become the colleague of Mr. Brooking, when Mr. Free-

SATURDAY, Nov. 6th, 1841.-All things being ready,
after great trouble in preparation, at half-past twelve,

consists of the two Princes,* Henry Smith, Esq., (who
thinks of accompanying us to the River Prah,) the Rev.
Robert Brooking, my interpreter, our servants, about
one hundred and fifty carriers from the coast, with one
hundred and sixty from Ashánti, and a Sergeant and
six soldiers from the Fort. The party may altogether
amount to three hundred and forty men.
The most difficult part of our work was that of con-

a present for the King. The narrowness of the road in
many places impeded us much ; and night coming on

carriage, we were obliged to leave it on the side of the
road, with a few men in charge of it; after which we
proceeded to the nearest village.
The men who carried our clothes, provisions, &c., not
being aware of our having been detained with the car-
riage, had proceeded to a still more distant croom, where
I had informed them we should probably stop for the
night. In consequence of this, we were obliged to
retire to rest, without any refreshment; and, as our
mattresses were taken forward, nearly all of us had to
sleep on the ground, in small huts. John Ansah slept
in his basket, and I spread my cloak on the ground.

carriers returned with some of the clothes, provisions,

At about ten minutes before twelve, A. M., we held
divine service: Mr. Brooking read prayers, and I
preached from part of 2 Cor. v. It was an interesting
service : many of our carriers were present. Lord, let
thy blessing attend thy word !
About five-and-twenty minutes before three, P. M.,
we had a short but heavy shower of rain, with some
thunder.
Last night the men who had the care of the carriage,
saw a very large horned snake: they could not ascertain
its length; in circumference it was about the size of a
man's arm.
I have now spent another Sabbath in the wilderness.
What a mercy it is that my lot was cast in a land of
Bibles ! How great are my privileges above those of
the poor Pagans around me!
“ I take the blessing from above,
And wonder at thy boundless love !"

men travel much better with the carriage this morn-
ing. We reached Asabu at a quarter before eight,
where we halted for breakfast. The morning was very
fine, and the appearance of the country beautiful, with a
balmy atmosphere. The plantations of plantains, &c.,
are in splendid condition ; Canna Indica is in full bloom
in every direction.
After breakfast we again resumed our journey. The
heat was very oppressive. We were overtaken by heavy
rain, which impeded our progress much. We rested to
change our wet clothes for dry ones, and also to dine, at
Akroful. We started from Akroful at a quarter past
three, P. M., and reached Tukwah at half-past five, where
we stopped for the night. The crooms we have passed
through to-day are small; and the carriage has given us
an immense deal of trouble, and very much impeded
our progress. We are not more than one good day's
journey from Cape-Coast, though we have been a day
and a half actually travelling. To-morrow we intend
to have the carriage drawn, instead of being carried ;
as such labour is too much for any men, even
natives, to contend with, in a climate so hot and ex-
hausting. I trust we shall succeed in forwarding the
vehicle to Kumási, as it will be a most extraordinary
sight, which, I trust, will operate favourably on the
King's mind.
The fire-flies are numerous around us this evening;
many of them flying about our little tent, and emitting
their faint but beautiful rays.
O God, my God, how excellent is thy loving-kindness!
In the midst of all my acute trials, thou cheerest my
drooping spirits, and comfortest my heart. O let me
daily see thee in thy splendid works around ; let
me feel thy love in my heart; let thy blessing attend
me in this and every enterprise which may have thy

9th.—About eight, A. M., we started, having first put
the carriage on the wheels. About noon we reached
Dunquah, rested the people for half an hour, and then
proceeded to Yankumási. On the way we were over-
taken by a tornado : the rains and thunder were very
heavy. Keeping behind with the carriage, I got wet,
and did not reach Yankumási until half-past five, P. M.
Chibbu (the Asín Chief) was seated under his um-
brella, with his Captains, &c., ready to receive us.
Finding that I was on the way with the carriage, he had
sent a party of men to remove the fallen trees, &c., out
of the road. He received us very kindly, and seemed
glad to see us.
10th.–We started, at half-past six, A. M., for Mansu,
accompanied by Chibbu, and a party of his men; who
assisted in removing the obstacles out of our way, in
passing through the forest with the carriage. The day
was very fine; and the beautiful scenery around us,-
the appearance of so large a party of men, laden with
packages, shouting as they wound their way among the
gigantic forest-trees, over hill and vale,—the sound of
Chibbu's rustic band, drums, &c., which were played
nearly the whole day,—and the well-known sound of the
axe and bill-hook, clearing some of the smaller trees out
of the path, combined to form a scene of a very romantic
and exciting description. At half-past six, P. M., we
reached Akiási, having left the carriage about two miles
behind us in the forest, on account of the darkness of the
evening.
11th.At half-past five, A. M., we went to bring up
the carriage to Akiási, took breakfast, and proceeded to
Mansu, where we arrived about noon. Gabri, the Chief,

received us very kindly, and appeared very glad to see
me. I had not seen him since my return from England.
12th.-.We halted at Mansu to rest the men, and
to make various preparations to facilitate our journey to
Kumási, through the more thinly populated, and less
cultivated parts of Fanti.
Mr. Brooking's few months' residence at Mansu has
had a very salutary effect; and the people are much
pleased at the idea of an European Missionary residing
among them. Our little school, which has cost us some
trouble to establish, on account of the prejudices of the
people, contains eleven children, several of whom are
beginning to make pleasing progress in their learning.
When I passed through this place to Kumási in 1839,
nothing had been done, and no Missionary had ever
visited it; but now, my ears are saluted, and my heart
gladdened, by the sweet melody of the children, who
have learned to sing the praises of God. Small as the
number of children may appear, this is a great change
in so short a period.
Another source of encouragement is, that we hope
soon to have a large and convenient Mission-house here,
for the use of brethren passing up to Kumási, at which
stores, &c., may be kept, and forwarded to Kumási
whenever required. This will be a great advantage
to us.*
* While preaching at Mansu, on my return from Kumasi, I
adverted to the wonderful change which had taken place in a few
years, and reminded the people, that, formerly, no European would
have thought of visiting Mansu, much less of residing there. I
adverted to the scenes of bloodshed and desolation which had taken
place in the neighbourhood, and the want of confidence among all
parties, whether Europeans, Fantis, Ashántis, or Asins; and com-
pared such a state, with our peaceful and quiet visits among them.
They reflected on the fact, and were filled with astonishment.

reached Ernebiage about thes that we were
13th.—At nine, A.M., we proceeded on our journey.
In about two hours we were overtaken by a heavy rain,
which continued, more or less, nearly the whole of the
afternoon.
Gabri followed us to Inkwirasu, the first croom after
leaving Mansu, and there bade us farewell, sending
forward a company of men with a Captain, to clear the
road more effectually, that we might pass with the carriage.
Though Chibbu had handsomely assisted us along
from Dunquah to Mansu, he also sent a Captain with
several men before, to assist Gabri's people in clearing
the road to the river Prah.
The heavy rains, and the large stumps and roots of
trees, made the road so bad, that we were obliged to
leave the carriage about three miles behind us. We
reached Ernebirim about five, P.M.
Sunday, 14th.–At eleven, A.M., I conducted divine
service under the shade of some splendid Plantain-trees.
Many of the people were present, and paid steady
attention to the word of life.
Fifteen of our men had been left behind with the
carriage, and we had decided on returning to them
early to-morrow morning to bring it up to the croom,
which work we hoped to accomplish by noon, or one,
P. M., intending to take one hundred men with us, to
assist in clearing the road. About one, just when
we had finished our conversation about the carriage, to
our great surprise, the men made their appearance with
it in the croom. They were, I think stimulated to
accomplish this extraordinary task, first, from a wish to
please and astonish us, not considering the conscientious
veneration in which we held the Sabbath ; and, secondly,
from an objection which they had to spend another cold
damp night in the forest. Rain fell early in the after-
noon, preceded by intense sultry heat.

15th.–At six, A.M., we proceeded on our journey.
The roads were wet and heavy. We halted to breakfast
at Kwatua-Kuma, a very small croom. After breakfast,
the Princes, with Messrs. Smith and Brooking, left me
behind at this place with the carriage, at my own
particular request, and proceeded towards the Prah.
I made this request, because it was necessary for me to
travel as slowly as the carriage, which I feared would
be irksome to my companions, as my attention to it was
so much engaged, as not to admit of my having much
intercourse with them. I stopped for the night at
Bansu.
16th.—At half-past five, A.M., I renewed my journey.
The roads were better, and we made greater progress.
I reached Fasuwia at a quarter to five, P.M., and rested
for the night. Very heavy rain in the evening, with
thunder and lightning. I saw some splendid butter-
flies, with colours of the richest hue.
17th.—At half-past five, A.M., we proceeded on our
way through a beautiful country, full of luxuriant
vegetation. The heat was very intense. We halted
for the night at Apunsi.
18th.—At five, A.M., we resumed the journey. The
country is beautiful, but the heat was oppressive. There
are splendid insects in great abundance. We saw a
beautiful species of Quercus, heavily laden with acorns.
We reached Dansamisu at six, P.M., and rested for the
night.
19th.–At ten minutes to five, A.M., I started for the
Prah, which splendid river I reached in safety about
half-past eleven. I am truly thankful for journey-
ing mercies. I found Mr. Brooking poorly; but my
other travelling companions were in good health.
I feel it to be a cause of humble gratitude to Almighty
God, that no serious accident has hitherto occurred

during a journey of eighty or ninety miles through the
Fanti country; while the carriage has been taken
through the most rugged and difficult paths, over steep
banks and rocks, down ravines, and over rivers.
..My own good health is to me extraordinary, amidst
so much labour, care, and anxiety, added to my many
sorrows : but why do I speak of them?
"'Tis magnanimity to hide the wound.”
O my full heart! '
“Heaven gives us friends to bless the present life,
Removes them to prepare us for the next.”
Since we left Cape Coast, on Saturday, the 6th ult.,
I have not ridden more than ten miles; the journey I
have generally performed on foot, in company with the
men who are taking the carriage ; and, on account of
the incessant rain which we have had, the roads
were so miry, that I was wet in my legs and feet
nearly the whole of each succeeding day. The only
inconvenience I have suffered from this exposure,
has been constant and violent attacks of tooth-ache, a
thorn in the flesh, to remind me, in the midst of my
otherwise good health and arduous labours, that my
deathless spirit is still inhabiting a frail tenement of
clay.
On Thursday morning last, while busily engaged in
starting the men with the carriage, in the twilight, about
five o'clock, I met with an accident, which might have
deprived me of the use of at least one of my fingers on
my left hand, by the knuckle coming in contact with the
edge of a sharp felling-axe, which cut some way into
the bone.
20th.—The heat is very intense. In the afternoon I
went up the river, for a short distance, in a canoe.

The weather was fine, and the scene indescribably
beautiful.
From the great quantity of rain which has recently
fallen, the river is higher than usual for this season of
the year; and the increased depth of water adds greatly
to its beauty. The foliage of the trees on its banks
baffles all attempts at description. The gigantic Bombax,
covered with climbers, Epiphytical Orchidacea, towering
high above the other trees of the forest; the numerous
varieties of Mimosa, growing from fifty to seventy feet
high, and presenting to the admiring eye all the grace-
fulness and beauty of Mimosa Sensitiva. The Bamboo-
palm, with its beautiful leaves, from eighteen to twenty-
four feet in length ; the Elais Guineensis, nearly equal
in beauty to the former, and its interest heightened by
its almost life-sufficing qualities; the Plantain-tree,
with its splendid foliage, and beautiful nodding bunch
of fruit; the gaudy plumage of the birds, which warble
on banks or flit across the stream, and the ever-grateful,
ever-pleasing sound of the rapidly-running waters,—all
united to form a scene, of a most magnificent de-
scription.
Roll on, ye dark-brown waters, in obedience to the
Almighty fiat! help to swell the proud waves of that
ocean which bears the messengers of peace, and the
glad tidings of salvation, to these dark and benighted
regions ; return again in rain to water the thirsty earth :
beautiful emblem of those showers of heavenly grace,
which will in due time water the moral desert of Africa,
and cause it to rejoice and blossom as the rose, the
droppings of which are already felt and seen. Yes; it
is no wild enthusiasm to hope, and believe, that the day
is coming when the waters of the Prah shall wander
through Christian realms, while many shall admire
its beauties, appreciate its worth, and adore the God of

nature, and the God of grace, who causes its streams to

Sunday, 21st.-Mr. Brooking is unwell. At eleven,
A. M., I conducted divine service, and preached to a
large congregation. Many of the Ashántis who are
travelling with us were present, and great attention was
paid to the word of life.
I intended to preach again in the cool of the
evening, but was hindered by the threatening ap-
pearance of the clouds, which gave indications of a
tornado.
22d.—At five, A. M., I collected the people together,
lashed two large canoes alongside of each other, and
took the carriage across the Prah. While engaged in
preparations for crossing the river, a messenger appeared
on the opposite bank, with a letter from the King of
Ashánti, of which the following is a copy :--
“ Kumási, Nov. 19th, 1841.
“Rev. Sir,
“I am now prepared to receive you and my nephews.
I expected to see you here on the 22d of this month ;
but am now informed that you are detained on the road
longer than I imagined : please, therefore, to let me
know when you think you can reach Kumási ; for I am
anxious that you should proceed as quick as you can.
“Yours faithfully,
“Quako Duah.”
After breakfast I answered the King's letter, sent the
soldiers back to Cape-Coast Castle with a letter for the
President, and then crossed the river and proceeded
with the whole party to Kikiwiri, where we remained
for the night.

houses, ves tempo them from
houses, many of the men were obliged to erect for
themselves temporary sheds, covered with Plantain-
leaves, to protect them from the rain which threatened
to fall: fortunately, however, for the whole party, the
night was dry and fine.
23d.—At half-past five, A. M., we pursued our jour-
ney, the weather still improving, with some indications
of the approaching harmattan season; generally known
by very cold nights, and a peculiarly dark and hazy
atmosphere. We travelled through a part of the country
thickly wooded, and gently undulating, and rested for
the night at Esiriman.
24th.--At half-past five, A. M., we resumed our
journey, and breakfasted in the forest. At ten, we
passed through Ansah, formerly the residence of one of
the great Asín Chiefs, now a small, diminutive croom.
Its former extent may be ascertained pretty correctly,
by some splendid Banyan-trees surrounding the present
croom in different directions ; which, doubtless, stood in
the centre of some of the largest streets, when Ansah
was in its prosperity.
I found a moss, of the most minute and beautiful
description, growing on the leaves of a species of Acros-
tichum. The weather is still improving, the air is dry
and pure, the roads are well cleansed, and travelling is
both pleasant and interesting. We halted for the night
at Akrofrum.
25th.–At half-past five, A. M., we went forward with
an intention, if possible, to cross the Adansi hills before
night. On our arrival at Akwansirem, where we took
breakfast, we were met by another messenger from the
King, accompanied by fifty men to assist us on our way.
After we had travelled about two hours from this
place, the dryness of the road, the peculiar state of the
atmosphere, and the gradual ascent we made, all proved

to us that we were attaining a considerable elevation.
About noon we reached the small croom where I slept
on my former visit to Ashánti, after my detection of
poor Korinchi's deceit, and consequent determination to
return to the Prah, if I could not immediately pass up
to Kumási.
I rested at this little place under the influence of
peculiar feelings. The old man, who is Chief of the
croom, recognised me with a smiling countenance, and
welcomed me with a present of a pot of palm-wine.
To heighten the interest of the scene, one of the
messengers whom Korinchi sent after me on that trying
occasion, was present, with several persons from Quisah.
I trust I felt thankful to the God of all mercies, for
favouring me with success in this work, amidst all my
trials and conflicts, and bringing me again to gaze on
these scenes which are rendered familiar by circum-
stances, connected with most interesting associations.
Here memory, that invaluable blessing, seems over-
officious; and, in spite of all my efforts to suppress
them, my troubled thoughts fly back to those scenes of
distress and anguish, through which I have been des-
tined to pass during the last six months. O mystery
of Providence! God of my life! thou art infinitely
merciful, even in thy darkest and most mysterious
dispensations !
“What mighty troubles hast Thou shown
Thy feeble, tempted followers here!
We have through fire and water gone,
But saw Thee on the floods appear,
But felt Thee present in the flame,
And shouted our Deliverer's name."
At half-past one, P. M., we arrived at the foot of the
great Adansi hill : we stopped an hour to rest, and take
refreshment, and then prepared to make the ascent.

Seventy men, part of them Ashántis, drew up the car-
riage to the summit, without halting. The sight was
beautiful and interesting; from two to three hundred
yards, the ascent approaches nearest to a perpendicular,
of any I have ever seen ; and, while we were making
this ascent, the scene was almost terrific. The ap-
pearance of the carriage, winding up among the lofty
forest-trees, surrounded by from one to two hundred
native Fantis and Ashántis actually shouting for joy, as
they beheld the carriage steadily ascending without
accident, while all nature around looked gay; the lofty
hills, rising in the distance on every hand; the fruitful
valleys, winding to the right and left; the immense
forest, stretching beyond, as far as the eye could reach;
and all, as it were, laughing beneath the bright sun
of a tropical sky; filled the reflecting mind with won-
der and delight. But this was not all. For where is
the Christian mind that is familiar with the past history
of these once-hostile tribes—who were so long engaged
in mortal conflict, producing all around a scene of almost
unbroken desolation, both natural and moral—that does
not behold in the conduct of the natives of both tribes,
in their harmony of meeting, and their unity of action,-
a great moral change, a great moral triumph ? Gazing
on a sight like this, the beholder is reminded of those
scenes, which the evangelical Isaiah's ardent and pro-
phetic mind contemplated. He hears “the mountains
and hills break forth into singing,” and sees the trees of
the fields “clap their hands.”

About a quarter before five, P.M., we reached Quisah,
when we rested for half an hour, and then proceeded to
Fomunah. On our arrival at Fomunah, I found the
same quarters provided for me, which I occupied during
my long detention, previous to my former visit to
Kumási.
Strange, indeed, were my feelings on entering the
simple dwelling, where I had before spent so many
weeks of tedious and distressing anxiety, and experi-
enced so large a measure of divine support and comfort!
Poor Korinchi, my old friend, and, I may almost say,
companion, with whom I formerly spent so many in-
teresting hours, is no longer Chief of Adansi. By some
very turbulent conduct in the King's presence, during
the investigations of a palaver between himself and one
of his Captains, he incurred the displeasure of his
Sovereign, has been dishonoured, and another Chief
placed on the stool of Adansi in his stead. I under-
stand he is now living at Brunian, a croom about twelve
miles from Kumási : I therefore hope to see him again.
26th.-In the afternoon, the new Chief received us
in due form, and according to the etiquette of the
country.
We have determined to rest here for a few days :
a repose which will be very grateful to my feelings, as
I have walked nearly all the way from the Coast, a

distance of nearly one hundred and fifteen miles, fre-
quently over rough and heavy roads, with the daily care
and anxiety of moving the carriage along unbeaten
paths, and over rivers, &c., where no such thing had
been before.
27th.—We were busily engaged in erecting a large,
temporary shed for divine worship, &c. Mr. Brooking
is still poorly. Lord of the harvest, give us, I entreat
thee, strength to labour for the eternal welfare of our
perishing fellow-men!
Many of my old friends have called to see me; others
meet me occasionally in my walks through the town and
neighbourhood, and, with smiling countenances, give me
a hearty welcome.
The people, in every place where we rest, appear de-
lighted to see the Princes, returning to their native home,
so much improved, and under circumstances so pleasing.
O that the great and important objects of their Christian.
education may be fully and entirely answered! May
the God of all grace keep and preserve them from the
dangers with which they are surrounded!
Sunday, 28th.–At half-past ten, A. M., divine service
was performed. I read prayers, and Mr. Brooking
preached. The congregation was large and attentive :
many Ashántis were also present.
In the afternoon I again conducted the worship of
God. The congregation was, as in the morning, atten-
tive.
29th.— I was rather poorly. The heat was very intense
during the middle of the day, with a strong harmattan.
My age has this day numbered thirty-two years; but
how small a portion of my life have I spent in the service
of God! and how very imperfect have been my best
services, unprofitable servant that I am! May the God

30th.— I wrote letters, and sent off messengers and
carriers to the coast.
Dec. 1st.—A person arrived from the King, informing
us, that His Majesty will receive us in Kumási on
Monday, the 13th instant.
2d. - Another messenger arrived, with a letter from
the King, of which the following is a copy :
“ Kumasi, Nov. 30th, 1841.
“Rev. Sir,
“Yours of the 22d of this month I received on the

“I am making arrangements for receiving you on
Monday, the 13th ; and give you this early information,
that you may have plenty of time to make your arrange-
ments also, for reaching Kumási at the time mentioned.
Tell Mr. Henry Smith to come with you if he likes : it
will afford me pleasure to see him. Salute my nephews
with a kiss for me, and oblige

we arrived about a quarter before four. The road
was well cleared, and prepared for the carriage: the

natives were much surprised at seeing in their town a
machine drawn upon four wheels. The weather was
very hot and dry.
Sunday, 5th.—At half-past eleven, A. M., Mr. Brook-
ing performed divine service under the shade of a
large Banyan-tree. The King's messengers and many
Ashántis attended. Mr. Brooking preached from He-
brews ii. At four, P. M., I conducted the worship of God
in the same place. The King's messengers, with several
of their people, and many of the inhabitants of the town
attended. I preached from Acts viii. 34, 35. During
the sermon, I asked them if they believed that I was
speaking the truth; to which the chief messenger an-
swered in the affirmative, saying they did not suppose
I should come all the way from England to tell them
lies; and that if they had thought so, they would not
have come to hear me. They paid deep attention to
the word of life. May the Lord seal the instruction on
their hearts !
6th.—Remaining for a short time at Dumpási, I went
into the forest, and saw a pretty variety of Justicia : the
colour was pink and white, and the leaf large and deeply
nerved, very much like Justicia Nervosa. I also saw a
handsome species of Hibiscus, which I had never seen
before ; the leaf was large, and the flower pink and
white.
The insects in the neighbourhood of Fomunah and
Dumpási are very fine; many of the butterflies are large,
double the size of the purple Emperor of England.
Their colours are also rich. The wings of some are
beautifully striated. One of my hammock-men caught
a fine species of hawk-moth : unfortunately, the rich
down was so much rubbed off from the wings, that I did
not see it in perfection. Its principal colour was green.
In the evening many of our carriers, and a party of

the Ashántis, collected together at one end of the town,
and danced for the space of an hour or more, to the
sound of their rude music, which was played by the
Ashántis. Though I could not, of course, admire the
dance, yet the idea of the harmony which is now begin-
ning to exist betwixt the two nations, produced in
my mind the most thrilling sensation. Yes, the most
bitter, the most determined, enemies are become friends ;
and thus is a gracious Providence, preparing the way
for the introduction of the Gospel of peace among
them.
The scenery about Dumpási, though not so bold as
that of Quisah and Fomunah, is very beautiful. The
town is skirted on one side by immense forest-trees,
chiefly Silk-cotton, towering to an enormous height;
(from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet;) and,
as the shades of evening approach, the appearance of the
dark green foliage of the underwood, the huge grey
trunks of the trees running perpendicularly to a height
of eighty or one hundred feet entirely without branches,
at which height the huge arms extend themselves
almost horizontally to a great distance, presenting one
of the most majestic objects on which the eye can rest ;
---and the empurpled heavens, appearing in the mighty
distance beyond these sylvan shades, while the gentle
zephyr is scarcely perceptible as it wafts over the way
the balmy fragrance of some of Flora's richest beauties,
-all combine to produce a scene bordering on enchant-
ment. The peaceful shades of the interior of Guinea
are peculiarly grateful to a reflecting mind. In walking
through these splendid scenes, I felt the force of the
following lines of an eminent poet:-
“ 'Tis the pure hour for poetry and thought,
When passions sink, and man surveys the heavens,

7th.-At half-past four, A. M., I sent to call the people
to prepare for resuming our journey. At five, nearly
every thing was ready.
When travelling every day successively, there is but
little trouble in managing the men; but if they are
allowed to rest for a day or two, there is a danger of
their unintentionally becoming almost unmanageable ;
or, at least, out of order. Of this I had a specimen this
morning in the conduct of my hammock-men, who,
though Pagans, are some of the most obedient and
docile men in the country. They had been, as I have
already observed, called up at half-past four ; but five
o'clock came, without any making their appearance, so
that I stood waiting for them to take up my chair, and
proceed with the rest of the party. I sent for them a
second time, but they came not. I then thought it best
to go after them myself; and, on entering their quarters,
I found them all comfortably seated, taking an early
breakfast. This was out of all order, as they were
allowed plenty of time to take their meals whenever we
rested during the day: they knew they were wrong,
and took the alarm the moment they saw me. As I
entered, they jumped up, and flew in every direction.
They had been sitting round a large earthen pot of
soup, out of which they were all feeding with their
fingers. In their hurry they broke the pot to pieces,
spilling the contents on the ground. The doors of the
native dwellings are generally small; and as several of
them tried to rush through at the same time, they
knocked down a part of the wall near it. One of them
ran into a small yard, where his progress was retarded
by a wall about six feet high, plastered with swish or
clay. Determined not to be foiled by the wall, though
a pretty strong one of its kind, he, with astonishing
activity, commenced pulling a part of it down, occasion-

ally looking over one of his shoulders, to see if I was
coming after him; and in a little time that seemed
almost incredible, he was at his post with his companions.
I need not say, that this fracas caused me no small
amusement; and as these frail buildings are so easily
repaired, the damages were not enough to cause much
regret. When I pointed out to the men the incon-
sistency of their conduct in being so late at their posts,
they acknowledged their error, and promised amend-
ment.
; At a quarter past five, A. M., we proceeded on our
journey. : The morning was very fine. We halted to
breakfast at Sakwanta, and then proceeded to Akwan-
kowási, where we arrived at ten; and as we had
plenty of time before us, the King having arranged for
receiving us in Kumási on Monday next, we took up
our quarters for the night.
The scenery around this place is chaste and pretty.
The croom is smaller than either Fomunah or Dumpási.
It is situated on a rising ground, and surrounded by a
belt of Plantains, beyond which rise, in majestic beauty,
some large Silk-cotton trees, intermingled with some
splendid specimens of Acacia and Mimosa, from thirty
to fifty feet high. There are also several large trees,
covered with papilionaceous climbers, with foliage of
the most beautiful description. Walking out in the cool
of the evening, I saw a species of Acacia, bearing a
number of fine seed-vessels. I immediately had the tree
cut down ; and as I was watching it falling, I observed an
immense moth, like some of the very large species
brought to England from South America, fly from the
top, and alight on a small shrub near the place where
I stood. I had a small fly-net in my hand, but the
handle was not long enough to reach it. I then tried
to approach it by walking a few paces on the stem

of a small tree near it, which grew in a slanting direc-
tion ; but, before I could get at it, it flew away. I
followed it through the forest for about one hundred
yards without success. It was by far the largest insect
of the kind which I have seen in Guinea, and was of a
greyish colour, with large white circular spots on the
wings.
These immense forests are full of objects of the
highest interest to every lover of the book of nature.
All around there is something on which to ponder and
admire. The damp recesses produce the most splendid
varieties of Ferns and Mosses, and other plants of the
Cryptogamia family, which afford shelter and support
for many kinds of moths and crustaceous insects, &c.;
while the splendid vegetable productions of the higher
grounds, with the beautiful insects flitting from tree to
tree, fill the mind with pleasure.
In the course of the day, I saw in the town a white
Negress. Her complexion was nearly as fair as that of a
European : her hair, between an amber and a straw colour.
She appeared to be about thirty years of age ; but not
so healthy as her jetty neighbours. It appeared to me
as though her fair colour was the effect of some extra-
ordinary family disease. It is not unusual to see the
natives, and especially the men, with their arms and
legs, hands and feet, covered with large white spots,
from one to two inches broad, the effects of a disease
called the krankras, and more frequently the effects of a
kind of ring-worm, produced by an indiscriminate use
of different species of fungi, indigenous to the soil of the
country, which they use as mushrooms.
Many of the complaints of the natives appear to result
from a careless selection of vegetable food; and there
are instances in which vegetable matter, coming in
contact with the skin, by some singular and extra-

ordinary process causes a large swelling; which, on
opening, contains a maggot about half an inch long.*
8th.—We stopped, as we intended, the whole day at
Akwankowási : the heat was very intense. I cut down
a species of Mimosa, to obtain some of its splendid seed-
vessels, from twelve to fifteen inches in length : the
foliage is exquisitely beautiful.
9th.–At half-past four, A. M., I sent round to call
up the carriers, &c. At five, we started for Eduabin,
and passed through a fine part of the country, more
thickly populated and more extensively cultivated,
than many parts of the interior through which I have
passed since we left Mansu. We saw, a short distance
from the path, a specimen of the Babab (Adansonia
Digitata).
The roads are well cleared and prepared for us. We
have to-day passed over several streams by means of
temporary bridges, which have been thrown across by
order of the King, to facilitate our journey with the
carriage. These are the first attempts at making
bridges which I have seen in the interior. They are
constructed in the following manner: some stout, forked
sticks or posts are driven in the centre of the stream,
at convenient distances, across which are placed some
strong beams, fastened to the posts with withes, from
the numerous climbing-plants on every hand. On these
bearers are placed long stout poles, which are covered
with earth from four to six inches thick; and this com-
pletes the bridge. Great and important results are
often produced by little things. And who knows to
what this may lead ? Our bringing the carriage, is the

cause of a better road being made through this part of
Ashánti, than has ever been seen before ; this is the
unanimous testimony of all the people : good roads
greatly promote civilization, and are an universal indi-
cation of national improvement.
At a quarter before three, P. M., we reached Eduabin,
and halted for the night.
To-day I have heard of a repetition of those bloody
scenes with which I became too familiar on my first
visit to Ashánti. We rested and took breakfast at
Amafuri, a pretty croom about a mile and a half from
Bekwah, a large town, and the residence of Bekwah
Osai, one of the most powerful of the Ashánti Chiefs.
As the road to Kumási does not pass through Bekwah,
we sent messengers to the Chief to present our respects,
&c.; who, on their return, informed us, that a human
sacrifice had been made in the town, and that the
victim of this cruel superstition was lying exposed in
the public street.
Merciful God, send down thy Spirit, enlighten these
Pagans, and save the purchase of thy Son's atoning
blood!
“ Assert thy worship and renown;
O all-redeeming God, come down !”
Eduabin is beautifully situated on a small hill, sur-
rounded by a splendid landscape. Its population is
probably from seven to eight hundred, including the
small crooms around. It is not now in that dilapidated
state in which I found it on my first visit to Kumási :
the houses are in better repair, and several new ones
have been erected.
10th. In the course of the forenoon, a misunder-
standing took place between our Fanti carriers and the
people of Eduabin, on account of the scanty supply

of native food, with which the former were furnished. ·
The Fanti complained, that himself and his companions
could obtain no food; told some of the natives of the
town that they ought to be ashamed of themselves, in
allowing them to want food ; and remarked, that when
the Ashántis came down to Cape Coast, they always
found a sufficient supply. One of the townspeople,
piqued at the remark, took it up warmly, and said,
“Well, if we do get plenty of food at Cape Coast, we
pay for it.” The Fanti, feeling at the time the cravings
of hunger, and incensed at the insinuation of dishonest
principle, into which he had construed the language of
the Ashánti, answered, “We want nothing without
paying for it; we are daily supplied with money to buy
food ; and do you think that our masters would allow
us to take your things without paying for them?”
These observations were followed by a scuffle between a
few of the men of each nation; and the Ashánti who
had been the principal talker in the affair, sustained
some rough treatment. On hearing of this, I sent for the
Fanti who had taken the leading part, and required him
to remain on the spot, until I could investigate the
matter. Shortly after, the King's messengers, and
several of the Ashántis, came and entreated me to
pardon the man. This I promised to do; but told
them, that I must inquire strictly into the affair, and
talk to the carriers, in order to prevent any thing of the
kind in future.
Every preparation being made for our departure for
Karsi, early in the afternoon we sat down to take
refreshment, when I embraced the opportunity of inves-
tigating the above affair. On inquiry, I found that the
Chief of Eduabin, to whom the greater number of the
plantain plantations, &c., belonged, being at Kumási, the
people were afraid to act in the absence of their master,

121
and hence the scarcity of food that was in the town.
This explanation, on the part of the Ashántis, was, of
course, satisfactory; and ignorance thereof, on the
part of the Fantis, was a sufficient excuse for their
expressions of dissatisfaction. Things being thus com-
fortably settled, I then, in the presence of all the
Ashántis, cautioned the Fantis against any unkind ex-
pressions or rash conduct; telling them, that we were
now under the protection of the King of Ashánti, that I
was responsible for their good conduct, and that if they
had any complaints to make, they must bring them to
me, and I would attend to them ; but if they neglected
to do this, and took the matter into their own hands,
the first transgressor must expect just censure. Some
of the men appeared affected, and all promised obe-
dience. Gimahin, the chief of the King's messengers,
said, “During our long and tedious journey of so many
weeks, we have all been comfortable and happy; and it
would be very foolish to fall out now, when we are
nearly at the end of our journey.".
We started from Eduabin at two, P. M., and reached
Karsi about five. On our way we passed through
Esargu, the little croom where I spent the last Sabbath
on my first visit to Kumási. As we went along, the
people recognised me with smiling countenances. The
scenery of the forest near Karsi is peculiarly beautiful ;
the road, within a mile or two of the croom, leads
through a splendid grove of Acaciæ and Mimose, many
of them sixty or seventy feet high. O the majesty and
splendour of these tropical forests ! Hail, beautiful
spots ! may you soon resound with the name of Jesus !
11th.—At five, A. M., I called up the men to go into
the forest and cut wood, &c., for a temporary cover;
and by half-past twelve, P. M., we had a large, comfortable
shed erected, thatched with grass and plantain-leaves.

In the course of the afternoon, messengers arrived
from the King, with a present of three sheep and some
palm-wine. Prince William Quantamissah's sister also
came over from Kumási to see her brother. She is a
fine young woman, about eighteen years of age. The
chief messenger, who came from Kumási with the
present, had in his hand a huge gold-handled sword,
and a golden decanter: I presume they are the same
which I saw on my first visit to the capital.
Sunday, 12th.–At half-past eleven, A. M., I con-
ducted divine service under the large shed erected
yesterday : the congregation was numerous and atten-
tive. I preached from 2 Cor. viii. 9.
Mr. Brooking is poorly this morning. About half-
past four, P. M., another party of messengers arrived
from the King, with a present of palm-wine. The
chief of the party rode on a strong Ashánti pony, with
an Arabic or Moorish saddle and bridle.

DECEMBER 13th.–We started from Karsi at five, A. M.,
and reached Kumási about seven. At the entrance of
the town we halted, and had the carriage cleaned, and
put in order for presentation. Afterwards we took
breakfast, and waited for a messenger from the King.
At half-past eight, my old friend Apoko arrived,
with a countenance beaming with satisfaction and de-
light, on seeing me again. He was accompanied by a
large train of attendants with gold-handled swords, and
canes richly ornamented with gold. There were also
several of the King's linguists in his train. They gave
us a hearty welcome, telling us that the King would be
ready to receive us soon. The carriage excited intense
interest among a large crowd of the natives, who col-
lected around while the men were preparing it.
Apoko left us for a time, and a servant from the King's
household came to take charge of our luggage, and to
see it safely lodged in our apartments.
About two, P. M., Apoko came to conduct us to the
King. We found him seated in the same place where
he sat to receive me on my first visit to Kumási. We
paid our respects to him in the same manner as I had
done previously, and then passed on, through an immense
concourse of people, to take our seats at a distance, and
there wait, to receive a return of the compliment from

the King and his numerous Chiefs. His Majesty then
sent us some palm-wine; and, after we had refreshed
ourselves with a draught, the multitude was in mo-
tion, and the King and the Chiefs came round accord-
ing to the usual custom. He stopped opposite us for
some little time, and surveyed the Princes, Quantamissah
and Ansah, from head to foot, (as they stood in their
English military dresses, one on my right hand and the
other on my left,) under the influence of considerable
emotion. He appeared affected : it was indeed a noble
scene. Yes; the King of Ashánti is capable of feeling
some of those sensations which delight the heart, on a
happy and auspicious meeting, after a long separation.
If this be felt by the King of Ashánti, surrounded as he
is by ignorance and gloom, O what must be the feeling
of those happy spirits, who meet to part no more in the
realms of glory! But whither am I wandering ? I am
still in the vale of tears !
I intended that the carriage should follow us in the
procession, as we went round to pay our respects; but
the crowd was so dense, that it was impossible; therefore
I sent it to the place where we expected to take our
seats. When the King came round, the carriage stood
opposite to us, at a distance of six or eight yards ; so
that he came between us and the vehicle, and turning
towards it, he surveyed it for some time with appa-
rent satisfaction; after which he passed on, followed
by many of his Captains. There was the same extra-
ordinary display of barbaric gold, blood-stained stools,
&c., as I witnessed on my former visit, with the excep-
tion of the horrible death-drum : this, I am glad to say,
was not in the procession.
The gaudy pageant exhibited a hundred and twenty-
five large Kabosirs' umbrellas, of various colours, some
of which were very handsome. This was a larger

number than I saw before. On my first visit I saw no
female in the procession, strictly speaking ; but on this
occasion there was an elderly sister of the King, appa-
rently occupying the position of Queen-mother,* who,
with several of the King's wives, came round and shook
us heartily by the hand.
Between the King's sister and his wives, there appeared
about twenty-four girls, from eight to twelve years of
age: their skins were marked with stripes of red ochre,
pipe-clay, and charcoal, and each carried a small stick,
covered with gold, about a foot long, one end of which
was placed in their mouths.
14th.–At two, P. M., we visited the King. He was
seated under his large umbrellas in front of his residence.
I then formally introduced the Princes to him, and also
Mr. Smith, (who had accompanied us from Cape Coast,)
and also Mr. Brooking; and then, in the name of the
Wesleyan Missionary Society, presented the carriage.
In doing this I told him, it was sent by the Society as
a token of their good feeling towards himself and his
people; and that they hoped he would use it, and that
it would lead him to improve his country, by making
good roads; which was one of the greatest means of
promoting civilization, and also an indication of national
advancement. He accepted the present, received the
message in a very gracious manner, and begged me to
present his thanks to the Society.
He further expressed his satisfaction at the return of
the Princes; and his thanks to Her Majesty the Queen
of England, and to Governor Maclean, for the kindness
and attention which had been shown to them.
We then took our seats at a short distance, and the
King and many of his Chiefs, &c., came and returned
* I find, on inquiry, that this person is the only sister the King has.

thanks according to the custom of the country. The
carriage was then taken into one of the palace-yards,
where the King met us to receive all the necessary
information respecting the carriage, harness, &c. On
my telling him, that Her Majesty the Queen of England,
had seen it, he seemed much pleased, and said, “The
Queen of England is Queen of Queens of the white
people, and I am King of Kings of the black people ;
and now we have carriages alike : this is very good."
After the necessary explanations were gone through,
and the present was delivered up to the King, I felt
thankful that so great a task, as that of conveying it for
nearly two hundred miles through the forests of Guinea,
where we had often been obliged to cut our way through
the jungle, and to have recourse to various means, in
order to transport it across the rivers and deep ravines,
had been accomplished, and that so great a triumph of
civilization over barbarism had been achieved. I felt it
an ample reward, also, for an hundred and fifty miles
journey on foot, and for the care and anxiety which I
had felt during that journey. When we took our seats
in the street where I introduced the Princes, &c., the
King sent us some refreshment; consisting of Madeira
wine, brandy, cherry-brandy, and liquors, with a supply
of delicious water, all neatly served up in decanters on
a tray, with tumblers and wine-glasses. The interview
was altogether deeply interesting.
15th.—At half-past two, P. M., we went again to the
royal residence, to deliver the presents which had been
sent from Her Majesty the Queen of England, and the
smaller presents from the Wesleyan Missionary Society.
We took our own carpenters to open the packages.
The first was a fine portrait of Her Majesty; with which
the King was much pleased, and said, he should place it
in his Stone-House, and often look at it, because it was

127
very handsome, and because Her Majesty was his friend.
The next box contained a view of Windsor Castle ; and
he was much pleased with the view of that noble residence.
After Her Majesty's presents followed several more
from our Society; namely, cutlery from friends in
Sheffield ; a pair of boots, highly finished, from Mac-
clesfield ; a tin box from Mr. Chubb (japanned); some
beautiful glass-ware, from Mr. Naylor, of London ; and
some handsome ladies' dresses, from friends at Keighley.
All the presents were very graciously received, and the
King seemed pleased with everything.
The King's sister (Queen-mother) was seated near
him, and seemed much interested about the dresses.
The King requested my interpreter to put on one of the
ladies' cloaks, sent from Keighley; and he highly
admired it. There were also some figured coloured
muslin caps, from the same friends; with which the
King was delighted, and said his Captains should wear
them.
The beautiful chandelier, from Mr. Edge, of West-
minster, brought out by Mr. Brooking, I am sorry to
say, we could not present on this occasion ; as the man
who had charge of the glasses, had, we presume, fallen
down with the box, during the journey from the coast,
for we found three of the shades broken. We informed
the King of it; and will try to make it complete, and
present it as early as we can. .
After these presents were delivered, the King re-
turned his thanks to Her Majesty, and also to the
Wesleyan Missionary Society; and placed before us
refreshments of nearly the same description as those of
yesterday.
16th.—I was busily engaged at my quarters : I had
no interview with the King to-day.

glad to rest quietly at home, after so many days'
excitement.
In the afternoon I heard that a Chief had died, and
that three human sacrifices had been made in the town :
the mangled victims were left in the public streets, as
usual. O God, have mercy upon this benighted people!
I saw a lad near my lodgings who is one of the King's
executioners. He had decapitated a poor victim that
morning. He appeared to be from sixteen to eighteen
years of age. I asked him how many persons he had
executed: he answered, “Eighty.” O awful fact !
eighty immortal spirits hurried into the eternal world,
by the hands of a boy under eighteen years of age, and
he only one of a large number engaged in the same
dreadful employment! Surely, British Christians will
not relax in their exertions, to send among the Ashántis
the mild and peaceful Gospel !
18th.-Quiet at home. The heat is intense.
Sunday, 19th.—At half-past nine, A. M., I conducted
divine service under a large shed, previously erected for
that purpose. I read prayers, and preached from Isai.
xlv. 22, 23. Many of the Ashántis were present, who
paid serious attention to the word of life. The discourse
was conversational; and many interesting and vital
questions were answered by the people. They said at
the close, that it was a “good palaver;" and that if all
men would obey God, and keep his commandments, we
should have a happy world. We then sung part of that
beautiful hymn, -
“Come, thou Conqueror of the nations,
Now on thy white horse appear.'
The singing seemed to fill them with delight. We
closed the interesting service with prayer.
At four, P. M., Mr. Brooking preached from Isai. iii.

morning. Many of the servants of the King's house-
hold were present, and one of the King's sons. This
sermon was also conversational. Lord, hasten that
happy day, when sanguinary Ashánti shall possess her
sacred temples, erected for the worship of the living God,
and her joyful myriads crowd the gates,
“Demanding life, impatient for the skies.”
The King has sent us a bountiful supply of palm-wine
every day in the week, except Tuesdays and Wednesdays,
which are his fetish-days.
· 20th.—About three, P. M., Apoko came to inform us,
that the King was sending us a present; and we took
our seats to receive it, according to the usual practice.
We had no sooner done so, than a long train of people made
their appearance. Apoko and the other linguists took
their seats opposite to us, surrounded by several mes-
sengers, with gold-handled swords. A number of
persons then passed before us, each bearing on his head
a block of fire-wood.* Then followed a beautiful cow
and calf, several sheep, (some of them very large,) pigs,
eggs, plantains, yams, and other vegetables, and fifteen
ounces, twelve ackies, of gold-dust (equal to £63 cur-
rency, or £56 sterling). Mr. Brooking's share and
mine amounted to £27 currency, which we gave for the
benefit of the Mission. The King also sent us some
palm-wine.
About half-past four, the King seated himself in
one of the most elevated parts of the town, to drink
palm-wine, and receive our thanks for the presents.
We then left our habitation ; and after passing through
several streets, we came into one, from eighty to ninety
*"If we bring you mutton, beef, &c., we also bring you blocks
of fire-wood to cook it." This is the idea conveyed in giving the
fuel.

yards wide, where the King was seated on a rising
ground, under his large umbrellas, surrounded by several
hundreds of the people. Boys were standing on each
side, cooling him with large fans; and a host of
messengers, with gold-handled swords, glittering under
the departing rays of the sun, formed a passage up to
the place where he sat. We walked up, and thanked
him, and then took our seats at a little distance. Shortly
afterwards his servants arrived, with palm-wine, and a
large calabash, partly overlaid with gold, for him to drink
out of, and a large silver bowl, to hold under the calabash,
to receive the palm-wine which might run down His
Majesty's beard. While he was drinking, the large
drums were played, and several arrows were shot from
the bow, to let the people know that he was still holding
the calabash to his mouth. He then sent us a supply of
the wine, after which he returned to his residence.
The scenery around Kumási, as viewed from the high
ground where the King was seated, is of the most
splendid description. The noble forest, with its great
trees of Silk-cotton, Acaciæ, Mimosæ, &c., stretching
over a beautiful undulating country, as far as the eye
could reach, filled us with admiration.
21st.-I prepared letters, &c., and sent messengers
to the coast.

were much pleased with the beauty of the scenery around.
On our return, we called at a house in an elevated,
healthy part of the town, into which the King wishes us
to remove early next week.
At seven, P.M., I retired to my apartments. At eight,
Apoko came to say, the King wished to speak with
us. We repaired to his residence, and found him seated,
surrounded by his linguists, and a few messengers. The

interview was quite private ; no Chiefs or Captains were
present, all restraint was thrown off, and he conversed
with us in a very open, free, and candid manner.
During this interview, I acquainted him with the
motives which had actuated the British Government in
taking the Princes to England, giving them a liberal
education, and showing them the kindness which they
experienced while in that country. I pointed out the
great source from which England derived her wealth,
power, and greatness; and placed Christianity, that soul
of all real happiness, in its proper position. I informed
him of the kind feelings which England cherished
towards him and his people, and of their anxiety to
evangelize and civilize the African race.
The subject of slavery was touched upon, and he
entered into it with great freedom. I told him of the
antipathy which England felt to it, and of her perseverance
in exertions to prevent traffic in slaves ; that she has
ransomed the whole of the slave-population in her West
Indian colonies, by paying to their owners twenty
millions of money; that no man could be a slave in
England; that a slave would become a free man the
moment he placed his feet on British ground; and that
England had lately sent an expedition up the Niger, (of
which river I found the Ashántis have some knowledge
as the Kowara,) for the purpose of introducing among
the numerous tribes on its banks, the comforts and
blessings of civilization, that they may no longer have any
pretext for selling slaves to obtain money and goods ;
as by the introduction of agriculture and arts, they would
obtain wealth from the abundant resources of their own
native soil. The magnificent sacrifices and exertions
which England has made, and is still making against
slavery and the slave-trade, and to benefit Africa, filled
his mind with astonishment; and he appeared amazed

at the idea of such noble disinterestedness. He said he
allowed none of his people to sell natives of Ashánti into
foreign slavery. “The small tribes in the interior,” he
said, “ fight with each other, take prisoners and sell them
for slaves ; and as I know nothing about them, I allow
my people to buy and sell them as they please : they are
of no use for any thing else but slaves ; they are stupid,
and little better than beasts." I answered, “If the
Dutch can take them to Elmina, and make valuable
soldiers of them, it is a proof that you could make use of
them in some way in Ashánti ; which would be more
beneficial to the country than selling them out of it."
He evidently felt the force of the remark; and, with a
smile on his countenance, dropped the subject.
I also embraced the opportunity of informing him,
that our special object, as Missionaries, was the in-
troduction of Christianity into his dominions; and, for
that purpose, we begged his protection, and the favour of
permission to build a Mission-House in Kumási : to
which he answered, “I will protect you, and supply you
with land, on which to build a house."
Part of the time was occupied in a lively and spirited
conversation on England, and on the arts and sciences,
in which Mr. H. Smith, and Mr. Brooking, William
Quantamissah, and myself, all joined.
The rapidity with which travelling is performed by
rail-roads and steam-packets, very much interested and
astonished him. On some palm-wine being brought, he
requested us to drink his health : we drank some out of
tumblers, and the King used his calabash, partly overlaid
with gold.
He asked me, if palm-wine could be obtained in
England. I told him it could not ; but the palm-tree
was grown in England in large glass houses, heated by
fire; and not only the palm-tree, but thousands of

plants and trees from Africa, and all other tropical parts
of the world. I farther observed, that the English
made the nature and character of animals and plants,
from all parts of the world, their study; and that is the
reason why travellers in Africa notice them, and try to
take them to England. I then referred to the suspicions
of the Bantama people, when they saw me examining a
tree on my former visit to Kumási ; and told him, I was
then looking after plants to take to England with me.
He seemed highly amused, aud asked if the plants I
took home lived throughout the journey. I told him,
that several of them were growing when I left England.
The King smiled when I referred to the fears of the
Bantama people, and appeared fully satisfied with the
explanation.
This pleasing interview lasted two hours; when we
closed the conversation, thanked the King for the favour,
and retired.
25th.I am spared to see another Christmas-day!
spared amidst many troubles, severe conflicts, and poignant
sufferings! O this frail bark,-
“Dash'd against the rocks and river,
In the midst of death it lives!”
O my Lord, my Friend, my Deliverer! thou hast indeed
chosen me in the furnace of affliction ; but whilst thou
art my God, I can neither be “hopeless nor unblest.”
While I keenly feel the trials thou callest me to pass
through, I cannot but rejoice in the success with which
thou hast favoured my exertions in the work thou hast
given me to do. While my dearest friends are taken
from me, I am blest with seeing my most sanguine
expectations more than realized, in the prosperity of our
enterprise in Ashánti. I need trials, severe trials, to
keep me humble. Lord, thou doest all things well!

At eleven, A. M., we held divine service. I read
prayers, and Mr. Brooking preached on the nativity of
Christ. There were but few Ashántis present, as no
previous notice had been given. The little congregation
was a very interesting one, and deep attention was paid.
At three, P. M., we dined under the large shed
which had been decorated for the occasion, with some
green boughs and flowers from the forest. The young
men whom we had brought as Teachers, with other
respectable young men from the coast, dined with
us. We sat down, twelve in number, to a dinner of
roast beef and plum-pudding, which reminded us
forcibly of good old England ; happy, sacred, and ever-
fondly-cherished England! Several of the Ashántis
collected around us. A Chief asked permission to sit
near and see us dine: he said, he liked English manners
and customs very much, and should try to follow them ;
asked if he were too old to learn to read, and seemed
very much pleased when we told him he was not. He
said, now that Missionaries were come to Kumási, he
would avail himself of the opportunity of learning a
thing so valuable. And who is this fine, handsome
young man, surrounded by his attendants, sitting so
humbly at a respectful distance from us, to take lessons
on civilization ? No less a personage than Apoko Akim,
a nephew of the present King, on the sister's side, with
only one person (Osai Kujoh) between himself and the
throne of Ashánti. This fact speaks volumes.
About one, P. M., Prince John Ansah’s aunt sent us
a present of yams, fruit, and a little gold-dust. At
two, the King sent us a present, consisting of two fat
sheep; one for the Princes, and the other for Mr. Brook-
ing and myself. Apoko stated, that His Majesty had
heard that this was Christmas-day, and that he sent the
sheep by way of congratulation. I presume the King

135
received this information from Apoko; for I had con-
versed with him early in the morning, and told him
the reason why we kept Christmas-day.
About half-past three o'clock, the King sent us some
palm-wine.
This, I presume, is the first Christmas-day on which
the Gospel has ever been preached in Ashánti. May
the day soon come, when thousands of enlightened and
evangelized Ashántis will hail the annual return of
this festival, with the satisfaction and delight with which
we regard it!
After dinner we sung some hymns, and then went
out for a walk. On our way home, I saw the corpse of
a young slave, about twelve years of age, slung to a
pole, and carried by two men. This led to the disclosure
of a fact, of which I had hitherto been ignorant; namely,
that all slaves, except a few favoured ones, are considered
not worth the trouble of a decent burial, and are conse-
quently taken, and thrown into the water which runs
round the town, where they are eaten by the thousands
of fishes which this small river contains. No persons
are allowed to touch these fishes. They are nearly the
colour of an English eel, from twelve to eighteen inches
long, about the thickness of a large English trout, and
the head much more flat than that of a dolphin. They
are so tame, that if a person stand near the water where
the descent is very gradual and flat, and throw a few
crumbs of bread into the water, and then drop some on
the dry land close to the water's edge, they will actually
come several inches out of the water to take them. I
had often heard of these fishes, but was incredulous
until the other day, when I saw at least fifty of them in
the water, not more than three or four inches below the
surface, tumbling one over the other to obtain the crumbs
thrown in, like so many boys scrambling for an orange ;

some of them, by a powerful motion of the head and
tail, managed to move several inches out of the water,
to obtain the crumbs, and then returned to their natural
element.
Sunday, 26th.—At the commencement of the Adai
custom, all strangers are expected to go and pay their
respects to the King, by way of congratulation on his
continued good health, &c. After passing through part
of the town, the King came back, and took his seat in
the street opposite his residence, where he received the
accustomed salutations, and then retired to his house..
At a quarter to four, P. M., we conducted divine
service. Mr. Brooking read prayers, and I preached
from 1 Tim. iii. 16. The congregation was very large
and attentive. One of the King's sons, and several
Chiefs and members of the King's household, were
present. The discourse was, as usual, in a conver-
sational form. It was a delightful afternoon. How
mysterious are the works of Providence! The Lord
calls us to pass through heavy and sore troubles ; but
with reference to our work, every obstacle seems to be
removed out of the way. The people appear under no
restraint: they come and hear for themselves, and pay
deep attention. Even those who may at some future
day fill the throne, come to hear of the salvation of God.
My most sanguine expectations never presented to my
mind scenes like this at Kumási in 1841. God be
praised for these tokens of his presence.
27th.—Early this morning the King went down to
Bantama, to visit the tombs of his ancestors. He re-
turned about half-past ten, A. M. About eleven, Apoko
went to speak to the King about our removal into a
larger and more airy house, which His Majesty had
provided for us in an open and healthy part of the town.
He soon returned to say, that the house was ready for

us, and that we could remove as early as we pleased :
consequently, after taking some refreshment, we com-
menced our removal without delay. We succeeded in
taking away a sufficient quantity of our things, to
admit of our sleeping in our new quarters.
We were glad to remove, as the part of the town in
which we have been residing is low, damp, and unhealthy,
and has been the cause of some sickness among our
party. John Ansah has been ill for several days, with a
seasoning fever; which, I am happy to say, by the
blessing of God, I have been enabled to check.
Mr. Smith, and Mr. Brooking, and several of the
servants, have been unwell; and I have suffered, for
many days and nights, from violent pains throughout
my whole frame, the effects of sleeping so many nights
in a damp room, the walls of which, being made of clay,
and having been recently built, were far from dry. These,
however, are but trifling difficulties, when compared
with the success with which the Lord is blessing our
exertions.

DeceMBER 28th.— About seven, A. M., the King sent
us an invitation to dine with him to-day; and requested
me to send my cook to assist in preparing the dinner.
About a quarter before three, we were ushered into a
large, open, oblong, square yard, about eighty feet by
forty-five; (the same place in which the King was
seated to receive the presents ;) where, under the shade
of several large umbrellas, a long table was placed before
us. Our dinner consisted of soup, fish, roast mutton,
roast fowls, boiled yams and plantains, kidney-beans, &c.,
which was very well served up in the European style.
At the end of our table were placed two others, with
very short legs, (about twelve or fourteen inches long,)
on which were plates and dishes for the King and the
principal members of the royal family; on one of
which were displayed several pieces of silver plate, of
Portuguese manufacture.
Before we sat down, we informed the King, that all
these good things were the gifts of God, and that we felt
it our duty to ask His blessing in the use of them; to
which he readily consented ; and my interpreter asked a
blessing aloud in the vernacular tongue of Ashánti.
We then took our seats. I was requested to take the
head of the table, the Princes, William Quantamissah

139
and John Ansah, supporting me on my right hand and on
my left. The other guests at our table were Mr. Smith,
the Rev. Mr. Brooking, Mr. Huydecoper, (the Dutch
Agent,) and my interpreter. At the head of the low
table, directly opposite to me, sat the King, in an
European dress. His coat was of brown velvet, covered
with silver lace, such as might have been fashionable in
England, in the latter end of the reign of George II.
His trousers were of white satin; his shirt was made of
white linen ; and his hat, (which he took off when he sat
down,) of black beaver, with three bands of silver lace
round it, the under side of the brim being covered with
silver lace. His sandals were highly ornamented with
gold and silver. He also wore a spotted silk-muslin
sash. A pair of golden knives, with mother-of-pearl
handles, in golden sheaths, were suspended from his
neck by a gold chain ; and another, of a. more massive
character, coiled six or eight times round his neck, and
hanging loosely down the breast, nearly to the waist, com-
pleted the dress of the Monarch of Ashánti. On his left
hand, a short distance from the table, sat Osai Kujoh,
the successor to the throne, in a fantastic, military dress,
of red velvet, with yellow stripes, and a square-cornered
cap, with tassels of the same description. Near to him
sat another Prince, clothed in one of the large loose
ladies' cloaks, sent out as presents from friends at
Keighley.
Behind these Princes, were seated several Captains,
belonging to the King's household ; and on the King's
right hand, at a short distance from the table, sat Apoko
with other linguists.
Behind us, at the farther end of the yard, a band,
consisting of several native musicians, with flutes,
clarionets, drums, and a French horn, was stationed.
The instruments were European, and the men had been

sent down to Elmina Castle, to receive instructions in
playing them.
The King inquired whether a band of music during
dinner was customary in England; and on our answering
in the affirmative, the men were directed to play.
On sending the soup round, I asked, whether the King
would take any, to which he answered, “ Yes ;” and
when it was placed before him, he tasted it, and then,
according to Ashánti custom, gave the remainder to
some of his attendants who were near him. Osai Kujoh
also tasted it. While we were taking our portion, a
bountiful supply of native soup was placed before the
King, which he sent round to his Captains and people.
· During dinner, a fine sheep, roasted, was placed before
the King in a large polished brass pan : he asked me,
whether sheep were ever roasted whole in England ? I
told him there were instances of it; and that deer, and
sometimes bullocks, were roasted entire. He appeared
pleased with the answer, and then, with the assistance of
some of his servants, proceeded to cut up the sheep, and
to send part of it round to the Chiefs and Captains. To
us he- sent a leg, begging that we would taste it: we
found it to be delicious meat.
After the dishes of meat were removed, the table was
laden with sweetmeats; namely, an excellent plum-
pudding, the materials for which had been supplied from
my small travelling store ; a pine-apple, papaws, pre-
served ginger, slices of sugar-cane, &c. We informed
the King, that plum-pudding was a favourite dish in
England, and begged him to take some, to which he
readily consented ; and on a slice being placed before
him, he tasted it, said it was very good, and then gave
the remainder to his attendants.
After the pudding, &c., were removed, we rose and
drank His Majesty's health ; in proposing which, I

141
embraced the opportunity of congratulating him, on the
pleasing and interesting circumstances under which we
were assembled, adverting to the auspicious return of the
Princes, and expressing our earnest hopes and prayers,
that the English and the Ashántis might become one in
spirit, and that the blessings of Christianity and civi-
lization, which England enjoys, might in due time, be
experienced in Ashánti. He seemed much pleased, and
nodded his assent and thanks.
We then proposed and drank the health of Her
Majesty Queen Victoria ; after which, Quantamissah
proposed the health of President Maclean, and spoke of
the kindness which he and his cousin had received, both
in England, and at Cape-Coast Castle.
The King then requested us to go and see the Stone-
House, built by Osai Tutu Quamina. We kept our
seats a few minutes, until the King had arrived there,
and had taken his seat to receive us. We were soon
summoned by a messenger, and proceeded to the house.
It is built with stone, has a flat roof, and is about the
size of many of the small villas in the vicinity of London.
We entered a court yard, ascended a flight of stone steps,
and passed through an ante-room into a small hall, in
which were tastefully arranged on tables thirty-one gold-
handled swords. In the same room were several of the
King's calabashes, overlaid with gold, out of which he
drinks palm-wine. Passing into another room, we found
the King seated in company with Osai Kujoh, and
attended by Apoko, and other linguists. On tables in
different parts of the room various articles manufactured
in glass were arranged, such as candle-shades, beautifully
cut glass tumblers, wine-glasses, &c., time-pieces, covered
with glass-shades, &c.; and almost every piece was deco-
rated with golden ornaments of various descriptions; large
pieces of rock gold, weighing several ounces each, and a

great number of gold chains. The weight of pure barbaric
gold which we saw, would probably be from eight
hundred to one thousand ounces.
Two small boxes, about sixteen inches deep, were
shown as specimens of native workmanship. They were
covered with green velvet, and ornamented with large
round-headed tacks, like an English trunk. The tacks
on one were of solid silver, and on the other of solid
gold. While I stood admiring them, the King came to
me, and corroborated the statement which was made
respecting them.
Whilst examining some of the articles in another part
of the room, the King again came up, and accosted me
in the following manner :-“In days that are past, I
could hardly believe that the English were so disinterested,
as to take so much trouble in teaching the natives of
Africa; and when you were here before, I could hardly
feel satisfied respecting it; but I have no fears now.
You paid me a visit some time ago; since that period
you have been to England, and have returned to Kumási
to see me again, bringing my two nephews with you.
I thank you for your kindness ; and I am fully satisfied, ,
that your object in coming here is to do good.”
I answered, “I am very glad your Majesty is satisfied
respecting the motives which lead us to come to Kumási ;
and I trust, that the more you know of us, the more will
you be convinced that the welfare of Ashánti is our
object.”
After we had gone through the principal rooms in the
house, we returned to the dining-table, and partook of
some fruit. The King again took his seat at the head of
it, and conversed with us very freely on various topics for
about half an hour, when we thanked him for his kind-
ness, and took our leave. After we left, he sent the
band and some of his people, to conduct us to our

quarters. The men played several English tunes during
the afternoon, with more correctness and ease than
a stranger would have expected.
When we reached our lodgings, I endeavoured to
collect my thoughts, and reflect on the extraordinary
scene which I had that day witnessed ; and the more I
thought on it, the more did my astonishment increase. I
had seen the proud sanguinary Monarch of Ashánti, whose
smile is life, and whose frown is death, among his people,
dressed in European clothes, surrounded by his warlike
Chieftains, sitting at table, and eating in public, with
several Englishmen, some of whom were Christian Mis-
sionaries,-persons of whom he had no knowledge
until the year 1839, and then whom superstition
would naturally have led him to fear and avoid ; and
whom they were disposed to pronounce, as the greatest
enemies of their country. The finishing stroke was
given to the splendid picture, by the presence of two
native Princes, enjoying all the advantages of a liberal
and religious education, and under the influence of
feelings favourable to the introduction of Christianity
into their country.
29th.—Busy writing, &c. Mr. Smith, Mr. Brooking,
and the Princes, visited the King. He was very
familiar. Mr. Brooking directed the carpenter in hanging
some of the King's pictures. Mr. Smith started for
Cape Coast.
31st.—The last day of an eventful year, during which
I have enjoyed greater happiness, and have had greater
trials, than at any former period of my chequered life. At
the commencement of the year, I was in possession of
one of the most amiable and best of wives. At the end
of the year, I mourn her early death, and am left a
widower in a foreign land. How powerfully does she,
being dead, yet speak, reminding me to be “ also

sufferings,—the loss of my wife, and that of some of my
brethren who had laboured with me in the same field,-I
rejoice that I can say, “ Bless the Lord, O my soul, and
all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the
Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits."
· January 1st, 1842.-I am spared to see the com-
mencement of a new year. O my God, thy mercies
are boundless! I bless thy name for the numerous
manifestations of thy love which I have experienced
during the year that is past; and humbly believe, that
the severe trials I have had, were sent in mercy both to
myself and my wife. Lord, help me to trust thee where
I cannot trace thee, and to confide in thy infinite and
eternal goodness! Graciously comfort and support, pre-
serve and direct me, so long as I may continue in this
vale of tears : make me a blessing to my Christian and
Pagan fellow-creatures! Pardon the sins of the past,
and grant me grace to live more fully devoted to thee,
than I have ever yet done. Grant that in my experience
this year, should my life be spared, I may realize more
abundant spiritual joys ; and that my spiritual progress
may be marked by more self-denial, more holy zeal in
my Master's work, and more of that “unconquerable
mind that was in Christ my Head.” Be with me, O
Lord, in my pursuits, studies, duties, and engagements.
Strengthen my mind in the walks of science and useful
learning; and, above all, illuminate it on the sublime
subject of Christian theology; let its great and glorious
doctrines be better understood, and more deeply felt and
enjoyed by me; and let this year be one of more
extended usefulness on my part, than any I have yet.

Blessed be God, I feel under the influence of solemn and
hallowed feelings.
At half-past six, A. M., I read prayers, and preached
from John xi. 40. Several Ashántis were present, and
very attentive. At twenty minutes past four, P. M., I
again preached, (Mr. Brooking was poorly,) from Isaiah
lv. 3: we had an interesting congregation. Deep at-
tention was paid to the word of truth. O that thousands
of the Ashántis may come to these living waters !
At a quarter past seven, we met to commemo-
rate our Saviour's dying love, and to renew our covenant
with God. Our party was small, consisting chiefly of
the Mission-family, including the Princes, and a few
pious friends from the coast, and other places. The
Lord was indeed with us, and we felt it to be a hallowed
season. I was powerfully reminded of our delightful
and happy Covenant-Service, last year, on board the
od happy Covenant-Service last
brig“ Osborn." Several of those who were then with
me, are now in the regions of glory. All hail, ye
happy spirits! Drink from the vivifying stream, "pluck
the ambrosial fruit,”
“ Walk with God,
High in salvation, and the climes of bliss ! ”
By faith we hear your triumphant shouts, which, for our
encouragement, seem to be wafted down on the wings
of mercy. We are only divided by a "narrow stream;"
and, taking into consideration our longest possible period
in this life, we shall soon, very soon, join your illustrious
society, and share your happiness and glory. Lord,
keep us to that day!
- 3d.-Early this afternoon we received intelligence,
that the King wished to see us in the course of the
afternoon; and about four o'clock, messengers came to
our quarters, stating, that the King was waiting for

Thelf, took oud twenty hi tof wh
us at his residence. On our arrival, we were ushered
into the spacious area where we dined last Tuesday,
and found the King seated in an elevated room, having
an open front at the end of the yard, under a large
and splendid silk umbrella, surrounded by his family,
many of the Princesses, children of the two former
Kings, his sister, and several of his wives. One side of
the yard was occupied by numerous females, part of
whom were wives of the King, and the others, at-
tendants and children. On the opposite side, in another
elevated room with an open front, a number of native
musicians were placed ; and down in the yard, in front
of the band, sat the King's chief eunuch, and several
little boys who attended upon him.
The Princes, Mr. Brooking, my interpreter, and
myself, took our seats at the lower end of the yard; on
our right, stood twenty little boys, each bearing a gold-
handled sword, several of whom were covered with
golden ornaments. One wore a cap decorated with
eagles' feathers, and a pair of golden rams' horns.
Many of the royal family, were dressed in rich silk
cloths, their ankles, wrists, breasts, shoulders, and necks
being decorated with golden ornaments. The King
was dressed in a very handsome cloth of native manu-
facture, and a leopard's-skin cap, richly ornamented
with gold; he had also similiar ornaments upon his
arms and legs. His sandals were heavily laden with
gold and silver.
No adult males of the royal family were present,
save Quantamissah and Ansah. Not even Osai Kujoh
was permitted to witness the scene about to take place.
The only men besides ourselves who were suffered to
attend, were the eunuchs, their attendants, and the men
composing the band. Apoko and the principal Chiefs,
linguists, &c., were all excluded, on account of the

King's wives; no male Ashánti being permitted to see
them. If any of them are walking in the streets, every
man is obliged to avoid them, either by turning into
another street, or by retiring into a house out of the
way, or by retracing his steps; and if he have not time
to avoid them in this manner, he must turn his face to
the wall, and wait until they have passed by.
Shortly after we had taken our seats, the King rose
from his chair, descended into the yard, and came and
spoke to us in a very cordial and affectionate manner.
He said, no Ashanti Chief or Captain was ever allowed
to be present on occasions like these. He never allowed
them the honour of meeting him with his wives; but
that he had made arrangements to meet us under
such circumstances, as the best means he had of tes-
tifying his satisfaction, in the safe and happy return of
the Princes, and in the kindness which had been shown
both to them and to himself.
The band then played, when several of the King's
wives, and some young women, from fifteen to twenty
years of age, members of the royal family, laden with
golden ornaments, engaged in a sort of dance, by moving
round the yard one after the other, in rapid but graceful
succession. There was nothing in their appearance
offensive to the eye, or disgusting to the mind. They
were handsomely dressed, and behaved with the greatest
decorum. While they were dancing, the King kept his
seat. When they ceased, he descended into the yard,
and began to dance himself. When he passed us, he
said, it was not usual for the Kings of Ashánti to dance
before their wives in the presence of any one; but he
did so before me, in honour of the Queen of England.
He then danced away, and took his seat; then several
of the females, among whom was the Queen-mother,
followed, singing at the same time war-songs in honour

Once more the King came down, and joined in the
dance with the females, they continuing to sing his
strong names," &c., some of which were, “The King
of Ashánti is the only King in Africa who has fought
with the great guns;" (alluding to the cannon in the
forts on the coast;)—“The King of Ashánti fought
with, and killed, the King of Buntuku.” The latter,
the King himself came up to explain as follows: “Osai
Tutu Quamina, at the commencement of the Buntuku
war, danced with his wives on the eve of his departure
for the battle; and, while dancing, he declared that he
would conquer and kill the King of Buntuku, and give
his body for food to the beasts, and the eagles should
eat out his eyes. He went, he fought, he conquered ;
* In singing the praises of their Kings and principal Chiefs, the
Ashántis extol the qualities and martial deeds, which have acquired
for them the characteristic appellations by which they are severally
known; and this is termed, “proclaiming their strong names."
Dupuis, in describing a public procession which he witnessed in
Kumási, states, that all the Chiefs of the first class were “ followed
by a group of parasites, whose business it was to proclaim, in
boisterous songs, the strong names of their masters.” One of the
songs commenced, “Where shall we find such a warrior as the
strong and beautiful A paku Kujoh, whose eyes are like the panther
in fight?.... Who fought the Gamans, and killed their Kabosir
Adouai ? Apaku Kujoh!” &c., &c. The “strong names” of the
Ashánti Monarch were, on this occasion, “ proclaimed” by the
tributary King of Banna, who, silencing his own band and syco-
-phants, by an authoritative wave of the hand, snatched a scimitar
from a youth in attendance, and, with violent gestures, and flour-
ishing of the weapon, sung, “Ashántis, who is there so great, so
good as Sai? Nowhere can you see such a King. He says,
• Destroy this country,' and it is a desert: the people are killed
with his shot and powder. When he makes war, he is like the
tiger. Can any one fight the tiger ? ” &c., &c.-Edit.

slew the King, as he said he would; and gave his body
to the beasts, and the eagles ate out his eyes.”*
The King then took from one of the little boys, who
was standing near us, his gold-handled sword, and having
fastened it to his waist, danced a little ; he then took
from another boy a musket, highly ornamented with
gold and silver, and danced again. Afterwards he came
up to me, shook me by the hand, turned, and danced
away among his wives, &c. Taking the sword and
musket into his hand, was to show us, that when they
went to war, he himself fought personally.
The women then sang,
“ The Englishman lives in Sebu Seki.
To-day he has come to visit the King.
The King has danced before him
In the presence of his wives,
And done what he has never done to
An European before. He has walked
Up, and shaken hands with him.”
Several of the King's wives, with other female
branches of the family, were very fine young women.
During the time we were there, the King sent us
palm-wine, and appeared highly pleased. About seven,
P. M., we retired to our residence.
* In this scene, the reader will recognise the perpetuation of an
ancient custom. The women of Israel also celebrated the triumph
over the Philistines with singing and dancing, and "answered, as
they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
his ten thousands.” (1 Sam. xviii. 6, 7.) Dancing is likewise
practised by the Africans on sacred as well as other occasions.
As David, on the removal of the ark, “ danced before the Lord
with all his might,” (2 Sam. vi. 14,) so, among the Ashántis,
dancing is connected with the most solemn ceremonies of their
religion.-EDIT.

As the night approached, the King, his wives,
&c., in their rich silk dresses, formed a group in the
centre of the yard: the scene was certainly one of the
most extraordinary I ever witnessed. The display of
gold was immense.
4th.—In the morning I sent for Apoko, to inform
him that I wanted to see the King, respecting land for
building. Shortly afterwards a messenger came from
the palace, stating, that a female member of the family
was sick at Jabin, and that the King wished to know, if
I could send her medicine. I answered, that I could not
prescribe remedies unless I saw her, and ascertained the
nature of the malady under which she was suffering ;
that to give a person medicine without seeing the pa-
tient, was like walking a dangerous road in the dark.
The messenger said, she was unable to come to Kumási :
I therefore offered to go over and see her.
The messenger repaired to the King, and soon returned
to say, that he would be thankful if I would go and see
her. About a quarter before four, P. M., Apoko sent to
say, that the King would see me respecting the land,
and that we were to go to him directly. We found him
seated in one of the rooms in the Stone-House. He
received us very kindly, and told us, that we should
have land near the spot where we are residing.
We had a long conversation on Christianity, and
civilization: I pointed out the advantages resulting
therefrom, and answered several important questions
on these subjects. One objection which had been
raised in his mind respecting education was, the
danger of it making the people rebellious; in which,
I found, he was encouraged by Apoko, and other
Chiefs. I told him, that in education, as well as in all
other good things, there was a possibility of abuse; and
that there would, doubtless, be a few unfavourable

exceptions; but that, in general, it had a tendency to
make the people more dutiful, and more obedient. He
saw the propriety of my remarks, and said he would
consult the Chiefs on the subject of sending their
children to school. Thus far, all our negotiations are
promising. Othou God of Missions ! give thine own
work success in this benighted land !
“Let the Heathen fall before thee,
Let the isles thy power declare! ”
5th.—About half-past eight, the King sent to inquire
if I would accompany Mr. Brooking and the Princes to
his residence, and teach him the use of the magic-
lantern. On our arrival, he was seated in the court-yard
of the Stone-House, with very few attendants. We
fixed the lantern in a kind of pent-house on one side of
the yard, and the King took his seat on the opposite
side. All our preparations, however, were useless for
the present; as we could only obtain palm-oil for the
lamp, which would not answer. When obliged to desist
for want of the oil, the King came into the pent-house,
and sat down on a couch. He directed my attention to
that article of furniture, and said, it was made in Kumási.
At this I was surprised. The frame-work was a kind of
ebony, and very neatly made. The covering was of
striped silk.
6th.—I started the Governor's messenger with letters,
Yesterday, preparations were made for a “custom,"
on account of the death of one of the King's daughters,
recently deceased : early this morning, muskets were
fired, and three human victims were sacrificed!
7th.-I took a rough sketch of a species of Ficus,
growing in a street near our quarters. This is one of
the most splendid specimens of that plant I have ever seen.
It is about sixty feet high; the branches covering a

considerable space of ground, and its leaves are small,
Its greatest peculiarity is, that of throwing out roots
from the trunk of the tree and the large branches, at a
height of from twenty to thirty feet from the ground;
something like the true Banyan, or Ficus Religiosa of
India.
About four, P. M., the King came to our residence to
pay us a visit. He went into all our rooms, and ex-
amined every thing they contained with much interest.
He was accompanied by Osai Kujoh, Apoko, his chief
eunuch, and numerous messengers.

JANUARY 8th.-At a quarter past ten, A. M., I started
for Jabin, * accompanied by my interpreter, two mes-
sengers from the King, my hammock-men, carriers, and
servants.† We went from Kumási in a north-easterly
direction, and passed through a country by no means
striking in its appearance, for several miles. The soil
is poor, when compared with that in the vicinity of
Kumási, and does not produce such splendid forest-
trees. We passed through several small crooms, and
stopped to take refreshment at Mampon, a small but
neat croom nearly due north from Kumási, about eight
miles.
At one, P. M., we resumed our journey, and travelled
at the rate of about four miles an hour, until a quarter
to seven, when we reached Jabin. As night had already
closed in, I had no opportunity of seeing the town this

evening: having walked the greater part of the journey,
and when it became dark, striking my feet severely
against the roots of the trees which crossed the path,
I felt tired, and little disposed to perambulate.
Shortly after my arrival, I went to see Seiwa, the
Queen of Jabin. We passed through several court-
yards, and found her sitting in a small room, surrounded
by her attendants. She received me very kindly, and
bade me welcome to Jabin.
On my return to my quarters, I found that the men
who carried my bed, &c., with the canteen, containing
food, had not arrived; the men whom I had sent into
the forest with torches to look after them, could not find
them; so that I began to suspect, I should neither have
food to eat, nor a bed to lie on. While making up
my mind to this, Seiwa sent me a large dish of savoury
soup made with venison, fresh-water fish, and yams.
Thus, when I little expected it, I found my wants sup-
plied, and a table mercifully furnished in the wilderness,
of which I partook under the influence of grateful
feelings. Our little family then collected together, and
a very strange and extraordinary thing took place in
Jabin: an altar was, for the first time, erected to the
Lord God of hosts, and the whole of that beautiful
hymn, “ Jesus, the name high over all,” &c., ascended
to heaven from grateful hearts.
There is a beauty in the fourth verse,
“O that the world might taste and see
The riches of his grace !
The arms of love that compass me,
Would all mankind embrace;"-
which, when it is sung by the Christian in barbarous
regions, surrounded by all the horrors of superstition
and Paganism, fills the mind with an overwhelming

influence. O the blessedness of feeling that happy
consciousness of being compassed by the arms of al-
mighty, redeeming, sanctifying, preserving Love! How
it cheers the Missionary, while a solitary and bereaved
wanderer, thousands of miles from his native land!
Though he may be no stoic, and may possess the
feelings of other men, which often require a mighty
effort to keep the mind in a proper state of equilibrium;
though his thoughts often fly back to his native land,
with all her precious advantages, her hallowed privileges,
her beautiful temples, her guarded hearths, and happy
families; while the breast heaves, and the silent tear
steals down the cheek; yet it is not at such times as
these. No; he rather feels that to be engaged in
spreading the savour of a Saviour's name in barbarous
regions, is indeed worth living for: however much his
hardships and privations may be the means of shortening
his earthly career, yet
“That life is long, which answers life's great end."
I lay down to rest on my travelling-table; the man,
however, arriving with my bed before I had fallen
asleep.
Sunday, 9th.—I was fatigued from the long journey
of yesterday, and was obliged to remove into better
apartments.
Expecting to see Seiwa concerning the malady under
which she is suffering, we had no opportunity of holding
divine service this morning.
In the afternoon she sent for me. She is suffering
under a severe nervous affection, which has deprived
her of the use of her left arm, the large muscle being
constantly in violent action, accompanied with intense
pain. Numerous remedies had been applied, during

her residence in Akim, together with other medicines,
which, I fear, have made it far worse than it otherwise
would have been. I found her exceedingly ignorant
respecting the complaint. She imagines that she has
been poisoned, and that the violent action of the large
muscle, is that of a worm. I endeavoured, with but
little effect, to convince her to the contrary. I hope,
however, to be more successful in a day or two; and
that I shall prevail upon her to consent to take those
medicines, which may at least afford her relief, if they
do not effect a cure.
In the evening we held a prayer-meeting, and I gave
an exhortation. Some of the natives were present, and
very attentive. O God, grant that this “ bread, cast
upon the waters" with a trembling hand, may “be seen
after many days!”
10th.—I had an opportunity of seeing the town. It
has been in ruins for several years, on account of the
absence of its rightful owners. Some of these have
returned, and are busy in rebuilding the place.
Shortly after the battle of Dudua, and the consequent
peace between the Ashántis and the Coast, Boitin, the
Chief or King of Jabin, incurred the displeasure of Osai
Akoto, the then reigning King of Ashánti ; and a very
serious quarrel took place between Akoto and the Jabin
Chieftain, who was a member of his own family. In
consequence of this quarrel, Osai Akoto sent an army to
advance upon Jabin, to bring the refractory Chief to
obedience. Boitin collected his people together, and
prepared for a desperate struggle. His brother, Kofi
Boitin, took command of the little army, and occupied
a position at the entrance of the town. A Captain was
left at Boitin's residence, in charge of the principal
members of the family, with express orders to put them
all to death, rather than allow them, in the event of a

defeat, to fall into the hands of the enemy; while Boitin
stationed himself in the rear of his people, to encourage
them to persevere in the combat. Though Boitin's
army must have been far inferior to the King's in
numerical strength, yet a conviction of their extreme
danger, the probability of the destruction of their
families, and their native town, in case of failure,
inspired them with unwonted courage; and though they
could not gain the victory, they withstood the charges of
the enemy for several hours, during which time, prepar-
ations were made in the town for a retreat. Much of
Boitin's property had been already destroyed, to prevent
the possibility of its falling into the hands of the victor;
a quantity of gold-dust had been mixed with copper,
and thus rendered comparatively useless; and when the
troops were unable any longer to maintain their position,
Boitin effected a retreat with his army and remaining
property, together with the principal part of the popu-
lation of the town.
With the bravery of his troops, and the result of the
battle, Boitin could not but feel highly satisfied. During
the battle, however, an event took place which must have
been to him a source of great grief. The Captain left
in charge of his family, finding the battle waxing hotter
every moment, and concluding, that the troops could not
stand their ground, rashly put the family to death, and
then destroyed himself and the habitation with gun-
powder. Boitin's mother, however, who is aunt to the
present King of Ashánti, by some means escaped
destruction, and fled, with her two sons, a daughter, the
army, and part of the population of the town, into
Akim; where they took refuge under the protection
of the British authorities, at Cape-Coast Castle.
When the present King ascended the throne of
Ashánti, he used every means in his power to induce

Boitin to return to his native country; but failed of
success.
In 1839, Boitin died in Akim, and his brother
succeeded him.
In 1840, Boitin's brother also died in Akim, leaving
every thing in the hands of their aged mother, Seiwa,
the present King's aunt. Having lost her sons, and
finding herself solitary, Seiwa, by the permission of the
local Government of Cape-Coast, has returned to Jabin,
with many of the people. About a thousand of the
people are still in Akim, having refused to accompany
their aged Chief to Jabin.
Jabin, when in a state of prosperity, from the time
Mr. Bowdich speaks of seeing the young Chief at
Kumási, at the great Adai custom, down to the retreat
of Boitin, must have been a very interesting place.
Then the town was destroyed by the Ashántis; and,
from the extent of the ruins, I should think, it must
have been half as large as Kumási. The population,
including that of the surrounding crooms, may have
been from ten to fifteen thousand.
Though there are many houses remaining, and some
of the streets are re-formed, the town is full of mounds
of earth, the sites of former houses and establishments,
where many of Boitin's Captains resided, with their
numerous followers. I am at this moment sitting
under the shade of a beautiful tree, with the ruins of
Boitin's premises before me, at a distance of about
eighty or ninety yards. They must have been almost
as large as those of the present King of Ashánti, in
Kumási. I am informed, that Boitin was, in the time
of his prosperity, very rich, ' and vied with Osai
Akoto, in his display of barbaric gold on every public
occasion.
This morning I walked over part of the ruins of
undeerous tollout Boitin's "Ct houses an is full ofnod

Boitin's habitation. In a shed, which with three others
surrounds a court-yard, I saw some of his large drums :
two of them were what the natives would call “deco-
rated,” with several human skulls on each, and another
had appended to it from fifteen to twenty-five human
jaw-bones.
Fifty yards from Boitin's premises stands the most
magnificent specimen of Ficus that I ever saw. Its
height is about sixty feet, the girth of the trunk thirty-
nine feet, the roots branching off from the trunk at
about two feet from the ground in every direction, with
part of them rising a foot above the earth, at a dis-
tance of eight feet and a half from the trunk: the space
covered by the branches is one thousand five hundred
and twenty square yards. It is now crowded with
leaf-buds, just beginning to open. A young Silk-
cotton tree has grown out from among its roots, and
shows its head out of the centre of the branches.
Beneath this tree is a small mound, which was kept
in proper form, and polished with red ochre, on
which Boitin sat under his large umbrellas, to keep the
Adai custom. In front of it, doubtless, the head of
many a human victim has tumbled to the ground, before
the knife of the executioner.
The soil of Jabin is rather light and sandy; not so
rich as that nearer to Kumási. The general character
of the vegetation is also different. The Silk-cotton and
other forest-trees are, generally speaking, not so fine as
they are near to Kumási, and Mansu in Fanti. There
is a greater tendency to produce grass; and I am
informed, that the forests become less dense, and high
grass becomes more the prevailing vegetation, every
succeeding day's journey from Jabin into the interior.
11th.—The heat was very oppressive. Seiwa was
more tractable and very kind, sending me soup, &c.,

ready cooked, every day. I was busy finishing a sketch
of part of the town.
Yesterday I despatched a messenger to Mr. Brooking
at Kumási, acquainting him with the nature of Seiwa's
malady, and of my intention of stopping at Jabin until
Thursday. This afternoon I obtained from him the
following letter:-
“I RECEIVED yours about three o'clock yesterday, and,
according to your request, I went and informed the
King of your hopes of, at least, alleviating the pains from
which his aunt has been suffering. We went down last
evening about seven o'clock, and remained with him until
nine. We should have stayed longer, but I had an
attack of fever, and was obliged to ask leave to retire.
“He still retains all the good humour which has
characterized his conduct ever since we arrived, and is
willing that you should stay until Thursday.
“There have been two Chiefs executed since you
left,-one on Saturday evening, and another on Sunday
evening,—for various crimes of which they have been
found guilty. I unexpectedly saw the one who was
decapitated on Sunday evening. He was killed at the
head of the street in which we live, just before the
conclusion of the service. Immediately after, I went
out a few minutes to enjoy the evening air ; and when
I arrived at the head of the street, I saw the poor
creature just bound to a pole with both his hands struck
off. The executioner then cut away a part of the chin
with the beard, after which he was removed.
“Judge of the feelings which it produced on me! We
are all, by the blessing of God, in good health. The
Princes desire their love to you.
“ Believe me, &c.,
“ROBERT BROOKING.

“P.S. We are going this evening to exhibit the
phantasmagoria. The King has heard that our oil has
arrived, and is anxious to see the exhibition."
12th.—This morning Seiwa sent to beg that, instead
of leaving for Kumási to-morrow, I would remain at least
until Monday next. As I am now very anxious to
return to the coast, I consented to stop until Saturday
morning, with which she is satisfied.
In the afternoon Seiwa sent me a present, consisting
of nine ackies of gold-dust, a sheep, yams, plantains,
bananas, palm-nuts, tiger-nuts, ground-nuts, rice,
papaws, and a little gold for my interpreter and
servant. I went and returned thanks.
Last night the ants invaded my dwelling, and came
even upon my pillow. While I was sleeping, one or
more of them found the way into my ears, and the
noise they made there, together with their running over
my face, (for they did not bite me,) aroused me from
my slumbers. I brushed them from my pillow, took
some cotton-wool, which I dipped in spirits of hartshorn,
and put it into my ears, and was soon again locked
in the arms of sleep. Early in the morning, on awaking,
I found about me more ants than before; and was
obliged to comb and brush them out of my hair.
Some may ask, “How could you sleep under such
circumstances ?" I reply :-It is astonishing, how soon
a person can, if he try, become inured to numerous
inconveniences. I have often slept on the ground, in
places no better than an open shed, with little pro-
tection from snakes, scorpions, centipedes, &c., without
any fear, or even annoyance. Confidence in the divine
protection will ever compose the mind, amidst all the
dangers and privations, to which travellers may be
exposed in these barbarous regions.

anxious to detain me, I have consented to remain until

14th. - Preparing letters for England the greater
part of the day, and in the evening made arrangements
for returning to Kumási to-morrow. Seiwa's daughter
came and sat by me for half an hour, while I was
sitting at my writing-desk. She is an interesting
person, about twenty-eight years of age. She said, she
did not often come out into the town, because its
dilapidated condition painfully reminded her of the loss
of her relations, and the prosperity of bygone days.
I sympathized with her, and directed her attention to
the comfort which Christianity affords, in seasons of
severe trial, by displaying the future, and intimating a
higher and more exalted state of being. She seemed
to feel the truth of my remarks. Merciful God, save
these poor Pagans !
“ Awake them by the Gospel call;
Light of the world, illumine all !”
Late in the evening I saw Seiwa. She said, she
was very sorry I was leaving the town so soon, and
asked, whether I could not, by sending an excuse or an
apology to England, take up my permanent abode in
Ashánti. I told her, I should have pleasure in re-
maining longer; but that my duties imperatively
demanded a speedy return to the coast; but when
I came to Kumási again, I should endeavour to pay
her a visit.
15th.— I took an early breakfast, and called on Seiwa
to take leave. Though far advanced in years, (for she
must be, at least, from sixty to sixty-five years of age,)
she walked with me, accompanied by her daughter and
several of her people, to the entrance of the town, and

there bade me farewell. At a quarter past eight, A. M.,
we commenced our journey, and travelled until twenty
minutes past one. We then halted to dine at
Mampon, a small croom, about eight miles from Kumási.
Here we remained until the arrival of the King's mes-
sengers, who were sent to accompany me; they having
dined on the path earlier in the day, and promised to
overtake us at Mampon. At twenty minutes past three
we resumed our journey, and reached Kumási at
five. Though I had walked all the way, a distance of
about thirty miles, I did not feel very weary. The
country through which I travelled is not so interesting
in appearance as some places between Kumási and the
coast : there is still, however, much to arrest the atten-
tion of a lover of the book of nature.
The Silk-cotton trees on every hand are laden with
blossoms, beginning to fall. Pine-apple plants are
growing by thousands on each side of the path, pre-
senting their scarlet fruits, about one-third of their full
size. The species is very much like the black Jamaica
Pine ; leaves rather long, slender, and slightly tinged
with purple near the centre.
In the low lands, on the banks of some of the small
rivers, a fine large white variety of Pancratium is
luxuriating, producing an immense profusion of flowers.
Though the soil is inferior, yet the grass on the side of
the path is in some places from sixteen to eighteen feet
high, and now in full bloom. The spikelets are from
nine to twelve inches long.
Sunday, 16th.–At half-past six, A. M., Mr. Brooking
read prayers, and preached from John iii. 14. Several
of the Ashántis were present; among whom was
Dagawa, one of the messengers who accompanied me to
Jabin. In the course of the day several of the natives
came to ask for medicine. Nothing seems to have so

great an influence in gaining their affections, as an
affectionate attention to their bodily ailments.
At four, P. M., I conducted divine service, and preached
from 1 Tim. ii. 1-5. The Lord has been with us to-
day in our devotions. Blessed be his holy name!
17th.—The Ashántis are evidently under an impres-
sion, that because the English have such a horror of
human sacrifices, they do not make public examples
of the greatest violators of the laws: hence the King
on one, occasion remarked, "If I were to abolish
human sacrifices, I should deprive myself of one of the
most effectual means of keeping the people in sub-
jection;" and, under the influence of this feeling, he
has confounded the sacrificing of hundreds and thou-
sands of innocent victims, with the punishment of those
who may have forfeited their lives on account of flagrant
transgressions of their country's law. Hearing of the
case of two criminals, I thought this an excellent oppor-
tunity of making our ideas on this subject known, that
we might have a still greater influence over the public
mind, in our opposition to human sacrifices. Conse-
quently, I walked into the town, accompanied by the
Princes, Mr. Brooking, and my interpreter. We found
the criminals seated on blocks of wood, in a street near
the King's residence, each accompanied by an execu-
tioner. One of the executioners was the lad who told
me, on the 17th of December, that he had himself
decapitated eighty persons. Two knives were forced

stop to gaze on the horrid spectacle ; but proceeded to
Apoko's residence, to pay him a visit. While we were
conversing with him, the two criminals were mentioned;
and, without making any allusion to human sacrifices, I
remarked, that those who were guilty of treason in
England, were generally made public examples of, and
that it was a sad thing to see men so rebellious. Apoko
appeared much pleased with the remark, and accom-
panied us, on our departure, a short distance from his
house. Our principal object in calling on Apoko, was,
to avoid giving the people an idea, that we had walked
out on purpose to see the execution : especially as I had
a good excuse for calling upon him, having not seen him
since my return from Jabin.
On our way from Apoko's house, we again passed
the place of execution. Before we arrived, the drum
played, and one criminal was decapitated. The
head was off in an instant; and, before we were
aware of what was then to take place, a man came
running past us with the head of the criminal in his
hand, followed by the executioner, with his large blood-
stained knife ; and just as we went by the place, the
other criminal was beheaded.
In taking such a step this morning, we, of course, did
violence to our feelings; but our peculiar position
seemed to demand it.
18th.— Early this morning Apoko came, to request
that I would accompany him to visit a friend, who was
very ill. I went with him, and found the sick man,
who is one of the greatest Chiefs in Kumási, labouring
under a severe attack of bilious fever; which had been
increasing in strength for the last three days, and now
assumed a very threatening aspect. I returned home,
and prepared a strong dose of medicine, which I gave
him. I watched him during the day, and found him

more quiet, but the fever very obstinate. At length, he
obtained considerable relief; and the strength of the
fever appeared to be breaking
When this favourable change became apparent, his
friends, wives, and attendants endeavoured, by every
means in their power, to testify their gratitude. I shall
never forget the countenances of his slaves when I first
saw him; they watched my features with most intense
interest, to ascertain, if possible, whether I thought he
would recover; and when I told them there were hopes
respecting him, their joy was very great. They ap-
peared to love their master; and, I believe, sincerely
wished him to live, from motives quite disinterested :
but at the same time they knew, that, if he died, they
would all be sacrificed, to accompany their master into
another world; and hence, doubtless, for their own sake,
they wished that he might be raised to health and
strength.
In the course of the afternoon the King sent, ex-
pressing a wish to see me. We walked down to his
residence, and found him in the Stone-House, sur-
rounded by a few of his attendants. He welcomed me
back to Kumási, and asked several questions respecting
his aunt, the Chief of Jabin. He expressed his thanks
for my kindness in paying her the visit ; and then
conversed with us on various subjects. Before we left,
he ordered a small portable medicine-chest, of English
manufacture, to be brought to me, requesting that I
would examine its contents. It is of neat workmanship,
and, in England, when new, and full of good medicine,
might have cost from eight to ten pounds. I could not,
consistently with proper delicacy and prudence, inquire
how he came in possession of it; but, from all I could
learn, I think there is not a doubt, that it was part of
the spoils of the war in which Sir Charles Macarthy

fell; for I think no European would run the risk of
presenting, to any King of Ashánti, a chest containing
laudanum, calomel, and other powerful and dangerous
medicines : but this was a question which I, of course,
hesitated to ask. During this interview, he promised to
send men with our carpenters and sawyers, to receive
instruction.
19th.-I visited the sick Chief, and found him easier ;
but the fever was returning, and he complained of
violent head-ache. I told him he must be cupped; to
which he objected, saying, “This is an unlucky day.”
I, however, insisted upon it; telling him, that it might
be to him a much more unlucky day, if the fever were
allowed to return in its full strength. He then quietly
submitted, and soon obtained relief. By the use of
calomel, refrigerant and tonic draughts, by the blessing
of God, I succeeded in subduing the fever in the course
of two days and one night.
Several of the King's messengers were continually
coming to see the Chief, and to watch the result of my
exertions. One of them remarked, while I was standing
over him, and attending to him, that I loved the
Ashántis.
20th.—The sick Chief is still better. I am busy
writing, having received letters from England.
At six, A. M., the King came to our abode, and
gave us land on which to build our Mission-house.
It being the time of the little Adai custom, he went to
Bantama, to visit the tombs of his ancestors.
21st.—The Chief is recovering fast, telling his friends,
that I have succeeded in saving his life.

JANUARY 22d. An eventful day, replete with mani-
festations of the kind regard of a gracious Providence.
About nine, A. M., Apoko came to have some conversa-
tion with me on the subject of schools; and mentioned,
that several of the Chiefs had said, their King could neither
read nor write, nor could they, and therefore they thought,
it would not be proper for their children to be educated.
I saw at once the ground of their objection,a fear,
that if their boys were educated, they would be dis-
obedient and troublesome, and perhaps despise them on
account of their ignorance. At this I wondered not,
knowing such an objection to be quite natural, and that
there were many even in enlightened England, who had
fears on this point; or, at least, there were those who were
not strangers to these apprehensions twenty-five years
ago. Finding, however, that Apoko seemed to speak
rather lightly of schools in the abstract, I thought it neces-
sary to reply to him somewhat strongly on the subject, as far
as I could, without my remarks being possibly construed
into unkindness. · Fully aware, that if I allowed these
objections to pass unnoticed, they would say, “If schools
are important, he would vindicate them, and press their
claims ;" and then if I spoke too strongly, they would
say, “ This man is so earnest, and speaks so much, that

he has probably some political object in view;" I en-
deavoured therefore to take the middle course, stating,
that I felt too much interested in their welfare, not to
speak at such a time, and was determined that they
should not have occasion, on some future day, to accuse
me of unfaithfulness, when the welfare of the nation
depended so much upon the line of conduct which they
might now pursue. These remarks, with many others,
had a powerful but favourable effect on Apoko's mind;
and I could perceive that an impression was made
which would not be speedily removed. The Princes
and Mr. Brooking took part in the conversation.*
During the conversation with Apoko, news was
brought to us, that the town was on fire. We imme-
diately went out, and found that a quantity of high
grass, which covers several acres of land on the outside
of the town, behind our quarters, was on fire. Much of
the grass being very dry, it being the harmattan season,
and its average height from twelve to fifteen feet, the
flames were making rapid progress, and threatened our
dwelling with destruction. The King came out, sum-

* Notwithstanding the excitement produced by the fire, which
immediately followed this interview, Apoko went and told the King
all that I had said, and the earnestness with which I had spoken.
The King remarked, “Did he indeed say so? Well, he has come
to Kumási, bringing no trade palaver. He is not come to make
arrangements for sending slaves down to the coast. It is evident
that he is come here to do us good; and, therefore, that which he
recommends so strongly, and with such earnestness, must be
of importance to us."
Having so far gained the point, I thought it best to say nothing
further respecting it at present; resting assured that, with such a
footing already secured, and with so large a share of the King's
confidence, every thing connected with Christianity would, in due
time, by the blessing of God, follow in train, “first the blade, then
the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.”

moned the Captains and people to try to check the
progress of the fire ; and sent to us, that we might
be on our guard. We mustered all the strength we
could, and began to cut down the grass near our abode,
that the flames might not invade us; and the Lord
mercifully interposed, by causing the wind to blow in
such a direction, as to arrest the conflagration in its ap-
proach. Though the fire came within two yards of our
dwelling, which is covered with a light thatch of
Bamboo-leaves, and would ignite like tinder, yet we
sustained no damage.
While we were anxiously watching the progress of
the fire among the grass, information was brought
that a house, in an opposite part of the town, about
a quarter of a mile from us, was in flames. This
placed us in more danger than from the fire among the
grass, as the wind was blowing from that direction.
Several of us ran to the spot, and found a number of
houses on fire, which was rapidly advancing towards us,
and now the destruction of our quarters seemed almost
certain.
I had, soon after the commencement of the flames
among the grass, taken the precaution to remove my
books and other valuables into my travelling-boxes,
ready for taking away, and the Princes and Mr. Brooking
now followed my example, and we immediately com-
menced removing all our things into the street. While
thus engaged, one of our men came running to say, that
the fire must be at our dwelling in a very few minutes :
and it certainly would, had not a gracious Providence
again interposed; for just as the flames came near to
the line of houses connected with our lodgings, the wind
changed, and blew in a direction sufficiently oblique to
screen us from harm. Had not this alteration taken
place, our dwelling must have been destroyed, and, in

all probability, much of our little property. We felt
thankful to God, and adored his holy name. The fire
continued to rage for several hours, until more than
half the town was in ruins. When all danger respecting
our dwelling and property was past, we went to the
King's residence, near to which the fire was still raging.
We found the King in the street anxiously watching its
progress, and trying to check its approach to his
premises. Thatch had been torn off from many of the
houses near; but it was thrown into a deep ravine near
the King's house, at the end of a street, toward which
the fire was approaching. We immediately saw the
danger; and while the King was busily engaged at a
distance, we removed the greater part of the thatch out
of the way of the flames. I was down in the ravine
assisting in throwing it out of the way, when Osai Kujoh,
the heir-apparent to the throne, passed by, and expressed
his thanks.
Shortly after, we saw the fire raging in another place
nearer to the royal residence: a quantity of thatch had
been torn off and thrown on the ground, and the fire
had already caught one end of it, which we succeeded
in quenching, and thereby saved the King's house from
almost certain destruction. It seemed that the people
apprehended no danger from this quarter, after the
thatch had been torn off; and therefore had left it
without any one to watch it. At length the progress of
the flames was arrested; but the destruction has been
immense. The space of ground over which the fire
passed, is about half a mile in length, and seven hundred
and fifty yards in breadth, containing the most populous
part of the town.
Mr. Ruydecoper, the Dutch Resident, has saved his
property; but his residence is destroyed. All the
houses near the market-place are destroyed. I hear also

that many of the Fanti traders have only succeeded in
saving a very small portion of their property.
The beautiful Banyan-trees, in those streets where the
fire raged, are shorn of all their verdant splendour.
The King's fetish-tree, in the market-place, has been
much injured; and a large Silk-cotton tree, near it, about
one hundred and fifty feet high, has its leaves burnt to
the very summit.
My patient, the Chief, who had so severe an attack of
fever, has lost his house and much of his property, and
was obliged to escape for his life on the shoulders of one
of his attendants. One of the messengers, who came
down to Cape Coast to conduct us to Kumási, lost his
house, wives, children, and all his property; and, I am
sorry to say, these are not the only victims.
As I passed the market-place in the evening, I saw a
poor woman running about and beating herself, while
her cries resounded through the place. I asked her the
cause of her grief. She stated, that she had a child in
the bush sick with the small-pox, and had gone to nurse
it, leaving her sister at home with an aged mother. On
her return this evening, she found the house and property
destroyed, and her aged mother burned to death. I
listened to this mournful tale with an aching heart.
The corpse, covered with a cloth, was placed on a little
mound of earth, and the two sisters were weeping over
it, having nothing to comfort them.
O Christianity, “thou soul of happiness," had they
in possession thy sacred comforts, their griefs would be
comparatively light! Could they, through thy medium,
behold the happy spirit of a sainted friend in glory, though
the tears might still flow, yet they would fall without
. bitterness. Owhen will the happy day arrive, when
this sovereign remedy for the miseries of the world will
be known in these barbarous regions ?

An aged Moor perished also in the flames. One of
his hands was the only part of him that could be found.
The Moors acted very foolishly during the fire, and
exposed themselves to much ridicule. The poor man
who perished had been requested to make his escape
before his house took fire; but he obstinately refused,
saying, God would preserve his house. They mani-
fested no activity in attempting to check the progress of
the flames even when near the royal residence. While
we were busy, labouring with our hands, three of them
stood praying; one held up his fingers, and kept moving
his hand steadily backward and forward; another counted
a string of black beads. Several fetish-women stood
before the King's house using their incantations; and
the people as they passed, being busily engaged in
checking the progress of the enemy, told them to get
out of the way with their nonsense. When it was
nearly dark, the King walked round to a street near
our residence, and sat down, attended only by a few
of his domestics. William Quantamissah, John Ansah,
and I, were walking near him; and when we found that
he recognised us, we went and spoke to him, in terms
of condolence. He expressed his thankfulness for our
exertions, and was evidently in an humbled frame of
mind. I pointed out to him the importance of securing
property by building more substantial houses. He an-
swered, “By God's help, I will try and do so, by and
by.” The ruins continued to burn during the night,
falling into the streets at different intervals with a heavy
crash.
Sunday, 23d.—On account of the confusion from the
effects of the fire of yesterday, we could not secure our
regular service this morning. I felt indisposed from
want of rest, and the extreme excitement of yesterday,
which kept me up until early this morning. At four,

P. M., however, I conducted divine service, and preached
from Isai. xl. 5. The Lord was with us.
24th.—The town wears a melancholy aspect. Thou-
sands of persons are burnt out of house and home. I
learn that a considerable quantity of gold-dust and ivory
have been lost by the fire, and also that ten persons have
perished.
The King sent a messenger, to thank us for our
exertions on Saturday.
Early in the morning, the King was out in the town
surveying the ruins.
In the afternoon, Osai Kujoh came to our lodgings,
sat and talked with us about the fire, and then requested
me to show him my insects. He also thanked us for
our exertions during the fire on Saturday; and on
expressing our regret at the catastrophe, he said, it was
cause of thankfulness to God, that we have any houses
left. Such an expression as this may sound strange to
an English ear from the lips of such a person ; but it is
no more strange than true. The King referred also to
the Divine Being when I conversed with him on
Saturday evening.
, 25th.--I forgot to mention, that on Sunday morning,
a nephew of the King met me as I was walking near the
royal residence, and said, “We are very sorry you are
going to leave us so soon. When you came to Kumási
before, we were afraid of you; but we have no fears now,
and are glad to see you here."
I met the same individual again on the very spot
where the fire so fiercely raged and threatened our
dwelling, when, providentially, the wind changed. He
said, “God preserved you Christians from the fire." I
answered, “Yes; and we feel thankful.” .
I am now busy packing up my things, and preparing
to start for the coast on Monday next.

26th.—About half-past ten, A. M., the King came
to our abode, to thank us personally for the exertions we
made during the fire on Saturday. I said I was glad
that we were able to afford any assistance, and wished
we could have done more; and also, that we were much
grieved that so sore a calamity had happened.
He said, “It pleased God that it should happen."
To which I answered, “Yes, it is intended, as well as
all other trials, to benefit by teaching us wisdom.
God instructs sometimes by prosperity, and at others
by adversity.” He very patiently suffered this word
of exhortation, and then left us, apparently well
pleased. Before he came in, he went into the yard
where the carpenter works, and was much gratified in
seeing the workmen, at his request, sharpen some tools
on our grinding-stone; a thing which he had never
witnessed before.
27th.-I was unwell during the greater part of the
day. Mr. Pell, the new Dutch Resident for Kumasi,
arrived here about noon.
Mr. Watson is again ill. O mystery of Providence !
Bad news from the Niger expedition! Many of its
brave men have fallen victims to the climate. How
extraordinary! How mysterious! O God, shield, com-
fort, and support thy people! Let not the successive
heavy news overwhelm them with too much grief.
28th.—I was busy transferring many articles of
property, connected with the Mission to Kumási, into
the hands of Mr. Brooking, preparatory to my departure
for the coast.
29th.--I settled certain necessary affairs with Mr.
Brooking; I also sent to the King, to remind him of
my wish to leave Kumási on Monday next; and at
eight, P. M., I went down to take leave, preparatory to
my departure early on the morning of that day. He was

surrounded by Apoko and other linguists and attendants,
and appeared rather low-spirited. He expressed his
thankfulness for the presents which Her Majesty the
Queen of England, and the Wesleyan Missionary Society,
had sent him; and said he was sorry that the distressing
condition of the town, from the effects of the late fire,
had hindered him from giving me the opportunity of
seeing him in the carriage; but as soon as the streets
were cleared, he would use it, and Mr. Brooking should
have an opportunity of seeing him do so, and then he
would write and tell me about it. I took my leave of
him, and returned to our quarters.
Sunday, 30th.—At half-past six, A. M., I read prayers,
and preached from Isai. xl. 25—31. The congregation
was large and attentive. There were three Chiefs
present, who paid deep attention to the word of grace.
Shortly after the commencement of the service, the chief
Moor entered the yard: we offered him a seat, and he
remained during the whole of the service, and seemed
much pleased, with what he both saw and heard. While
I was speaking of the almighty power and goodness of
God, his hard and care-worn features underwent an
extraordinary change; his countenance beamed with
delight and satisfaction, and he seemed carried away by
the splendid idea and exhilarating facts contained in the
text. Since my departure from the coast, I had seen
many things which have filled me with astonishment;
and which convinced me, that the Lord was blessing us
in our work, and gradually preparing our way before us;
but this seemed more than all others to astound me, to
behold such conduct in so aged and venerable a follower
of the false Prophet.*
The Rev. Mr. Brooking, in writing to Mr. Freeman, several
weeks after his return to the coast, remarks, “The Moors are

aminutes. He e very smaltimery kindi
Early in the afternoon I walked out, to call on Apoko
and others, to take leave of them. The last person on
whom I called, was Osai Kujoh, the successor to the
throne. He received me very kindly, and conversed
with me, in a very gratifying manner, for several
minutes. He expressed his satisfaction at the good
understanding which now exists between Ashánti and
England, and his wishes that it might always continue.
He spoke of peace as a blessing, and of war as being
very injurious and destructive; to which I answered,
“Yes; war is injurious even to conquerors.” To this
he gave his full assent, and said, “We have, in days
that are past, had but little friendly intercourse with the
English ; and consequently we have been deprived of
many advantages. Our taste for European things in
general is at present but small; yet I hope, as things
become more settled, and we are better acquainted,
affairs will undergo a steady change, which will be very
beneficial to us.” During our interview, he referred to
my early departure from Kumási, and said, “You have
now been with us some time; and we begin to know
you, and are very sorry that you are going to leave us.”
I answered, “I am sorry, also, and should feel much
pleasure in remaining longer, if I could; but my duties
on the coast demand my immediate return. I must
leave to-morrow; but I hope to have the pleasure of
seeing you again. I have now visited you twice, which,
I believe, no European has done before. I therefore
consider myself in one sense an Ashánti, and must, if
possible, come up at the usual season, with the Kabosirs,
exceedingly friendly with me; one of whom brings me a bottle of
new milk every morning.” Considering the usual hostility of
Mahommedanism to the Christian faith, these are singular and
interesting facts.-EDIT.

to pay my compliments to the King.” This amused
him very much; and he said, “Of course, you must
come up as you have said, and we shall be happy to see
you; and we believe you will come, according to your
promise, because you have kept your word, ever since
we have known you.” I then took my leave of him,
highly gratified that a man so near the throne was so
well disposed towards us.
At four, P. M., I again preached, from 1 John iv. 8,
to a very interesting congregation. The venerable
Moor was present again, paying deep attention.
31st.—1 rose at five, A. M., and began to prepare for
my journey. Apoko came over to see me, and to
deliver a message from the King, referring to some
secular business on the coast. After breakfast the King
again sent Apoko, to request that I would stop until he
had taken his bath, and then he would send messengers
to say, “Farewell.” About half-past nine, Apoko and
several persons arrived, bringing one golden tobacco-
pipe, and another, made with silver, in an unfinished
state. Apoko said, the golden pipe was for Her Majesty
the Queen of England, and the silver pipe for the
Wesleyan Missionary Committee, as tokens of thank-
fulness on the part of the King, for the handsome
presents he had received.
Apoko also informed me, that the King would make
me a present of a silver tobacco-pipe; and that the
pipes should be sent to the coast, as soon as the former
was finished. *
I then commenced my journey, accompanied as far as
Karsi by the Princes and Mr. Brooking. I left Kumási
* In the course of Monday morning, the King sent me £9
gold-dust, and a slave, about twenty-five years of age, whom I, of
course, set at liberty, as soon as I reached Karsi.

at half-past eleven, A. M., and reached Eduabin about
half-past three, P. M.
The heat was intense; and as I was not fully supplied
with men to carry my luggage, I was obliged to walk all
the way, and let my hammock-men assist with the
boxes, &c., so that I was very much fatigued on my
arrival at Eduabin.
February 1st.—We started from Eduabin at six,
A. M., and reached Fomunah at five-and-twenty minutes
before six, P. M. We were welcomed by the Chief, and
treated kindly. We rested at Fomunah for the night.
As I was leaving Eduabin in the morning, I met a
messenger with letters from the coast, acquainting me
with the arrival of Mr. Allen. How encouraging, after
all our recent heavy losses, to find that our friends
stagger not at our difficulties! to find that there are
Christian Missionaries who dare to come, and friends who
hesitate not to send them, to assist in filling up the
breaches which death has made among us!
2d.–At half-past eight, A. M., I took my leave of the
Chief of Fomunah, and resumed my journey. We
halted a short time at Quisah, and again on the summit
of the Adansi hills. We started from thence at half-past
two, P. M., and reached Akrofrum at six. I was much
troubled with a severe attack of tooth-ache accompanied
with a swollen face: a trifling circumstance to talk about,
but not a pleasant companion in the wilderness.
3d.-At four, A. M., we resumed our journey in the
dark, and, travelling rapidly, reached the Prah about
five, P. M. At six, a heavy tornado came on, and lasted
some time. The rain was very heavy, and the thunder
and lightning awfully grand: a mercy that it did not
overtake me, with my swelled face, &c., in the forest.
I felt thankful for a little hovel which sheltered me
from the fury of the contending elements.

4th.—After making arrangements for raising a little
school and resting-house at the Prah, at nine, A. M., we
again resumed our journey. It was delightful travelling,
the heavy rain having cooled the earth, and given a
charming freshness to the forest. Late in the afternoon,
feeling myself weary with walking, I was riding in my
chair, when we passed a great tree, at the foot of which
lay, coiled up, a large black snake, within three or four
yards of us. I felt anxious to kill it, and preserve it;
but the men were alarmed, and looked on it with horror,
and seemed ready to take to their heels. Having my
fowling-piece ready loaded, I killed it. Its length was
about six feet six inches, the largest I had seen since
I left Cape Coast. We stopped for the night at Apunsi
Kwanta.
5th.—At half-past five, A. M., we started for Mansu.
During the day, we passed some of the places where we
had the greatest difficulties in conveying the carriage.
I thought that, had I not seen the carriage taken
through and over those places, I should hardly have
believed it possible. We reached Mansu about half-
past four, P. M.
Sunday, 6th.At half-past ten, A. M., I conducted
divine service. Several of the natives were present.
At a quarter past four, P. M., I again preached to an

APPENDICES TO THE SECOND
JOURNAL
APPENDIX, A.
From the Journal it will be seen, that, before
Mr. Freeman left Kumási on his return to the coast,
regular public worship had been commenced, and that
the services were attended by many of the Ashántis,
including several persons of high rank; that the King
had given land for the erection of a suitable Mission-
house; that he had allotted a large native-house for the
residence of the Missionaries, until the new building
should be completed; and that the King had not given
the Princes, his nephews, a separate establishment, but
left them to reside with the Missionaries, on whom, of
course, they are altogether dependent for Christian
and civilized society. Having formed a religious com-
munity, consisting of converted Fantis connected with
the Mission, and a few strangers, Mr. Freeman thus left
the nucleus of a Christian church in Kumási; and,
shortly after his return to the coast, he had the satis-
faction to learn, that the King had consented to the
establishment of a school, and that one had been actually
commenced. The following extracts show the state
and prospects of the Mission down to the latest date:-

taries of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, dated Mission-
House, Cape Coast, February 25th, 1842.

pleased to crown our efforts in Ashánti with success. Our

important negotiations with the King have been brought
to so comfortable a close, that he has taken Mr. Brooking
under his protection as a resident Christian Missionary
in Kumási; given us land in a very healthy and airy
part of the town on which to build a Mission-house;
allows the people to attend divine service without
restraint, and treats us with uniform kindness and
attention. This great advantage having been gained,
we humbly hope that all other arrangements will, under
the blessing of God, follow in due order, and that an
appearance of permanency will soon be given to the
Ashánti Mission.
Many of the Chiefs and Captains occasionally attend
divine service; and we may reasonably calculate on
their hailing with pleasure the establishment of schools,
&c., as they become better acquainted with us, and are
able to form more correct ideas of the claims of scrip-
tural Christianity. The King seems very anxious to
introduce improvements into the country, as far as the
prejudices of the people will admit of his doing so.
His carpenters are sent to the Mission-house to work at
the same bench with ours; and I expect that, by this time,
he has sent men to our saw-pits, to learn to cut boards, &c.
During my residence at Kumási, he often visited us at
the Mission quarters, and gave many proofs that we
have, by the blessing of God, secured his confidence.
A short time before I left Kumási, a dreadful fire broke
out, and destroyed, at least, half the town. Had such
a catastrophe taken place during my former visit, they
would probably have attributed it to the anger of
their Fetish, on account of my being in the town ;
or to some baneful power which they imagined me
to possess, and to have employed to their injury;
but such a change has now taken place, that in the
midst of the awful dangers with which they were

surrounded, during the raging of the flames, when they
saw us actively engaged at the most dangerous points, in
endeavouring to check the progress of the devouring
element, they recognised us as their friends; and the
King himself called at our residence, a day or two
afterwards, and personally expressed his thanks for our
exertions.
From the same, dated April 17th, 1842.
All things are going on admirably well in Kumási.
Mr. Brooking writes full of spirits, and big with hopes
. of abundant success. He is now engaged in building
the new Mission-house: and I am as busy here, en-
deavouring to meet his wants ; and they are not
trifling ones, in a place so far distant from the coast.
Prejudice, on the part of the Ashántis, seems to pass
away as the morning cloud and the early dew; so that
we are all astonished at the pleasing prospect of things
in Ashánti. The King is now about to form a new
street, in honour of the Mission ; which will be a great
convenience to the brethren there, as it will open a
healthy communication with the market-place, and the
principal parts of the town.
Mr. Brooking entreats me to send up a Missionary to
Kumási without delay; stating it to be his opinion, that
Kumási is far more healthy than the coast, in which
opinion I entirely agree. I have long felt anxious to
have another Missionary in Kumási; but as Mr. Watson's
health is still delicate, I know not what steps to take.
I durst not send Mr. Watson, and Mr. Allen certainly
ought to go to Domonási. The only efficient person,
therefore, is Mr. Rowland, whom I thought of sending
to Badagry. After serious reflection for many days,
I mentioned the matter to him, and he immediately

APPENDICES.
185
expressed his willingness to go to Kumási, Badagry, or
anywhere else. Judging our way to be clear, I have
decided on Mr. Rowland's departure for Kumási on the
10th or 11th of May, and have written to Mr. Brooking
to send down one of the young men to the Prah, with
travelling conveniences, to conduct him. As Mr. Row-
land does not understand the nature of travelling in this
climate, I intend, by God's permission, to take him as
far as the Prah myself. I am aware that you may
perhaps blame me for risking my health by so much
incessant labour ; but what can I do in such a case ?
Go he must, and he must not go alone. He has had
a thorough seasoning, and the medical men say that
he may now go anywhere with safety: they recom-
mend Kumási in preference to the coast. It is a
cheering fact, that the climate improves as we advance
into the interior. Mr. Allen is now preparing for
Domonási. He is to go up with us to the Prah, by way
of seasoning him, and on our return he will immediately
occupy his proper post.
APPENDIX, B.
Extract of a Letter from Prince William Quantamissah, to the
Rev. John Beecham, dated Kumási, May 1st, 1842.
I am very glad to address you a few lines, which I
hope will find you, Mrs. Beecham, and all your family
and friends in the enjoyment of good health.
I write to return you my sincere and best thanks, for
the very great kindness and attention we experienced
from you, when in your favoured country.
I am happy to inform you, that, through the mercy
of Heaven, we safely arrived here on Monday, the 13th
of December, in the year of our blessed Lord 1841, and

were honourably received by our uncle the King. Our
much-respected friends, the Rev. Messrs. Freeman and
Brooking, your Society's two able and worthy Mission-
aries, were with us; so our journey from Cape Coast
up to Kumási was very comfortable. His Majesty is
much pleased with the handsome carriage your honour-
able Society was kind enough to send him ; and I do
assure you, that your Society has done much for
Ashánti, in sending him this carriage. For this I have
two reasons; and I will explain them to you. First,
the carriage will civilize and improve the town of
Kumási. Instead of the old streets, which are narrow
and dirty, now, on account of the carriage, the King has
ordered new streets to be made, passable for the carriage;
therefore the carriage indeed will improve and civilize
our country; thank God to say. The second reason is
plain and simple,—that the King, instead of being
carried by men on their heads and shoulders, will now
be carried by the carriage ; and again, the carriage will
take, in some measure, half of the distresses and hard
labour from our fellow-neighbours' heads and shoulders ;
therefore permit me to say, your noble Society deserves
all praise. Remember me kindly and affectionately to
them all ; more especially to Dr. Bunting and family,
Dr. Alder, Mr. Hoole, and other leading members of
the Society, whom I had the pleasure of seeing at your
hospitable house.
I would have written to you seven or eight epistles
before this, but I had to wait for opportunity to send
what I was preparing. When we arrived at Cape-Coast
Castle, we received, through the hands of the Rev,
Thomas B. Freeman, volumes of books, which we have
now with us, and for which we return you our thanks.
I do assure you, that, though we are now parted, and
perhaps we shall never see each other again, yet neither

time nor place can obliterate from my memory the
kindness of my well-wisher.
Pray never cease to help Ashánti, and poor Africa at
large.
APPENDIX, c.
Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Robert Brooking, dated
Kumási, April 6th, 1842, to the Rev. Thomas B. Freeman,
Cape-Coast Castle.
All things around us are as promising as ever.
I am still frequently visited by the principal Chiefs.
Indeed it seems that I am exciting a greater interest
among them. I am just now getting a few articles of
furniture completed. A few days ago I had a side-board
finished, and put up in its place ; which circumstance
has drawn numerous visiters hither. They are also
greatly astonished at the wonders of the turning-lathe.
You will remember, in reading the adventures of that
excellent Missionary, WILLIAMS, that the first thing he
turned in the South-Sea Islands was the leg of a sofa.
By a curious coincidence, quite undesigned on my part,
that was also the first thing I turned in Kumási ; nor
did it occur to me, until after Degowar came in and saw
it; who, after he had examined it, for upwards of
half-an-hour, with the greatest attention, and placed
it in twenty different positions, pronounced it to be
a most beautiful thing. The King also paid me a visit
to-day. He was here almost an hour; he, too, was much
gratified with what I have done, and desired me to work
the turning-lathe, with which he was greatly delighted.
He expressed a degree of surprise, when, after he asked
me how long I had had it, I informed him three weeks,


## p. 188 (#208) ############################################

188
APPENDICES.
that no one had told him I had got such a wonderful
thing. He was also pleased with the side-board : and
when he saw the stool, he pronounced it to be an
excellent thing, and told Quantamissah that he should
like to have one to be carried with him when he goes on
a journey, but that he did not like to ask me to make
him one. I shall set Kobri to make him a neat one,
and send him down as soon as possible; and am glad
that I have such an opportunity of doing him this
favour.
One of the Chiefs told me the other day, that if he
had been told that the side-board had been made on the
coast and brought up here, he should not have believed
it, but have concluded that it certainly came from
England.
APPENDIX, D.
Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Thomas B. Freeman, to the
General Secretaries, dated Mission-House, Cape-Coast Castle,
May 9th, 1842.
To see a footing secured in Kumási, has been to me,
so much as I have been identified with it, a source of
joyous expectation, mercifully weighed in the balance
against my severe sufferings, from various causes, during
the past year: and should God, in his providence, be
pleased to remove me from this scene of trial, this state
of "pleasing, anxious being;” should He call me to
follow my sainted friends into an invisible world before
I begin my descent from the summit of life's meridian
prime; I trust I shall be enabled to depart with some-
thing like the sentiments of old Simeon in holy writ,-
“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace:
for mine eyes have seen” one of the most powerful
Monarchs of interior, degraded Africa, become a

nursing-father to the heralds of “thy salvation.” To
God most high, the loving Father, the redeeming Son,
the convincing and sanctifying Spirit, be all the praise
and all the glory! Amen and amen!
If time would permit, I have many things to say ;
but I am so hardly pressed, that I cannot do what I
would. Yesterday I was sick in bed, I believe chiefly
from the effects of incessant toil, and close application
to business; and to-day I have to write several letters,
and to close my papers for this vessel, independent
of my being obliged to prepare for a fortnight's or three
weeks' absence from home, to take Mr. Rowland to the
Prah, (a distance of nearly ninety miles,) chiefly on foot,
with an intention of visiting the interior parts of the
station, before my return to Cape Coast. This labour
is not of short duration, but it is nearly the same all the
year round. I need great strength, both of body and
spirit, to bear this. I bless God that I am enabled to
do it.
APPENDIX, E.
The following extracts describe various Missionary
operations on the Gold Coast, and especially show the
necessity which exists for greatly increased exertions to
meet the spiritual wants of the native population :-
Dix-Cove.-Extract of a Letter from the Rev. John Watson,
dated Dix-Cove, July 13th, 1841.
My inability to write to you on the return of
Mr. Mycock—inability arising from the seasoning fever
—will, I have no doubt, be deemed a sufficient excuse
why you have not heard from me earlier. However, the
revolution of another quarter brings with it the duty

APPENDICES.
of "giving" you " an account of". the exercise of my
ministerial "stewardship.”
Our General Superintendent, deeming it necessary
that a European Missionary should be stationed at this
place, selected me for that purpose ; and, as soon as my
strength was sufficiently recruited, I accordingly re-
paired hither, at which place I arrived, April 7th, 1841.
The estimated distance from Cape Coast to Dix-Cove
is between sixty and seventy miles by land. The
population of this town is computed at five thousand;
though one-fifth or more of these are generally absent
from home, either attending to their farms in the bush,
or on trading excursions. Your Missionary has never
been preceded in this part of the Mission-field by a
messenger of peace, except by an American Episcopalian
Missionary, who resided here but eight weeks. There
is only one European merchant resident here. A boys'
school was only commenced twelve months previous to
my arrival; so that the facilities hitherto afforded to
the inhabitants for acquiring a knowledge of divine
truth having been limited, the darkness of Heathenism
is consequently nearly unbroken, and “the god of this
world” has hitherto reigned in this part of his dominions
with almost undisputed sway. The limits of this com-
munication, and my comparative inexperience, prohibit
me from saying any thing respecting the religious
opinions, superstitious practices, &c., of the natives,
except that their principal tutelar deity is the alligator ;
which, being devoutly revered and suitably protected,
has multiplied rather too rapidly, and having recently
become injurious to men, and destructive to sheep, goats,
fowls, &c., the authorities have deemed it necessary to
demonstrate the mortality of their divinities, by shooting
two of them.
During the first fortnight of my residence here, I

was hospitably entertained by John G. Sandeman, Esq.,
Commandant, (pro tempore,) at the expiration of which
period no suitable house being obtainable, I was under
the necessity of renting the one which I now occupy for
six ackies of gold (£1. 10s. currency) per month. It
consists of three rooms on a ground-floor, the respective
sizes of which are seventeen feet by nine, eleven by
nine, and nine by nine. It is situated on the beach, and
the high-tides wash the foundations of the side and end-
walls of my bed-room, and approach within four yards
of the entire front of the house ; so that your Missionary
unavoidably lives in steam by day, and in dew by night.
I trust, dear Sirs, you will perceive the indispensable
necessity of immediately erecting a Mission-house, if
you resolve to continue a European Missionary at Dix-
Cove. At present a residence here is eminently peril-
ous; and, indeed, that I am alive to write these lines
is matter of grateful surprise to myself.
Our religious services were held in the open air until
the commencement of the rainy season in the latter end
of May, when we were compelled to retreat to the
school-room, in which our services have subsequently
been held. My congregations have varied from forty
to two hundred; and many attend regularly now, who
only attended casually at first. My reception among
the people has been exceedingly kind and flattering.
The principal head-men and merchants manifest an
ardent desire for instruction; and, previous to my ar-
rival anong them, they envied the privileges of the
inhabitants of Cape Coast. They saw the full light of
truth shining at a distance; and the few streaks of it
which occasionally reached them were only sufficient to
show them their destitute condition, and to excite the
desire that the “Sun of righteousness” might arise on
them, “with healing in his wings.”

Twelve persons have been united in church-fellow-
ship, some of whom, we trust, have entered into "the
kingdom of God, which is not meat and drink, but
righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost;" and
of others we have hope that they are not far from the
same kingdom. The boys' school is now committed to
our superintendence and direction : at present there are
thirty-five boys in it, who display great aptitude in
learning; and their progress is exceedingly creditable,
considering the short time that the school has been
established.
A girls' school was commenced on Monday, May 17th.
Previous to this the whole town was canvassed by me;
and the discouraging result was, only the promise of two
girls. The female sex are so degraded here, and con-
sidered so much inferior, that the idea of educating
them was ridiculed and laughed at as the greatest
absurdity which the human mind could entertain.
However, difficulties and discouragements are every-
day occurrences with Missionaries; and notwithstanding
the indifference of some, and the idiotic laughs of others,
the school was opened at the time appointed; and when
the people were satisfied as to the benevolent character
of my intentions, by my furnishing the girls with frocks,
work-bags, &c., their prejudices began to yield, and we
succeeded in obtaining seven on the first day. The
number has gradually increased since the commence-
ment, and at present we have sixteen in the girls'
school. For such a beginning, we “thank God, and
take courage.”
APOLLONIA.—Extract of a Letter from the Rev. William Allen,
dated Cape-Coast Castle, February 2d, 1842.
I am happy to announce to you my safe arrival at
Cape Coast. We were six weeks and two days before

we made land. When we came to Apollonia,* the
Captain went on shore to trade with the King, and met
with a friendly reception. He told the King that he
had a Missionary on board; whom he expressed a strong
desire to see. The Captain wrote me a letter to that
effect; and the King sent his large canoe, with twelve
men, to conduct me on shore. I suppose I was the
first Missionary that ever set a foot on the shores of
Apollonia. I stopped at the King's house, and met
with the kindest welcome. The Captain and I were
together. We had not our meals with the King, but
a most splendid entertainment was provided for us;
and when we wanted to go, the King was unwilling
that we should leave. He threw himself into a passion
about our departure; and had placed round the court-
yard not less than fifty men, armed with guns and
swords, to prevent us from going; and in addition to
these fifty men in the court-yard, he ordered all the
workmen from a new house which he was building, not
less than twenty, to come and stand also at a door-way
through which we must pass, if we got out of the court-
yard; some were armed with axes, others with adzes,
each of them having a weapon of some kind. We
stayed here two days, and even then it was not without
trouble that we got away. At length the King, in a fit
of passion, ordered the canoe-men to take us to the vessel
immediately: this was what we wanted. In reference
to the character of this King, I may remark, that he is
supposed to be more barbarous than the King of Ashánti.
A short time since, his mother died, and, to honour
her, he caused twenty men, twenty women, and twenty
young girls, to be sacrificed. They first killed a man,

the British formerly had a fort.- EDIT.

then a woman, and then a young girl ; and continued
their cruelties in this order, till they had killed the
whole. The females were slain by striking them on
the back of the head with clubs: they partly cut the
throats of the men, and then tied ropes to their legs, and
drew them round the town, their throats still bleeding,
and men following them with clubs, striking them on
their stomachs; and when they were brought back to
the place from whence they started, they cut off the heads
of those who were still living. The bodies of both male
and female were thrown into a hole in the bush, to be
food for beasts of prey. This King orders the head of a
person to be cut off for a very trifling offence. I saw a
large tree growing near to his house, in one of his court-
yards, the trunk of which was lashed round with the
skulls of human beings: there were not less than fifty
human heads tied to that tree! I saw also several of
his large drums, which were encircled with human
skulls.
AKRAH.-Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Thomas B.
Freeman, dated Cape-Coast Castle, April 17th, 1842.
Our schools at Dix-Cove are doing well: they contain
forty-five boys, and nineteen girls.
Our school at Cape Coast is rapidly advancing : it is
now kept in the Mission-house, and contains sixty girls.
I hope our friends at home will not forget us respecting
clothes, needles, thread, &c. : we are sadly at a loss for
these things.
Mr. and Mrs. Shipman have returned to their post at
Akráh, and are busy in preparing to receive as many
young men as we can obtain, to undergo a course of
theological training and other preparation, for the more
efficient discharge of their duty as teachers, &c. We
have fixed upon Akráh as a proper place for this,

because the Mission-house is large, and the society so
small as to admit of Mr. Shipman's devoting much
of his time to teaching, and preparing the young men
for usefulness.
Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Thomas B. Freeman,
dated Cape-Coast Castle, June 25th, 1842.
SINCE I last wrote to you, I have accompanied
Mr. Watson to Dix-Cove, to make arrangements for his
permanent residence there. Alive to the importance
of avoiding expenses as much as possible, I have tried
by every means to hire a good habitation for him, but
cannot succeed ; and hence we are under the necessity
of building a small house immediately. We have
selected a piece of ground, of which we expect to
obtain a “grant" from the Local Government; and
are now purchasing materials, and preparing workmen
to commence the house forthwith. As we have plenty
of labourers at hand, I trust we shall succeed in getting
it finished before the rainy season. I am glad to say
that Mr. Watson's health seems to be fully restored ;
as a proof of which I need only tell you, that he has
performed a journey of a hundred and forty miles along
the coast, during the rainy season; a great part of which
we had to walk, often climbing over rugged rocks, and
sometimes wading through muddy paths, during the heat
of the day, and the damps of the night: he has now
proceeded to Anamabu, to pack up his things, and to
prepare for his removal to Dix-Cove, in perfect health.
This is very encouraging amidst our heavy duties. I
hope the new house at Dix-Cove will be built with
greater rapidity, and with less expense, than we have
accomplished such work before, on any part of the coast.
We are thinking of slating the roof, as it will be the
safest, as well as the most expeditious method. We can


## p. 196 (#216) ############################################

196
APPENDICES.
obtain slate from America, cheaper than we can from
England ; and I think I can procure it from thence, by
the time that we shall be ready for it. Many of the
merchants here are using slate for the roofs of their
houses, and find it no more expensive than the ordinary
method of terracing.
I hope these steps will meet with the approbation of
the Committee, and that the result will prove our strict
adherence to economy.
I am now preparing to proceed to Badagry, with
Mr. and Mrs. De Graft, by the first opportunity; and
hope, by the blessing of God, to be able to write to you
from thence, in about two months from this date.
I bless God that our reports from all parts of the
District are very encouraging, both from the interior
and along the coast. Some of us, either from hard
labour, or from the exhausting effects of the rainy
season, are not quite so strong in bodily health as we
could wish : but we will not complain ; for we know in
whose glorious work we are engaged.
