<p class="caption-text">Anonymous, “Group of Workmen (Including William Ivens Craft) with Two Horse-Drawn Carts” (Photograph, [c.1910]), Personal image collection of Martin Copeland. Used by permission. This is the only known photograph of William Ivens Craft. He appears in the image leaning casually against the left-hand cart with one elbow resting upon the shaft. This photograph of William Ivens in an English coal yard among mostly-white fellow workers reflects the complex racial dynamics that the <em>One More Voice</em> digital exhibition will explore. Moreover, although the story of his parents – William and Ellen Craft – remains famous due to their sensational escape from slavery, William Ivens' own struggles and quest for belonging in the post-emancipation transatlantic world have received considerably less attention from historians, thereby making the recovery work of the planned exhibition all the more significant.</p>
