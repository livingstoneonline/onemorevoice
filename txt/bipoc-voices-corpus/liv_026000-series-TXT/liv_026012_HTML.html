<h5 style="text-align:center;">INDIAN SNAKE-CATCHER.</h5>
<p>A British-Guiana Missionary writes—</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">It has been my lot to witness, on more than one occasion, the effects of 
the bite of the labaria; and there is perhaps no person who has lived for 
years in the interior who has not been in imminent danger at times from 
the proximity of some of these creatures. I have, however, only heard 
of one instance in which a full-grown man has been seized by one of the 
boa species. This occurred in the swamps of the Akawini. The reptile,
a large camudi, sprang upon him, and coiled round his body, confining
one of his arms. Providentially, before it could master the other, 
his wife, who was near, handed him a knife, with which he inflicted a 
deep cut, causing the snake to quit him, and make its retreat. The 
Indians, also, once told me of a large camudi having been killed in a 
state of torpidity, which had just swallowed a boy of the Caribi nation.</p>
<br><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livingstoneonline/onemorevoice/master/txt/cove-amd-transcriptions/data/img/liv_026012_0002_IMG.jpg" alt="Sketch of 'Indian Snake Eater'; courtesy of Adam Mathew Digital" style="width: 455px;"></div><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">To any one who knows what destructive creatures abound in these 
forests, it is surprising that accidents of this kind do not more frequently 
occur. But the great characteristic of the Indian is caution, and his 
keen eye and acute hearing are constantly exercised by the nature of his 
situation. He displays a subtilty of artifice in capturing these reptiles 
equal to that which is usually assigned to the serpent himself. I have 
seen an Indian creep under a low bush on his hands and knees, and 
capture a kolokonaro by means of a noose, which he dropped over its 
head with a forked stick as it raised it to look at the intruder: the stick 
being then quickly placed on its neck, and the noose drawn tight, the 
reptile was hauled forth, and its capture completed. In this manner the 
Indians catch such snakes as they wish to preserve alive for sale. If the
snake be not too large or venomous, the man grasps it tightly by the 
neck, and allows it to coil itself round his arm [see the engraving], until 
he is able to place it in secure confinement. The kolokonaro was only 
about five feet in length, but so thick and strong that the Indian who 
carried it was soon obliged to call for assistance, to remove the snake, 
and release his arm from its pressure. This species is beautifully marked 
with brown, orange, white, and other colours. It is sometimes called the 
<em>land</em>-camudi or boa, to distinguish it from the other camudi, which takes 
to the water, and is found in damp places. They both attain to a great size.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">Some of the larger snakes are said to attain to upwards of thirty feet 
in length. I never saw any near that size. The largest that I knew of 
was about twenty feet, and was captured by some of our Indians in a
similar manner to that related above, while gorged with food. They 
then tied it to the stern of a canoe, and towed it through the water to 
the residence of a settler, to whom they disposed of it alive.<a href="#note1" id="note1back">*</a></p>
