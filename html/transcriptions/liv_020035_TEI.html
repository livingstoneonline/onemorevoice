<p class="p noindent "><span class="small caps ">Many</span> circumstances combine at the present period
to encourage the cheering belief that He, whose ear never closes to the cry
of human
suffering, is coming forth to manifest his effectual compassion on behalf of
the long
oppressed <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>; the now almost portionless inhabitants of
a fertail country once their own.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Friends, both at home and
abroad, are actively espousing their cause, pointing to the manifold wrongs
which they have
suffered, vindicating and recommending their equitable claims on the righteous
and benevolent
feeling of the <span class="country" title="A country."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">British</span> nation</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Among the efforts now made to rescue this injured race of men from
their deplorable condition, those of the Lieut. Governor, on the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Eastern Frontier of
the Colony</span>, appear peculiarly prominent, and eminently tend to inspire encouragement
and hope.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The means whcih are requisite to promote this truly
valuable work, contemplating as it does the moral and religious advancement
of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>, as well as their social elecation, are specially marked
out in the two following communications; the first from <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Rev. J. Monro</span>, of
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Graham's Town</span>, describing chiefly the auspicious opening for
Missionary exertion, which has been created by the liberal measures of the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Liet.
Governor</span>; the second, from the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Rev. Dr. Philip</span>, the

1838.</span> <span class="seg right ">7</span></span> transmitted from the schip in which they have
recently embarked, and, as it will be seen, more particularly referring to the
immediate wants
of the several <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span> families who have removed to their new
cantonments on the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Gread Fish River</span> and appealing for aid to the generous
sympathies of all who may feel disposed to assist in a project so replete with
interest and
importance as that to which attention is now invited.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In July last, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Monro</span> thus writes to the Foreign
<span class="seg word ">Secretary:—</span></p>
<div class="div narrow">
<p class="p ">In order to give you as clear a statement as possible, respecting the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span> settlement along the banks of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Gread Fish
River</span>, I intimated my intention to his honour the Lieut. Governor of visiting them
in person; and having received his cordial approbation, I proceeded on the
11th inst. to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span>
Drift</span>, and arrived there on the 13th.</p>
<div class="div ">
<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span> Drift
Settlement</span>.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">The party were delighted to see me, and were loud in their praises of the privliges
which
they posessed in arable land, garden ground, &amp;c., &amp;c., The men here, as at
all the
settlements, receive rations from <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span>, and the women and children
collect roots.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The men likewise go hunting, some of them to
the river in which there are numerous hippopotami, and some to
the bush, where the
bufaloes
graze in heards; but there is sufficient land for several hundred
families.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is a good place for a Missionary station, and
from its proximity to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffres</span>, a congregation might, in
time, be collected on the other side of the river; thus forming a field of
Missionary
exertion of a very encouraging nature, and as far as we are able to judge,
with every
prospect of usefulness and success.</p>
<p class="p ">From <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span> Drift</span> we advanced up
the river to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Trompettor's Drift</span>, and proceeded then to the</p>

<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Settlement under
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Appel</span></span>.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">Here the whole party were busy erecting their habitations.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This place far exceeds in natural beauty any spot that I have seen along the whole
course
of the river, from the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span> Drift</span>
up to the junction of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kat River</span> with the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Fish
River</span>; but it affords little opportunity to the settlers for the display of
industry in the cultivation of land. Between their dwellings and the river,
50 paces is the
extreme extent of what they call their garden ground, and there is no other
spot, either
above or below the site of their village, which presents more encouraging
appearance.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here there are 18 families, consisting of about 70 individuals, and
several families are on their way to join them.</p>

<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lowe</span>'s party is located a few miles lower down the river, in a
similar situation.</p>

Rivers</span></span>.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">From <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Trompettor's Drift</span> I continued my route up the river,
passing <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Committy's Drift</span>, now occupied as the chief military fort
on the fronteir instead of <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Fort Welshire</span> and <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Double
Drift</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Above the last mentioned, <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Klaas</span>'s party</span> is located at the junction of
the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kat River</span> and the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Fish River</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are more than 50 families here.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their
greatest want, as they say themselves, is to have a Missionary who will teach
their children,
as well as preach to them, and advise with them in their several plans and
operations.</p>
<p class="p ">The site which they have chosen for a village is pleasantly situated.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fronting their houses there is an island of considerable extent, which they
intend to enclose immediately, subdiving the same into patches, varying in
size, according
to the wants and means of the several familites.</p>
<p class="p ">This is certainly the most interesting settlement yet formed, and a Missionary<span>*</span> would find sufficient work here, independent of the other
settlements lower down the river; but if schoolmasters are sent to this place
and to
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Trompettor's</span> and <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span>
Drifts</span>, the Missionary may then itinerate among all of them, and a fine field
it certainly is.</p>
<p class="p ">During my journey I conducted Divine service twenty-three times in ten days, and all
our
meetings were accompanied by prayer.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I enjoyed it very much,
and found that in watering others I was much refreshed myself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>May the Lord bless the settlers, and send them a Missionary and teachers who will
prove a
blessing to them! Much depends on an immediate supply being afforded, and
I trust the
Directors will kindly, and without delay, consider their case and send them
the bread of
life.</p>

have strong claims on the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Government</span>, for any unoccupied lands it might
have to dispose of; and in giving them the lands that have been assigned them,
he has (in
connexion
with the good of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>,) consulted the
interests of the colony, the security of the fronteirs and the future well-being
of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffres</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The plan now pursued by the
Lieut. Governor was recommended by the Crown Commissioner of the Inquiry in
the reports to
the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Home Government</span>, and perhaps it would have been well for
the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Colony</span> had it been carried into effect at that period.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kat River</span> settlement</span> and the protection of the

men of colour
between the white Colonists and the barbarous tribes beyond the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Colony</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The heart of the Lieut. Governor is now set upon the completion of this plan,
in which he will, we doubt not, be ably secconded by his Excellency, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Major General
Napier</span>; but he feels great difficulties in carrying it to the full extend he
contemplated, owing to the great poverty of the people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span> located on the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kat River</span> had
no assistance from Government, nor from any other quarter; but the banks of
the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kat
River</span> were and are more favourable to the furtherance of such a scheme than the
banks of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Dish River</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Besides, a
number of the first settlers on the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kat River</span> had something of their own
to begin with, and those who had any thing of their own assisted their poorer
neighbours.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the contrary, those that are permitted to
locate themselves on the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Fish River</span> belong to that class of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span> who have had the least protection, and who stand in need
of every thing.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They are without herds and flocks, without
clothing, or the commonest agricultural tools.</p>
<p class="p ">In a letter to a friend, the Lieut. Governor remarks:—"My plan cannot succeed without
Missionaries and schoolmasters, and means to put the people in possession of
a few sheep and
goats, seed corn, and agricultural instruments," and for these he looks to
the friends of
religion and humanity in <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, and we hope he will not look in vain for
the assistance required.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This appeal to the sympathies of the
friends of the colonial races in <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, will be the more readily
responded to, when it is known that the Lieut. Governor has generously advanced
3000 dollars
out of his own pocket, to purchase for the settlers a small quantity of stock;
but, as the
people are flocking to the new locations, all that the most generous individual
can furnish
out of his private means will go but a little way to supply their necessities.</p>
<p class="p ">We regret at this moment that we could not have remained a little time longer in
<span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, to have made our appeals in person on behalf of this people; but
we feel confident that the appeal we have left behind, as embraced in the preceeding
statements, will not be unheeded by the generous friends of <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> in

<span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Clothing is an article the new
settlers stand much in need of; agricultural tools are particularly wanted,
or money
wherewith to purchase them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sheep, and goats, and the few
cattle which are needed, can be purchased in the colony.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Regular accounts will be given of the application of all the money
intrusted
to our care.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Leaving this appeal to the generous
consideration of the numerous friends of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span> race in
