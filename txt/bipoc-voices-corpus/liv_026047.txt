Gleanings from Recent Letters.
The Gospel preached by a Captive Yoruba Girl.
The subjoined deeply interesting narrative is from a recent journal of the Rev. Daniel Olubi,
Native Pastor at Ibadan, and well known as the faithful helper for many years of Mr. and Mrs.
Hinderer:&#8212;
June 6th, 1874&#8212;To-day, Messrs.
Allen, Okusende, two members of
our Church, and myself, went to Adeladan, a wicked persecutor of a new
inquirer, a girl named Moyoade, now in fetters, to beg him and his
brothers to release her from the fetters, and let her be coming to church,
and that nothing bad will be the result if she sincerely follow the Lord
Jesus Christ. We were there for five hours, reasoning and urging them
to this point; but sorry to say that they remained obstinate and unreasonable, and so we
returned unsuccessful. The poor persecuted girl
sent to us afterwards, that we should not take the trouble of coming to
her relatives, because they determined to lend us their deaf ear.
A few weeks after this she escaped from the chains, and ran to Kakanfo
(the Mohammedan head chief) for protection. The chief was informed
of this beforehand, and he promised her assistance whenever the case
is brought before him. So now he fulfilled his promise and assisted
her very much; and though poor Moyoade knows little of Christianity
herself, yet it pleased the chief to keep her for three days in his
house, during which time he conversed much with her on the subject
of Christianity. He received more knowledge from the girl of that way,
and the girl was also happy to receive more encouragement from the
chief. Now, after three days, her relatives were sent for by the chief,
and he warned them that the girl must be left alone to pursue this new
religion, and, he added, "it is the best religion." Then he delivered the
girl over to them. But before they left the chief's presence the girl stood
up and assured the relatives," I shall willingly obey and do your orders;
but if you will stop my going to church, I prefer death rather than obey
you."
Alas! when they got home with her every punishment was doubled.
She was the more cruelly chained. But He whom she desires to serve
mercifully helped her, and she escaped from the chains, and took refuge
at another new inquirer's house; but here she was not at all safe, consequently she was brought
to me. The next morning I went to tell the
chief of it, and he wondered that he was not listened to. He kindly
advised me to keep the girl secret out of their way until they are pacified.
But, then, how long? is the question.
We earnestly beg the faithful prayers of the friends of the Mission,
that it may please God to turn the hearts of these persecutors as the
rivers of water, withersoever He wills.
We are thankful to add that a more recent communication
from Mr. Alubi mentions incidentally that the girl's case was
"nicely settled," and "all going on beautifully."
