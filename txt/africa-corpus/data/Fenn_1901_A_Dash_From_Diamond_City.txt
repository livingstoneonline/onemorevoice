CHAPTER I.

TICK, tap, tap—tap, z'z'cker—z'z'cker, Zapper—lapper,

and scratck~—scratalz went two pens, in one of the minor
o?ices connected with that vast wealth-producing in-
dustry known as the De Beers Diamond Mines, where,
' seated at desk and table, three young men were hard
at work, one manipulating the typewriter, one writing
a letter, and the third making entries in a fat leather-
covered book with broad bands and a big letter dis-
tinguishing it upon the back.
The words: "minor of?ce in a diamond-mine,"
naturally suggest wealth, Turkey carpets, french-polished
furniture, and plate-glass; but the of?ce in question was
an example of simplicity, for its walls were mud and its
roof corrugated iron, while the roughness of the interior
was only slightly softened down by a lining of what
a carpenter calls matchboarding. In spite of its vast
wealth, Kimberley is still little better than a moving

camp, and holds out few prospects of ever becoming
a magni?cent town. '
The interior of that newly-created of?ce, allowing
for the tapping of the typewriter and the scratching of
the pens, was very quiet; but outside there was the
strange sound produced by the mingling of voices
with trampling feet and the distant whirr and rattle Of
machinery, till a clock began striking, followed by
the clangour of a bell, and then all was changed.
"Time!" shouted the manipulator 0f the typewriter,
springing from his stool tO stretch his wiry six feet of
length, at the same time spoiling a keen, manly face
by distorting it with a yawn. The clerk who had been
bending over the thick account-book ceased making
entries, applied the blotting-paper, and closed the book
with a bang, tO turn round and display a pink-and-
white, fat, smooth face, dis?gured by nearly white eye-
brows and lashes and curly whity-brown hair. As he
stood up he yawned and wrinkled his fat face a good
deal; but the wrinkles died down into a smile which
gave him a meek and mild appearance, the said smile
being doubled directly after by his taking a little round
shaving-glass out of his desk, propping it up by means
of a contrivance behind, and then, by the help Of a
pocket-comb, proceeding to rearrange his hair, which,
from the resistance Offered, appeared to be full of knots
and kinks.
The last to leave his desk was a manly-looking

THREE WHITE ONES. ' I I
young fellow who appeared to be twenty, but who
possessed documentary evidence that he was only
eighteen. He neither stretched nor yawned, but drew
himself up with a Sigh of relief, and, after carefully
locking up the letters he had written, he turned to the
typist.
"Going out, Ingleborough?" he said.
"Yes; I shan't be long. I must go on to the
compound. Back in—--"
"Five minutes?" dashed in his questioner.
"No; that I shan't," said the young man smartly;
"but I will not exceed ?fteen. Get out 'my ri?e and
belts, West."
"All right," was the reply, and as the door closed
the young clerk crossed to a plain deal cupboard in
the corner of the of?ce, threw open the broad door,
and revealed an arms-rack with some twenty of the
newest-pattern ri?es standing ready for use, and bayo-
nets and bandoliers to match each breechloading piece.
A peculiarly innocent baby-like look came over
his companion's face as he opened his desk and took
out a little ?at oblong mahogany case and said softly:
"Going to play at soldiers again? Only to think of
Oliver West, Esquire, learning to shoulder arms and
right about face when a drill~sergeant barks at him."
"Look here, Anson," cried the young fellow
warmly; "is that meant for a sneer?"
"Me sneer?" protested the plump-looking cherubic

clerk. "Oh dear, no! I never indulge in sneers, and
I never quarrel, and I never ?ght." _
"Humphl" ejaculated the ri?e-bearer.
"I only think it's all braggadocio nonsense for a
lot of fellows to go wasting time drilling and volunteer-
ing when they might acquire such an accomplishment
as this."
As the speaker addressed his warlike companion
he tapped the lid of his case, opened it, and revealed
three joints of a ?ute lying snugly in purple-velvet
?ttings, and, taking them out, he proceeded to lick the
ends all round in a tomcat sort of way, and screwed
them together, evidently with a great deal of satisfac-
tion to himself, for he smiled softly.
"Bah! It's a deal more creditable to be prepared
to defend the place against the Boers. Better join us,
Anson."
"Me? No, thank you, unless you start a band and
make me bandmaster."
"We shall want no music," said West, laughing.
"The Boers will give us plenty of that with their guns."
"Nonsense! It's all fudge," said the ?autist, smiling.
"There'll be no ?ghting, and even if there were I'm
not going to shoulder a ri?e. I should be afraid to
let it Off."
"You?" cried West, staring into the smooth, plump
face. "Why, you once told me you were a ?rst-rate
shot."


## p. 13 (#21) ##############################################



THREE WHITE ONES. 13
"Did I? WVell, it was only my fun," said the clerk,
placing his ?ute to his lips and beginning to run dumb
scales up and down, skilfully enough as to the ?ngering,
but he did not produce a sound.
"I say, don't you begin to blow!" cried West,
looking rather contemptuously at the musician and
forcing himself to restrain a laugh at the grotesque
round face. with the eyes screwed up into narrow slits.
"Oh, no one will come here now," was the reply.
"I get so little practice. I shall blow gently." Directly
afterwards he began to run up and down, playing
through some exercise with which he was familiar
extremely softly; and then by way of a change he
began what is technically known as "double-tonguing."
This was too much for_Oliver West. He had
stood rubbing ?rst one ri?e and then the other with
a slightly-oiled rag to get rid of specks of rust or
dust, every now and then stealing a glance at the
absurdly screwed-up face, feeling the while that a good
hearty laugh would do. him good, but determined to
maintain his composure so as not to hurt the per-
former's feelings. But the double-tonguing was too
much.
T ooile-tao, {wile-too, toolle, tooz'le-too went the per-
former, running up the gamut till he reached the octave
and was about to run down again, but he stopped
short, lowered his instrument, and turned from a warm
pink to a deep purply crimson, for \Vest suddenly burst

out into a half-hysterical roar of laughter, one which
he vainly strove to check.
"I—I—~I—I beg your pardon," he cried at last.
"Thank you," snorted out Anson; "but I don't see
anything to laugh at."
"I couldn't help it, Anson. You did look so—so
comic. Such a face!"
"Did I?" cried the musician angrily. "Such a face,
indeed! You should see your own. Your grin looked
idiotic: half-way between a bushman and a baboon."
"Thank you," said \Vest, calming down at once,
and feeling nettled in turn.
"Oh, you're quite welcome," said Anson sarcasti-
cally. "I have heard about casting pearls before
swine; butI never saw the truth of the saying before."
"Thank you again," said \Vest, frowning. "But
if I were you I would not waste any more of my
pearls in such company."
"I do not mean to," said Anson, with his eyes
glittering.
He got no farther, though he was prepared to say
something crushing, for the door was ?ung open and
their fellow-clerk came back quickly.
"Hullo!" he cried, "?ute and hautboy. I say,
Sim, put that thing away and don't bring it here, or
I shall have an accident with it some day. You ought
to have stopped him, Noll. But come out, both of
you. There's some fun in the compound. They're

going to thoroughly search half-a-dozen Kaf?rs, and I
thought you'd like to see."
"Been stealing diamonds?" cried Anson excitedly.
"Suspected," replied InglebOrough.
"I'll 'come too," said Anson, and he began to
rapidly unscrew his ?ute, but so hurriedly that in place
of separating the top joint from the next he pulled it
open at the tuning-slide, changed colour, and swung
himself round so as to turn his back to his companions,
keeping in that position till his instrument was properly
separated and replaced in its case, whose lid he closed,
and then turned the key.
"I'm ready," he cried, facing round and buttoning
his jacket over the little mahogany case. >
"Do you take that shepherd's pipe tO bed with
you?" said Ingleborough scornfully.
"Generally," replied the fat-looking clerk inno-
cently. "You see, it's so nice when one wakes early,
and I have learned to blow so softly now that I can
often get an hour's practice before I have my morning's
bath."
"How delightful for the other boarders! You're
at Dick Tomlin's house, aren't you?"
"Yes," said Anson. '
"Have they any room for another boarder, Sim?"
"I—I really don't know, but I'll ask, if you like,
this evening."
"NO, no; don't, please," cried Ingleborough. "Per-

haps it might be too strong for me. I ought to go
through a course of bagpipes ?rst."
Anson had fastened two buttons of his jacket so
as to hold the ?ute-case from slipping, and now he
fastened another button, smiling pleasantly the while.
"That's meant for a joke," he said.
"Quite right," cried Ingleborough abruptly. "Come
along."
He stepped out, closely followed by West, and
Anson called after them: "\Vith you directly," as the
door swung to.
"Don't do that again," whispered West.
"What?"
"Say anything to chaff Old Anson. Did you see
how he behaved?"
"I saw him smile like a Chinese mandarin orna-
ment. That's all."
"I saw him smile and look smooth; but he can't
bear a joke. His hands were all of a tremble as he
buttoned up his jacket, and there was a peculiar look
in his eye. It's not good policy to make enemies."
"Nonsense! He's a poor slack-baked animal. I
wonder they ever had him here."
West glanced back; but Anson had not yet left
the of?ce.
"Relative of one of the directors," said West
quickly; "and I've noticed several things lately to make
me think he does not like us."

THREE \VHITE ONES. 17

"Oh, if you come to that," said Ingleborough, "so
have I. That's quite natural, for we don't like him.
One can't; he's so smooth and soft. But why doesn't
he come.> I'll just give him a minute after we get up
to the compound gate, and if he is not there then
he'll have to stay outside."
I
"Here he comes,' cried West, and the next minute
their fellow-clerk joined them, just as they got up to a
gate in the high fence of the enclosure where the
Kaf?r workers about the diamond-mines were kept to
all intents prisoners till they had served the time for
which they had engaged.
"Haven't kept you two waiting, have I?" said
Anson, with a pleasant smile directed at both.
"No, no, all right," replied West, and directly
after they were admitted to the compound, just in
time to ?nd that half-a-dozen of the stalwart Kaf?r
workers were standing perfectly nude awaiting the ex-
amination about tov be made by some of the of?cers
—an examination which they seemed to look upon as
a joke, for they laughed and chatted together.
"Looking as innocent as old Anson, only not so
white," Whispered Ingleborough. "But we shall see."

CHAPTER II.
BLACK INNOCENTS.
THE examination of the men was not a pleasant
duty, but it was carried out in the most matter-
of-fact way by a couple of experienced white men.
who began at once.
"Now, you," cried the one who seemed to be the
head; "this way." .
The big black spoken to stepped forward at
once, smiling good-temperedly, and stopped by a heavy
wooden stool, upon which he planted a foot, and in
obedience to orders separated his toes in turn to show
that he had no diamonds hidden between them. Then
he was seized by the searchers, the ?rst holding the
black's head on one side while his companion took
hold of the lobe of the right ear and twisted it about,
ending by thrusting in a small wooden scoop and after-
wards turning itdto act as a sound.
"Don't seem to have a diamond in there," said
Anson, smiling and looking very innocent, but deeply
interested. "Turn him over."


## p. 19 (#27) ##############################################


BLACK INNOCEN TS. 19
But the searchers had not waited for Anson's
words, and were already turning the black's head over,
the man yielding himself to every push and thrust,
smiling good-humouredly the while, though the treat-
ment was decidedly rough.
"Nothing in the other ear," said Anson, smiling
at 'West. "Shouldn't wonder if he's got ever so many
tucked in his cheeks, like a monkey pouches nuts."
This time it seemed as if the same idea had struck
the searchers, for the black was ordered to open his
mouth, and a big coarse ?nger was thrust in, and the
interior of the mouth was carefully explored, with-
out result.
"Herc, I know," whispered Anson, rubbing his
hands together. "Oh, the artfulness of the beggarl"
"Where are they, then, old Double-cunning?"
cried Ingleborough contemptuously.
"Stuck with gum in amongst his woolly hair—I
say, isn't it fun?"
"Rather disgusting," replied \Vest. "I shouldn't
like the job."
"Oh, I don't know," said Anson; "it sets me
thinking, and it's interesting. Hahl I was right."
He stood rubbing his hands together in his
childish enjoyment, while one of the searchers care-
fully passed his hands all over the black's head, but
found no small diamonds tangled up amongst the
curly little knots of hair.

"\Vcll, I did think he'd got some there," continued
Anson—"Oh, of course! One might have guessed
it before."
This was upon the black's head being forced
back a tri?e, while a pinch of snuff was blown through
a_pea-shooter right into the prisoner's nose, making
him sneeze violently.
But still no diamonds made their appearance, and
after a little further search the man was set at liberty,
giving place to another supposed culprit.
This man came up smiling and con?dent, opening
his mouth wide, to display its state of innocency and
a magni?cent set Of teeth at the same time.
"Take care! he bites," said Ingleborough banter-
ingly; and Anson, who had pressed to the front,
started back in horror, to be greeted with a burst
of laughter. '
'1!
"How fond you are 01 a joke he cried,
smoothing his face.
At the same moment one of the searchers sent
a puff of snuff in the black's face, with the result that
he was seized with a violent burst Of coughing and
sneezing.
"Two—three—four!" cried Anson excitedly, and,
springing forward, he picked up three of the diamonds
ejected by the black, who, after a little further search,
yielded up a couple of very small stones from one
ear, and was marched off for punishment.

"I do like this!" said Anson, rubbing his hands
together. "\/Vhat brutes Of thieves they are!"
"Yes, you ought to take to searching," said West,
smiling. "You'd make a capital detective."
"Think so?" said the young man, growing serious
directly. "You're not chaf?ng me, are you?"
"Chaffing? Not at all! I mean it," replied West.
"Well, do you know," said Anson, in a con-
?dential way, "I don't think I should make a bad
one. I know I should like it better than the work I
do now. But look what a big strong fellow this one
is. I wonder whether he has any."
"Half-a-dozen, I daresay," said West, looking
curiously at another stalwart black, who came forward
slowly and unwillingly to take the place of the
second man, set aside for punishment.
"N—n—no," said Anson thoughtfully. "I don't
think this one has any."
"'Why?" asked West.
"I can't say," replied Anson dreamily. "I only
know that I don't think he has any." And, as it
happened, the most rigid examination failed to discover
any of the gems. But, all the same, the culprit was
set aside for punishment, two Of the watchers present
at the examination declaring that they had seen him
put his hand to his mouth and swallow something.
The next man, upon being summoned to the
stool, came up boldly and displayed a child-like

eagerness to prove his innocence, opening his mouth
widely and passing his fore-?ngers round between
gums and checks, thrusting his little ?ngers into his.
ears, and then bending down and going through the
motion of one washing his head.
But he did not wash any gems out of his shock
of little nubbly curls.
"No got no dymons, boss," he cried. "Me go
now, boss?"
"No," said the chief searcher sharply. "Clap that
foot of yours upon the stool."
The black stared at him hard and shook his head.
"Do you hear?" cried the searcher. "Clap that
right foot upon the stool."
The black stared at him vacantly, shook his head
again, and turned to the second searcher, who trans-
lated the order into the man's own tongue.
At this the black smiled and nodded. Then,
turning to the chief searcher, he placed his bare left ,
foot upon the stool. '
"No, no: the other," cried the stern of?cial,
pointing to the right foot, and the order was
emphasised by his assistant.
Once more the black looked intelligent, placed
both his feet upon the ground, changed them several
times by shuf?ing them about, and once more placed
his left foot upon the stool. I
Anson chuckled with delight, and turned to West.


## p. 23 (#31) ##############################################

BLACK INNOCENTS. 23

But this act on the part of the black was too
much for the chief searcher's composure.
"Up with the black scoundrel's foot!" he roared,
and his assistant seized the black's ankle, and gave it
such a vigorous hoist that the man's equilibrium was
upset, so that, though the foot was planted ?rmly on
the stool, he fell over backwards, leaving his support
upon the stool, where it was probed by the searchers,
who were not at all surprised to ?nd a large stone
hidden between the little and the next toe.
"There's a blackguardl" cried Anson excitedly,
turning to his companions. "He ought to be well
?ogged, and no mistake. 'VVell, I neverl"
The last words were uttered in disgust at the
man's behaviour, for he burst into a hearty laugh as if
thoroughly enjoying the discovery, professing at the
same time to be utterly astonished.
"How come there?" he cried. "'Tick 'tween um
toe—so."
He illustrated "so" by} stamping his foot down
over and over again and raising it up, the last time
cleverly picking an ordinary pebble from the ground
with his toes, and holding it out as easily as if he
had used his ?ngers and thumb.
But his action had no effect upon those around,
who were well used to the Kaf?rs' tricks, and re-
ceived everything with the grimmest of looks as they
passed their prisoner along for punishment, and ?nally

ordered forward the last man. This prisoner took \Vcst's
attention from the ?rst, for he was a well-built, keenly
intelligent-looking fellow, who seemed quite awake to
his position and behaved throughout with a calm air
of conscious innocence.
It struck West, too, that the Kaf?r kept on gazing
very hard at Anson, as if attracted by his gently-
smiling, innocent-looking face, and as if he were
silently pleading to the most amiable-looking personage
of the party to intercede for him and save him from
punishment.
Anson, however, did not appear to notice the
man's eager looks, being too much interested in the
search for illicitly-acquired stones, and eagerly watching
every phase of the proceedings, his eyes sparkling
and cheeks ?ushed with pink at every fresh discovery,
while he rubbed his hands and looked from one to
the other with all the pleasure of some big, fat,
stupid child.
"Now then," cried the chief searcher roughly;
"come along."
The Kaf?r quietly submitted to the rough handling
he experienced in being forced up to the stool, and,
anticipating the order, he opened his mouth; but the
under-searcher roughly told him to "shut up," and
he closed his ?ne white teeth with an audible snap,
while the search was commenced at his feet, the toes
being carefully examined without result.

BLACK INNOCEN'TS. 25

Then his closely-knotted hair, which looked as if
it would have made, if he were scalped, good trim-
mings of astrachan wool for the collar and cuffs of
an English gentleman's overcoat, was carefully searched
by well-trained ?ngers; the ears were probed and in-
spected; nostrils searched and given a ?nal wring be-
tween thumb and ?nger as if he were being insulted
in old-fashioned style by pulling his nose; and lastly, his
cheeks were felt outside and in, and the searchers,
who looked puzzled, made the black kneel down and
remain for some time in that position, with his mouth
wide open and head thrown back so that the sun
shone right into his great mouth.
"He's all right!" said Anson. enthusiastically.
"You've got the wrong pig by the ear this time. I
thought this fellow looked honest."
The Kaf?r darted a grateful look at the speaker,
which told plainly enough that he comprehended the
words, and Anson replied with a smile.
"Ah, you ought to be on this job, Mr. Anson,"
said the chief searcher sarcastically. "You'd be in-
valuable here."
Anson laughed good-humouredly.
"You're bantering," he said; "I know. ButI
should like it, and I fancy I could ?nd the diamonds
quickly enough if a man had hidden any."
"Find them then now," said the man who had
spoken. "Come on."

There was a general laugh here, in which Anson
joined.
"Nay," he said good-humouredly; "get another
subject who has some hidden. That chap has none,
unless he has swallowed some."
"What would you do then, squire?" said the
man. "Shoot him, and make a [Sosl-morlem exam?"
"Ugh! horrid!" cried Anson, with a look of the
most intense disgust. "But I say, I mean it. Fetch
another chap, and let me examine him. I should like
to, really."
"Why don't you search this one?" said Ingle-
borough contemptuously, and "Test laughed.
Anson winced and turned upon them half-angrily.
But he changed his manner before he had ?nished
speaking, and his face broke up into a broad smile.
"Because I don't want to be laughed at by you
chaps and called a fool," he said. "I'm not stupid
enough as it is to believe he has any diamonds
hidden."
"Well, I am," said Ingleborough coolly.
"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Anson mockingly. "'You
go on with the search then, and ?nd them."
"There is no need," said Ingleborough coldly;
"those two know what they're about."
He was wrong in saying "two," for the under-
searcher now continued the examination, and Anson's
eyes were screwed up and twinkled again upon seeing

the man give, up at the end of another two minutes
and shrug his shoulders.
"N0 go," he said, turning to his companion.
"Someone has been too clever here."
"Look again," said his chief.
"No: I shan't look any more. I've done."
West's eyes were resting upon the Kaf?r, and he
saw the man draw in a deep slow breath which made
his broad chest. expand, retaining the air for a minute
and then slowly ejecting it.
"Ah! you'll never make a ?rst-class searcher,
Jem," said the head man.
"I never did profess to be so smart as you are,"
retorted the other sharply.
"No, Jemmy, you never did," said his chief; "but
you ought to have found something here."
"Why, you don't think he has any about him, do
you?" cried the man, who was staggered by his chief's
cool, con?dent way of speaking.
"Yes, I do," said the chief, "and so does Mr. Ingle-
borough there. Don't you, sir?"
Ingleborough nodded shortly, and \Vest saw the
Kaf?r's eyes ?ash, while when he turned to Anson he
saw that his fellow-clerk's face looked cold and hard.
But Anson's aspect changed the next moment, as
soon as he saw he was observed, and he said, with a
broad grin: "Wish I was a betting man: I could easily
win half-a-crown or two over this".

But it struck \Vest that there was a ring of in-
sincerity in the tone of his voice, and the hard look
began to come like a grey shadow over his fat pink
cheeks as he saw the chief searcher go closer up to
the Kaf?r, bring his hands down heavily upon the
man's shoulders, and stand facing him and looking him
full in the eyes.
There was utter silence now. The Kaf?r stood
for a moment ?rmly gazing back into his white holder's
eyes; but it manifestly required a strong effort, and
West felt sure that he saw a quiver like a shadow of
dread run down the black, making his knees slightly
shake.
The whole thing was momentary, and the looker-
on could not feel sure. Then the searcher spoke.
"You're a clever one," he said, with a harsh laugh,
"and you don't mind hurting yourself to do a bit of
the illicit. Turn round."
He gave the Kaflir a sharp thrust with one hand,
a pull with the other, and the man stood with his back
to the lookers-on. i

HAT followed was performed with the quick
dexterity of a clever surgeon, the searcher
bending down, grasping the great ?rm muscles of the
Kaf?r's right leg about mid-way between hip and
knee, and pressing hard with his two thumbs, when
to the surprise of West a small perpendicular slit
opened and a good-sized diamond was forced out,
to fall upon the ground and be received by the under-
searcher, while the wound closed up again with all
the elasticity of a cut made in a piece of indiarubber. I
"Bravol" cried West, and then he held his breath
as he saw the clever manipulation performed upon the
Kaf?r's other leg, a. second diamond being forced out
of the man's elastic muscle, to be secured in turn.
"That will do," said the chief searcher, after a
quick glance down the Kaf?r's arms, the man scowling
and looking depressed as he was marched away.
"Almost a pity you didn't back your opinion heavily,
Mr. Anson, eh?" added the of?cial.

"\Vell, I am deceived," said Anson, wrinkling up
his forehead. "Who'd ever have thought of that?"
"The Kaf?rs, seemingly," said Ingleborough coolly"
and he smiled in Anson's disconsolate face.
"But it's wicked," cried Anson, "downright wicked
for a man to cut himself like that for the sake Ofa bit
of glittering glass. I say, mustn't it hurt very much?"
"Can't say," said West merrily. "Try!"
"What, me?" cried Anson, looking startled and
involuntarily thrusting his hands down to touch the
parts in question. "Oh no! It's horrible what people
will do for the sake of gain."
"Quite sure you wouldn't like to try, Mr. Anson?"
said the searcher. "I'll do it for you if you like. Only
wants a very Sharp knife and a good hard pinch to
numb the muscle; then it's done in a few minutes—-
one good cut, the stone pressed in, and the cold sur-
face makes the skin contract." '
Anson's face seemed to curdle up, and two creases
formed, one round each corner of his mouth, as if
putting it between parentheses, as he shook his head.
"Look here," he said, "what's the good of ban-
tering so? Are you going to search any more men?"
"No," said the Of?cial; "that's the lot."
"But are you going to punish them?"
"Oh yes! They'll have to take their dose for it,
sir; you may be sure of that. We're going to be
more and more severe over this illicit diamond-dealing."

"Are you?" said Anson innocently.
"\Ve just are. It'll be a shooting matter soon if
it can't be stopped otherwise."
"How horrid!" said Anson. "But I say, these
men don't deal illicitly, do they?" '
"They wouldn't if a set of scoundrels did not set .
them on to steal, so that they could buy of the poor
ignorant savages, giving them shillings for what they
sell for pounds."
"How sad it seems!" said Anson thoughtfully.
"And how innocent you seem!" said West,
laughing.
"Yes, it's charming," cried Ingleborough. "Why,
you know all about it."
"I?" cried Anson. "Oh, of course Iknow some-
thing about it. I've heard of the illicit diamond-deal-
ing, and read about it; but it has all gone in at one _
ear and out at the other. You see, I devote so much
time to music. That and my work at the of?ce keep
me from taking much notice of other things. Politics,
for instance, and the rumours of war. Do you think
it at all likely that there will be any ?ghting, West?"

"I can't say,' was the reply; "but we're going to
be perfectly ready for the Boers in case there is, and
it's quite time we were off, Ingleborough, if we intend
to answer at the roll-call."
"Hah! Yes," cried the young man addressed.
"Better come with us, Anson."

The latter shook his head, and his companions
separated from him at the gate.
"Better come," said Ingleborough again. "Join,
and then you'll be on the spot if we do form a
band."
"Oh no!" said Anson, smiling. "You make up
your minds at headquarters to form a band, and then,
if you like, I'll come and train it."
"He's a rum fellow," said \Vest, as the two young
men fell into step.
"Ah," said Ingleborough roughly, "I am afraid
Master Anson's'more R. than F." .
"More R. than R?" said West questioningly.
"If you must have it in plain English, more rogue
than fool."
"Well, I fancy he isn't quite so simple as he
pretends to be."
"Bah! I'm not a quarrelsome fellow, but I al-
ways feel as if I must kick him. He aggravates me."
"Nice soft sort of a fellow to kick," said West,
laughing.
"Ugh!" ejaculated Ingleborough, and his foot ?ew
out suddenly as if aimed at the person of whom they
spoke. "Don't know anything about diamonds! What
things people will do for the sake of a bit of glittering
glass! Look here, West, for all his talk I wouldn't
trust him with a consignment of stones any farther
than I could see him."

"Don't be prejudiced!" said West. "You don't
like him, and so you can only see his bad side."
"And that's all round," replied Ingleborough
laughing. "No; I don't like him. I never do like a
fellow who is an unnatural sort of a prig. He can't
help being fat and pink and smooth, but he can help
his smiling, sneaky manner. I do like a fellow to be
manly. Hang him! Put him in petticoats, with long
hair and a bonnet, he'd look like somebody's cook.
But ifI had an establishment and he was mine, I
should be afraid he'd put something unpleasant into
my soup."
"Never mind about old Anson," said West mer-
rily, "but look here. What about that illicit diamond-
buying? Do you think that there's much of it taking
place?"
"Much?" cried his companion. "It is tremendous.
The company's losing hundreds of thousands of pounds
yearly."
" Nonsense l "
"It's a fact," said Ingleborough earnestly; "and
no end of people are hard at work buying stolen
diamonds, in spite of the constant sharp look-out kept
by the police."
"But I should have thought that the licences and
the strict supervision would have checked the greater
part of it."
"Then you'd have thought wrong, my boy. I wish

it did, for as we are going on now it makes everyone
suspicious and on the look-out. I declare that for
months past I never meet any of our people without
fancying they suspect me of buying and selling dia-
monds on the sly."
"And that makes you suspicious too," said West
quietly.
Ingleborough turned upon him sharply, and looked
him through and through.
"What made you say that?" he said at last.
"Previous conversation," replied West.
"Humph! Well, perhaps so."

' CHAPTER IV.
RUMOURS OF WAR.
THE Diamond Fields Horse had drilled one evening
till they were tired, and after it was all over,
including a fair amount of ?ring, the smell of blank
cartridges began to give way to the more pleasant
odour Of tobacco smoke, the of?cers lighting their
cigars, and the privates ?lling up their pipes to incense
the crisp evening air.
"I'm about tired Of this game," said one ofa
group who were chatting together; "there's too much
hard work about it."
"Yes," said another. "Someone told me it was
playing at soldiers. I don't see where the play comes."
"Look at the honour of it," said another. "We
shall be defending the town directly from an attack
by the Boers."
There was a burst Of laughter at this, and when
it ended the ?rst speaker broke out contemptuously
with: "The Boers! We shall have to wait a. long time
before they attack us."

"I don't know so much about that," said the man
who had spoken of the attack. "I believe they mean
mischief."
"B0sh!" came in chorus.
"Ah, you may laugh, but they've got Majuba Hill
on the brain. The idiots think they fought and thrashed
the whole British Army instead of a few hundred men.
Here, Ingleborough, you heard what was said?"
The young man addressed left off chatting with
\Vest and nodded. .
"You went to Pretoria with the superintendent of
police about that diamond case, and you were there
a couple of months."
"Yes," said Ingleborough. "\Vhat of that?"
"Why, you must have seen a good deal of the
Boers then!"
"Of course I did."
"Well, what do you say? Will they ?ght if it
comes to a row?"
"Certainly they will!" replied Ingleborough.
There was a derisive laugh at his words, and
West ?ushed a little on hearing it, as the volunteers
gathered round.
"Bah! It's all bluff!" cried a voice. "They know
that by holding out they can get what they want.
They'd cave in directly if we showed a bold front."
"Moral," said West; "Show a bold front."
"That's what we're doing," said one of the men;

RUMOURS OF \VAR. 37
"but there's too much of it. Some of the of?cers
have war on the brain, and want to force the soldier-
ing element to the very front. We've done enough
to show the Doppers that we should ?ght if there was
any occasion. There was no drilling going on when
you were at Pretoria, eh, Ingleborough?"
"Yes, there was, a good deal," said the young
man slowly. "They did not make any fuss, but in a
quiet way they 'were hard at work, especially with
their gun drill."
"Gun drill!" cried one of the group contemptu-
ously. "What, with a few rusty old cannon and some
wooden quakers?"
There was a roar of laughter at this, and West
coloured a little more deeply with annoyance, but
Ingleborough shrugged his shoulders, turned his little
?nger into a tobacco-stopper, and went on smoking.
"The Boers are puffed up with conceit," he said
gravely, "and they believe that their victory at Majuba
Hill has made them invincible; but all the same they've
got some level-headed men amongst them, and I believe
before long that it will come to a ?ght and that they
will ?ght desperately."
His hearers laughed.
"What for?" shouted one.
"To drive the British out of South Africa, seize
Cape Colony and Natal, and make the country a Dutch
republic."

There was a momentary silence before someone
cried: "I say, Ingleborough, are you going mad?"
"I hope not," said the young man quietly.
"\Vhy?"
"Because you 'are talking the greatest bosh I've
heard for monthsl"
"I don't think I am," said Ingleborough gravely.
"I know that the Boers are terribly in?ated with vanity
and belief in themselves, but they have wisdom in
their heads as well."
"I've never seen any of itl" said the previous
speaker. "Bahl Rubbish! They drive us out of South
Africa! Why, that would mean taking Rhodesia too."
"Of course," replied Ingleborough, "and that's
what they believe they are going to do."
"With popguns?"
"No," said Ingleborough gravely; "but with their
ri?es. Do you know that they can at any time arm
a hundred thousand men with the best magazine-ri?es
in the world?"
"Nol" came in chorus. "We don't."
"And that they have a magni?cent force of ar-
tillery, which includes such guns as would dwarf any
that we could bring against them, thoroughly out-
,range ours, and that in addition they have a great
number of repeating-cannon—Maxims and Nordenfelts?
Above all, they have a vast supply of ammunition."
"\Vhere did they get it from?" cried one.

"The moon," shouted another, and there was a
roar. '
"The fellow's a regular Boer himself," shouted a
man behind; and there was a hiss raised, followed by
a menacing groan, which made \Nest's blood tingle as
he closed up to his friend's side.
- "The old story," said Ingleborough contemptuously. .
"You can't bear the honest truth."
"Yes, we can," cried one of the men; "but we
can't bear lies. Do you think we are fools to believe
your cock-and-bull stories about magazine-ri?es and
guns that would dwarf all that the British Army could
bring up against the Boers?"
"You can do as you like about believing," said
Ingleborough coldly. "I have only told you whatI
learned for myself when I was staying in Pretoria." '
"And do you mean to tell us that the Boers have
guns like that?"
"I do," said Ingleborough.
"Then where did they get them?"
"From the great French and German makers.
From Creusot and Krupp."
"And how did they get them up to Pretoria?"
"From the Cape and Delagoa Bay."
"What nonsense!" cried another voice. "Their
arms and ammunition would have been stopped at
once. What do you say to that?"
"The Boers are slim," said Ingleborough. "Hun-

dreds Of tons of war material have been going up
country for years as ironmongery goods and machinery.
They have a tremendous arsenal there, and they mean
to ?ght, as you'll see before long."
The hissing and threatening sounds ceased, for
there was so much conviction in the tone adopted by
the speaker that his hearers began to feel uneasy and
as if there might be something in the declarations,
while, upon Ingleborough turning to \Vest with: "Come
Oliver, let's get home!" the little crowd of volunteers
hedged the pair in, and the man who had been the
most ready to laugh laid a hand upon his arm.
"Hold hard a minute," he cried frankly. "I felt
ready to laugh at you and chaff all your words; but
I'm not going to be a dunder-headed fool and shut
my eyes to danger if there really is any. Look here,
Ingleborough: are you an alarmist, or is there really
any truth in what you have said?"
"It is all true," replied the young man calmly.
"Well, then, I for one will believe you, my lad;
for, 'now you have spoken out as you have, I begin
to put that and that together and I feel that the Boers
have been playing dark."
"They have been playing dark," said Ingleborough
warmly, "and I Should not be surprised to hear any
day that they had declared war and found us anything
but prepared."
"They only want to be free," said a voice.


## p. 41 (#49) ##############################################

RUMOURS OF WAR. 4 I
"Free?" cried Ingleborough. "Yes, free to do
exactly what they please: to tax every stranger, or
outlander, as they call us, for their own bene?t: to
rob and enslave the unfortunate natives, and even
murder them if it suits their hand. Free? Yes, look
at their history from the ?rst. Why, their whole
history has been a course of taking land from the
original owners by force."
That very night rumours reached Kimberley which
sent a tingle into the cheeks of every man who had
iOined in the demonstration against Ingleborough:
though the greatest news of all had not yet arrived,
that the Transvaal Government had thrown down the
glove and made the advance.

CHAPTER V.
AN UGLY CHARGE.
S everyone knows, the declaration of war was not
long in coming, and the news came like a thunder-
elap to all in Kimberley, where those who had been
in doubt as to the wisdom of the preparations previ-
ously made were the loudest in ?nding fault because
more had not been done.
"But do you think it's true, Ingle?" said West.
"Think what is true?"
"That the Boers have invaded Natal."
"I'm sure it is," was the reply; "and before very
long we shall have them here."
"Why should they come here?" said West.
"Because they have plenty of gold at Johannes-
burg, and they want to utilise it for settings to our
diamonds, rny lad. They're a nice, modest, amiable
people, these Boers, with very shrewd eyes for the
main chance. They'll soon be down here to take
possession, so if you feel at all uncomfortable you had
better be off south."


## p. 43 (#51) ##############################################

"Is that what you are going to do?" asked \Vest
quietly. _
"I? Of course not! I shall keep with the volun-
teers."
"Of course," said \Vest; "and I shall too."
Ingleborough smiled grimly and went on with his
work, West following suit, and they were busy enough
till "tif?n"-time that morning.
Their "tif?n" went on as usual; but out in the
town there was a buzz of excitement which resembled
that heard in a beehive when some mischievous boy
has thrust in a switch and given it a good twist round
before running for his life.
So eager and excited did everyone seem that
West could hardly tear himself away from the main
street, which was full of talking groups, everyone
seeming to be asking the same question—"What is to
be done ?rst?"—but getting no reply.
"We ought to fortify the place," said West to
himself, and full of this idea, which he intended to
propound to Ingleborough and Anson as soon as he
reached the of?ce, he hurried in that direction, all the
faster from the fact that he had been so interested in
the busy state of the streets that he had overstayed
his time.
On approaching the of?ce door the conscious blood
rose to his checks, for he could hear an angry voice
speaking, upon which he could only place one inter-

pretation—namely, that one of the principals was ?nd-
ing fault severely because he, the guilty one, was not
back to his time.
"\Vhat a fool I am!" muttered \Vest. Then,
pulling himself together, he stepped forward, muttering
again: "Must take my dose like a man."
. The next moment he had opened the door quickly,
entered and closed it, and then stood staring in wonder
at the scene before him.
For there was no angry principal present—only
his two fellow-clerks: Ingleborough stern and frowning,
and Anson with his ordinarily pink face turned to a
sallow white, and, instead of being plump and rounded,
looking sunken and strange.
"What's the matter?" said \Vest, for Anson, who
had the moment before been talking rapidly, suddenly
ceased. "You're not quarrelling, are you?" he con-
tinued, for no one replied. "Oh well, I'll be off till
you've done."
"No, don't go," cried Anson, springing forward
and grasping his arm.
"Let go!" cried \Vest. "I don't want to be mixed
up with any quarrels; but you might have got them
over outside. There, I'm off."
"Stop where you arel" cried Ingleborough. "You
have a perfect right to hear what I have said, and
you're welcome."
"Yes, stop where you are, West," cried Anson,

clinging to the young fellow's arm. "I believe that
the war scare has sent Ingle off his head. You never
heard such a bit of scandal as he is trying to hatch
up. I believe it's all out of jealousy."
"No, you do not," said Ingleborough coldly.
"But I do," cried Anson. "It's scandalous. He's
trying to ruin me."
"How?"
"By hatching up a story which, if it got to the
principals' ears, would mean me being turned off neck
and crop, no matter how innocent I am."
"How what?" replied Ingleborough ironically.
"Innocent? Why, I've suspected you for some months
past." '
"Oh, my graciousl" cried Anson. "Hark at him!
He does mean it—he must mean it, unless we can
bring him to his senses, \/Vest. You will help me,
won't you?"
"How can I tell till I know what it's all about?
What's the quarrel, Ingle?"
"Ask him," answered the young man addressed,
frowning.
"Very well, then; I'll ask him. What's the row,
Anson?"
"I have hardly patience to tell you, \Vest," was
the reply. "But I suppose I must, though it makes
my face burn with shame."
" Humph ! " grunted Ingleborough.

"Then it is something you are ashamed of?" said
West quickly.
"Me? Oh no, West; I'm not ashamed. I've
nothing to be ashamed of: only being accused by a
fellow-clerk, a brother-clerk, I might say, of doing a
terrible thing."
"And did you?" said \Nest sharply.
"I? Good gracious, no! I was out in the main
street about half—an-hour ago, being of course inte-
rested in the news, when I saw a couple Of Kaf?rs
talking, and it made me wonder what would become
of them if it came to ?ghting, and I naturally enough
' asked the poor fellows whether they'd stay in Kimber-
ley or go back to their own country."
"Well?" said West, for the speaker stopped.
"Well, that's all as far as I'm concerned," said
Anson; "only just then Ingleborough, who is never
happy without he's mixing himself up somehow with
the police folk, and who must have been watching me
in a miserable underhanded way, suddenly pounced
upon me; and you'll never believe it, my dear \Vest,
he actually accused me of illicit diamond-buying from
the Kaf?rs."
"And that means very severe punishment," said
West. "Well, were you doing it?"
"Was 1? Oh, for shame, West! How could you
think such a thing possible? My dear fellow, I couldn't
do such a thing? Is it likely?"


## p. 47 (#55) ##############################################

"Ingleborough says it is," replied the young man
addressed, shortly.
"Yes, but only because he is absurdly jealous of
me, and dislikes to see me in the of?ce. It would
ruin me for ever if it were reported, and he says he
is going to, although I have been begging and praying
him not to do such a thing. What do you say?"
"If it's true, and Ingleborough says it is, I don't
see how he could help reporting your conduct to the
directors."
"But it isn't true!" cried Anson, almost in a whine.
"Oh, West, how can you? You know I couldn't do
such a thing!"
"Do you mean to say that you are quite inno-
cent?"
"Oh, quitel" cried Anson. "It was as I told you.
I only asked the two poor hard-working fellows what
they meant to do, and then to my utter astonishment
Ingleborough pounced upon me with that terrible charge.
Help me, my dear friend, to make him see that he
has deceived himself !"
"Do you hear, Ingle.> " cried West sympathetically.
"It is a terrible charge to bring against a fellow."
"Terrible!" said Ingleborough sternly.
"And you have thought what it means?"
"Of course."
"His dismissal and imprisonment?"
"Yes."

"But—-—"
"There is no room for buts, my lad," said Ingle-
borough harshly. "Diamond-buying from the natives
is, as we all well know, penal; and we know, too,
that it is our duty to help to protect the property of
our employers, and to see that the laws are obeyed."
"Of course, my dear Ingleborough," said Anson;
"and that's what I have always tried to do, as you
know."
"I know that you have been playing a false game
for months—that is, I feel perfectly sure you have,
though I cannot prove it. But this I can prove: that
you were buying stolen diamonds from two natives this
afternoon, all parties choosing the time because you
believed the excitement would secure you from notice."
"Oh, \Vest, hark at him!" cried Anson, in a
piteous tone. "Ingleborough, you don't know how
wrong you are!"
"That's truel" said their fellow-clerk.
"Look here, Anson,"
cried \\'est angrily; "what's
the good of going on like a great girl—oh-ing, and
making weak appeals? \Vhy don't you speak out like
a man? Is it true, or is it not, that you bought these
diamonds?"
"It's all a mistake of Ingleborough's and as false
as false can be! I couldn't do such a thing!"
"Nor yet throw them away as soon as you found
that you were seen?"

"Of course not!" cried Anson excitedly.
"What are these, then?" cried Ingleborough sternly,
as he took a couple of rough crystals from his trousers
pocket and held them out in his hand to the astonished
gaze of his comrades.
"Those?" said Anson, whose face began to turn
of a sickly green; "they look like diamonds."
"Yes: they are the two that you threw away, and
which I went and picked up."
"Oh!" cried Anson, with a piteous groan; "hark
at him, West! I wouldn't have believed that a man
could have been so base as to hatch up such a plot
as this to ruin his brother-employé. West, I assure
you that I never set eyes upon those diamonds before
in my life. It's all a cruel, dastardly plot, and I—-
Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! Is it possible that a
man can be so base?"
He took out his handkerchief and applied it to
his eyes, uttering a low piteous groan the while.
"You hear this, Ingleborough?" said West.
"Yes, I hear," said Ingleborough sourly, as he
thrust the gems back in his pocket. "So do you, and
you know now what it is my duty to do."
West was silent.
"Oh, do speak and help me!" cried Anson.
"Don't stand by and see me ruined, \Vest! You know
how he has taken up lately with the new superinten-
dent of police, and been always with him, and watch-

ing the poor natives till he is half a detective himself,
and goes about suspecting innocent people. I am in-
nocent, West, and it's all a horrible mistake of his, or
a cruel trick to ruin me; and I'm afraid I've been
mistaken in him altogether, and that it is a wicked
conspiracy."
"Ingleborough wouldn't do a mean thing!" said
West warmly.
"That's what I want to believe," whined Anson;
"but he's got hold of two diamonds, and he's going
to charge me with buying them, and he'll get mesent
to Cape Town breakwater."
"Not if you are innocent!" said West.
"Well, that's what I am, and he can't prove that
I've any of the precious stones about me. Come and
search me if you like!"
"You will be searched by the police authorities,"
said Ingleborough sternly.
"Whatl—Oh, it's abominable!" cried Anson.
"Here, West, aren't you going to do anything to help
an innocent man?"
"What can I do," said West, "but look on? I'll
tell you this, though: I don't believe it possible of you!
There must be some mistake!"
"Thank you for nothing," cried Anson bitterly.
"It's the old story—and you call yourself a friend!
Well, I'm not going to be bullied. I've given you
both a chance to own that you are all wrong; but

you always were both Of you dead against me. I'll
do now what I ought to have done at once—go to
the principals. I shall get justice there."
Saying this, he clapped on his hat, giving it a
?erce cock on, one side, passed out, and banged the
door after him.
Ingleborough paid no heed to his companion's
enquiring look, but crossed quickly to the window and
looked out.
"Anson thinks he is going to make a bolt," said
Ingleborough, half to himself; "but he'll soon ?nd out
his mistake." '
"How?" said West eagerly.
"Norton is outside with a couple of the police,"
Ingleborough replied.
"But this is very horrible!" cried \Vcst. "Once
more, are you quite sure that you have not made a
mistake?"
"Quite! I am certain!"
"But is it wise to be so certain?"
"Yes," replied Ingleborough quietly. "Surely I
can believe my own eyes!"
"But might he not have been questioning the
Kaf?rs, as he said?"
"Certainly," replied Ingleborough, with a grim
smile; "but I do not see why he should receive two
diamonds from them and give them money in exchange,
and lastly why he should ?ick the two diamonds away

into the dust as soon as he caught sight of me. Do
you?"
"No," said West thoughtfully. "Well, I am very
sorry. \Vhat will be the next proceeding?"
" The next thing in an ordinary way would be that
the scoundrel would bolt; but, as he must have found
out by this time that he is carefully watched, he will
no doubt go straight to the principals and brave it
out by telling them his own tale and trying to per-
suade them that I have hatched up a conspiracy
against him."
"And of course he will not be believed," replied
West thoughtfully; "for it is next door to high treason
for anyone to be found buying diamonds illicitly from
the natives."
"High treason?" cried Ingleborough, laughing.
"Why, my dear boy, it's much worse than regieide.
The authorities in Kimberley look upon diamond
smuggling 0r stealing as the blackest crime in the
calendar."
"Hallo!" cried West just then. "So soon?"
For there was a sharp rap at the door, anda man
entered to announce that the principals of the great
company desired the presence of Ingleborough and
West directly.
"I don't see why they want me!" said West. "I
know nothing about the matter."
"You'll have to go all the same," said Ingle-

borough. "He has dragged your name into the case,
and he trusts to you to speak in his behalf."
"And of course I shall," said West; "for I'm
horribly sorry for the poor fellow. He couldn't with-
stand the temptation to buy the diamonds for a mere
nothing and sell them at a heavy price."
"I don't want to be malicious, Noll," said Ingle-
borough; "but I've for some time been under the im-
pression that Master Anson was a humbug. There,
come along! Of course I don't like a piece of busi-
ness like this; but we must make rogues go to the
wall. You're too soft-hearted, Noll, my boy."
"Perhaps so," replied the lad; "but I'd rather be
so than too hard-hearted."

CHAPTER VI.
A VAIN SEARCH.
EST saw at once upon entering the presence of
the principals that things appeared bad for Anson,
who stood facing a table at which three of the direc-
tors of the great company were seated, all looking
very stern. They signed to Ingleborough and West
to stand upon their right—Anson was facing them to
the left.
Then there was a brief colloquy in a low tone
between the three directors, ending in one of them
saying aloud: "You speak."
The gentleman thus addressed turned to Ingle-
borough.
"Mr. Anson has sought this interview with the
directors, Mr. Ingleborough, to inform us that you
have made up a malicious tale about his having
been engaged in illicit diamond-buying. Of course,
if you could prove such a charge, it was your duty
to inform us."


## p. 55 (#63) ##############################################

A VAIN SEARCH. 55
"Of course, sir," replied Ingleborough; "but,
though I have for some time suspected him, this affair
only occurred during our tif?n-time this morning, and
as soon as we returned to the of?ce I felt bound to
accuse him as my fellow-clerk, and tell him what I
intended to do."
"So as to give him, if guilty, a good chance to
conceal the diamonds or escape?"
"Oh no, sir," said Ingleborough quietly. "I took
proper precautions against that."
"Indeed?" said the director. "\Vhat did you do?"
"Mr. Superintendent Norton is a friend of mine,
sir, and I went to him at once. He and two of his
keenest men have been carefully watching Anson ever
since." '_
"Humph! Quite right," said the director, and he
glanced at Anson, who was smiling contemptuously
then; but \/Vest had seen him wince sharply when
Ingleborough mentioned the superintendent's name.
"Well," continued the director, "let us hear your version
of this business." '
"Really, gentlemen," cried Anson, "I ought to have
the assistance of a law of?cer and~———"
"Stop, Mr. Anson," said the director sharply;
"we have heard you all through. Have the goodness
to be silent now while Mr. Ingleborough gives us his
statement."
"But legal assistance, sir."


## p. 56 (#64) ##############################################

56 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"You can have as much as you like, sir, as soon
as the matter is brought before the magistrates. We
must ?rst Of all hear what Mr. Ingleborough has to
say. Now, sir, have the goodness to tell us everything
you know about this business."
Ingleborough made his statement perfectly clearly,
and it was listened to in silence, and the diamonds were
produced.
Afterwards the three directors spoke together in a
low tone of voice for a few minutes, ending by turning
to Anson to tell him that he must consider himself for
the present as suspended from all further duty in con-
nection with the company's business.
"We have no desire to proceed to extremities,
Mr. Anson," he said in conclusion, "and every oppor-
tunity will be given you to clear yourself; but in the
meantime you must consider yourself under supervision,
and your lodgings will be searched."
"I protest, Sir," cried the young man warmly.
"You have no right to order such a thing to be done
without magisterial authority."
"Then we will assume the right, Mr. Anson, as it
is a question of our property being stolen by our black
employés and ?nding a purchaser in one Of our clerks.
Mr. West, as the superintendent is keeping an eye upon
Anson, I presume he is here?"
"I passed him at the door as I came in, sir,"
answered West.


## p. 57 (#65) ##############################################

A VAIN SEARCH. 57.
"Have the goodness to call him in." _
Anson winced; but he faced the tall stern-looking
of?cer of police as he entered and heard the reason
for his being called in.
"Then you wish a search to be made, gentlemen?"
said the superintendent.
"Certainly."
"Look here," cried Anson ?ercely; "there's law
for everybody. I'm not your servant any longer, for
I refuse to stay with such a pack of tyrannical dividend-
making scoundrels."
"That will do," growled the superintendent, in a
low, deep voice. "Keep a civil tongue in your head.
You'll do no good for yourself by this."
"You mind your own business," cried Anson, turning
upon the of?cer so ?ercely that West wondered at the
change in his fellow-clerk's manner.
"All right: I will," said the of?cer, seizing him
sharply.
"Here, what are you going to do?" cried Anson,
in alarm.
"Search you, my lad," was the reply.
"Then I call everyone present to witness that this
is illegal. I'm not going to stand quietly by and be
treated like a worm."
"Leave off wriggling, then," said the of?cer.
"I won't. I refuse to be treated like one of the
black labourers."


## p. 58 (#66) ##############################################

i 58 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Look here, sir," said the of?cer sternly; "I don't
want to treat you like a Kaf?r unless you behave like
one. You are charged with illicit buying, and your
game's up;' so the best thing you can do is to produce
everything you have on you and have done with the
matter."
"Search me if you dare," cried Anson, still keeping
up his de?ant manner.
"Right: I dare," said the of?cer. "Mr. Ingleborough,
be ready to lend a hand if I want it."
"If john Ingleborough dares to lay a hand on me
I'll send a bullet through him."
In an instant Ingleborough's hand came down
heavily upon Anson's shoulder and gripped him fast.
"Never mind him, Norton. It's all bluff. He is
unarmed."
"Armed or unarmed," said the superintendent,
"I'm going to search him," and directly after a quick
pair of hands were busy going through the suspect's
pockets.
"Urrrl" he growled, showing his white teeth be-
tween his thick red lips, as he cast off thoroughly the
mask of servile humility he had previously worn; "it's
lucky for you that I am unarmed. But search away.
Go on. I'll have heavy damages for this dastardly
assault and defamation of character, and the public
shall know all about the games carried on by this
beautiful diamond syndicate. Curse you all—masters

and men! You shall pay for it, and, as for you, John
Ingleborough, look out for yourself. Yes, and you
too, Oliver West, you miserable sneak. I always hated
you."
"Hadn't you better save your breath, Anson?"
said West quietly. "You're only making everybody
believe you guilty."
"Let 'em," cried the suspect, whose plump round
face was now distorted with impotent rage. "I'll be
even with all of you for this."
"Humph! Nothing in his pockets; nothing sewn
in the seams of his clothes, nor in the band of his
trousers," muttered the searcher. Then aloud: "Now
then, hold up l" I
Anson behaved like a horse,' or, as West and
Ingleborough afterwards laughingly said, like an ass,
lifting to order each foot in turn for the bottoms of
his trousers to be examined and the heels of his boots,
which had not been bored nor plugged.
"He has nothing upon him, gentlemen," said the
of?cer, at last. ,
"But you have not thoroughly searched him," said
one of the directors, frowning.
1!
"Oh yes, sir, replied the of?cer; "a party like
this wouldn't carry diamonds about him same as a Kaf?r
would. He wouldn't play any tricks with his person
by slitting or swallowing: he knows too much about
the risks. You can be perfectly satis?ed that he has

nothing about him. I was, as soon as I had turned
out his pockets."
"They'll be satis?ed before they've done," sneered
Anson.
"I should like to see his desk and stool in the
Of?ce where he has worked, gentlemen," continued the
of?cer.
"Yah!" snarled Anson. "Yes: go on; search
everywhere. Perhaps you'd like to search the place
where I lodge?"
"Afterwards," said the of?cer quietly.

EST saw his fellow-clerk wince slightly again,
though it passed unnoticed by the others, and
directly after the whole party adjourned tO the of?ce,
the superintendent's men following them, and, without
doing anything to excite attention, forming a guard at
the door.
"There's nothing here," said the superintendent in
a low tone to Ingleborough and West.
"How do you know?" said the former.
"By his manner. He's all brag and bounce!"
"Yes," said Ingleborough; "but you don't know
your man."
"Look here!" cried Anson; "none of that! Search
if you like, but no plotting and planning there! I don't
see why they shouldn't be charged too. Search their
desks as well as mine. Perhaps you'll ?nd some illicit
diamonds there."
West started, for a strange suspicion shot through
his breast.


## p. 62 (#70) ##############################################

62 A DASH FROM DIAMOND Cl'l'Y.
"If you do they'll swear I put 'em there, and the
superintendent will believe them."
"You scoundrel!" cried West passionately, and
Anson uttered a low sncering laugh; but his face grew
set directly, as the of?cer turned upon him.
"Which is your desk, sir?" he said sharply.
"Search them all!" was the reply.
"Which is his desk?" said the superintendent to
West now.
The young man made no reply, and Ingleborough
pointed it out.
"Friends and brother-workers!" said Anson, in
a sneering manner. "Look here, noble employers,
play fair! Let's have all the desks and the Whole
place searched."
No one spoke, and after a cursory examination of
the tall stool in front of the desk the of?cer picked up
a thick silver-mounted rattan cane thrust in a stand
by the side of the desk in company with three um-
brellas.
"Yours?" he said, turning to the suspect.
"Yes, and one of the umbrellas too. The worst
one's mine. That dandy silk one is West's. The handles
of all three are sure to unscrew and are hollowed out
to :hold diamonds, no doubt."
"Of course," said the of?cer, and after a glance
at the umbrellas he turned the thick heavy cane over
in his hands, noticing that in addition to a silver cap


## p. 63 (#71) ##############################################

anson REBOUNDS. 63
there was a thick silver ring about six inches from
the top.
"Oh yes, that's hollow too," cried Anson mock-
ingly, "and stuffed full of diamonds, I daresay.——Ah!
mind you don't cut your ?ngers!"
For the of?cer, as he held the thick cane in both
hands, tried to unscrew the top part, thickest by the
ring, and, after yielding a little, he gave it a sharp
tug, drawing out about a foot of a bright blue damas-
cened sword, and then thrusting it back with an
impatient "Fish!"
)7
"A sword-stick, said the of?cer.
"Well, why not?" cried Anson. "I don't carry a
revolver."
The of?cer thrust the cane into the stand, and
then, with Anson watching him keenly, raised the lid
of the broad ?at desk, turned over some books and
papers, measured its depth outside and in to make
sure that there was no false bottom, and then brought
out the clerk's little ?at mahogany box, Anson grinning
sneeringly as the lid was opened and the joints of the
?ute lay exposed to view. .
"Now you've got 'em, sirl" cried Anson, With a
mocking laugh. "Blow through them, and you'll find
it's all wind."
The superintendent turned the box upside doWn,
and the joints were left upon the top of the desk,
except that the top joint with its gaping mouth-hole

stuck in the velvet ?tting, but looked the most hollow
of the set.
"There's nothing here, gentlemen," said the of?-
cer, replacing the other joints and gravely closing
the desk.
"Oh, nonsense!" cried Anson, jeering. "You
haven't half looked. Perhaps, though, young W'est has
the whole swag in his desk."
"Would you like to examine the other desks,
gentlemen?" said the of?cer.
"N o, certainly not," said the leading director sharply;
"we have no wish to insult our employés."
)
"Only one,' snarled Anson. "Do you call this
fair play?"
\Nest drew a breath full of relief, and glanced at
Ingleborough, who made no sign, but stood looking
stolidly at the of?cer.
"I'm quite satis?ed, gentlemen," said the latter.
"There is nothing here. Do you charge Mr. Anson
with illicit dealing?"
"You have not searched his apartments yet," said
the chief director. "We wish to} have further proofs
?rst."
Anson opened his mouth a short distance as his
chief spoke, and closed it again with a sharp little
snap.
"You wish the prisoner's rooms to be searched
then, gentlemen?" '


## p. 65 (#73) ##############################################

ANSON REBOUNDS. 65
"I'm not a prisoner," cried Anson angrily. "I've
neither been charged nor taken into custody."
"Certainly!" said the director sternly. "Search
Mr. Anson's rooms preliminary to his being charged
and taken into custody. Mr. West, go in front with
the superintendent to show the way. I do not wish to
make a procession, to create excitement and make us
the observed of all."
"I understand, sir. Mr. Anson will walk in ad-
vance with me, and you can follow as you please.
There is no need for Mr. West to walk with us. I
know the way!"
"Of course!" snarled Anson. "Mr. Ingleborough's
doing, I suppose. Then I have been watched."
"Yes, my doing," said the person named. "As
soon as I suspected you of illicit dealing Ikept an eye
upon you and told Mr. Norton here what I thought."
"Cowardly, sneaking cur!" cried Anson,_ grinding
his teeth.
"No, sir," cried the director sternly: "faithful ser-
vant of the company."
"Where are your proofs that I am not?" cried
Anson ?ercely.
"Not found yet," said the Of?cer; "but with all
your cunning I daresay we shall trace them."
"Go on," said Anson. "I'm ready for you."
The next minute the whole party were straggling
through the camp-like town towards the outskirts, to

gather together at the very ordinary shed-like house of
mud wall and ?uted corrugated-iron roo?ng, where the
wife of one of the men at the mine stared in wonder
at the party, and then looked in awe at her lodger,
her eyes very wide open and startled as she grasped
what the visit meant.
"Oh, Mr. Anson, what have you been a-doing of?"
she cried, and burst into tears.
West looked at the poor woman with a feeling of
pity, and then felt disposed to kick Anson for his
brutality, for the clerk's gesture was that of an ill-
tcmpered cur: he literally snapped at her.
"Out of the way, you idiot!" he cried, "and let
this police-constable and his party come by."
West saw the directors exchange glances before
following the superintendent into the little house, leaving
the two clerks to the last, the police-constables re-
maining watchfully at the door. ,
"Master Anson is regularly cutting the ground from
under him, Ingle," said West softly.
"Yes: the fool! I take it to be a tacit confession.
You don't think I've made a mistake now?"
West shook his head and looked distressed, but
said nothing.
"Of course he'll never come back to us, and he
knows it, or he'd never put on this de?ant manner.
Hark at him!"
For at that moment the object of their thoughts

shouted loudly: "Here, you two spies, what are you
waiting behind for? Come in and help search the
place."
West frowned and hung back, but Ingleborough
laid a hand on his shoulder. ,
"Come along," he said; "you must help me to
see it through! It isn't pleasant, but it's part of one's
duty."
The next minute they were in Anson's combined
bed and sitting room, a very ordinary-looking place,
with the simplest of furniture and plenty of suggestions
all round of spots where an ingenious man might have
hidden a little fortune in diamonds; for the mud walls
were lined with matchboard, the ceiling was of the same
material, and then there was the ?oor, where in any
part a board could have been lifted and a receptacle
made for the precious crystals, without counting the
articles of furniture, including the bedding.
"I'm sorry I have no more chairs, gentlemen," said
the tenant banteringly. "Sit on the table, and three of
you can make a sofa of the bed. Never mind tumbling
it! You'll do nothing compared to Mr. Superintendent
Norton when he begins. I say, though, you should
have given me notice of all this, and then I'd have
had a carpenter here to skin the walls and ceiling so
as to have made everything nice and easy for you. I
say, Mr. Norton, you'll want a pickaxe and shovel
directly, won't you?"

The directors had paid no heed to the speaker's
bantering remarks, but the superintendent was getting
hot, tired, and annoyed by the constant chatter of the
man he was longing to arrest; and, though he had
treated everything so far with calm indifference, his
lack of success in his search for something incriminating
in such places as experience had taught him were in
favour with those who carried on diamond smuggling
began now to tell upon his temper, and he turned
sharply upon the speaker: to snap out words which
showed that his thoughts ran on all fours with those
of Ingleborough.
"Look here, young man!" he said; "I don't know
whether you are aware of it, but you are hard at
work building up a black case against yourself, and if
you're not careful you'll ?nd yourself before long
working out your two years as a convict on the Cape
Town breakwater."
"I shall!" cried Anson. "\Vhat for? \Vhere's
your evidence? You've got a jumped-up cock-and-bull
story made by a fellow-clerk who says one thing while
I say another. You've only his word for it. You've
found no diamonds on me, and you've found none in
my lodgings."
"Not yet," said the superintendent meaningly.
"Oh, I see! Not yet! Go on, then, pray! I'm
not paid by time, so I can afford to lose a few hours.
Search away! Perhaps our clever friend Ingleborough

ANSON REBOUNDS. 69
can tell you where to look. Perhaps he wouldn't like
to, though. It would hurt his feelings to accuse a
brother-clerk of being an illicit trader. But don't mind
me, Ingle. It's good sport for you. Why don't you
help, and think you're a good little boy playing at
'hot boiled beans and very good butter' again?
Now then, Norton's going across to the other side.
You should call out 'colder' when he's going away
from the place, and 'warmer' when he gets nearer.
Then 'hot,' and last of .all 'burning.' Come, keep up
the game I"
"I should just like to ram that pair of clean socks
between your teeth, my ?ne fellow, and keep it there
with a leather strap," muttered the of?cer; and, as if
about to put his wish into practice, he stooped and
picked up the closely rolled-up pair of socks lying with
' some other articles of attire placed freshly washed upon
a shelf by Anson's landlady.
"Now then," cried Anson boisterously, "cry
'burning,' somebody: there must be some diamonds
inside that!" .
The directors frowned, and Ingleborough and West
looked on angrily as the of?cer dashed the soft woollen
ball back upon the heap and then went on with his
search for nearly an hour.
By this time the lookers-on were as much disgusted
as the superintendent.
"I'm very sorry, gentlemen," he cried; "but I can

do no more. There is nothing else to be done un-
less we have my men in and regularly strip the wood-
work down."
"011, pray have them in, then," cried Anson. "If
I were you I'd——"
"Silence, sirl" cried the chief director ?ercely, and
Anson stared. "\Ve have not the slightest doubt of
your guilt. Your conduct all through has proved it.
That will do, Mr. Norton."
"You think the evidence suf?cient to justify an
arrest, gentlemen?"
"'We will consult together," replied the director
who had just spoken, "and' communicate our decision
to you."
"What, aren't you satis?ed yet?" cried Anson
mockingly.
"Quite," replied his chief; "and of course, sir, your
post is vacant. For the present, Mr. Norton, you will
keep an eye upon this man, and see that he does not
leave the town."
"Unless I'm very much mistaken, sir," said the
superintendent, "neither our friend here nor anyone
else will leave Kimberley for some time to come."
"Is it so bad as that?" '
"Yes, sir. The Boers are gradually closing in, I
am told. But I'll keep an eye on Mr. Anson here all
the same."
Five minutes later the party were on their way

ANSON REBOUNDS. 7I
back to the mine buildings, where the ?rst thing that
\Vest heard was that the Boers were gathering in great
force, and, as far as could be judged, were making the
Diamond City their objective.
Troubles were gathering fast, and news kept on
coming hotter and hotter.
\Vest and Ingleborough were back in their places
at the of?ce, talking over the war news and mingling
with it the scenes they had just gone through.
"Norton promised me he'd call in here when he
left the governors," said Ingleborough.
"Then he must have forgotten it," replied West,
"for he has been with them quite an hour. I say, I
didn't know that you were such a friend of the super-
intendent."
"Well, I'm not in the habit of talking much," said
Ingleborough, smiling. "But I do like him; he's such
a straightforward, manly fellow, and I take so much
interest in the way he runs down criminals. I often
wish I had joined the detectives who have this diamond-
smuggling in hand."
"Pst! here he is! " said \Vest quickly, for there were
steps outside, and directly after a Sharp rap at the door.
"May I come in, Ingleborough?"
"Yes. Entrez! West said you'd gone."
"Did he? You knew I was not?"
Ingleborough nodded.
"What have they decided?" he asked.

"To let the matter drift for the present: only I'm
to keep an eye on the scoundrel. They say that we
shall all have our hands full enough directly in strengthen-
ing the town, and they're right. I'm afraid we're going
to have a warm time."
"Think they'll attack us?" asked West.
"Safe to. Now's the time for you volunteers to
show what you're made of, for I believe that the
enemy will make straight for Kimberley. Our getting the
diamond-?elds has always been a sore point with them,
and we shall have our work cut out to save them."
"Yes," said Ingleborough thoughtfully, "and if I'm
not mistaken, you'll have more cause to watch Anson
than for smuggling. He has his knife into the company."
"Exactly," said Norton; "and if he can make friends
with and help the enemy, he will."
"You mean he'll be a dangerous spy in the camp?"
said West excitedly.
"That's it, Mr. West; but if he plays that game
and is caught his punishment will not be a couple of
years on the breakwater."
"N0," said Ingleborough: "the military will deal
with him then."
"How?" asked West, whose veins began to tingle
and a cold shuddering sensation to run down his spine.
"A couple of lines of infantry, a volley of mus-
ketry, and——"
"Finis," said the superintendent. "Good day. I

don't wish him any harm; but I feel pretty sure he'll
run straight into some trap. That sort of fellow al-
ways does."
The next minute the door had closed upon the
superintendent, and the two young men sat thoughtfully
looking in each other's eyes.
"Only a few hours ago, and we three were calmly
working together," said West sadly; "and I looked
upon Anson as an unsatisfactory fellow whom I never
could like, but whose worst faults were being a cringing
kind of bore and a perfect nuisance with his flute."
"And I as a smooth hypocrite Whom one ought
not to trust," said Ingleborough.
"And now he's gone, and we're to have the Boers
at us and most likely have to soldier in real earnest.
Hallo! Here's Norton back again."
For there was a quick step outside, and the door
was thrown open. But it was not the superintendent's
face that met their eyes, for their late fellow-clerk
stepped boldly in.
"How are you, gentlemen?" he said, with a strong
emphasis upon the last word. "50 I've got the sack;
but I'm not going to leave my property behind."
He stepped to his desk and took out his ?ute case,
tucked it under his arm, and then drew the sword cane
and umbrella from the stand, giving the pair a mali-
ciously triumphant look.
"Can't afford to leave the swordstick as a me-

mento for you, Ingle, nor the ?ute for sneaky \Vest.
Goodbye, both of you. Look out for our next merry
meeting. Ta, ta!"
Neither of the young men replied, but sat gazing
?xedly at the speaker till he passed out, banging the
door.'
But only to open it again to look in and utter the
one word: "Cadsl"
Then the door was banged, and West leaped from
his stool and made a dash.
"Stop, stupid!" thundered out Ingleborough, sup'
plementing his words by a bound and ?inging his
arm round his companion's chest. "Let the brute go.
You don't want to kick him?"
"But I do," shouted West, struggling "Let go."
"Keep still," growled IngleborOugh, and then,
"Why, Noll," he cried, "I do believe———" '
"What?" said West, cooling down and looking
wonderingly in his companion's excited eyes, for Ingle-
borough had stopped short.
"That ?ute—that sword-cane——
"Well, he has got them. Bah! I'm glad you
stopped me from punching his head. Let him have
them; they're his."
"Yes," said Ingleborough; "but the handle of the
cane and the top joint of the ?ute. There was room
for a dozen big diamonds in each."
"What! Then let's go and stop him!"

"Yes; we could but be wrong. Come on."
"Hah! Listen," cried West, and a sound arose
which turned their thoughts in a different channel, for
it was like the ?rst note of the coming war.
The trumpet rang out the " assemblée " and thrilled
both through and through, sending them to the arm-
press for ri?e and bandolier.
Clerking was over for many months to come. The
pen was to give way to the modern substitute for
the sword.

CHAPTER VIII.
VOLUNTEERS VOLUNTEER.
RUMOURS that proved to be false and rumours
that proved to be true were plentiful enough
during the following fortnight; and in that time Kimber-
ley was transformed from a busy mining camp in which
the black and white inhabitants were constantly going
and coming like ants in a hill to a town whose siege
was imminent, and whose people thought of nothing
but preparing for the enemy, and whose talk was of
rifle, cartridge, and trench.
But there was something done beside talk, the
people loyally joining with the small military garrison
in preparing for the defence of the place; and, while
one portion worked to strengthen every spot that would
form a redoubt, the other strove as long as was pos-
sible to get in stores to enable the defenders to hold
out if they were besieged. For the determination was
strong to save the enormous wealth of the place from
the enemy whose borders Were so short a distance from
their lines. I

VOLUNTEERS VOLUNTEER. 77
Drilling and instruction in the use of arms were
carried on almost night and day, and in a very short
time the military element seemed to have pretty well
swallowed up the civil, While each hour found the
people more ready to meet the ?rst rush of the dogs
of war.
It was a most unsuitable place for defence, being
a mere mining camp pitched in a wide bare plain, the
only part suitable for turning into a keep being the
huge mound cast up by the excavations in the search
for diamonds; and this was forti?ed to the best of the
defenders' ability almost from the ?rst. But the situa-
tion had its advantages as well as failings, for the ?at,
open, desert-like land stretched right away on all sides,
giving an enemy no undue advantages in the shape of
kopje or ravine to turn into a natural fortress from
which the town could be attacked.
The place, then, was a fair example of weakness
and strength, the latter, however, daily growing, in the
shape of a stern determination to give the Boers a
very warm reception when they did attack.
So the days glided rapidly by, with authentic
news at ?rst fairly abundant, but invariably of a very
serious nature, and whenever they were off the new
duties they had to ful?l, the said news was amply dis-
cussed by the two young men, Who from their prior
preparation had stood forward at once as prominent
members of the semi-military force.

"Be patient," said Ingleborough laughingly, one
evening; "there'll be plenty of ?ghting by-and~by. I'd no
idea you were going to develop into such a ?re-eater."
"Fire-eater? Absurd! I only feel deeply interested
in all we are doing."
"That's right, No!!! So do we all; but let's have
no rashness. Remember all the drill and discipline.
That's where we shall be able to tell against the enemy.
They can use their ri?es well enough; but they are an
undisciplined mob at the best. By the way, have you
run against the ?ute-player lately?"
"No, but I met the people with whom he lodges
yesterday. They knew me again, and came up as if
Wanting to speak."
"\Vhat about?"
"Oh, they began by talking about the war and
asking me whether I thought it would last long."
"To which you said No, eh?" _
"I only said that I hoped not, and then they
volunteered the information that they believed Anson
was going to leave the town for the south." .
"Indeed?" said Ingleborough sharply.. "What
made them think that?"
"Because their lodger had packed up all his little
belongings and had bought a wagon and a span of
oxen, which he kept just outside."
"Well, he'll lose them if he doesn't look out.
He'll ?nd himself between two ?res. Either the oxen

will be seized for stores, or the Boers will cut them
off. The fellow must be either desperate or mad."
"In a fright, I should say," said West. "I don't
think he would stomach the ?ghting."
"Oh, it's all nonsense! The report this evening
was that the Boers are closing round us fast. He'll
be stopped by one side or the other. Norton ought
to know of this, though."
"I daresay he does know already," said West;
"for he told me the other day that he was keeping
his eye on our friend."
"So he did," said Ingleborough thoughtfully. "He
has some idea of catching him trying to communicate
with the enemy. If he does, Master Simon will not get
off so easily as he did over the diamond business. Well,
I'm tired, and I shall go to bed. Let's sleep while we
can. There's no knowing what a day will bring forth!"
"You are right," said \Nest. "You think we shall
really come to close quarters?"
"Yes, and very close quarters too. I've expected
it before now." '
Nothing happens so surely as the unexpected,
someone once said; and it was so the very next day.
Military drill was, as intimated, constantly going
on; but that next morning there was a larger gathering
than usual, the principal part of the regulars being
drawn up in lines with the volunteer defenders—in all,
a goodly show.


## p. 80 (#88) ##############################################

80 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
It was to some extent a general inspection; but
after it was over the men were formed up as three
sides of a hollow square, and the Colonel in command
addressed the men, complimenting them upon their
behaviour, and then giving them the contents in a
great measure of the despatches he had received from
headquarters, in combination with the reports of the
scouts and from the outposts. He concluded by say-
ing that in a few hours they would, in all probability,
be completely shut off from communication with the
south, for the Boers were closing round them in great
force, and that until they were relieved they would be
called upon to hold Kimberley, making a brave defence
to save so important a town from falling into the
hands of the invader.
Here he was stopped by a tremendous burst of
cheering, which hindered him from saying, as he in-
tended, that they must be of good heart and full of
trust that the General in command would soon send help.
But the enthusiastic cheering taught the Comman-
dant plainly that the men before him needed no
"heartening up," and he smiled with satisfaction as he
felt convinced that every call he made upon them
w0uld be answered.
What followed was short and to the point. He
thanked them, made a_few remarks about his deter-
mination that no Boers should drag the British ?ag
from where it ?uttered, told the garrison that he was


## p. 81 (#89) ##############################################

VOLUNTEERS VOLUNTEER. 8I
proud to say that they had an ample supply of provi-
sions and military stores, and that the Boers had only
to make their ?rst attack to ?nd how they had deceived
themselves about the British surrender at Majuba Hill.
Here there was another deafening burst of cheers.
Finally he made a fresh allusion to the well-known
town farther north which was being surrounded by the
enemy even as they were being Shut in there.
"It will be a race," he said, "between us as to
which town will ?rst beat the Boers off; and the victors
will then have the glorious task of going to the relief
of the others."
After this the regulars were marched off to their
quarters, leaving the volunteers standing fast; and the
Commandant now summoned their of?cers to his side.
As it happened, this was within a few yards of
the spot where West and Ingleborough were drawn up
in the line, and every word the Commandant spoke
came to them clear and plain.
"I have another little business to speak about,
gentlemen," he said, "in connection 'with a second
despatch which was enclosed to me this morning within
my own. It is a letter of instructions I am ordered
to convey to our brave brother-in-arms now in com-
mand at Mafeking; and, on thinking the matter over,
I concluded that it would be unwise to select one of
my own men to carry that despatch, from their want
of knowledge of the country and people, and far better
6


## p. 82 (#90) ##############################################

82 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
to apply to you gentlemen to recommend to me a
thoroughly trustworthy man or two, who, regardless
of all obstacles, would carry the despatch, bringing to
bear force or cunning so as to evade the enemy's
scouts, for the road is sure to swarm with them, even
if it is not occupied by the Boers in force. It is
possible, too, that Mafeking may be completely invested
when he or they reach its neighbourhood; but I must
have a despatch-rider who will look upon even that
as a tri?e to be overcome or crossed, and who will
not rest until the despatch is safely placed in Colonel
Baden-Powell's hands. Let me be fully understood: I
want messengers who will be ready to ?ght if neces
sary or ?y if needs be, but only to rebound and try
in another direction—in short, men who will button up
this despatch and say: 'It shall be placed in Baden-
Powell's hands by hook or crook as soon as a swift'
horse can cover the ground.' This is what I want, and
it is urgent, or it would not be placed in my hands
to deliver with such stern commands. It means life
or death to hundreds, if not thousands. So now then,
whom do you know that will, with the assistance of a
brave comrade, risk his life and carry my despatch? "
A dead silence, which lasted many seconds, fell upon
the group, but at last the volunteer Colonel spoke out.
"I am not prepared to name anyone, sir," he
said, "and I ?inch from sending any man in my regi-
ment upon so terribly perilous a journey, for it means

VOLUNTEERS VOLUNTEER. 83
almost to a certainty being shot down, for the bearer
of the despatch will be bound to hurry on and pay
no heed to challenges to stop."
"Certainly," said the Commandant, frowning; "but
surely-—" '
"One moment, sir; I was about to say that the
fairest way would be to call for volunteers, and then
select the two most likely men."
"Well," said the Commandant, "do that then, and
let the men fully understand that it is a most dange-
rous task. Mind, too, that he must be a good and a
rather reckless rider, able to bear fatigue, and above
all determined to do this thing for the honour of his
country and the saving of his brother men.—Yes, my
lad, what is it?"
For West, whose face had ?ushed deeply and
whose blood tingled in his veins, had taken four steps
forward out of the ranks, and now stood with his hand
raised to the salute.
"Give me the despatch, sir," he said. "I'll take it."
"You?" cried the Commandant wonderingly, as
his eyes ran over the speaker. "You are very young.
But are you a good rider?"
"I think I can ride anything well enough, sir."
"Splendid rider," said a deep voice, and Ingle-
borough strode to the young man's side. "He'll do
it, sir, if any man can; and I'll go with him to help
him in the task if you'll give me orders."
6*


## p. 84 (#92) ##############################################

"Hah!" ejaculated the Commandant. "Yes, I
know you, Mr. Ingleborough. You belong to the
police?"
"Oh no, sir; I am only on friendly terms with
the superintendent, and have been on expeditions with
him."
"And you think your young friend would be a
good man to carry the despatch?"
"I would trust him ifI were in power, sir."
"Then I will," said the Commandant, after a long
and searching look at West. "Be at my quarters in
?fteen minutes' time, both of you, and we will have
further talk on the matter."
The young men exchanged-looks as they resumed
their places in the ranks, West's countenance betoken-
ing the wild excitement he felt, while Ingleborough,
who looked perfectly calm and contented, just gave
him a smile and a nod. '
A few minutes later they were dismissed, and the
two young men had hard work to get free from their
brother volunteers, who surrounded and cheered them
loudly, one of the of?cers proposing that they should
be chaired back through the town. But they escaped
this on the ground of their orders to go to the Com-
mandant's quarters, and were at last set free, to hurry
away. The next minute they encountered Anson, who
had heard and seen all, and passed them without a
word, but wearing a peculiarly supercilious and mean-

VOLUNTEERS VOLUNTEER. 85
ing smile which broadened into a grin of contempt
that made \Vest writhe.
"Bless him!" said Ingleborough. "DO you know
what the pleasant look means?"
"That he will not be happy till I've thrashed him."
"No," said Ingleborough; "he has evidently heard
all, and has made up his mind that he is going to have
a Pleasant revenge."
"How? In what way?" cried West.
"He thinks the Boers will shoot us: that's all."
"Ah!" cried West.
"But we will not let them, my dear boy," said
Ingleborough coolly. "They're Slim, as they call it;
but two can play at that game."
"Yes, but'look: here's Mr. Allan coming to say
that we can't go," said West excitedly, for the chief
director was approaching and raised his hand to stop
them, signing to them directly after to come to his
Side. .
"Looks as if he is going to put a stopper on our
patriotism," growled Ingleborough. "We've been
reckoning without our host."

" ERE, you two boys," cried the director; "I've
just heard of this wild project. Are you
mad, West?"
"I hope not, sir."
"But, my good lad, I realiy—I—that is—bless
my soul! It's very brave of you; but I don't think I
ought to let you go."
"I heard you say, sir, that everyone ought to be
ready to devote his life to the defence Of the country."
"Eh?" cried the director. "To be sure, yes, I
did—in that speech I made to the volunteers; but
then you're not everybody, and—er—er—you see, what
I said was in a speech, and sometimes one says more
then than one quite means."
"There'll be no work doing in the of?ce, sir,"
said Ingleborough; "and I hope you will not place
any obstacles in the way Of our going."
"Oh no, my dear boys! I feel that I must not;
but I don't like you to run such a terrible risk."


## p. 87 (#95) ##############################################

FOUR-LEGGED HELP. 87
"We must all run risks, sir," said \Vest gravely.
"And I beg your pardon: our time is up for
seeing the Commandant," said IngleborOugh, referring
to his watch.
"Yes, I heard you were to go to him," said the
director. "But it sounds very rash. There, go on,
and come to me afterwards."
They parted, and a few minutes later the young
men were ushered into the Commandant's room.
"Then you have not repented, my lads?" he said,
smiling. '
"No, sir," replied West, speaking for both; "we
are quite ready to go."
"Then I must take you both at your word. But
once more I give you both the opportunity to draw
back if you like."
"Thank you, sir,'
7
replied West; "but if you will
trust us we will take the despatch."
"Very well," said the Commandant, turning very
stern and business-like. "Here is the despatch. It is
a very small packet, and I leave it to your own in-
genuity to dispose of it where it cannot be found if
you have the bad luck to be captured. It must be
sewn up in your pockets, 0r ?tted into your hats, or
hidden in some way or other. I leave it to you, only
telling you to destroy it sooner than it should fall into
the enemy's hands."
"We'll consult together, sir, and decide what to

88 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
do," replied West, looking frankly in the of?cer's eyes;
"but—I have heard of such a thing being done, sir——"
"What do you mean?" said the Commandant sternly.
"That to ensure a despatch not falling into the
enemy's hands the bearer learned its contents carefully
and then burned it." '
"Hahl Yes. That would make it safe," cried
the of?cer, with a satis?ed look. "But, no, it could
not be done in this case. I have no right to open
the despatch, and I do not know its contents. You
must take it as it is, and in the event of disaster burn
or bury it. Destroy it somehow. It must not fall
into the enemy's hands. Here."
"I understand, sir," said West, taking the thick
letter in its envelope, as it was extended to him; and
the Commandant heaved a sigh as if of relief on being
freed of a terrible incubus.
"There," he said, "I shall tie you down to no
restrictions other than these. That packet must some-
how be placed in the hands of the Colonel Comman-
dant at Mafeking. I do not like to name failure, for
you are both young, strong, and evidently full of re-
source; but once more:_ if you are driven too hard,
burn or destroy the packet. Now then, what do you
want in the way of arms? You have your ri?es, and
you had better take revolvers, which you can have
with ammunition from the military stores. Do you
want money?"


## p. 89 (#97) ##############################################

FOUR-LEGGED HELP. 89
"No, sir; we shall require no money to signify,"
said Ingleborough quietly. "But we must have the
best horses that can be obtained."
"Those you'must provide for yourselves. Take
the pick of the place, and the order shall be made for
payment. My advice is that you select as good a pair
of Basuto ponies as you can obtain. They will be the
best for your purpose. There, I have no more to say
but 'God speed you,' for it is a matter of life and death."
He shook hands warmly with both, and, on
glancing back as soon as they were outside, they saw
the Commandant watching them from the window,
whence he waved his hand.
"He thinks we shall never get back again, Noll,"
said Ingleborough, smiling; "but we'll deceive him.
Now then, what next?"
"We must see Mr. Allan," replied West.
"Then forward," cried Ingleborough. "We must
see old Norton too before we go, or he'll feel huffed.
Let's go round by his place." ,
They found the s'uperintendent'in and ready to
shake hands with them both warmly.
"Most pluckyl" he kept on saying. "Wish I
could go with you."
"I wish you could, and with a hundred of your
men to back us up," said West laughingly.
"You ought to have a couple of thousand to do
any good!" said the superintendent: "but even they

would not ensure your delivering your despatch. By
rights there ought to be only one of you. That would
increase your chance. But it would be lonely work.
What can I do for you before you go?"
"Only come and see us off this evening."
"I will," was the reply, "and wish you safe back."
"And, I say," said Ingleborough: "keep your eye
on that scoundrel."
"Anson? Oh yes: trust me! I haven't done with
that gentleman yet."
Directly after they were on their way to the
director's room, and as they neared the door they
could hear him pacing impatiently up and down as if
suffering from extreme anxiety. 7
The step ceased as they reached and gave a tap
at the door, and Mr. Allan opened to them himself.
"Well," he said, "has the Commandant decided
to send you?"
"Yes, Sir," replied \Vest.
"I'm very sorry, and I'm very glad; for it must
be done, and I know no one more likely to get through
the Boer lines than you two. Look here, you'll want
money. Take these. No questions, no-hesitation, my
lads; buckle on the belts beneath your vests. Money
is the sinews of war, and you are going where you will
want sinews and bones, bones and sinews too."
In his eagerness the director helped the young
men to buckle on the two cash-belts he had given them.


## p. 91 (#99) ##############################################

FOUR-LEGGED HELP. 91
"There," he said; "that is all I can do for you
but wish you good luck. By the time you come back
we shall have sent the Boers to the right-about,
unless they have captured Kimberley and seized the
diamond-mines. Then, of course, my occupation will
be gone. Goodbye. Not hard-hearted, my boys; but
rather disposed to be soft. There, goodbye."
"Now then," said West, "we've no time to spare.
What are we going to do about horses?"
"We've the money at our back," replied Ingle-
borough, "and that will do anything. We are on
Government service too, so that if we cannot pay we
can pick out what we like and then report to head-
quarters, when they will be requisitioned."
But the task proved easy enough, for they had
not gone far in the direction of the mines when they _' '
met another of the directors, who greeted them both
warmly.
"I've heard all about it, my lads," he said, "and
it's very brave of you both."
"Please don't say that any more, sir," cried West
appealingly, "for all we have done yet is talk. If we
do get the despatch through there will be some
praise earned, but at present we've done nothing."
"And we're both dreadfully modest, sir," said
Ingleborough.
"Bah! you're not great girls," cried the director.
"But you are not off yet, and you can't walk."


## p. 92 (#100) #############################################

92 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"No, sir," said West; "we are in search of
horses—good ones that we can trust to hold out."
"Very well; why don't you go to someone who
has been buying up horses for our mounted men?"
"Because we don't know of any such person,"
said \Vest. "Do you?"
"To be sure I do, my lad, and here he is."
"You, sir?" cried Ingleborough excitedly. "Why,
of course; I heard that you were, and forgot in all
the bustle and excitement of the coming siege. Then
you can let us have two? The Commandant will give
an order for the payment."
"Hang the Commandant's paymentsl" cried the
director testily. "When young fellows like you are
ready to give their lives in the Queen's service, do you
think men like we are can't afford to mount them?
Come along with me, and you shall have the pick of
the sturdy cob ponies I have. They're rough, and
almost unbroken—what sort of horsemen are you?"
"Very bad, sir," replied Ingleborough: "no style
at all. We ride astride though."
"Well, so I suppose," said the director, laughing,
"and with your faces to the nag's head. If you tell me
you look towards the tail I shall not believe you. But
seriously, can you stick on a horse tightly when at full
gallop?"
"Oliver West can, sir," replied Ingleborough.
"He's a regular centaur foal."


## p. 93 (#101) #############################################

FOUR-LEGGED IIELI'. 93
"Nonsense! Don't ?atter," cried \Vest. "Ican
ride a bit, sir; but Ingleborough rides as if he were
part of a horse. He's accustomed to taking long rides
across the veldt every morning." (
"Oh, we can ride, sir," said Ingleborough coolly;
"but whether we can ride well enough to distance the
Boers has to be proved."
"I'll mount you, my boys, on such a pair of
ponies as the Boers haven't amongst them," said the
director warmly. "Do you know my stables—the
rough ones and enclosure I have had made?"
"We heard something about the new stabling near
the mine, sir," said West; "but we've been too busy
to pay much heed."
"Come and pay heed now, then."
The speaker led the way towards the great mine
buildings, and halted at a gate in a newly set-up fence
of corrugated iron, passing through which their eyes
were gladdened by the sight of about a dozen of the
rough, sturdy little cobs bred by the Basutos across
country, and evidently under the charge of a couple
of Kaf?rs, who came hurrying up at the sight of their
"baas," as they termed him.
Here Ingleborough soon displayed the knowledge
he had picked up in connection with horses by select-
ing two clever-looking muscular little steeds, full of
spirit and go, but quite ready to prove how little
they had been broken in, and promising plenty of

work to their riders if they expected to keep in their
saddles.
"Be too fresh for you?" said the owner.
"We shall soon take the freshness out of them,
poor things!" said Ingleborough. "\Vould you mind
having them bridled and sadled, sir?"
The order was given, and, after a good deal of
trouble and narrowly escaping being kicked, the
Kaf?rs brought the pair selected up to where the
despatch-riders were standing with the director.
Ingleborough smiled, and then bade the two
Kaf?rs to stand on the far side of the ponies, which
began to resent the Kaf?rs' ?ank movements by sidling
up towards the two young men. '
"Ready?" said Ingleborough, in a low, sharp tone.
"Yes."
"Mount!"
They both sprang into their saddles, to the intense
astonishment of the ponies, one of which made a bound
and dashed off round the enclosure at full speed, while
the other, upon which West was mounted, reared
straight up, and, preserving its balance upon its hind
legs, kept on snorting, while it sparred out with its
fore hoofs as if striking at some imaginary enemy, till
the rider brought his hand down heavily upon the
restive beast's neck. The blow acted like magic, for
the pony dropped on all fours directly, gave itself a
shake as if to rid itself of saddle and rider, and then

uttered a loud neigh which brought its galloping com-
panion alongside.
"Humph!" ejaculated their new friend; "I needn't
trouble myself about your being able to manage your
horses, my lads. Will these do?"
"Splendidly, sir," cried West.
"There they are, then, at your service!" And,
after a few directions to the Kaf?rs about having them
ready when wanted, the party left the enclosure and
separated with a few friendly words, the despatch-
bearers making once more for the Commandant's
quarters to report what they had done so far, and to
obtain a pass which would ensure them a ready pas-
sage through the lines and by the outposts.
They were soon ushered into the Commandant's
presence, and he nodded his satisfaction with the report
of their proceedings before taking up a pen and writ-
ing a few lines upon an Of?cial sheet of paper.
"That will clear you both going and returning,"
said he, folding and handing the permit. "Now then,
when do you start?"
"Directly, sir," said Ingleborough, who was the
one addressed.
"No," said the Commandant. "You must wait
a few hours. Of course it is important that the deS-
patch be delivered as soon as possible; but you must
lose time sooner than run risks. If you go now, you
will be seen by the enemy and be having your horses

shot down—perhaps share their fate. SO be cautious,
and now once more goodbye, my lads. I shall look
forward to seeing you back with an answering de-
spatch."
This was their dismissal, and they hurried away to
have another look to their horses, and to see that they
were well fed, before obtaining a meal for themselves
and a supply of food to store in their haversaeks.
"There's nothing like a bit of foresight," said
Ingleborough. "We must eat, and going in search of
food may mean capture and the failure of our mission."
The time was gliding rapidly on, the more quickly
to West from the state of excitement he was in; but
the only important thing he could afterwards remember
was that twice over they ran against Anson, who
seemed to be watching their actions, and the second
time West drew his companion's attention to the fact.
"Wants to see us off," said Ingleborough. "I
shouldn't be surprised when we come back to ?nd
that he has eluded Norton and gone."
"Where?" said West.
"Oh, he'll feel that his chance here is completely
gone, and he'll make for the Cape and take passage
for England."
"If the Boers do not stop him."
"Of course," replied Ingleborough. "It's. my
impression that he has smuggled a lot of diamonds,
though we couldn't bring it home to him."

"I suppose it's possible," said West thoughtfully.
"But isn't it likely that he may make his way over
to the enemy?" _
Ingleborough looked at the speaker sharply.
"That's not a bad idea of yours," he said slowly;
"but, if he does and he is afterwards caught, things
might go very awkwardly for his lordship, and that
?ute of his will be for sale."
"Flute for sale? What do you mean? From
poverty ?—no one would employ him. Oh! I under-
stand now. Horriblel You don't think our people
would shoot him?" '
"Perhaps not," said Ingleborough coldly; "but
they'd treat him as a rebel and a spy. But there, it's
pretty well time we started. Come along."
Within half an hour they were mounted and off
on their perilous journey, passing outpost after outpost
and having to make good use of their pass, till, just as
it was getting dusk, they parted from an of?cer who
rode out with them towards the Boers' encircling lines.
"There," he said, "you've got the enemy before
you, and you'd better give me your pass."
"Why?" said West sharply.
"Because it has been a source of protection so far:
the next time you are challenged it will be a danger."
" Of course," said Ingleborough. "Give it up, Oliver."
"Or destroy it," said the o?icer carelessly: "either
will do."


## p. 98 (#106) #############################################

"Thanks for the advice," said West, and they shook
hands and parted, the of?cer riding back to join his men.
"You made him huffy by being suspicious," said
Ingleborough.
"I'm sorry, but one can't help being suspicious of
everything and everybody at a time like this. What
do you say about destroying the Commandant's pass?"
"I'm divided in my opinion."
"So am I," said West. "One moment I think it
best: the nextI am for keeping it in case we fall
into the hands of some of our own party. On the
whole, I think we had better keep it and hide it. Let's
keep it till we are in danger."
"Chance it?" said Ingleborough laconically. "Very
well; only don't leave it till it is too late."
"I'll mind," said West, and, as they rode out over
the open veldt and into the gloom of the falling night,
they kept a sharp look-out till they had to trust more
to their ears for notice of danger, taking care to speak
only in a whisper, knowing as they did that at any
moment they might receive a challenge from the foe.
"What are you doing?" said Ingleborough sud-
denly, after trying to make out what his companion
was doing. "Not going to eat yet, surely?"
"No—only preparing for the time when I must.
Look here."
"Too dark," said Ingleborough, leaning towards
his companion.

"Very Well, then, I'll tell you: I'm making a
sandwich."
"Absurd! What for?"
"I'll tell you. You can't see, but this is what I'm
doing. I've two slices of bread here, and I'm putting
between them something that is not good food for Boers.
That's it. I've doubled the pass in half, and stuck it
between two slices. If we have the bad luck to be taken
prisoners Ishall be very hungry, and begin eating the
sandwich and the pass. I don't suppose it will do
me any harm."
"Capital idea," said Ingleborough, laughing.
"That's done," said West, replacing his paper
sandwich in his haversack, and a few minutes later,
as they still rode slowly on, Ingleborough spoke again.
"What now?" he said.
"Making another sandwich,
"Another?"
"Yes, of the Mafeking despatch."
"Ah, of course; but you will not eat that?"
"Only in the last extremity."
"Good," said Ingleborough, "and I hope we shall
have no last extremes."
He had hardly spoken when a sharp challenge in
Boer Dutch rang out, apparently from about ?fty
yards to their left, and, as if in obedience to the
demand, the two Basuto ponies the young men rode
stopped suddenly.

was the reply.

Ingleborough leaned down Sidewise and placed
his lips close to his companion's ear.
"Which is it to be?" he said. "One is as easy
as the other—forward or back?"
"One's as safe as the other," replied \Vest, under
his breath. "F orward."'
They were in the act of pressing their horses'
sides to urge them on when there was a ?ash Of
light from the position of the man who had uttered the
challenge, and almost immediately the humming, buz-
zing sound as of a large beetle whizzing by them in
its nocturnal ?ight, and at the same moment there was
the sharp crack of a ri?e.

" LESS 'em!" said Anson to himself that same
evening, "I don't wish 'em any harm. I only
hope that before they've gone far the Boers will
challenge them.
"I can almost see it now: getting dark, and an
outpost challenges. 'Come on, gallop!' says old Ingle,
and they stick their spurs into their nags and are off
over the veldt. Then crack, crack, crack, go the ri?es
till the saddles are emptied and two gallant defenders
of Kimberley and brave despatch-riders lie kicking
in the dust.
"Ugh! How I should like to be there with my
?ute. I'd stand and look on till they'd given their
last kick and stretched themselves out straight, and
then I'd play the 'Dead March' in 'Saul' all over 'em
both. Don't suppose they'd know; but if they could
hear it they wouldn't sneer at my 'tootling old ?ute'—-
as Ingle called it—any more.

"Urrrr! I hated the pair of 'em. Ingle was a
hound—a regular snif?ng, smelling-out hound, and
N011 West a miserable, sneaking cur. Beasts! So
very good and nice and straightforward. Hundreds of
thousands of pounds' worth—yes, millions' worth of
diamonds being scraped together by the company,
and a poor fellow not allowed to have a handful. I
don't say it's the thing to steal 'em; but who would
steal? Just a bit of nice honest trade—buy in the
cheapest market and sell in the dearest. It's what the
company does, but nobody else ought to, of course.
Who's going to ask every Kaf?r who comes to you
and says: 'Buy a few stones, baas?' 'Where do you
get 'em from?' Not me. They've as good a right
to 'em as the company, and ifI like to do a bit of
honest trade I will, in spite of the miserable laws they
make. Hang their laws! \Vhat are they to .me?
Illicit diamond-buying! Police force, eh? A snap of
the ?ngers for it! I
"A bit sooner than I expected," mused the ?ute-
player. "A few months more, and I should have made
a very big thing if the Boers hadn't upset it all and
Master Ingle hadn't been so precious clever! Never
mind: it isn't so very bad now! I'll be off while my
shoes are good. I don't believe the Boers have got
round to the south yet, and, if they have, I don't
believe it'll matter. Say they do stop me, it'll only
be: 'Who are you—and where are you going?' Down

south or west or anywhere, to do a bit of trade. I'm
sloping off—that's what I'm doing—because the British
are trying to force me to volunteer to ?ght against
my old friends the Boers. I'll soft-soap and butter
'em all over, and play 'em a tune or two upon the
?ute, and offer 'em some good tobacco. They won't
stop me."
The quiet, plump, thoughtful-looking muser was
"on his way to a farm just beyond the outskirts of
Kimberley, as he walked slowly through the darkness, '
hardly passing a soul; and he rubbed his hands softly
at last as he came in sight of a dim gleaming lan-
tern some distance ahead.
"All ready and waiting," he said softly, and now
he increased his pace a little in his excitement, but
only to stop short and look back once or twice as if '
to make sure that he was not followed. But, neither
seeing nor hearing anything, he rubbed his hands
again, muttered to himself something about wiping his
shoes of the whole place, and went on quickly.
"Das you, baas?" said a thick guttural voice just
above the lantern.
"Yes, this is me," replied Anson. "Team in-
spanned?"
"Yaas, baas: big long time ago. Not tink baas
come."
"But I said I would," replied Anson. "Got the
water-barrel slung underneath?"


## p. 104 (#112) ############################################

104 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
The man grunted, Anson gave an order or two
in a low tone, and in response to a shout a dimly-
seen team of great bullocks roughly harnessed to the
dissel boom and trek tow of a long covered-in wagon
began to trudge slowly along over the rough track
which led to the main road leading south. A second
man led the way, while the Kaf?r with the light
swung himself up on to the great box in front of
the wagon and drew out an unusually long whip,
after hanging his horn lantern to a hook in the
middle of the arched tilt over his head.
"Baas come alon' heah?" said the man.
"No, go on, and I'll walk behind for. a bit," said
Anson, in a low tone of voice. "Go on quietly, and
keep off the track. Go straight away till I tell you
to turn off." I
The Kaf?r grunted, and the oxen plodded on at
their slow two-mile-an-hour rate, leaving the last sign
of occupation far behind, Anson twice over giving
instructions to the man who was leading which way
to steer, the result being that the creaking wagon was
driven right away south and west over the open veldt,
avoiding the various farms and places till Kimberley
was left far behind.
It was a bright starlit night, and the long pro-
cession of big bullocks looked weird and strange in
the gloom, for at times they seemed to be drawing
nothing, so closely did the tilt of the great lightly-

loaded wagon assimilate with the drab dusty tint of
the parched earth and the dusky-coloured scrub which
the great wheels crushed down.
The driver sat on the box with his huge whip,
his shoulders well up and his head down, driving
mechanically, and seeming to be asleep, while the
voorlooper kept pace with the leading oxen, and hour
after hour passed away without a word being spoken.
So the night wore on, the only watchful eyes
being those of Anson, who kept on straining them
forward right and left, while his ears twitched as he
listened for the sounds which he knew would be
uttered by a Boer vedette.
But no challenge came, and the fugitive breathed
more freely as the stars paled, a long, low, sickly
streak began to spread in the east, and the distance
of the wide-spreading desolate veldt grew more clear.
"I knew they wouldn't be on the look-out," said
Anson to himself, in an exulting fashion. "Hah! I'm
all right, and I wonder how \Vest and Ingle have
got on."
It was growing broad daylight when the thoughtful-
looking ex-clerk climbed up to the side of the driver.
"How far to the fontein?" he said.
7
"One hour, baas,' was the reply.
"Is there plenty of grass?"
"Plenty, baas. Bullock much eat and drink."
The information proved quite correct, for within

the speci?ed time—the team having stepped out more
readily, guided as they were by their instinct to where
water, grass, and rest awaited them—and soon after
the great orange globe had risen above what looked
like the rim of the world, the wagon was pulled up
at the edge of a broad crack in the dusty plain, where
the bottom Of the spruit could be seen full of rich
green grass besprinkled with ?owers, through which
ran the clear waters of an abundant stream.
A ?re was soon lighted, a billy hung over it to
boil, and Anson, after watching the team, which had
dragged their load so well and so far, munching away
at the juicy grass, began to get out the necessaries
connected with his own meal.
"Hah!" he said softly, as he rubbed his hands;
"sorry I haven't got my two fellow-clerks to break-
fast: it would have been so nice and——Ugh!" he
growled, shading his eyes to give a ?nal look round,
for there in the distance, evidently following the track
by which he had come through the night, there was
a little knot of horsemen cantering along, and from
time to time there came a ?ash of light caused by
the horizontal beams of the sun striking upon ri?e-
barrel or sword.
Anson's hands dropped to his sides, and he
looked to right, left, and behind him as if meditating
?ight. Then his eyes went in the direction of his
oxen, freshly outspanned, but he turned frownineg

away as he felt that even with the team already in
their places, the lumbering bullocks could not have
been forced into a speed which the horses could not
have overtaken in a few yards at a canter.
Then he shaded his eyes again to have a good
look at the party of horsemen.
"Police," he said, in a hiss. "Yes, and that's
Norton. 1"
He drew in his breath, making a peculiar sound,
and then, as if satis?ed with the course he meant to
pursue, he went back to the ?re and continued his
preparations for his meal, apparently paying no heed
to the party of mounted police till they cantered up
and came to a halt by the wagon.
"Hallo, constablesl" cried Anson boisterously;
"who'd have thought of seeing—Why, it's you,
Mr. Norton!"
"Yes," said the superintendent. "You seem sur-
prised l"
"Why, of course I am. Got something on the
way? Anyone been smuggling stones?"
"Yes," said the of?cer shortly.
"Sorry for them then, for I suppose you mean
to catch 'em."
"I do," said the of?cer warningly.
"That's right; I'm just going to have some break-
fast: will you have a snack with me?"
"No, thank you. I'm on business."

108 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Ah, you are a busy man, Mr. Norton; but let
bygones be bygones. Have a snack with me! You're
welcome."
"I told you I was on business, Master Anson.
Now, if you please, where are you going?"
"\Nhere am I going?" said Anson warmly. "\Vhy,
down south. \Vhat's the good of my staying in
Kimberley ?"
"I can't answer that question, sir. Where's
your pass?"
"Pass? \Vhat pass?"
"Your permit from the magistrate to leave the
town."
"Permit? Nonsensel" cried Anson. "I'm turned
out of the mine of?ces, and I'm not going to sit and
starve. No one will give me work without a character.
You know that."
The superintendent nodded.
"Perhaps not," he said; "but you are still a
suspect, and you have no right to leave the town."
"I'm not a prisoner," said Anson de?antly, "and
I'm going on my lawful way. What have you to say
to that?"
"In plain English, that I believe you are going
off to escape arrest and to carry off your plunder."
"My what? Plunder? Why, it's sickening! Didn't
you come to my place and thoroughly search it?"
"I did search your room, but found nothing,

because I believe you had everything too well hidden.
Now then, if you please, what have you got in your
wagon?"
"Nothing but provisions and my clothes! \Vhy?"
"Because of your sudden ?ight."
"My sudden what?" said Anson, laughing.
"You know what I said, sir. Your sudden ?ight!"
"My sudden nonsense!" cried Anson angrily.
"I have told you why I came away."
"Yes," said the superintendent; "but I'm not
satis?ed that this move does not mean that you have
smuggled diamonds here with you to carry to where
you can dispose of them."
"Well, it's of no use to argue with a policeman,"
said Anson coolly. "You had better make another
search."

CHAPTER XI.
ANOTHER SEARCH.
" HAT'S just what I'm going to do, Master Anson,"
was the reply, given sternly.
"All right," said Anson nonchalantly. "Search
away; but, if I was in the police and had a good tip
given me as to where the plunder I was after had been
planted, I don't think I should waste time hunting blind
leads, and letting the real culprits have plenty of time
to get away."
"But then you are not in the police, sir," said the
superintendent, with a nod. "SO ?rst of all I'll let my
men run over you and your Kaf?rs."
"Wait till I've lit a cigar ?rst," said Anson, taking
out a case, and then laughing, for the police of?cer
was watching him keenly. "That's right; there are
three or four diamonds in every one of these cigars,
and as I smoke you'll notice that I don't burn much
of the end Ilight, but that I keep on biting Off bits
of the leaf till I get to the diamonds, and then I
swallow them."


## p. 111 (#119) ############################################

He held out his cigar'case, and the superintendent
took it and began to feel the cigars, till Anson burst
out laughing.
"Don't pinch them too hard," he cried, "or you'll
break them, and then they won't draw."
The of?cer returned the cigar-case with an angry
ejaculation, and glanced round as if hesitating where
to begin, while the horses of his men began to imitate
the action of the oxen, nibbling away at the rich grass
surrounding the pleasant spring.
"I say, Robert," said Anson, and the superintendent
started at the familiar nickname: "I'd look smart over
the business, for the Boers have been here lately to
water their horses, and if they should by any chance
come back it might mean a journey for you and your
men to Pretoria."
"And you too, if they did come," said the of?cer
surlily.
"Oh, I don't know," said Anson airily. "I don't
believe they would stop a man with an empty wagon
going south on a peaceful journey."
"They'd take you and your wagon and span, sir,"
said the Of?cer sternly. I
"Look here, I don't believe the Boers would be-
have half so badly to me as my own people have done.
But aren't you going to search?"
"Yes," said the superintendent sharply. "Your
ri?e, please."


## p. 112 (#120) ############################################

112 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
Anson unslung it from where it hung in the wagon,
and the of?cer took it, examined the stock and the
plate at the end of the butt, to be sure that there
were no secret places scooped out of the wood, before
he opened the breech and withdrew the ball cartridges,
holding the empty barrels up to his eyes.
"That's right," cried Anson; "but have a good
look round for squalls—I mean Boers. Gun-barrels
don't make half bad things to squint through when you
haven't got a binocular."
"Bah!" said the superintendent angrily, replacing
the cartridges and closing the breech with a snap. "But
you have a pair of glasses slung across your shoulder,
sir. Have the goodness to pass the case here."
Anson obeyed willingly enough, giving his slung
ease up for the ri?e that was returned.
"There you are," he said, "and when you've done
I suppose you'd like to search my clothes and my skin.
But I haven't anything there, and I haven't cut myself
to slip diamonds inside my hide, and there are none
in my ears or boots."
"It's my duty to have you searched all the same,"
said the superintendent. "Here, two of you go care-
fully over Mr. Anson, while you three hitch up your
horses there and make a close search throughout the
wagon."
Anson chuckled as the men began promptly to pass
their hands over his clothes, turn out his pockets, and

haul off his boots, their chief, after satisfying himself
that the binocular case had no false bottom or pre-
cious stones inside the instrument itself, looking search-
ineg on.
Satis?ed at last that his captive had nothing eon-
cealed about him, and frowning heavily at the malicious
grin of contempt in which Anson indulged, the super-
intendent turned to the men examining the oxen so as
to satisfy himself that none of the heavy dull brutes
had been provided with false horns riveted over their
own and of greater length so as to allow room for a
few diamonds in each.
Then the dissel boom was examined to see if it
had been bored out somewhere and plugged to cover
the illicitly-acquired diamonds thrust in.
But no: the great pole of the wagon was perfectly
solid; there were no stones stuck in the grease used
to anoint the wheels; there was no sign anywhere out-
side the wagon of boring or plugging; and at last
the superintendent, after carefully avoiding Anson's
supercilious grin, turned to give a ?nal look round
before giving up the search.
Was there anywhere else likely?
Yes; there were the bags of mealies and the water-
eask slung beneath the wain, both nearly full, the
cask to give forth a sound when it was shaken, and
the sacks ready to be emptied out upon a wagon sheet
and shed their deep buff-coloured grains, hard, clean,

and sweet, in a great heap, which was spread out more
and more till they were about two deep, but showed
not a sign of a smuggled stone.
"Fill the bags again, my lads," said the police
superintendent, "and let's have a look at what's inside
the wagon."
"We've searched everything there,'
'
said a sergeant
gruf?y.
"I have not," replied the superintendent sharply.
"Let me see."
"But you haven't looked in the water-cask," said
Anson mockingly; "turn the water out on to the wagon
sheet. It won't stay there, of course; but we can easily
get some more. Do you think diamonds would melt
in water?"
"Try one and see," cried the superintendent angrily,
as he turned away, to stand looking on while every
article that could by any possibility have been made
to act as a vehicle to hide smuggled diamonds had been
examined and replaced.
"\Ve've been sold, eh?" said the sergeant, looking
up in his superintendent's eyes at last.
"It seems like it," was the reply. "There's nothing
here." i
just then Anson, who had been lighting a fresh
cigar, came up to him smilingly.
"Haven't done, have you?" he said.
"Yes: quite," was the gruff reply.

"Oh, I am sorry you haven't had better luck,"
said Anson, in a mock sympathetic tone. "It must be
terribly disappointing, after expecting to make a big
capture."
"Very," said the superintendent, looking the speaker
searchingly in the eyes.
"Well, I said something to you before, but you
took no notice."
"Oh yes, I did."
"But you didn't act on my tip. It seems like
playing the sneak, but that's what they did to me, so
I don't mind paying them back in their own coin."
"Pay whom?"
"The two who informed on me to save their own
skins."
"I do not understand you."
"Oh clear, what fools you clever men are!"
"What do you mean?"
"Bah! And you call yourself a police of?cer. I'd
make a better one out Of a Dutch doll."
"Once more, what do you mean?"
"Rub the dust out of your eyes, man."
"There's none there."
"Tchah! Your eyes are full of the dust those two
threw there. Can't you see?"
"No."
"Well, I am surprised at you," cried Anson; "and

"\Vhat! West and Ingleborough?"
"To be sure! What should they want to volunteer
for, and risk capture by the Boers, if they hadn't
Something to gain by it?"
"Well, they had something to gainihonour and
promotion."
"Pish!" cried Anson; "they want something better
than that! You've been had, squire. You've been set
to catch poor innocent, lamb-like me, and all the while
those two foxes have been stealing away with the
plunder."
"What!" cried the superintendent.
"I spoke plainly enough," said Anson, smiling
pleasantly.
"Yes, you spoke plainly enough," said the super-
intendent; "but it's nothing to laugh at, sir."
"Why, it's enough to make a cat laugh. Well, I
wish you better luck," said Anson, "and if you do catch
up to Oliver \Vest I hope you'll slip the handcuffs on
him at once and make him part with his smuggled
swag."
"You may trust me for that," said the superintendent
grimly.
"I shall," said Anson, smiling broadly. "Glad you
came after me, so that I could put you on the right track."

"So am I," said the police of?cer, with a peculiar
look.
"And I'm sorry I cut up so rough," continued
Anson, smiling, as he apologised; "but you know, it
isn't nice to be stopped and overhauled as I have
been."
"Of course it isn't," said the of?cer drily; "but
in my profession one can't afford to study people's
feelings."
"No, no, of course not. But don't apologise."
"I was not going to," said the superintendent;
"I'm sorry, though, to ?nd out that West is such a
scamp. W'hy, Ingleborough must be as bad."
"Or worse," said Anson, grinning.
"Yes, because he's older. Why, I quite trusted
that fellow."
"Ah, you're not the ?rst man who has been de-
ceived, sir."
"Of course not; but by the way, Mr. Anson,
why didn't you say something of this kind in your
defence when Ingleborough charged you before the
directors ? "
"Why didn't Isay something about it? Why, be-
cause I didn't know. It only came to me too late.
But there, you know now; and, as I said before, I
wish you luck and a good haul, only unfortunately
they've got a good start and you'll have your work
cut out. Going? Goodbye then."

"Goodbye?" said the superintendent, using the word
as a question.
"Yes, of course. I'm going to chance it. Idon't
suppose we shall meet any Boers."
"No; I don't think you'll meet any Boers," said
the of?cer, in so meaning a way that Anson grew
uneasy.
"Why do you speak like that?" he said sharply.
"Only that it isn't goodbye, Mr. Anson."
"Not goodbye? Yes, it is. I'm off to the south
at once."
"No, sir; you're going north with me. You are a
suspected person, Mr. Anson. I am not altogether
satis?ed with my search, nor yet with your very
ingenious story."
"Then search again?" cried Anson excitedly.
"Not here, sir. I'll have a careful look over the
wagon when we get back to Kimberley."
"You don't mean to say you are going to drag
me back to Kimberley?"
"I do, sir, and you ought to be thankful, for you'd
never pass through the Boers' lines further south."
"But you have thoroughly searched me and my
wagon."
"I have told you that 1 am not satis?ed," said the
of?cer coldly; "and, even ifI were, Ishould take you
back with me all the same."
"Why? What for?"

"To face this Mr. \Vest and his companion if we
capture them and bring them back."
"But what's that to me?"
"Only this: you are the informer, and will have
to give evidence against them when they are examined.
Now, please, no more words, Mr. Anson; you are my
prisoner. Quick, boys! Get the team inspanned and
the wagon turned the other way."
"But breakfast," said Anson, with a groan. "I
must have something to eat."
"The billy is boiling," said the sergeant to his
chief, in a con?dential tone, "and the bullocks would
be all the better for an hour's feed, sir."
The superintendent looked sharply towards the ?re
and the prisoner's provisions, and shaded his eyes and
gazed for some minutes south.
"You're right," he said. "Send two men off a
good mile forward as outposts, and let the oxen feed.—
Now, Mr. Anson, I'll take breakfast with you if you'll
have me for a guest." '
"Yes; I can't help myself," said the prisoner bitterly;
"and suppose I shan't have a chance given me to
make your tea agreeable with something I have in the I
wagon."
"No; I don't think you will, sir, thanks."
"But I can sit and wish you luck, my friend, and
my wish is this—that a commando may swoop down
upon you and your gang" '


## p. 120 (#128) ############################################

120 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Thanks once more," said the superintendent grimly.
"There, sit down, sir, and I'll preside and send you
your breakfast."
This was done, the repast made, and, as soon as
two of the constables had ?nished, they were sent off
to relieve their rearguard, sending them on to have
their meal, and with orders to fall back towards the
wagon a quarter of an hour after the relief had been
made.
All this was duly carried out, the oxen inspanned,
and the wagon began its lumbering course back towards
Kimberley, the black driver and voorlooper taking their
places in the most unconcerned way, as if it were all
in the day's work, while Anson, after eating voraciously,
had a ?t of the sulks, watching narrowly the move-
ments of the police. After a moment's indecision he
climbed upon the box in the front of the wagon and
in doing so glanced at his ri?e, which hung in its
slings close to his head.
"Six of them," he said to himself, as he smiled
pleasantly. I could bring down the chief and one more
easily; but that wouldn't scare the rest away. Odds are
too heavy, and one don't want to be taken and hanged.
They are so particular about a policeman being hurt!
Never mind; I daresay my luck will turn—fool as I
was to try that dodge on about those two going Off
with the smuggled loot. I'll wait. Here goes to whistle
for the Boers, as the sailors do for wind."

Saying this, he drew out the little mahogany case
which held his ?ute, and coolly took the pieces and
?tted them together, before crossing his legs upon the
rough seat and beginning to blow, keeping up a series
of the most doleful Old Scotch and Irish laments, while
the oxen plodded on and the police rode by the wagon
side, listening and looking in vain for any sign tending
to point out the fact that the ?autist was a dishonest
dealer in the coveted crystals which were so hard to
get, but all the same keeping a keen look-out for danger
in the shape of advancing Boers.

HE report of the ri?e was magical in its effect
upon the Basuto ponies, each rearing up on its
hind legs and striking out with its forefeet; but the
same punishment was meted out by the riders—namely,
a sharp tap between the ears with the barrels of the
ri?es—and the result was that beyond ?dgeting they
stood fairly still, while ?ask, ?ask, ?ax/z, three more
shots were ?red. The bullets whizzed by with their
peculiar noise, sounding quite close, but probably no-
where near the riders—those who ?red judging in the
darkness quite by sound.
7
"Let's keep on at a walk,' whispered \Vest; but,
low as his utterance was, the sound reached an
enemy's ears.
"Mind what you're about!" said someone close
at hand, evidently mistaking the speaker for a friend;
"one of those bullets went pretty close to my ear.
\Vhereabouts are they?"
"Away to the right," whispered Ingleborough, in
Dutch.


## p. 123 (#131) ############################################

IN THE THICK OF IT. 123
" Come on then," said the former speaker. " Ck!"
The pony the man rode made a plunge as if spurs
had been suddenly dug into its sides, and the dull beat
of its hoofs on the dusty soil told of the course its
rider was taking.
\Vest was about to speak when the rapid beating
of hoofs came from his left, and he had hard work to
restrain his own mount from joining a party of at least
a dozen of the enemy as they swept by noisily in the
darkness.
"\Vhat do the fools think they are going to do
by galloping about like that?" said Ingleborough gruf?y.
"If they had kept still they might have caught us.
Hallo! Firing again!" _
Three or four shots rang out on the night air,
and away in front of the pair the beating of hoofs
was heard again.
"Why, the country seems alive with them," whis-
pered West. "Hadn't we better keep on?"
"Yes, we must chance it," was the reply. "No
one can see us twenty yards away."
"And we ought to make the most of the darkness."
"Hist!" whispered Ingleborough, and his com-
panion sat fast, listening to the movements of a mounted
man who was evidently proceeding cautiously across
their front from left to right. Then the dull sound of
' hoofs ceased—went on again—ceased once more for
a time, so long that \Vest felt that their inimical neigh-

bour must have stolen away, leaving the coast quite
clear.
He was about to say so to Ingleborough, but
fortunately waited a little longer, and then started, for
there was the impatient stamp of a horse, followed by
a sound that suggested the angry jerking of a rein,
for the animal plunged and was checked again.
As far as the listeners could make out, a mounted
man was not forty yards away, and the perspiration
stood out in great drops upon \Vest's brow as he
waited for the discovery which he felt must be made.
For a movement on the part of either of the ponies,
or a check of the rein to keep them from stretching
down their necks to graze, would have been enough.
But they remained abnormally still, and at last, to the
satisfaction and relief of both, the Boer vedette moved
off at a trot, leaving the pair of listeners once more
free to breathe.
"That was a narrow escape!" said West, as soon
as their late companion was fairly out of hearing.
"Yes. I suppose we ought to have dismounted and
crawled up to him and put a bullet through his body,"
answered Ingleborough.
"Ugh! Don't talk about it!" replied West. "I
suppose we shall have plenty of such escapes as this
before we have done."
"You're right! But we can move on now, and—-
Hist! There are some more on the left."


## p. 125 (#133) ############################################

IN THE THICK OF IT. 125
"I don't hear anyone. Yes, I do. Sit fast; there's
a strong party coming along."
\Vest was quite right, a body Of what might have
been a hundred going by them at a walk some_eighty
or ninety yards away, and at intervals a short sharp
order was given in Boer Dutch which suggested to
\Vest commands in connection with his own drill,
"Right inclinel" or "Left inclinel" till the commando
seemed to have passed right away out of hearing.
"Now then,' said West softly, "let's get on while
we have the chance."
The words were hardly above his breath, but in
the utter stillness Of the night on the veldt they pene-
trated suf?ciently far, and in an instant both the des-
patch-riders knew what the brief orders they had heard
meant, namely that as the commando rode along a
trooper was ordered to rein up at about every hundred
yards and was left as a vedette.
For no sooner had \Vest spoken than there was
a sharp challenge to left and right, running away along
a line, and directly after the reports of ri?es rang out
and bullets whizzed like insects through the dark night
air. Many ?ew around and over the heads of the fugi-
tives; for the moment the discovery was made West
and Ingleborough pressed their ponies' sides and went
forward at full gallop to pass through the ?re in front
of them.
It was close work, for guided by the sounds of

the ponies' hoofs, the Boers kept on ?ring, one shot
being from close at hand—so close that the ?ash seemed
blinding, the report tremendous. This was followed
by a sharp shock, the two companions, as they tore
on, cannoning against the vedette, \cht's pony striking
the horse in his front full upon the shoulder and driv-
ing the poor beast right in the way of Ingleborough's,
with the consequence that there was a second collision
which sent the Boer and his horse prostrate, Ingle-
borough's pony making a bound which cleared the
struggling pair, and then racing forward alongside of
its stable companion, when they galloped on shoulder
to shoulder. They were followed by a scattered ?re
of bullets, and when these ceased West turned in his
saddle and listened, to hear the heavy beat of many
hoofs, telling of pursuit; but the despatch-riders were
well through the line, and galloped on at full speed
for the next half-hour, when they slackened down and
. gradually drew rein and listened.
"Can't hear a sound!" said \Vest.
"Nor I," replied Ingleborough, after a pause. "So
now let's breathe our nags and go steadily, for we may
very likely come upon another of these lines of
mounted men."
A Short consultation was then held respecting the
line of route to be followed as likely to be the most
clear of the enemy.
"I've been thinking," said Ingleborough, "that our


## p. 127 (#135) ############################################

IN THE THICK OF IT. 127
best way will be to strike off west, and after we are
over the river to make a good long détour."
West said nothing, but rode on by his com-
panion's side, letting his pony have a loose rein so
that the sure-footed little beast could pick its way and
avoid stones.
"I think that will be the best plan," said Ingle-
borough, after a long pause.
Still West was silent.
"What is it?" said his companion impatiently.
"I was thinking," was the reply.
" \Vell, you might say something," continued Ingle-
borough, in an ill~used tone. "It would be more lively
if you only gave a grunt."
"Humph!"
It was as near an imitation as the utterer could
give, and Ingleborough laughed.
"Thanks," he said. "That's a little more cheer-
ing. I've been thinking, too, that if we make this
détour to the west we shall get into some rougher
country, where We can lie up among the rocks of some
kopje when it gets broad daylight."
"And not go on during the day?"
"Certainly not; for two reasons: our horses could
not keep on without rest, and we should certainly be
seen by the Boers who are crowding over the Vaal."
West was silent again.
"Hang it all!" cried Ingleborough. "Not so much

as a grunt now! Look here, can you propose a better
plan?"
"I don't know about better, but I was thinking
quite differently from you."
"Let's have your way then.'
"Perhaps you had better not. You have had some
experience in your rides out on excursions with Mr.
1
Norton, and I daresay your plan is a better one than
mine."
"I don't know," said Ingleborough shortly. "Let's
hear yours."
"But——"
" Let's—hear—yours,'
and his voice sounded so harsh that West felt annoyed,
7
cried the other imperatively,
and he began:
"Well, I thought ofdoing what you propose at ?rst."
"Naturally: it seems the likeliest way."
"But after turning it over in my mind it seemed
to me that the Boers would all be hurrying across the
border and scouring our country, looking in all direc-
tions as they descended towards Kimberley."
"Yes, that's right enough. But go on; don't
hesitate. It's your expedition, and I'm only second."
"So I thought that we should have a far better
chance and be less likely to meet with interruption if
we kept on the east side of the Vaal till it turned
eastward, and then, if we could get across, go on north
through the enemy's country."

"Invade the Transvaal with an army consisting of
one of?cer and one man?"
"There!" cried West pettishly. "I felt sure that
you would ridicule my plans."
"Then you were all wrong, lad," cried Ingleborough
warmly, "for, so far from ridiculing your plans, I think
them capital. There's success in them from the very
cheek of the idea—I beg your pardon: I ought to
say audacity. \Vhy, of course, if we can only keep
clear of the wandering commandos—and I think we
can if we travel only by night—we shall ?nd that nearly
everyone is over the border on the way to the siege
of Kimberley, and when we stop at a farm, as we
shall be obliged to for provisions, we shall only ?nd
women and children."
"But they'll give warning of our having been there .
on our way to Mafeking."
"'No, they will not. How will they know that we
are going to Mafeking if we don't tell them? I'm afraid
we must make up a tale. Perhaps you'll be best at
that. I'm not clever at ?bbing."
"I don't see that we need tell the people lies,"
said West shortly.
"Then we will not," said his companion. "Per-
haps we shall not be asked; but if we are I shall say
that we are going right away from the ?ghting because
we neither of us want to kill any Boers."
" Humph ! " grunted West.


## p. 130 (#138) ############################################

130 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"\Vhat, doesn't that suit you? It's true enough.
I don't want to kill any Boers, and I'm sure you don't.
\Vhy, when you come to think that we shall be telling
this to women whose husbands, sons, or brothers have
been commandoed, we are sure to be treated as
friends."
"We had better act on your plan," said \Vest,
"and then we need make up no tales."
"W'ait a minute," said Ingleborough. "Pull up."
West obeyed, and their ponies began to nibble
the herbage.
"Now listen: can you hear anything?"
\Vest was silent for nearly a minute, passed in
straining his ears to catch the slightest sound.
"Nothing," he said at last.
"Nothing," said his companion. " Let'sjump down!"
\Nest followed his companion's example, and swung
himself out Of the saddle.
"Now get between the nags' heads and hold them
still. You and they will form three Sides of a square:
I'm going to be the fourth."
"What for?"
"To light a match."
"Oh, don't stop to smoke now," said \Vest re-
proachfully. "Let's get on."
"Who's going to smoke, Old jump-at~conclusions?
I'm going to carry out our plan."
Sarah/z! and a match blazed up, revealing Ingle-

borough's face as he bent down over it to examine
something bright held in one hand—something he tried
to keep steady till the match burned close to his ?ngers
and was crushed out.
"Horses' heads are now pointing due north," he
said. "Keep where you are till I'm mounted. That's
right! Now then, up you get! That's right! Now
then! Right face—forward!"
"But you're going east."
"Yes," said Ingleborough, with a little laugh, "and
I'm going with \Nest or by West all the same. \Ve
must keep on till we get to the railway, cross it, and
then get over the border as soon as we can."
"What, follow out my plan?"
"Of course! It's ten times better than mine. Look
here, my dear boy, you are a deal too modest. Recollect
that you are in command, and that my duty is to obey."
"Nonsense!"
"Sense, sir; sound sense. I've got enough in my
head to know when a thing's good, and you may
depend upon my opposing you if I feel that you are
going to act foolishly. Once for all, your idea's
capital, lad; so let's get on as fast as we can till day-
break, and then we can lie up in safely in the enemy's
country."
In due cOIIrse the railway was reached, a breeze
springing up and sweeping the sky clear so that they
had a better chance of avoiding Obstacles in the way,
9*

132 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
and as soon as they were well over the line the ponies
were kept at a canter, which was only checked here
and there over broken ground. This, however, became
more plentiful as the night glided away, but the rough
land and low kopjes were the only dif?culties that they
encountered on the enemy's side of the border, where
they passed a farm or two, rousing barking dogs,
which kept on baying till the fugitives were out of
hearing.
At last the pale streak right in front warned them
that daylight was coming on fast, and they searched
the country as they cantered on till away more to the
north a rugged eminence clearly seen against the sky
suggested itself as the sort of spot they required, and
they now hurried their ponies on till they came to a
rushing, bubbling stream running in the right direction.
"Our guide, Noll," said Ingleborough quietly; "that
will lead us right up to the kopje, where we shall ?nd a
resting-place, a good spot for hiding, and plenty of
water as well."
All proved as Ingleborough had so lightly stated;
but before they reached the shelter amongst the piled-up
masses of granite and ironstone, with shady trees growing
in the cracks and crevices, their glasses showed them
quite half-a-dozen farms dotted about the plain. They
were in great doubt as to whether they were unseen when
they had to dismount and lead their willing steeds into
a snug little amphitheatre surrounded by rocks and trees,

IN THE THICK OF IT. 133
while the hollow itself was rich with pasturage such
as the horses loved best, growing upon both sides of
the clear stream whose sources were high up among
the rocks. '
"You see to hobbling the ponies, Noll," said Ingle-
borough, "while I get up as high as I can with my
glass and give an eye to the farms. If we've been
seen someone will soon be after us. We can't rest till
we know. But eat your breakfast, and I'll nibble mine
while I watch. Don't take off the saddles and bridles."
West did as he was requested, and ate sparingly
while he watched the horses browsing for quite an
hour, before Ingleborough came down from the highest
part of the kopje.
"It's all right," he said. "Let's have off the saddles
and bridles now. Have you hobbled them well?"
"Look," said West.
"Capital. I didn't doubt you; but you might have
made a mistake, and if we dropped asleep and woke
up to ?nd that the ponies were gone it would be fatal
to your despatch."
"Yes; but one of us must keep watch while the
other sleeps."
"It's of no use to try, my lad. It isn't to be done.
If we're going to get into Mafeking in a business-like
condition we must have food and rest. Come, the
horses will not straggle away from this beautiful moist
grass, so let's lie down in this shady cave with its

soft sandy bottom and sleep hard till sunset. Then
we must be up and away again."
"But anxiety won't let me sleep," said West. "I'll
sit down and watch till you wake, and then I'll have
a short sleep while you take my place."
"Very well," said Ingleborough, smiling.
"What are you laughing at?" said \Vest, frowning.
"I was only thinking that you had a very hard
day yesterday and that you have had an arduous time
riding through the night."
"Yes, of course."
" \Yell, nature is nature! Try and keep awake if
you can! I'm going to lie ?at on my back and sleep.
You'll follow my example in less than an hour."
"I—will—-not!" said \Nest emphatically.
But he did, as he sat back resting his shoulders
against the rock and gazing out from the mouth of
the cave where they had made themselves comfortable
at the beautiful sunlit veldt, till it all grew dark as if
a veil had been drawn over his eyes.
It was only the lids which had closed, and then,
perfectly unconscious, he sank over sidewise till he lay
prone on the soft sand, sleeping heavily, till a hand
was laid upon his shoulder and he started into wake-
fulness, to see that the sun had set, that the shadows
were gathering over the veldt, and then that Ingle-
borough was smiling in his face.
"Rested, old man?" he said. "That's right. The nags

have had a splendid feed, and they are ready for their
night's work. I haven't seen a soul stirring. Come on!
Let's have a good drink of water and a feed, and by
that time we ought to be ready to start."
"We ought to cross the Vaal before morning,"
said \Vest.
"I doubt it," was the reply, "for it will be rather
a job, as we shall ?nd the enemy about there. If we
get across tomorrow night we shall have done well."
"But we shall never get to Mafekingv like this."
"It's going to be a harder task than you thought
for when you volunteered so lightly, my dear boy;
but we've undertaken to do it, and do it we will. It
isn't a work of hours nor days. It may take us
weeks. Come along! I'm hungry, and so are you."
"But tell me," said West, "how long have you
been awake?"
"Not aboveaquarter of an hour. \Ve must have
Sleep and rest as well as food. \Vhen we've had the
last we shall be ready for anything through the night."
And so it proved as they rode on properly re-
freshed, meeting with no adventure, but being startled
by the barking roars of lions twice during the night,
which came to an end as they reached a very similar
kopje offering just such accommodation as they had
met with on the previous morning.
"Hah!" said Ingleborough. "just enough prog
left for a rough breakfast. To-morrow we shall have

to begin travelling by day, so as to pay a visit to some
farm, for we can't do as the nags do, eat grass when
they can get it and nibble green shoots when they
can't. Now then, my dear Noll, the orders for to-day
are: sleep beneath this projecting shelf."
"But I say," said \Vest, a minute or so later, "is
your ri?e charged? You were wiping the barrels as
we rode along."
There was no reply, for Ingleborough was fast
asleep, and West soon followed his example.

CHAPTER XIII.
AFTER A LAPSE.
OLIVER WEST was sleeping soundly that night from
sheer fatigue; but all the same his slumber was
not pleasant, for though his body was resting his brain
was hard at work. '
Before an hour had passed he was conscious of
being cold, and in a dreamy way he felt that he ought
to do what under the circumstances was impossible:
that is to say, put more clothes over him, or, failing
them, as he had no more, roll himself over and over
in the blanket that he had brought strapped to his
saddle-bow and only thrown over him when he lay
down to sleep. But his body was so steeped in sleep
that he did not stir, and suffered from the freezing air
of the night—so tremendous a change from the torrid
heat of mid~day out on the veldt.
Later on, about midnight, the impression came
upon him that he could hear a lion far away, seeming
to make the earth quiver beneath him by giving forth
in the ?erce beast's strangely ventriloquial way its
awe-inspiring roar, so puzzling to the listener as to


## p. 138 (#146) ############################################

138 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
whether it is far off or near. And even in his dreamy
state West found himself doubting that it could be a
lion's roar that he heard so near to where civilisation
had driven off most of the savage beasts of the plain.
But the roar came again, nearer, and in his dreams he
felt sure that he was right, and he recalled, still sleeping,
the fact that now and then the king of beasts followed
one or other of the straggling herds of antelopes quite
close to the Boers' farms. Then the curious barking
roar ceased, and with it consciousness for some time.
All at once he found himself wide awake, lying
upon his back, and gazing straight up through the
transparent darkness at the stars. He lay for some mo-
ments wondering what had awakened him, perfectly
still, and listening intently for steps or the trampling of
horses, feeling sure that the Boers were close at hand.
Instinctively his hand was reached out to grasp the
rifle, which he had laid by his side and covered from
the dew or hoar frost, whichever might come, by
throwing over it part of his blanket.
As he touched it the cold perspiration began to
start from every pore, for there was a whiff of hot
breath upon his face, and he could dimly see that some
large animal was stretching down its muzzle towards
him, and for a few brief moments he lay as if para-
lysed, expecting to feel himself seized and dragged
away, for now came back with keen clearness the re-
collection of having heard the distant roaring of a lion.

AFTER A LAPSE. 139
He had hardly grasped this when once more, from
somewhere near, the lion's terrifying cry arose, evidently,
as he thought in a ?ash, one of the companions of the
huge beast at his side. In an instant now he had grasped
the truth, for as the distant lion roared there came
from his right the peculiar stumbling movement of one
of the hobbled horses striving to get closer to where
there would be human companionship, if not protection.
"Poor beast!" thought West, as his fascinated eyes
stared at the dim shape above him, so close that it
shut out from him the light of the stars.
Then the half-paralysed listener saw clearly, for the
beast raised its head and uttered a low whinnying cry,
which was answered from the direction where the other
hobbled pony was moving.
"Woho, my boy!" whispered West, with the blood
now tingling through his veins, and as the pony whinnied
softly again'West raised himself up with his ri?e in his
right hand and stretched out his left for it to come in
contact with the soft warm muzzle of his pony, which
pressed against it, the poor brute uttering a low sigh.
Quite a minute then passed, the two ponies re-
maining motionless, and West listening with every nerve
on the strain, knowing as he did that a lion must be
in very close proximity, and fully expecting every
moment that there might be a tremendous bound and
the savage brute would alight either upon him or
upon one of the poor shivering beasts.


## p. 140 (#148) ############################################

I40 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
Then, from evidently pretty close at hand, there
was a low muttering growl, the barrel of \Vest's ri?e
fell into his left hand as he held the weapon pistol-
wise and ?red low down in the direction of the sounds.
At the ?ash and in company with the report there
was a yelping snarl and a couple Of angry roars in
quick succession.
West ?red again as nearly as he could judge where
the beast would be, and the next moment Ingleborough
was kneeling by his side.
"\Vhat is it—lions?" he panted.
"Yes," whispered \Vest, whose ?ngers were busy
reloading, and he listened for the next sound, but only
to hear a deep sighing breath on either side, telling
that the horses had been too much terri?ed to start
away, or else felt that they would be safer with their
masters, and that to try to gallop Off meant the spring-
ing of a savage enemy upon their backs.
The silence continued for nearly a minute, and
then there was a vicious snarling, apparently some
?fty yards away, while without a moment's hesitation
Ingleborough raised his ri?e to his shoulder and ?red
as nearly as he could judge at the spot from whence
the noise came. He ?red twice, the shots being so
close together as almost to be like one for a while.
Then after a perceptible interval they were echoed from
the walls of a distant kopje, and again from another,
before they died away.

AFTER A LAPSE. I4 I
"That has startled the lions," said Ingleborough;
"but I'm afraid it will startle the Boers and bring them
to see what's the matter."
"Yes, the lions are gone," said West. "Hark at
that! \Vho says horses have no sense?"
For the crop, crop, amp of the browsing animals
had begun again from close at hand, and the comrades
stood listening for some little time while the Otherwise
unbroken stillness once more reigned.
"\Vhat's to be done?" said West. "Shall we make
a start at once, or wait for daylight?"
"I was thinking," replied Ingleborough. "If we
start now we have the advantage of the darkness to
hide us, but the disadvantage too, for we may go
blundering right into the midst of some commando. I
don't think the ?ring could do us any harm, after all,
for the enemy would not be able to tell where the
sounds came from. I think we had better stay where
we are and wait for morning."
"I think so too," said West, with a sigh ofrelief; "but
one of us ought to watch in case the lions come back."
"They will not come back!" said Ingleborough
decisively. "From what I know of their habits they'll
have been too much scared to risk their lives again.
You hit one of them; there's no doubt about that."
"You think there was more than one?"
"I should say it was a family party of an Old
lioness and two or three half-grown cubs."


## p. 142 (#150) ############################################

I42 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Then we may lie down and sleep again?"
"Yes; we must trust to our luck, Noll; there's a
good deal of chance in these affairs."
West hesitated for a few minutes, and then followed
his companion's example, lying awake for some time
thinking of what a strange change this was from his
quiet life in the of?ces of the company; and then, as he
began to ponder over what might be to come, the sub-
ject grew too dif?cult for him and he fell fast asleep.
But he was the ?rst to awaken in the grey dawn,
to ?nd that the horses were close at hand, browsing
away contentedly enough, and ready to neigh softly
and submit to his caress when he walked up to them;
while, as soon as he had satis?ed himself that they had
not suffered in any way, he walked in the direction in
which he had ?red during the night, to ?nd footprints
in several directions, and in one place the dust among
some stones torn up and scattered, as if one of the
brutes had fallen on its side and scratched up the earth.
Plainer still in the way of proof of what had happened,
there were spots and smudges of blood, giving thorough
evidence that one of the lions had been wounded by
the chance shot, and had fallen, and struggled ?ercely
to regain its feet. '
He had just arrived at this conclusion when Ingle-
borough found him.
"Hallo!" cried his companion; "that was a good
blind shot, Noll. \Nell done, lad! A full-grown lion

tool Look at its pads. It must have had a nasty
flesh-wound to have bled like this."
"Do you think it'll be lying anywhere near, half-
dead, or quite?"
"No! A cat has nine lives, they say; and really
this kind of beast is very hard to kill. Look, there
are the pugs, along with those of three more, all half-
grown, going right away yonder into the open veldt.
We might hunt 'em down, but we don't want to, eh?"
"Absurd! We want to get on at once. Can you
see any pug, as you call it, of Boers?"
"No. I've had a good look round, and as soon
as we've had a mouthful we'll be off. I say, it's wonder-
ful, isn't it, how one can sleep out here on the veldt?"
"Surrounded by dangersl" replied \Vest. Then
laconically: "Yes."
Their scanty meal was soon eaten and washed
down with a draught of pure water, after which they
both climbed to the top of the highest part of the
kopje to take a good survey of the surrounding plain.
"There's nothing in sight," said Ingleborough
quietly; "so we'll hurry on at once while our shoes
are good."
The ponies looked as fresh as ever when they
were saddled and ready to start, and after an exami-
nation of the compass Ingleborough pointed out that
they ought to keep along north-east to strike the Vaal
somewhere that evening, and then go along its south-

144 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
ern bank till a ford was reached, after which their
journey would be north by west.
"But we must be on the look-out for some lonely
farm today," said \Vest. "We ought to well ?ll our
haversacks before we start again."
"Never fear; we shall ?nd plenty of food for sale so
long as we have money to show the Boer ladies. Ready?"
"Yes," replied West, and together they sprang
into their saddles and rode down the slope, their horses
carefully picking their way among the stones, till the
open veldt was reached. They then struck off at a quiet
canter towards a rocky ridge so as to put that between
them and the kopje where they had slept, in case by
any possibility their shots had been heard and a party
of the enemy should ride up to it to make a search and
in the course of it see them in the distance riding away.
"And that would mean pursuit, a race, and the
fastest horses to win," said W'est.
"As they generally do when there is fair play,"
replied Ingleborough quietly. "Keep a sharp look-out
forward, and I'll keep on casting an eye back at the
kopje."
The ridge was only about a couple of miles dis-
tant from their previous night's resting-place, proving
to be fairly high, but with a gradual slope: while just
as they reached the spot where the ascent began Ingle-
borough turned in his saddle from a long look-out
backwards.


## p. 145 (#153) ############################################

AFTER A LAPSE. 145

"This is like wringing one's own neck," he cried.
"Now then, let's canter up this bit, and as soon
as we have topped it we need not be so cautious.
Ready?"
"Yes," cried \Vest.
"Then off! Steady! NO galloping; a gentle
canter."
It was fortunate for the pair that they did not
breathe their horses, but rode up the gentle Slope at
a regular lady's canter, to ?nd the ridge pleasantly
fringed with a patch of open woodland, through which
their steeds easily picked their way, and on to the
farther slope, which was more dotted with forest growth;
but there was nothing to hinder their rate of speed—
in fact, the horses began to increase the pace as a
broad grassy stretch opened before them.
The moment they passed out of the woodland on
to the open space West uttered a word of warning and
pressed his pony's Side, for the ?rst glance showed him
that they had come right upon a Boer laager which
was in the course Of being broken up. Oxen were
being inspanned, men were tightening the girths of their
ponies, and preparations were in progress everywhere
for an advance in some direction.

CHAPTER XIV.
MAN-HUNTING.
HATSOEVER this may have been, the sudden
appearance of the two fresh horsemen decided
the course of some thirty or forty, who stood about
for a few moments staring wonderineg at the pair
?ying down the descent, before mounting in some cases,
in Others seizing their ri?es and ?inging themselves
upon the ground to load rapidly and take aim.
"Mind how you go, I'oll!" shouted Ingleborough.
"A fall means being taken prisoner now!"
He had hardly shouted the words before the bullets
came buzzing about their ears like bees after disturbers
on a hot swarming day in old England.
"Take care!" cried West excitedly. "It will be
a long chase; so don't press your nag too hard. Lie
down on your horse's neck; the bullets are coming
more and more, and we shan't be safe for another
mile."
"Bah! It's all nonsense about their marksmanship,"
cried Ingleborough, who seemed to be suffering from


## p. 147 (#155) ############################################

MAN-HUNTING. 147
a peculiar kind of elation in which there was no feeling
of fear. "Let them shoot! \Ve're end on to them,
and have a clear course! They're trained to shoot
springbok, I suppose, when they get a chance; but
they haven't had much experience of galloping men.
Fire away, you cowardly brutes!" he roared, as if he
fancied that the enemy could hear him. "I don't
believe you could hit a runaway railway truck or a
cantering furniture-van, let alone a horse with a man
on its back."
"Ah!" cried West, at that moment, as he turned
from looking back and snatched off his broad-brimmed
hat. '
"Noll, boy, don't say you're hit!" cried Ingleborough
passionately.
"No," said West, drawing his breath with a peculiar
sound. "I've escaped; but I thought I'd got it! Ifelt
as if my hat was being snatched off, and something
touched my ear." -
"Turn your head this way!" said Ingleborough
huskily.
"Wait a moment!" replied \Nest, who had passed
his hat into his rein hand, to afterwards clap his right
to his head and draw it away.
"First blood to them!" he said, with a mocking
laugh.
"Here, we must ease up and let me bandage it,"
said Ingleborough.

"No, thanks: that's a likely tale with the bullets
flying like this! Keep on, man; we've got a fair start!
Let's get past those trees forward yonder; they'll shelter
us a bit!"
"But your wound, my lad?"
"They've only nicked the edge of my car. It will
stop bleeding of itself. There's nothing to mind!"
Ingleborough watched him eagerly as he spoke, and
seeing for himself that there was only a feeble trickle
of blood from the cut ear, he pressed on in the required
direction.
"Give me warning," he cried, "if you feel faint,
and we'll pull up, dismount, and cover ourselves with
our horses while we try what practice we can make
if they come on."
"If they come on!" said West bitterly. "Look
for yourself; they're already comingl"
Ingleborough turned his head sharply, to see that
a line of galloping men had just been launched from
the Boer laager to the right and left, and were stream-
ing in single ?le down the slope, leaving ample room
between them for their dismounted companions to keep
up a steady ?re upon the fugitives.
"That's their game, is it?" said Ingleborough, be-
tween his teeth. "Very well, then, we must make a
race of it and see what our picked ponies can do."
"That's right!" cried West. "Let's open out a
little!"


## p. 149 (#157) ############################################

MAN-HUN TING. 149
"Right, and give them less to aim at! The bullets
are ?ying wildly now. Ten yards apart will do."
They separated to about this distance, and at a
word from West each nipped his pony's ?anks with
his knees and rose a little in the stirrups, with the result
that the wiry little animals stretched out greyhound
fashion and ?ew over the veldt as if thoroughly enjoy~
ing the gallop.
"Steady! steady!" shouted West, at the end of ten
minutes. "We're leaving the brutes well behind, and
the bullets are getting scarce. Don't let's worry the
brave little nags! With a start like this we can leave
the Boers well behind."
Ingleborough nodded after a glance backward and
followed his companion's example, drawing rein so that
their steeds settled down into a hand-gallop, still leaving
their pursuers farther behind. The ground was now
perfectly level, stretching for three or four miles without
an obstacle, and then the horizon line was broken by
one of the many kopjes of the country, one which lay
right in their line of ?ight.
"What about that?" said West. "Shall we make
for it and get into shelter ready for using our ri?es?"
"I don't like it!" replied Ingleborough. "There
might be another party there, and then it would be like
galloping into another hornets' nest."
"I don't like it either," said West; "but we must
think of our horses, and by the time we get there half

of this pursuing lot will have tailed off, while I don't
believe the rest will come on if we shoot pretty true
from behind some rock."
"That's right!" said Ingleborough. "\Ve mustn't
let them keep us on the run, for the horses' sake."
"Look out!" said \Vest, in warning tones.
"What is it?"
"They're pulling up and dismounting," replied
\Vest. "Here come the bullets again."
For as he spoke the buzzing, whizzing notes of
danger overhead, which had for some minutes ceased,
began to utter their warnings again, but in a very ir-
regular way, which brought forth the remark from Ingle-
borough that their enemies' hands were unsteady from
their sharp ride.
"The more need then for us to get into a sheltered
place where we can rest a few minutes before they
can come up," said \Vest. "Let's have another Sharp
gallop and get well among the rocks: it will be riding
out Of range and getting more in advance before they
mount again."
"Right, general!" cried Ingleborough banteringly;
and once more they tore over the veldt, pursued only
by the bullets, for the following Boers had dismounted
to a man.
"Keep a little wider," said West, laughing outright
at his companion's word "general." "Don't let's give
them a chance by riding SO close together!"


## p. 151 (#159) ############################################

MAN-HUNTING. I 5 I
"Right! Fine manoeuvre!" replied Ingleborough;
and they went on' towards the kopje at full speed,
both feeling a wild kind of exhilaration as the wind
rushed by their cheeks, and the plucky little horses
stretched out more and more as if enjoying the race as
much as their riders.
Strange terms "exhilaration" and "enjoying," but
none the less true. For there was no feeling of dread,
even though the bullets kept on whizzing by them to
right, to left, in front, far behind; now high overhead,
and more often striking up the dust and ricochetting
into space, to fall neither knew where. Every leaden
messenger, it it reached its mark, meant a wound;
many would have resulted in death had they struck
the fugitives. But the excitement made the rush one
wild grati?cation, combined with a kind of certainty
that they would escape scot-free; and they laughed
aloud, shouting words of encouragement to their ponies
and cries of de?ance and derision at the unsuccessful
ri?emen.
"Why, we could do better ourselves, Noll!" cried
Ingleborough. "SO these are your puffed-up Boers
whom writers have put in their books and praised so
effusively! My word, what a lot of gammon' has been
written about ri?e-shooting! I believe that Cooper's
Deerslayer with his old-fashioned ri?e was a duffer
after all, and the wonderful shots of the trappers all
bluff."


## p. 152 (#160) ############################################

152 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Perhaps so!" shouted West, rather breathlessly;
"but these fellows can shoot!"
"Not a bit!"
"Well, my ear has stopped bleeding; but it smarts
as if someone was trying to saw into the edge."
"Never mind; it's only gristle !" said Ingleborough.
"I don't mind, but if the Boer who ?red that bullet
had only held his ri?e ahair's breadth more to the left
the scrap of lead would have gone into my skull."
"Of course; but then he did not hold his ri?e a
hair's breadth more to the left.-——By jingo!"
"What's the matter?"
"Don't quite know yet. It feels quite numb and
free from pain. I don't think I'm hit. I half fancy
the poor pony has it, for he gave a tremendous start.
All right; keep on! The bullet struck my rolled-up
blanket, and it has gone into the saddle. I can feel
the little hole."
"What a narrow escape!" cried \Vest anxiously.
"Come, you must own that they can shoot straight!
If that bullet had gone a tri?e higher it would have
gone through your loins."
"To be sure! and a little higher still, through
between my shoulders; a tri?e more, through the back
of my head; and again a tri?e more, and it would have
gone above me. As it is, there's a hole in my saddle,
and I'm all right."
"Thank Heavenl" cried West.


## p. 153 (#161) ############################################

MAN HUNTING. 153
"I did," said Ingleborough, "but in a quiet way!
Yes, lad, they can shoot; but it's a hard mark to hit—
a galloping man end on. They'd be better if we were
going at right angles to the shotl"
"Now then, another ?ve minutes, and we shall be
beyond the range of their ri?es."
"And in another you had better give the word to
slacken speed, for the ground will be getting rough.
Why not give it now? They've ceased ?ring."
"Ease down then to a gentle canter," cried West,
in reply, and their panting steeds were checked so that
for the last mile of their retreat they progressed at an
easy ambling pace which enabled the horses to recover
their wind, while the precipitous sides of the eminence
in front grew clearer to the eye and gave ample proof
of being able to furnish nooks which would afford
them and their horses security, while enabling the friends
a good opportunity for returning the compliment to
the Boers as far as bullets were concerned.
West said something to this effect after taking his
glass from where it was slung and looking back, to
see that the enemy was remounting and continuing the
pursuit.
"Not theyl" replied Ingleborough. "They're too
fond of whole skins to run risks! They'll lie down in
holes and corners to ?re at us, but they will not attack
us if we are well in cover, and they ?nd we can hold
our ri?es straight."


## p. 154 (#162) ############################################

154 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Then we must!" said \Vest quietly. "Only we
shall want a bit of rest ?rst, for my nerves are all of
a quiver, and the blood feels as if it was jumping in
my veins." '
"Come along then! We'll soon ?nd a place
where we can lie down behind the stones! The sooner
the better too, for I'm beginning to feel rather mur-
derous."
"Murderous!" cried West.
"Yes: don't you? I'm not going to be shot at
for nothing! Look here, Nolly, my lad, life's very
sweet, and I value mine. I'm peaceably disposed
enough, but these brutes have invaded our country,
and you've had proof that they are trying their level
best to make us food for the crows. Under the circum-
stances don't you think it's time for the lambs—meaning
us—to turn upon the butchers—meaning the Boers—
and let them feed the crows instead?"
"Don't talk in poetical metaphors, Ingle," said
\Vest, with a grim smile. "If it comes to the point,
we'll make our ri?es speak in a way that will keep
the enemy from stopping to hear the end of what they
have to say."
"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Ingleborough; "who's talk-
ing metaphorically now?"
"I've done," said West. "Walk!" he cried loudly,
and they drew rein, to let the ponies pick their way
up the commencement of a slope dotted with small

stones, while but a short distance farther on the front
of the castle-like kopje was gashed with little gorges
and ravines, offering plenty of places where horses and
men might hide.
"Rather awkward if we were to ?nd that there
were some more of the enemy here!" said West, as the
nature of the ground forced him to follow his companion,
instead of their riding abreast.
He had hardly spoken when it was as if a trumpet
had rung out a challenge from one Of the little gorges
in front, and West answered by shouting: "Right about
face!" and leading the way back. It was no trumpet,
but the loud neigh of a Boer horse, while shot after
shot was ?red as they galloped away, fortunately being
able to shelter themselves from the ?re by striking off
to the right as soon as they were clear of the stones,
the higher ones proving their salvation, being in the
way of the enemy's aim.
"Out of the frying-pan into the ?re!" cried Ingle-
borough; "and the ?re's going to be hotter than the
pan."
"Yes," cried West. "Give them their head!
Gallop right for the river now."

CHAPTER XV.
A DESPATCH-RIDER'S WORK.
" HURRAH!" cried \Vest, as soon as they were once
more well out in the open, their horses breathed,
and ready to answer to any demand made upon them
by their riders. "Keep abreast, and open out more.
Faster! faster! We have only a short start this time."
"But we'll make the best of it," cried Ingleborough,
between his teeth. "Bend down well! The ?ring has
begun!"
"It is speaking for itself," said West grimly, as
the buzzing whirr of the bullets began again, while
faintly heard there came, half smothered by the thud-
ding of their own horses' hoofs, the clattering of Boer
mounts being led out over the stones of the ravine in
which they had been hid.
"See any more of the old party?" cried West, as
they rode well out now on to the level.
"No; we've turned off so much that they are quite
in our rear."
"Then the way's clear for the river?"

A DESPATCH-RIDER'S WORK. 157
"If we can reach it, lad," said Ingleborough; "and if
we do it may be in ?ood, or impassable where we hit it."
"Or a hundred other things," cried \Vest angrily,
as they tore along at full gallop now, with the bullets
?ying round them.
"Don't begin to prophesy evil! I say we're going
to leave the Boers far behind and escape."
"I can't look at our chance in the same ?owery
light as you do, my boy," replied Ingleborough. "My
breakfast wasn't good enough to inspire me with so much
hope, and I should advise you to open your haversack."
"Nonsense! I could not eat now!"
"But you must be ready to if you don't begin,
my lad. My advice is that you get ready to eat those
sandwiches, for you mustn't let the good verbal meat
inside get into the enemy's hands."
Ingleborough had hardly spoken before his horse
suddenly checked, throwing him forward upon its neck
and nearly sending him off. But he clung to it des-
perately, while the poor beast's next act was to rear
up, pawing hard at the air. In spite of the dif?culty,
Ingleborough shuf?ed himself back into the saddle,
speaking encouraging words to the shivering animal,
which kept on pawing at the air for a few moments and
just gave its rider time to throw himself off sidewise
before it went right over backwards, struck out with
all four legs in the air, and then subsided—motionless.
West drew rein instantly as he tore by, and

cantered back, reckless of the whistling bullets which
were ?ying around.
"Beg their pardon!" cried Ingleborough, struggling
to his feet after a heavy fall. "I retract my words."
"Hurt?" cried West excitedly.
"Rather! Ground is pretty hard
"Here," cried West, leaping off; "jump into my
saddle, and I'll hold on by the mane and run."
"Nonsense! Absurd! Don't be a fool!" cried Ingle-
borough angrily. "The game's up for me! Jump up
and gallop again! Don't let the brutes take you too."
"Likely!" said West, taking out his handkerchief
and beginning to fold it bandage fashion. "Your
head's bleeding. Let me tie this round."
"Let it bleed!" cried Ingleborough angrily, and
'71
picking up his soft felt hat, which had fallen in the
dust, he stuck it on tightly. "That's bandagedl" he
said. "Now then, be off before it's too late."
"Ofeourse; that's just what you would have done!"
said West quietly.
"Never mind what I would have done," cried
Ingleborough angrily. "Ride for your life!"
"Do you take me for a Dutchman?" said West coolly.
"Oh, you fool—you fool! " cried Ingleborough, stamp-
ing his foot angrily. "You'll be too late! No, they're
dismounting. Now then, up with you and make a dash."
West gave a glance to right and left, to see that
some twenty of the enemy had leaped from their

horses and were advancing, while twice as many more,
who covered them with their ri?es, came slowly on,
shouting to him the Dutch for "Hands up!"
The position was perilous, though the chances
were even still about being taken or riding clear if he
went at full gallop; but West did not stir.
"No, thankye, old fellow," he said. "It would be
such dull work riding alone. What do you say to
taking cover amongst the bushes?"
"Bah! Cover for the front, and none for ?ank or
rear!"
"We could squat down back to back," said West
coolly, "and shoot a few of them ?rst. I want to
?ght the brutes with their own weapons."
"Once more, will you make a bolt of it?" cried
Ingleborough faintly.
"No——I-——will——notl" said West slowly and
distinctly, and then, making a dash, he caught his
comrade round the waist, letting him sink gently down
upon the sand and stones, for his legs had given way
and his face turned ghastly.
"Thanks, old man," said Ingleborough, with a
feeble smile and his eyes looking his gratitude.
He lay still now, with his countenance seeming to
grow ?xed and hard; but West opened his water-?ask
and poured a few drops between the poor fellow's
lips, when he began to revive at once, and lay per-
fectly still while his comrade removed his hat and

proceeded to bind the ready-folded handkerchief tightly
about the bleeding wound, caused by Sharp contact
with a stone when he fell.
"\Vest," groaned Ingleborough, recovering now a
little, "once more, lad, think, think; never mind me!
Mount; never mind the ?ring; ride for your life!"
"Once more, old fellow," said West, through his
teeth, "I won't leave you in the lurchl"
"But the despatches, lad. I am only one, and
they are to save a thousand."
"Ah!" cried West, springing to his feet as if the
object of his journey had been driven out of his head
by the excitement of the moment, and he took a step
towards his horse, just as, to his intense surprise, Ingle-
borough's mount suddenly threw up its muzzle, made
a plunge, and found its feet, Shook itself violently, and
whinnied, as if it had just recovered from being stunned.
- "Here, make one effort," cried West, seizing the
steed's bridle and leading it to where its rider lay.
"Look—your pony's all right again! Can you mount?"
"NO," said Ingleborough faintly, as he made an effort
to struggle to his knees, but only fell back with a groan.
"Can't! Feel as if my neck's broken and my Shoulder
numbed. Now will you make a dash while you can?"
West hesitated, and duty mastered friendship and
humane feeling for his companion. He was but one,
and the despatch might deal with the lives of a thou-
sand men in peril of their lives.

"Yes, Imust go!" he groaned, making for his
horse; but he was too late.
For though the Boers, apparently from a feeling
that they were quite sure of their prey, had advanced
slowly and cautiously, each man with his ri?e pre-
sented and ?nger on trigger, their movements showed
plenty of cunning. They had opened out so as to get
round the horses, watching the young man's actions
all the time, and when he at last made for his mount
they were close up, and ri?e-barrels bristled around,
every muzzle threatening and grim.
"Throw up your hands!" came in chorus from a
score of throats, and directly after the same order was
given in fair English by two of the ragged, unkempt,
big-bearded enemy.
West looked ?ercely round like a hunted animal
brought to bay by the hounds, waiting to seize the
?rst one that sprang, and ground his teeth with rage;
but he paid no heed to the men's words.
"Throw up your hands!" roared one of the men.
"Throw up your own!" said West de?antly, and
then to his bitter annoyance he started on one side,
for there was a ?ash, simultaneously a whizz close to
his face, and instantly the sharp report of a ri?e.
Recovering from the sudden shock to his nerves
caused by his previous unbelief that the enemy would
be so cowardly as to ?re upon a perfectly helpless
prisoner, West swung himself round to face the man
11

who had ?red at him from such close quarters 'that
the ?ash of the powder had scorched his cheek.
The Boer was busily thrusting a fresh cartridge
into the breech of his piece, and as he met the young
man's eyes he burst out into a coarse and brutal laugh.
"Throw up your hands, then, you cursed rooinek!"
he cried, "or I'll blow out your brains!"
"Not ifI die for it!" cried \Vest. "You cowardly
cur!" And turning as the Boers closed him in, he
continued, with bitter contempt, and speaking in their
own tongue: "I suppose you are a specimen of the brave
peasant farmers making a struggle for their liberty!"
"You keep a civil tongue in your head, young
man," growled out one of the party in English, "unless
you want to feed the crows!"
"You keep your cowardly gang in order ?rst be-
fore you dictate to me!" cried West, turning upon the
speaker sharply. "Do you call it manly to ?re at
close quarters upon a party of two?"
"No!" said the man shortly, as he turned round
and said a few angry words in the Boer jargon—
words which were received by some with angry growls,
while the major portion remained silent and sullen.
"You're not our cornet! Mind your own business,
before you're hurt!" cried the man who had ?red,
aking a few steps towards the spot where West stood,
and, seizing him savagely by the throat, he tried to
force him to his knees.

But he tried only with one hand—his left—his
right being engaged by his ri?e, and to his utter
astonishment the prisoner retorted by kicking his legs
from under him and ?inging him upon his back.
A yell of anger arose from some, and of delight
from others, all looking on while the discom?ted Boer
sprang up with a cry of rage, cocked his ri?e, and,
taking quick aim, would have ?red point-blank at the
prisoner had not his act been anticipated by the Boer
who had before spoken. Quick as thought he sprang
upon his companion, striking the presented ri?e upwards
with a blow from his own, and then grasping the in-
furiated man by the collar.
"None of that!" he cried ?ercely in Dutch. "Cornet
or no cornet, I'm not going to stand by and see a
cowardly murder done! We've got to ?ght, brother
burghers, but we'll ?ght like soldiers and men. Our name's
been stained enough by what has been done already."
"Here, you'd better go and ?ght for the rooineks,"
cried the discom?ted Boer ?ercely.
"I'm going to ?ght for my home and country,
brothers," cried West's defender, "the same as you
are: not help to murder a helpless boy who has be-
haved like a brave man."
The portion of the force who had seemed dis-
posed to side against the speaker were disarmed by
his words, and there was a general cheer at this, while
the cause of the trouble growled out: "You're a

traitor to your country, and the commandant shall
hear of this."
"No, no, no, no!" came in chorus. "Serves you
right."
\Vest made no resistance now, as his defender
signed to him to give up his ri?e, which, plus the
bandolier, was handed over with a sigh, Ingleborough's
having already been taken away.
The next thing done was to search the prisoners'
pockets—watch, purse, and pocket-book being taken
away, but the inner belts containing the greater part
of their money were entirely overlooked, while West
stood breathing hard, his face wrinkled up and an
agonising pain contracting his heart, for the Boer who
had defended him unbuttoned the ?ap of his haver-
sack, thrust in his hand, and brought out a couple of
cake loaves, and then, one after the other, two carefully
wrapped-up sandwiches, standing for a few moments
with them in his hand, hesitating, while Ingleborough,
who had recovered his senses, darted a meaning look
at his suffering companion.
"It's all over with our expedition!" he said to
himself. "Why didn't poor Noll eat his sandwiches?"
The moments were as agonising to him as to
West, who could only stand in silence; but, having
become somewhat versed in the tricks of those who
fought the law through his friendship. with Norton, an
idea crossed his mind, and turning in a faint appealing

way to the Boer who seemed to be holding in sus-
pense the scales of success and failure, he said: "Don't
take our bit of provisions away! We're prisoners;
isn't that enough?"
The Boer ?xed him with his eyes, noted his pallid
face and the blood trickling down from the cut caused
by his fall, and then, as if satis?ed and moved by a
feeling akin to compassion, he nodded his head, thrust
the cake and the sandwich-like papers back into West's
haversack, and let it swing again under the young
man's arm.
"Lucky for them we're not hungry!" he said, in
his own tongue, "or we shouldn't have left them much."
"Why don't you make them eat it?" cried the 'man
who had ?red. "For aught we know, it may be poisoned."
"Bah!" cried their friend, who had done the pair
so good a turn; "let them be!"
A couple of the Boers then approached with reins,
but, in spite of the opposition that had taken place,
the man who had taken West's part again interfered,
just as they proceeded to raise Ingleborough to bind
his hands behind his back.
"There is no need!" said the man sharply. "Can't
you see that he is tOO weak to stand? Help him upon
his horse, and one go on either Side to keep him in
the saddle."
Then turning to West, he continued: "Mount; but
you will be shot dOWn directly if you attempt to escape."

"I am not going to leave my friend," said West
coldly. "I could have galloped away had I wanted
to. Let me walk by his side to help him."
The man looked at the speaker searchineg and
then nodded, \Yest taking the place of one of the
Boers, who placed himself just behind him with ri?e
ready. Then the little party moved on" towards the
kopje where the prisoners had been surprised.
"How are you?" asked West, as soon as they
were in motion.
"I feel as ifI were somewhere else!" was the
half-laughing, half-bitter reply. "All use seems to
have been completely knocked out of me, and the
hills and kopjes go sailing round and round."
"That will soon pass off," said West, and then
after a short pause: "\Nell, we're prisoners after all.
It does seem hard now we have got so far! I wonder
where they'll send us?"
"It does not much matterl" said Ingleborough.
"Anywhere will do, if I can lie down and rest till this
dreadful swimming and confusion passes off. As soon
as it does we'll escape—to eat the sandwiches," he
added meaningly.
"If we can," said WeSt; "but don't talk about
them again! Oh, Ingle, I wish I had your sharp wits."
"Pooh! Where there's a will there's a way," said
Ingleborough faintly. "You might have escaped, but
as you insisted upon being taken to share my lot I

was obliged to do something, and now I must do
nothing but think of how to get away."
The effort of talking was evidently too much for
the poor fellow, and West con?ned himself to keeping
him upright in the saddle, from which he would cer-
tainly have fallen but for his comrade's willing arm.
West was so fully occupied by his task, the two
Boers offering not the slightest aid, that he paid no
heed to the fact that their captors led them right
round to the far side of the kopje, and then through
a narrow gap of the rocks into a natural amphi-
theatre, wherein there was ample room for the forma-
tion of a great laager, the wagons being arranged in
an irregular ellipse, thoroughly hidden from the veldt
outside, while the rocks of the kopje roughly formed
a rampart of vast strength, and apparently quite im-
pregnable.
West took in all he could as he and his com-
panion in misfortune were led through and within the
barricade of wagons to where the horses and cattle
were securely tethered, while a burst of cheering saluted
the returning party as soon as it was seen that they
had prisoners and a couple of likely-looking mounts. It
was a surprise, for no one journeying across the veldt
could for a moment have supposed that so secure a
natural stronghold existed behind the rocky barriers.
The next minute the prisoners saw their sturdy
ponies tied up to the tail of one of the great wagons,

so near that West began to wonder whether when dark-
ness came it would be possible to creep to their side, cut
them free, mount, and make a old dash for liberty.
But a glance at Ingleborough showed him that this
would be impossible, for the poor fellow had sunk
over Sidewise as soon as he had been lifted out of
the saddle, and lay perfectly inert and with his eyes
half-closed. \Vest knelt down by him and, taking his
slung water-bottle, he raised his injured companion's head
a little and began to trickle, a few drops at a time, a
little water between the sufferer's lips.
He was occupied in this way when he noted that
a large group of the Boers had approached, one of
whom, a short sturdy-looking individual, with swarthy
skin and thick black beard plentifully sprinkled with
grey, suddenly said, in good English: "What is the
matter with him—Shot? "
"NO," replied West. "His horse was struck, and
reared up, and my friend was thrown heavily upon
his head."
"Oh, is that all?" said the Boer nonehalantly.
"Let himv Sleep it off! But listen, you: we shoot pri-
soners who try to escape."
"I shall not try to escape and leave him," said
West coldly.
The Boer commandant, for such he proved to be,
gave him a keen look and then turned away to speak
to one of the men, the result of the orders he gave

being that Ingleborough was carried to one of the
wagons forming the laager, and \Vest ordered to follow
and wait upon his friend, who, after his injury had been
carefully bathed and bandaged, sank into a swoon-like
sleep, leaving West to sit thinking of their position
and pondering upon the fact that the two Basuto ponies
were tethered in Sight of where he sat, and that he
still had the treasured-up despatches safe.
His great trouble now seemed to be whether he
should conceal the papers about his person or leave
them in the haversack carelessly hung from the side
Of the wagon tilt, lest he should be searched again
and with a more serious result than the loss of watch
and purse.
Night came at last, with the dif?culty still unsolved,
and a yet more serious one to keep him awake.
It was this: Ought he to wait till well on in the
night, and then creep out by the sentry on duty out-
side, get tO one of the ponies, and try and steal away?
And the time glided on, with the question still
unanswered. There was the horse, and there was the
despatch; but there were also the Boers by the hundred,
hemming him completely in, and, even if he were dis-
posed to leave Ingleborough to his fate, any attempt
seemed to be mad to a degree.

. CHAPTER XVI.
AFTER A REST.
EST started up into wakefulness the next morning
from a dream in which he was galloping for his
life with the Boers in full pursuit, and then he sighed
and wondered when and how he had dropped asleep,
for he could only recall being miserable, awake, and
puzzled as to what to do, and then all seemed to have
become blank till he was awakened by his captors'
busy stir and the crackling of the ?res being lighted.
West's ?rst steps were to see to his companion,
who did not seem to have moved, and the ?rst feeling
was one of satisfaction; but directly afterwards he felt
uneasy, for Ingleborough seemed to be unnaturally
still, and a shiver ran through him as he leaned over
where his friend lay on the ?oor of the wagon, to place
a hand upon the injured man's forehead below the
bandage which made him look so ghastly. I
Then came reaction as it was proved that the
sufferer had only been in a deep sound sleep.
For Ingleborough's eyes opened, to gaze at him
wonderingly.

"\Vhat's the matter? Oh, it's you, Nolll"
"Yes; you startled me!"
"Eh? What did I do?"
"You lay so still!"
"Did I? Oh, of course. I've been very fast asleep,
I suppose. What time it is—nearly sundown?"
"No, it's morning—sunrise."
"I'm blessed! What, have I slept all night?"
West nodded and smiled. '
"Soun'dly, Isuppose!" he said. "But how are you?"
"Horriny stupid and muddled! I don't quite make
out! Oh yes, I do now. I came down such a quelch
that it knocked all the sense out of me, and my head
feels all knocked on one side. But tell me: what about
the despatch?" .
"I have it all right so far!"
"That's good. Where are our ponies?"
"Tied up yonder to the wheel of a wagon."
"That's good, too, lad! Then all we've got to do
is to help ourselves to them the ?rst chance and ride
away."
"Yes," said West drily, "the ?rst chance; but will
there be a ?rst chance?"
"Why not? It's of no use to look at the black
side of things! Where there's ill luck there's always
good luck to balance it, and we're bound to have our
share of both. We had the bad yesterday; the good
will come to-morrow, or next day, or the day after-

who knows? \Ve were not killed. You had your ear
nicked and I had a bad fall which will cure itself as
fast as the slit in your ear grows up. I call it grand
to have saved the despatch! Are they going to give
us any breakfast?"
"Hah!" sighed West; "you've done me good,
Ingle. I was regularly in the dumps."
"Keep out of them, then!" was the reply. "You
didn't expect to get your message delivered at Mafe-
king without any trouble, did you?"
"No, no, of course not! Then you think we might
make a dash for it some time?"
"Of course I do; but I don't suppose the chance
will come to-day. Let's hope that our next move may
take us nearer our goal, for I don't suppose the Boers
will take us with them. They'll send us prisoners to
Pretoria, I suppose; and we must make our dash some-
where on the road."
Ingleborough was right: the chance for the dash did
not come that day, nor the next, nor the next. For the
Boer commando did not stir from the natural stronghold
which had been made its halting-place. In fact, two
fresh parties, for which there was plenty of room,
joined them, and a good deal of business went on:
men going out on expeditions and returning: wagons
laden with provisions and ammunition and two big
?eld-pieces arriving, as if the force was being increased
ready for some important venture—all of which busy

preparation took place under the eyes of the two pri-
soners, who, while being fairly well treated in the way
of rations, were carefully guarded.
"One would like to know a little more what it
all means!" said Ingleborough. "As it is, one seems
to be quite in the dark!"
"And we're doing nothing!" sighed \Vcst. "Oh,
it's terrible! I must begin to stir, even if it is only to
bring about another check."
"What would be the good of that?"
"Ease to one's brain!" said West passionately.
"Here have I been trusted with this mission and am
doing nothing, while all the time the poor fellows at
Mafeking must be watching despairingly for the des-
patch that does not come."
"Look here, old lad," said Ingleborough sympa-
thetically; "when a fellow's chained down hand and
foot it's of no use for him to kick and strain; he only
makes his wrists and ankles sore and weakens himself,
so don't do it! Believe me, the proper time to act is
when they take you out of your chains! It's very
depressing, I know; but what can't be cured——J'
"Must be endured. I know, Ingle; but here we
are prisoners, and I can't help getting more hopeless."
"But you must! Things can't go on like this
much longer! Either our troops will come here and
attack the Boers, or the Boers will go and attack the

British. Just have patience and wait

"But here we are, just as we were nearly a week
ago, and nothing has happened."
"Oh yes, something has!" said Ingleborough, with
a smile. "I've got well again! The ?rst morning I
couldn't have mounted my pony and ridden off even
if they had brought it to the end of the wagon here
and said: 'Be off!' To-day I could jump on and go off
at full gallop. Do you call that nothing?"
"NO, of course not!" said West. "There, you
must forgive me! I'm very discontented, Iknow; but
you see why."
"To be sure I do! I say, though, you've been
at that satchel! The sandwiches are gone."
West nodded.
"Haven't eaten them, have you?"
"No, they're sewed up in the belt of my jacket.
I did it two nights ago, and I'm living in hopes that
they will not search us again."
"That's it, is it? Well, I'm glad you did that!
There, keep a good heart; something is sure to happen
before long!"
"I only hope it may; even evil would be better
than this miserable state of inaction. I think till I feel
half-mad."
"Well, we won't hope for the evil, only for some-
thing in the way of change, if it's only to pay a visit
to Pretoria gaol."
"What!"

"Only so as to get some news to give to old
Norton when we get back. It will interest him. I
wonder whether he's keeping his eye on Master Plump-
and-Pink. Well, I am blessed!"
"What is the matter? Are they making a move?"
cried West excitedly, for Ingleborough had sprung to
the end of their wagon prison to stand looking out.
"Someone has! " cried Ingleborough angrily. "Look
here! Why, old Norton must have been asleep."

CHAPTER XVII.
BAD SHILLINGS ALWAYS COME BACK.
EST stepped to his companion's side, looked out
between the rough curtains of the wagon, and
saw a group of mounted Boers surrounding a freshly-
arrived wagon with its long team of bullocks, the
black voorlooper at the head and the driver with his
enormous whip on the box.
"\Vell," said West, after a sharp glance, "there's
a fresh load of provisions, I suppose! What of it?"
"Rub your eyes, lad, and look again."
"They don't want rubbing."
"Well, of all the fellows! Look there, beyond
those mounted men who escorted the wagon in—there
where the commandant and the dismounted party are
talking together."
"Yes, I see Where you mean; but what has it to
do with us? Idon't—yes, I do. Why, it's Anson!"
cried West excitedly.
"Anson it is! I began to think you were going
blind!" '

"But how strange! They have taken him prisoner
then. Look here; we're not going to have him with us."
"It doesn't look as if he is a prisoner," said Ingle-
borough; "they all seem too friendly. I believe the
scoundrel has deserted from the town and come to
join the Boers. What has old Norton been about?"
"Is it possible?"
"Oh, it's possible enough, if old Norton has been
to sleep. Rats desert sinking ships 1"
"Kimberley isn't a sinking ship!" said West
indignantly.
"I don't know so much about that, lad! There
is a very small force ready to defend it; it's a long
way from help; and, as we see here, the enemy is
swarming down upon it from all directions. You see,
it's so far from our forces and so near to the Free
State border."
"Ah, there he is plainly enough, laughing with the
commandant! Look, he clapped him on the shoulder!"
"Yes, I give him credit for anything!" said Ingle-
borough. "I shouldn't wonder if he was in full
correspondence with the Boers and is ready to sell
us as well as buy diamonds. As likely as not, he has
slipped away with his swag so as to escape before
the ?ghting begins. But how Norton can have let him
get away is more than I can understand!"
"Well, it's plain enough that he's here!" said
West; "and I can't help feeling glad that he is not a

prisoner, for if he had been put with us it must have
come to a quarrel. Look here, seeing what the
treacherous thief is, we ought to denounce him to the
commandant."
"Don't do anything of the kind! What good would
it do?"
"But he is such a despicable wretchl"
"What's that to you?"
" Ingleborough! "
"Oh yes, I know what you're ready to say; but
you've got something else to do besides playing the
virtuous part of denouncing Master Anson as a dia—
mond-dealer. Besides, I don't believe the Boers would
think any the less of him if they believed you."
"They couldn't help believing our evidence!" said
West. '
"Nonsense! It isn't your business!"
"It's every honest man's business!" cried West hotly.
"Not if he is on Government service with a des-
patch to deliver in Mafeking," said Ingleborough, with
a peculiar look at his companion.
"Hah!" cried West; "you are right again! But—
oh!"
"Oh, what?"
"Why, he was present when we volunteered to
carry the despatchl"
"To be sure, so he was!" cried Ingleborough ex-
citedly. ' ' f;

"Then as soon as he knows we have been cap-
tured he'll denounce me to the commandant as the
bearer of the message, and oh, Ingle, we shall be
searched again!"
"Yes," was the thoughtful reply; "and you've got
it on you. We might change jackets, but that would
be no good. Could you rip it out of yours?"
"Yes, Of course, in a few moments."
"Then you'd better."
"Not now; it's too. late. We must wait for a
better opportunity."
"But——-—"
"No, no, I tell you," cried West excitedly; "look,
he's not a prisoner. The scoundrel has recognised us
and is coming here. Why, Ingleborough, he's a traitor
——-a rebel. No wonder he got through the Boer lines.
Look! there can be no doubt about it; he has joined
their side. Those men, the Boer leaders, the com-
mandants and ?eld cornets, cannot know that he is a
thief."
"But they soon shall!" answered Ingleborough
hoarsely.
"No, no, keep quiet," whispered West; "he's
laughing with them and coming here. Don't say a
word; wait! It's my advice now."
"If I can!" muttered Ingleborough. "The skunk!
He's sending the blood dancing through my veins! He
must be denounced, and if he begins to say a word

about your volunteering to bear the despatch I'll let
him have it hot and strong."
"Why, you seem to have completely turned your
coat!" said West bitterly.
"I have! What we have just been saying has
stirred up all my bile. But I wish I could turn your
coat too—out of the wagon."
"Why not?" said West, as a thought occurred to
him, and running to the other end of the vehicle,
stripping off his jacket as he did so, he thrust out his
head and called to the sentry whose'duty it was to
guard against any attempt to escape.
"What is it?" said the man quietly.
"Take my coat and hang it on the rocks yonder,"
he said. "I've been sleeping in it night after night,
and it's all fusty and damp. Out yonder, right in
the sun."
The request was so simple and reasonable that
the man nodded, took the jacket, and was turning to
go away.
"Don't let anyone meddle with it," said West;
"it's my only one, and I don't want a Kaf?r to carry
it off."
"He'd better not try!" said the Boer, with a
meaning laugh, and he bore the jacket right away to
where the sun was beating hotly upon the rock, where
the next minute the garment was spread out.
"Talk about me having a ready wit in an emer-

gencyl" said Ingleborough merrily; "why, I'm a baby
to you, West, my son! There: I'm proud of you."
"Oh, but the risk!" whispered the young man.
"That precious garment lying carelessly yonderl"
"Carelessly? That's just the way to keep it safe.
Who'd ever think of examining the coat lying out
there?" '
"The ?rst man who goes near it!"
"The ?rst rogue, and he'd only feel in the pockets.
But there's no fear: that sentry would ?re at any thief
who tried to steal! That's safe enough!"
"I wish I could think so!" replied West. "The
?rst thing when they come will be to ask me what I
have done with my jacket."
"Pooh! In that loose, dark ?annel shirt they'll
never think of it. I thought they'd have been here,
though, before now."
They had to wait for some little time still, for
the Boers had gathered about the new-comer, forming
a half-circle, evidently to listen while Anson talked to
them earnestly, his gesticulations suggesting to Ingle-
borough, rightly or wrongly, that he was describing
the arrangements for defence made by the British
garrison at Kimberley, which he had so lately left;
and as he spoke every now and then the listeners
nodded, slapped the stocks of their ri?es, turned to
make remarks to one another, and gave the speaker
a hearty cheer.

182 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Oh, you beauty!" growled Ingleborough. "I
can't hear a word you say; but I'm as certain as if I
were close up that you're telling those chuckle-headed
Dutch that all they've got to do is to march straight
in and take Kimberley, for they'll ?nd it as easy as
kissing their hands."
"If he is telling them the weak points it's down-
right treason," said VVest bitterly, after a glance out
of the wagon in the direction of the rocks on which
lay his jacket.
"It's stand him up with a ?ring party, and a
sergeant with a revolver to ?nish the work if it isn't
quite done," said Ingleborough. "The cowardly scoun
drel: he'll be getting his deserts at last! Isay, though,
isn't it sickening? A blackguard like that, who doesn't
stop at anything to gain his ends!"
For Anson had ?nished speaking and the Boers
had closed round him, patting him on the back and
pressing forward one after the other to shake his hand,
while he smiled at them in his mildest, blandest way.
After a few more friendly words the ex-clerk began
slouching slowly up, followed by half-a-dozen of the
principal men, till he was close to the tail of the
prison wagon where West and Ingleborough were
seated trying to look perfectly indifferent, but the
former with his heart beating heavily and a ?ush com-
ing hotly into his cheeks, when the Boers stopped short,
leaving Anson to speak, listening the while as if they

anticipated a little amusement from their new friend
the informer hailing the prisoners in the wain.
"Hullo!" cried Anson, with one of his most irri-
tating smiles—one full of the triumph over them he en-
joyed and the contempt he felt, "hullo! Who'd have
thought that the virtuous West and the enthusiastic
sham detective Ingleborough would have come out
here to join the Boers? But don't tell me. I know: I
can see how it is. You've both been bled, and that's
let some of the bounce out of you."
He stopped for a moment for those he insulted
to reply, but as they both sat looking at him in cool
contempt he went on jeeringly: "The Boers know
what they're about, I see. When a horse has the
megrims they bleed him in the ear, and judging that
the same plan would do for a donkey they've bled
cocky West there, and bull-headed Ingleborough on
the Skull."
West's face grew of a deeper red, and he drew
in a long deep breath, for those of the Boers who
understood English burst into a hearty laugh at this
sally of the renegade's.
"Well, I'm glad of it!" continued Anson, taking
the Boers' laughter as so much approval. "It was all
you wanted, Bully West, and I daresay, now that you've
come to your senses, you'll make a decent Boer. There,
I'll give you a recommendation for a clerkship, for you
do really write a decent hand."

"Say thanks," growled Ingleborough, with a sneer
which told of his contempt; "he will no doubt have
plenty of interest. He has come up to lead the Boer
army's band and give lessons on the ?ute."
Anson started as if he had been stung.
"Quiet, man, quiet!" whispered West to Ingle-
borough; but it was in vain.

PEOPLE make their plans in cold blood and forget
all about them when the blood grows hot.
It was so here. West had made up his mind
what to do while cool, but acted just in the fashion
he had cried out against to his companion.
For as soon as Anson lounged up to them in his
supercilious jaunty way, West's cool blood warmed,
grew hot at the scoundrel's contemptuous look of
triumph, and at the insult respecting the Boers boiled
over.
"How dare you!" he raged out. "Keep your
distance, you contemptible cur, or, prisoner though I
am, I'll give you such a thrashing as shall make you
yell for mercy!"
"Hullo! What does this mean?" said one of the
Boer of?cers, closing up, followed by the others.
"The prisoner is a bit saucy!" said Anson con-
temptuously. "You did not bleed him enough!"
"You know these two?" asked the of?cer.

186 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Well, in a way," said Anson, in a haughty, in-
different tone. "They were a pair of underlings where
I was engaged at the diamond-mines. Insolent bully- .-
ing fellows, both of them! But you'll tame them down."
The Boer leader nodded.
"A bit sore at being taken prisoners!" he said.
"No," cried \Vest; "it is the fortune of war, sir.
\Ve are Englishmen, and we made a dash to escape
Kimberley, and got through your investing lines." '
"To carry despatches to the rooineks?"
"No," replied W'est. "Your men searched us and
found no despatches." Y
"Messages then. You were going to the British
forces?"
"We should have joined them after a time, per-
haps," said West, speaking more coolly.
"He's lyingl" said Anson sharply. "Have them
searched again!"
The Boer commandant nodded, gave the order,
and half-a-dozen of his men came forward, after which
the prisoners were ordered out of the wagon, and they
let themselves down, when they were thoroughly
searched from head to heel—of course, without result,
and the Boer chief turned frowningly to Anson.
"They must have hid the letter somewhere about
the wagon then!"
"Two of you get in and search!" said the com-
mandant.

This was carefully carried out, and the men de-
scended.
"Then they must have destroyed their message
before you took them," cried Anson, "or somehow since."
"They were carefully searched as soon as they
were taken," observed one of the ?eld-comets.
"Yes," said the commandant, "and I saw it done.
Well, they will not carry any news to Mafeking. Tell
them that the British are being swept into the sea east
and south, and their rule is at an end. I want brave
men who can ride and ?ght, so if they like to join the
Federal forces and do their duty there will be a pros-
perous time for them. If they refuse there will be a
long imprisonment, perhaps something worse."
"Mr. Anson, the renegade, need not trouble him-
self, sir," said West quietly. "Neither my companion
nor I will do as he has done."
"You had better!" said Anson sneeringly. "It's
a grand chance for you now your characters are gone
and the I. D. detectives are after you."
Ingleborough looked at the speaker sharply; but
Anson made believe not to notice it a..d went on.
"You've no character now, either of you," he
continued coolly. "Old Norton came after me as I
was trekking south, utterly sick Of the English lot. He
came on the old pretext: that I had bought diamonds
and was carrying them off. He searched again, and
then I told him the simple truth—that you two had

volunteered to carry despatches so as to get clear off
with the swag you had acquired—after accusing me;
but he professed not to believe me, and took me back
to Kimberley, but the very next day he started off
with half-a-dozen men to fetch you back, and I came
away."
"With the diamonds you had hidden?" said Ingle-
borough sharply.
' "Perhaps," replied Anson coolly. " So, you see, you
had better join our party, for even if you escaped it
would only be for the police superintendent to get hold
of you both, and if he did, you wouldnt' ?nd him such
an excellent friend."
"Wants thinking about!" said Ingleborough drily.
"But 'our' party—'our'?"
"Yes," said Anson coolly. "I've made up my
mind to belong to the right owners of the country for
a long time past. we've got the gold at Johannes-
burg, and the diamonds at Kimberley are ours by
right, and we're going to have them."
There was a murmur of satisfaction from the
Boers at this, and Anson went on nonchalantly: "That
is one reason why I consented to serve the company
in such a beggarly position. I wanted to learn all I
could about the mining so that it might come in useful
when we of the Boer party took possession."
"And then, I suppose," said Ingleborough, "you'll
expect to be manager-in-ehief?"

THE RINGING OF THE SHILLING. 189
"\Vell, I don't go so far as that," said Anson;
"but, with my knowledge of the management of the
mining business, I feel sure my Boer friends will ?nd
it to their advantage to retain me high up on the staff.
You see, there are so many things in the way of check-
ing losses which I have mastered."
"Stopping the illicit diamond buying and selling,
for instance," said Ingleborough sarcastically.
"Exactly!" replied Anson, apparently without
noticing the sarcasm; "and I've been thinking that no
doubt I could put a good thing in both your ways.
Of course, we have been bad enough friends; but I'll
pass over all that if you'll serve me as faithfully as
you did the company. What do you say?"
"Say?" cried West.
"Stop! Hold hard, Oliver!" cried Ingleborough,
stopping him short; "this is a thing that can't be
settled in a minute. We want time. All I say now,
Mr. Anson, is that I'm glad we bear such a good
character, seeing that we are illicit diamond-dealers
escaping with the plunder that we haven't got."
"Exactly!" said Anson. "Very well, then, I'll
give you till to-morrow night to think it over, and
you'll soon see which side your bread's buttered."
"Don't stop me, Ingle," said West hotly. "I
can't stand this. I must speak. This—--—-"
A sharp report from behind the wagon checked
further words, and every man made a rush for this place

or that in full expectation that a sudden attack had
been made upon the laager within the rocky walls.
At the same moment a Kaf?r of the blackest type
and with his hair greased up into the familiar Zulu
ring bounded into sight, tripped, fell upon his hands,
sprang up again, ran on, and disappeared, whilst a rush
was made for the man who ?red, leaving Anson and
the prisoners together.
The next minute West's blood felt as if it was
running cold in his veins as he saw, only a few yards
from him and close to the stone upon which his jacket
had been stretched, the sentry slowly re-loading his
pistol. But the coat was gone.
West had hard work to repress a groan.
"My orders were to ?re at anyone I saw stealing,"
said the man surlily, and West heard every word.
"Well, who was stealing?" asked one of the of?cers.
"A Kaf?r," replied the sentry. "I'd got a jacket
stretched out upon the stones yonder, to get aired in
the sunshine, and I only took my eyes off it for a
minute, when I saw a foot rise up from behind a
stone, grab hold of the coat with its toes——'
"Nonsense!" cried the of?cer; "a foot could not
do that!"
"Not do it?" said the man excitedly. "It had to
do it; and it was creeping away, when I ?red, and
the black sprang up and ran."
"Where's the jacket?"

THE RINGING OF THE SHILLING. ' 191
r The of?cer's question woke an echo in West's
breast, and he started, for it was just as if the question
was repeated there, and it seemed to be echoed SO
loudly that he fancied those near must have heard it.
"He's got it, I suppose," said the sentry coolly.
"Carried it away, and a bullet too somewhere in his
carcass."
A miserably despondent feeling attacked West at
these words, for he had clung to the hope that he
might be able to recover the despatch, succeed in
escaping and delivering it in safety, however late; while
now the desire to get away died out, for how could
he return to Kimberley and confess that he had failed?
He turned to glance at Ingleborough, who met
his eyes and then shrugged his shoulders as much as
to say: "It's a bad job, and I pity you."
At that moment a hand was clapped heavily upon
West's shoulder, and the Boer who had saluted him
so roughly pointed to the wagon, and he saw that his
companion was being treated in the same way, while,
the scare being over, upon their walking back and
preparing to climb in, they were called upon to stop.
Naturally the prisoners obeyed, and, turning, they
found the group of Boers in earnest conversation once
more with Anson, who at the end of a few minutes
nodded decisively and approached his two Old fellow-
clerks, making West's heart begin to thump with ex-
citement and his eyes gleam, for the despair he felt

at the loss he had sustained made him ready to turn
?ercely upon the ?rst enemy who addressed him.
"Take it calmly!" whispered Ingleborough. "Let
me diplomatise. You'll do no good by making a row."
"Take it calmly!" whispered back West, "and at
a time like this! I can't!"
"Look here, you two," said Anson coolly. "Let's
have no more bones about the matter. These gentlemen
say they have too much to think about to bother over
any shilly-shallying on the part of a couple Of priso-
ners. You know it's a good chance, and I've told
them you'll both join along with me. just tell them
out and out you will."
"You miserable renegade, how dare you!" cried
West ?ercely.
"Here, what does that mean?" cried the Boer
commandant sharply.
"Shamming!" replied Anson, with a contemptu-
ous laugh. "They're going to join us, knowing, as
they do, that the game is all up at Kimberley; but
they put on all this make-believe. They want to be
able to say that they were forced to serve, so as to
hedge—so as to make it all comfortable with their
consciences, as they call them."
"It is false!" cried West furiously—"a tissue of
lies! Don't believe him; this man is no better than
a miserable contemptible thief!"
"What!" shouted Anson, lowering the ri?e he

carried and taking a step forward with what was in-
tended to be a ?erce aspect.
But he only took one step, being checked suddenly
by the action of West, who, regardless of the weapon,
sprang at him, and would have wrenched away the
ri?e had he not been seized by a couple of the Boers,
who held him fast.
"Pooh! I don't want to shoot the wretched cadl"
said Anson contemptuously. "An old fellow~clerk of
mine! He's savage and jealous of my position here!
He always was an ill-tempered brute!"
"But he says that you are a thief!" said the Boer
commandant sternly.
"Pooh! A spiteful man would say anything!"
cried Anson contemptuously. "Look here, sir, I've
watched the Boer troubles from the ?rst: I've seen
how the English have been trying to ?nd an excuse
for seizing the two republics: I know how they got
possession of the great diamond-mines by a trick ar-
ranged with the surveyors of the boundaries."
There was a low murmur of assent here from the
gathering crowd of Boers who had now surrounded him.
"Yes," he said, raising his voice, "I knew all the
iniquities of the British Government—how the English
had seized the diamond-?elds, and how they were
trying to get the gold-mines, and as soon as the war
broke out I made up my mind to join the people
?ghting for their liberty."
13


## p. 194 (#206) ############################################

194 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
There was a burst of cheering from the few who
could follow the speaker, and then a roar as soon as
his words were explained to the crowd, while Anson
looked round with his fat face growing shiny, as he
beamed upon his hearers.
"Yes," said the Boer leader coldly; "but this
young man, who knows you, charges you with being
a thief."
"All cowardly malice!" cried ,Anson contemptu-
ously, and giving his ?ngers a snap. "A thief ?—a
robberP—nonsense. Pooh! I only dealt in and brought
away with me a few of the stones, which were as
much mine as theirs. I was not coming away from
the enemy empty-handed. I said to myself that I'd
spoil the Egyptians as much as I could, and I did."
There was a shout of delight at this, and one of
the ?eld-comets gave the speaker a hearty slap on the
shoulder.
"Yes, I brought some away," continued Anson,
rejoicing fatly in the success of his words; and, raising
his voice, he said, ?rst in English and then in Boer
Dutch: "I brought some away, and I wish I had
brought more."
There was a fresh and a long-continued roar of
delight, repeated again and again, giving the speaker
time to collect his thoughts, and as soon as he could
gain silence he continued.
"Look here," he said: "I came and joined the

Boers because I believed their cause to be just; and
I said to myself, knowing what I do of the secrets of
the diamond-mines, I will be the ?rst as soon as
Kimberley is taken to show the commandants where
the British tyrants have hidden away the stones that
belong of right to the Boers, the stones that have
been stolen from the earth—the land they fought for
and won with their blood from the savage black scum
who infested the country. I know where the stones
are hidden away, and I can, if you like, lead you to
what the British think you will never ?nd. But if you
are going to believe the words of this malicious boy,
and consider me to be a common thief, I've done.
You can have the few paltry stones I brought away
to sell and pay for my bread and meat till the war
is over, and let me go. I don't want to act as your
guide into Kimberley! It's nothing to me! I have
told you what I did; and what is more, I'd do it
again!"
"Yes," said Ingleborough, in a whisper to West,
as he sat holding his hand to his injured head: "I
believe him there."
West nodded, and the next minute they saw
Anson being led away in triumph by a crowd of
Boers; but the commandant, with half-a-dozen more
who seemed to be of?cers, and the man who had de-
fended them when they were captured, remained close
by the prisoners, talking together.

## p. 196 (#208) ############################################

196 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
Soon after, the commandant approached them,
glanced at Ingleborough, who lay back, evidently in
pain, and then turned to West: "You heard what
your Old friend said?"
"Yes," replied West.
"It is all true?"
"His base confession is," said West boldly. "The
man is a detected illicit diamond-dealer."
"He only bought what the British wrongly claimed!"
said the Boer warmly. "What right had they to
make laws forbidding people to buy what was freely
given up by the earth for the bene?t of all?"
"It is of no use for me to argue about the mat-
ter!" said West coolly. "I shall never convince you,
and you will never convince me."
"Oh yes, I should, after you had come to your
senses! There, we are not brutes, only men ?ghting
for our liberties, and I like you, for you are brave
and manly. Why not join our cause? It is just."
West looked the Boer full in the eyes, thinking
the while that the man spoke in all sincerity and be-
lief that his cause was right.
"Well, what do you say?" cried the Boer.
West tightened his lips and shook his head.
The Boer frowned and turned to Ingleborough.
"Well," he said, "you join us, and you will not
repent. Prove faithful, and you will gain a place OI
trust among us!"

West listened for his comrade's reply.
"Oh, I can't join without him," said Ingleborough.
"He's master, and I'm only man!"
"Then he was bearer of the despatch—What that
man Anson said was true?"
"Oh yes, that part of his story was true enough."
"That you were despatch-riders on the way to
Mafeking—you two?"
"Quite right."
"And you two had been diamond-dealers, and
brought away a quantity?"
"just as many, as we schoolboys used to say, as
you could put in your eye with the point of a needle.
All a lie! Anson was putting his own case. All we
brought away was the despatch."
"Then where is it?" said the Boer sharply.
"I don't know; I was not the bearer," said Ingle-
borough quietly.
"But you know where it is now?"
"I—do—not," said Ingleborough ?rmly. "I have
not the slightest idea where it is!"
"Then you have sent it on by someone else?"
"No," said Ingleborough. "There, you know that
we have failed, and if you set us at liberty, all we can
do is to go back to Kimberley and say what has
happened." _
"You will not go back to Kimberley," said the
Boer, speaking with his eyes half closed, "and if you

did it would only be to go into prison, for the Dia-
mond City is closely besieged, and if not already taken
it will in a few days be ours. There, go back to
your wagon, and spend the time in thinking till Isend
for you again. The choice is before you—a good
position with us, or a long imprisonment before you
are turned out of the country."
He pointed towards their temporary place of con-
?nement, and then turned away, while a couple of
the Boers marched them to the wagon and left them
in the sentry's charge.

NCE more in the wagon, one or a pair of despon-
dent prisoners, hot in temper as well as in per-
son with the excitement of what he had so lately gone
through, West cast himself down upon the ?oor ready
to groan, while his more experienced, harder comrade
sat down cross-legged to think.
"If I only knew where the coat was!" said West,
with a groan.
"Hah!" sighed Ingleborough. "I'm afraid it's
gone for ever! That Kaf?r was one of the Boers'
slave-like servants, of course, or he wouldn't have been
in the camp; and after the attempt at theft, if he was
not too badly wounded, he would bolt right off for his
own people. It's a sad business, old lad: but I don't
think you need fear that it will fall into the Boers'
hands."
"No, I don't fear that!" replied West. "But it is
the misery and shame of the failure that worries me!
I did so mean to succeed!"
"Hah! Yes," sighed Ingleborough again; "but

someone said—hang me if I know whol—"Tis not in
mortals to command success.' You're only a mortal, old
fellow, and you must make the best of it."
West groaned.
"It's horribly hard; just, too, as I had hatched
out a way of escape," continued Ingleborough.
"I don't want to escape now."
"What? You don't mean to join the Boers as
old Fat Face suggested?"
"Why not?" said \Yest dismally. "I dare not go
back to Kimberley."
"You daren't turn traitor to your country, and,
though you feel right down in the dumps, you dare
go back to Kimberley and walk straight to the Com-
mandant and speak out like a man, saying: 'I did
my best, sir; but I failed dismallyl'"
"Ah!" sighed West.
"And he would reply: 'Well, it's a bad iob, my
lad; but it's the fortune of war.'"
West held out his hand as he sat there tailor-
fashion by his friend in the bottom of the wagon, and
there was a warm grip exchanged.
"Bravo, boy! You're coming round! I knew it.
You only wanted time."
"Thank you, Ingle! Now then, what was your
idea of escaping?"
"Oh, a very simple one, but as likely to succeed
as to fail."

"Tell me at once! It will keep me from think-
ing about that miserable despatch."
"And the jacket! You and I will have to take
turn and turn with mine when the cold nights come,
unless we pretend to lovely Anson that we are going
to stop, and ask him to get you a fresh covering for
your chest and back."
"Oh, none of that, Ingle! I can't bear lying
subterfuges. I'd sooner bear the cold of the bitter
nights."
"Don't use big words, lad! Subterfuge, indeed!
Say dodgeéa war dodge. But about my plan! You
have noticed that for some reason they have not taken
our ponies away."
"Yes, they are still tethered to the wheel or that
wagon. What of that? It would be impossible to get
to them and ride out unchallenged."
"Oh no: not my way!"
"What is your way?" said West excitedly.
"Last night was dark as pitch."
"Yes; but there are double lines of sentries about."
"With sharp eyes too; but there was a commando
rode out, evidently to patrol the country and look out
for our people."
"Yes; I heard them ride away."
"And I heard them come back at daybreak; but
I was too lazy to get up."

wearily; "but I suppose you have some good idea—
I hope a plausible one."
"I think it is, old lad," said Ingleborough, speak-
ing now in a low whisper. "Suppose when that com-
mando musters after dark—I am supposing that one
will go out again t0-night—suppose, I say, when it
musters we had crept out of the wagon and crawled
as far as that one where our ponies are tethered?"
West's hand stole forward to grip his comrade's
knee.
"Ah, you're beginning to grasp it!" said Ingle-
borough. "Then, as I still have my knife, suppose I
cut the reims and we mounted."
"And joined the muster?" said West, in a hoarse
whisper.
"It isn't a dragoon troop, with men answering the
roll-call and telling Off in fours from the right."
"No, just a crowd!" said West excitedly.
"Exactly! There's only one reason why we
shouldn't succeed."
"What's that?"
"We don't look rough and blackguardly enough."
"Oh, Ingle, I quite grasp it now!"
"I've been quite aware of that, old lad, for the
last minute—that and something else. I don't know
what will have happened when the war is over, but
at present I don't wear a wooden leg. Oh, my knee!
I didn't think your ?ngers were made of bone."

"I beg your pardon, old fellow!"
"Don't name it, lad! I'm very glad you have so
much energy in you, and proud of my powers of
enduring such a vice-like—or say vicious—grip without
holloaing out. Next time try your strength on Anson!
Why, your ?ngers would almost go through his fat."
" Ingle, we must try it to-night."
"Or the ?rst opportunity."
"Why didn't you think of that before we lost the
despatch?"
"Hah! Why didn't I? Suppose it didn't come!"
West rose and crept to the end of the wagon and
looked out.
"The ponies are still there," he whispered, and
then he started violently, for a voice at the other end
of the wagon cried: "Hallo, you two!"
West turned, with his heart sinking, convinced
that the man must have heard.
"I'm just off sentry!" the Boer said good-hu-
mouredly. "I must have shaved that Kaf?r somewhere
and not hurt him much. As soon as I was relieved
I went and had a good look for him; but there wasn't
so much as a drop of blood."
"Poor wretch!" thought West.
"Lucky for him!" said Ingleborough, in Dutch.
"But I made the beggar drop the jacket," said
the Boer, laughing; and, to the delight of the prisoners,
he sent it ?ying into the wagon.

That was all, and the sentry strode away, just as
\Vest bounded upon the recovered garment like a tiger
upon its prey.
"Say bless him!" whispered Ingleborough.
"Oh, Ingle!" groaned his companion, in a chok-
ing voice: "I can feel the despatch quite safe."
" Hah ! " ejaculated Ingleborough.
"And such a little while ago I was ready to curse
fate and the very hour I was born!"
"And very wrong of you too, my son!" said
Ingleborough, in tones which betrayed some emotion.
" Cursing's a very bad habit, and only belongs to times
when wicked old men lived in old-fashioned plays and
indulged in it upon all kinds of occasions, especially
when they had sons and daughters who wanted to
marry somebody else."
"Oh, Ingle! Oh, Ingle! The sky doesn't look so
covered with black clouds now." B
"By no means, my lad! I can see enough blue
sky to make a Dutchman a pair of breeches—for
Dutchman let's say Boer. I say, what do you say to
going out on patrol to-night?"
"Yes, yes, of course! But we have no gunsl"
"Nor bandoliers, and that's a fact! Well, it's 01
no use to think of getting our own back again, even
if we said we repented and meant to join the Boers
at once."
"They wouldn't trust us!"

"Too slim! Fools if they did!"
"Then it is hopeless!" said West. "Someone
would notice it at once!"
"Yes," said Ingleborough, "and those were beauti-
ful ri?es too. But look here: I could see a way out
of the dif?culty, only you are so scrupulous. One
mustn't tell a diplomatic ?b."
"I can't stand telling an outrageous lie, even
under stern necessity!" said West, pulling down his
jacket after putting it on.
"And you are so horribly honest!"
"Yes," said W'est bitterly. "I have not, as Anson
declared, been busy buying illicit diamonds. But why
do you say this——-what do you mean?"
"I meant that I'd have risked it as soon as it was
dark, and crept away to steal a couple of the Boers'
Mausers—just like a cat—mouser after Mauser—I say,
what a horrible jokel"
~ \Nest was silent.
"They say they're splendid pieces; but it would
be a terrible theft, because I should take the bando-
liers too."
West was still silent.
"I say, lad," whispered Ingleborough, laughing
gently: "you couldn't object to my stealing the ri?es
that would be used to kill our men."
"How would you manage?" whispered "Test.
"Hah!" sighed Ingleborough, relieving his breast

ofa long pent-up breath, as he looked up at the arched-
in wagon-tilt: "this fellow's very nearly as wicked as
I am."
"Don't—don't joke!" said \Vest: "the matter is
too serious. How would you manage?"
"Never you mind, old Very Particular! Leave
that to me! By the way, though, before I lie down
and have a good nap, in case I should be out all night,
I don't think there is the slightest probability of our
ioining the Boer forces, do you?"
"Not the slightest!" answered \Vest drily.
"There'll be plenty .of traitors to their country with-
out usl"
Five minutes later Ingleborough, whose head
troubled him more than he owned to, was sleeping
soundly, leaving West thinking deeply over the pro-
spects of a daring escape, and every now and then
glancing out and across the laager to make sure that
the ponies had not been moved, as well as to ?x the
position of every wagon well in his mind ready for
the time when his comrade and he would be stealing
across in the dark, and thinking at times that the
Boers must be mad to leave their prisoners' mounts
tethered in sight of their temporary prison.
"But they're altogether mad!" he mused, "or they
would never have dared to defy the power of Eng
land in the way they have done!"
This thought had hardly passed through his mind


## p. 207 (#219) ############################################

THE SKY CLEARS. 207
when he saw a group of the laager's occupants come
by the prison wagon, each with a couple of well-?lled
bandoliers crossbelt-fashion over his breast, and ri?e
slung, making for the range forming one side of the
laager. They broke up into twos and threes, and as
they approached they unslung their weapons and took
off their cartridge-belts to place them beneath the
wagon-tilts, while they settled down to prepare a meal
before having a rest.
"just come off duty!" thought the prisoner, and,
with his heart beating fast, he sat watching two of
the men and then gazing hard at the nearest wagon,
piercing in imagination the thick canvas covering spread
over the arching-in hoops, and seeing, as he believed,
exactly where two Mauser ri?es and the Boers' bando-
liers had been laid.
"Why, if it were dark," he thought, "I could
creep out and secure those two ri?es as easily as pos-
sible—if they were not taken away!"
West's face turned scarlet, and it was not from
the heat of the sun upon the wagon-tilt, nor from the
sultry air which passed in from one end and out at
the other.
He drew a deep breath and moved towards Ingle-
borough to tell him of the burning thoughts within
him; but his comrade was sleeping so peacefully that
he shrank from awakening him.
"He'll want all his strength!" thought West, and

then he fell to wondering whether or not they would
succeed.
The plan was so wonderfully simple that it seemed
very possible, but——
Yes, there were so many "buts" rising up in the
way. The slightest hitch would spoil all, and they
would be detected and subjected to the roughest of
usage, even if they were not shot. But it was worth
the risk, and the thinker's heart began to beat faster,
and his hand stole to the part of his jacket where he
had hidden the despatch, and as he did so he men-
tally saw himself and his companion riding through
the darkness with the Boers, and waiting for an op-
portunity to dash off, taking the enemy so by surprise
that they would be off and away and well into the
gloom before they could be followed.
Once well mounted, with the open veldt before
them, and the darkness for their friend, he felt that it
would go hard if they did not escape.
He had come to this point, and'vws full of a
wild exhilaration, feeling at heart that the venture only
wanted the dash with which they would infuse it, when
his attention was taken up by seeing the Boer leader with
about half-a-dozen of his ?eld-cornets pass by the open
end of the tent and cross the laager.
He watched them with some anxiety, and then all
at once his heart began to sink with a sudden attack
of despair, for two of the party went off in front,

unfastened the reims by which the two Basuto ponies
were tethered to the wagon-wheels, and led them to
where the Boer leader and the rest had halted, prior
to putting the little animals through their paces as if
to test their powers in connection with some object
in view.
A castle in the air dashed down into nothingness,
and he uttered a low groan, which made Ingleborough
start up with a wondering look in his eyes.

CHAPTER XX.
HOW TO ESCAPE.
"WHAT'S wrong?" said Ingleborough, in a whisper.
"Look out at the bottom of the wagon,"
was West's reply.
Ingleborough rose to his knees, and at a glance
grasped the meaning of his companion's troubled look.
"Going to adopt our little Basutos for their own
use, eh?" he said coolly. "Well, I wonder they
haven't done it before! Bah! There are plenty more
horses about! What worries me is how I'm to get a
couple of ri?es and the ammunition.' I was rather too
cock-a-hoop about that when I talked to you, for these
beloved Dutch cuddle up their pieces as if they loved
them with all their hearts".
West smiled.
"Oh, don't do that because I said cuddled."
"I smiled because I see the way to get a couple
of ri?es as soon as it's dark," said \Vest, and he told
what he had noted.


## p. 211 (#223) ############################################

HOW TO ESCAPE. 2 1 1
"Then there's no reason for you to look glum.
I'll get a couple of horses somehow if you'll get the
guns. Here, I'd whistle or sing if I were not afraid
of taking the sentry's attention. \Ve're all right, lad,
and that bit of sleep has taken away the miserable
pain in my head which I keep on having since my fall.
Now then, what are they going to do with those
ponies?"
Sitting well back, the prisoners watched all that
went on, and saw the ponies mounted and put through
their paces by a» couple of big Boers of the regular
heavy, squat, Dutch build.
"Bah! What a shame!" whispered Ingleborough;
"it's murdering the poor little nags. A regular case
for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals. Those fellows want a couple of dray-horses to
carry them."
"Yes, and they've found it out," said West softly.
For as they looked on they saw the two Boers
pull up after a canter up and down the full length Of
the laager, and then drop clumsily Off, with the result
that the ponies spread out their legs and indulged in
a good shake which nearly dislodged their saddles.
Then a couple more of the onlookers tried the
little mounts, but stopped after one trot up and down,
and a general conversation ensued, resultingin the
ponies being led off and tied up again in the same
place, making West's heart beat as fast as if he had

been running hard, while all the time he tried to crush
down a feeling of elation, lest he Should be premature
in his hopefulness and be met with a fresh disappoint-
ment, for, though he saw the reims fastened in the
same places, there was plenty of time before dark for
the ponies to be removed.
just then their examination of the Boers' proceed-
ings was brought to an end by one of their captors
bringing the roughly-prepared portion of food that was
served out to them every day.
It was rough, but good of its kind, for the Boers
seemed to like to live well, and they did not stint their
prisoners, who, at a word from Ingleborough, fell to at
once.
"Appetite or no appetite, eat all you can," he
said. "We may have to work very hard to-night, and
shall need all our strength."
There was a fair amount left after they had done,
and this was carefully tied up ready for taking with
them if they were successful that night. After this
there was nothing more to be done but to wait till
darkness fell, and they sat back watching while the
sentry was again changed, when the fresh man visited
the wagon, to climb in, look carefully round, and eye
them suspiciously before returning to his post.
"Does that fellow suspect anything?" whispered
West.
"Of course; but nothing fresh. He comes on duty

HOW TO ESCAPE. 213
under the full impression that we mean to escape if
we can, and he feels that if we attempt it his duty is
to send a bullet through each of us."
"Then you don't think he suspects that we are
going to make an attempt to-night?"
"Pooh! How could he? But look! There goes
Anson! Not coming here, is he?"
"No: going to his own wagon! I say, Ingle, do
you think he has any illicit diamonds with him?"
"I'm sure of it! He could not, according to his
nature, have come away without robbing the company
somehow. I only wish I had the searching of his
wagon! I suppose Norton did not have a chance!"
"Yes, look! He has gone to his wagon. \Nhere
should you search if you had the chance?"
"Not quite sure yet!" said Ingleborough gruf?y.
"But don't talk to me. I want to think of something
better than diamonds."
"You mean liberty?"
"That's right. And now, once for all, we don't
want to make any more plans: each knows what he
has to do, and as soon as it is dark he has to do it."
"No," said West gravely; "your part must wait
until I have managed to get the ri?es."
"Well, yes; I must not be in too great a hurry.
But I say, wouldn't it be better for us to go together
to the horses, and hide by them or under them till
the Boers muster?"


## p. 214 (#226) ############################################

214 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"But suppose the sentry takes it into his head to
come and examine the wagon, and gives the alarm?"
"Oh, don't suppose anything!" said Ingleborough
impatiently. "\\'0 must chance a good deal and leave
the rest to luck."
\Vest nodded, and ?xed his eyes upon the wagon
he had previously singled out, noticing that the Boers
who occupied it were lying right beneath, sleeping,
each with a rolled'up blanket for a rug.
A little later he saw a big heavy-looking Kaf?r
come up, look underneath at the sleepers, and then go
off for a short distance, to lie down upon his chest,
doubling his arms before him so as to make a resting-
place for his forehead, and lying so perfectly motion—
less that it became evident that he also was asleep.
The evening was closing in fast now, and the men
began to move about more as if making preparations
for some excursion which they had in view.
"That looks well!" said Ingleborough. "There's
going to be some movement to-night. All was so still
half~an-hour ago that I began to think we should have
to put off our attempt."
"Oh, don't say that!" said West. "We must go!"
Further conversation was checked by the coming
of the sentry to look in upon them, scowling heavily
before he slouched away.
Ten minutes or so later the darkness began to fall,
increasing so fast that within half-an-hour the laager


## p. 215 (#227) ############################################

HOW TO ESCAPE. 215
would have been quite black if it had not been for a
lantern inside a wagon here and there; but, in spite
of the darkness, the camp began to grow more ani-
mated, a buzz of conversation seeming to rise from
the wagons like the busy hum of the insects outside.
All at once, as Ingleborough was going to draw
his companion's attention to this fact, he felt a hand
steal along his arm to grip his hand. Then it was
withdrawn, a very faint rustling followed, and the
listener felt that he was alone.
"Good luck go with him!" he muttered. "I wonder
whether he'll succeed?"
Leaning a little forward, he seemed to strain his
ears to listen, though he felt that this was absurd, till
all at once it struck him that he heard the soft sound
of stealthy steps approaching from the other end of
the wagon,_and, creeping towards the sounds, he felt
more than heard two men approaching, and as he got
his head over the wagon-box he heard a whisper.
"Anson and the sentry!" he said to himself. "The
spy, come to ?nd out whether we're safe. Yes, that
was Anson's whisper! Then we're done'if he brings
a lantern and ?nds me alone."
He paused for a moment or two, asking himself
what he should do; and then the idea came.
Subsiding into a reclining position, he suddenly
gave his thigh a sharp slap and started as if the blow
had roused him up.


## p. 216 (#228) ############################################

216 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Don't go to sleep, stupid!" he said aloud. "One
can't sleep all these awful long nights! Oh dear me,
this is precious dull work. I wish we had a lantern
and a box of dominoes! I wonder whether there is a
box in the laager?"
"Bother!" he said, in a low smothered tone, with
his hands covering his face. "I wish you wouldn't!
I was dreaming about old Anson and that he'd got
ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds in a bag
aboard his wagon."
"Like enough!" continued Ingleborough, in his
natural voice. "Ha, ha, ha!" he laughed. "I Should
like to serve the beggar out!"
"How?" he said, in the smothered sleepy voice.
"How? I'll tell you how it might be done if he
had got them. Find out where his wagon is in the
laager, and then wait till the sentry's asleep, and crawl
out of this thing, and nobble the lot."
" Rubbish! "
"Not it! We could get them easily enough and
bring them back here. Nobody would suspect us!
But there would be no getting them away! I say, are
you asleep again?"
"NO," said West quietly. "What's the matter with
you? Are you talking in your sleep? I was afraid to
come in, thinking someone was with———"
He got no farther, for Ingleborough clapped a
hand over his mouth and continued.

"Heigho! \Vhat bosh one does talk! I wish
there wasn't a blessed diamond in the world!"
He removed his hand, and feeling that there was
some reason for all this, West said quietly: "Why?"
"Why? See what a lot of trouble they cause! This
?ghting is as much about the diamond-?elds as any-
thing, and——Hullo! how you startled me?"
It was quite true: he was horribly startled, feeling
that their plan was spoiled, for there was a faint sound
at the end of the wagon and the door of a lantern
was suddenly opened, throwing the light within, and
giving the prisoners a glance of the sentry's and Anson's
faces looking in.
"All right?" said the sentry, in his own tongue.
"Oh yes, all right!" replied Ingleborough; "but
look here: you might as well leave us that lantern!
We won't set ?re to the bed-curtains, I promise you!"
"No," said the Boer, and with a chuckle he closed
the door of the lantern and walked whistling away
to his companion.
"Anson!" said West, with his lips close to Ingle-
borough's ear. '
"Yes: the fox! How you startled me! I didn't
hear you come! I was keeping up a sham conver-
sation, for they were stealing down upon us to catch
us on the hop! You failed, then, or were you obliged
to turn back?"
"Neither: I succeeded!"


## p. 218 (#230) ############################################

218 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"What? You got the ri?es?"
"Yes."
"Then they must have seen them when the light
was thrown in!"
"No," said \Vest quietly; "they are outside, lean-
ing against the near hind wheel."
"West, lad, this seems too good to be true. How
did you manage?"
"Easily enough. I had marked down one wagon
——the one I pointed out to you while it was light—and
as soon as I dropped down from here I went _on my
hands and knees to crawl towards it. You know what
a short distance it was, and by going very slowly I
passed two others where the Boers were sitting outside
talking. This was easy enough, for they Were so much
interested in their conversation that they took no notice
of any noise I made."
"And they couldn't see you?"
"I couldn't see them," replied \\'est; "so, of
course, they did not see me."
"Go on."
"I did," said West, "and then Ithought it was all
over, for the next wagon faced in another direction,
and I saw what I had not seen before—a lantern
was hanging in front over the driver's box, and it sent
a dull path of light forward on the. ground, and I
stopped, for 1 had to cross that path, and I felt that
I must be seen."


## p. 219 (#231) ############################################

"Tut-tuttut!" clicked Ingleborough.
"But after a few moments Irecollected how much
my drab brown jacket was like the soil, and I deter-
mined to risk it."
"And crawled on?"
"Yes, but not on my hands and knees. I lay ?at
on my chest and worked myself along upon my hands
and toes. It was only about a dozen yards where it
was light, but it seemed like a mile."
"Never mind that! " said Ingleborough impatiently
"You did it unheard?"
"Yes; but a man sitting in the wagon suddenly
moved when I was half across, and I was about to
spring up, thinking that he was searching for his ri?e."
"Phew!" whistled Ingleborough softly.
"It was well I did not; for directly after, to save
getting up and opening his lantern, the Boer struck
a match, and as I lay perfectly still, fully expecting
to be shot, the whole place seemed to be lit up, and
instead of hearing a ri?e cocked I smelt a whiff of
strong coarse tobacco, and I felt that I was safe."
"Go on and get it over!" whispered Ingleborough.
"You are making my hands feel wet."
"I lay some time before I dared to move."
"That you didn't, for you weren't gone long."
"Well, it seemed an hour to me: and then I
crept on and out of the light into the black darkness
again, rose to my hands and knees, wondering whether

220 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
I was going right, and the next minute my hand rubbed
softly against a wagon-wheel, and Iknew I was right."
"Bravo! " whispered Ingleborough.
"I rose up directly, and began to feel about care-
fully for the tilt, and once more my heart seemed to
rise to my mouth, for from under the wagon there
came a dull deep snoring, and I felt it was impossible
to do more for fear of being heard."
"But you made a dash for it?"
"No: I waited to get my breath, for I was just
as ifI had been running. But as soon as I could I
went on feeling along the edge of the tilt, and then
my heart gave a jump, for my hand touched the barrel
of a ri?e and directly after that of another."
"Hurrah!" panted out Ingleborough, and West
went on.
"I began to draw the ?rst towards me, but, as
soon as I did, to my horror the other began to move,
and I felt that if I kept on the second one would fall
and wake the sleeping Boers. So I reached up with
my other hand, got well hold, and drew both together.
But it was terrible work, for they would not come
readily, because the bandoliers were hanging to them,
and as I pulled I fully expected that something would
catch and discharge one of the pieces, to alarm the
whole laager for certain, even if it did not kill me.
But by lifting and easing and turning the ri?es over I
at last got the two pieces nearly out, when they sud-

denly seemed to be held fast, and I stood there gradu-
ally getting drenched with perspiration."
"Why, the edge of the tilt must have caught
them!" said Ingleborough excitedly.
"Yes, that's what I found to be the case, and by
turning them over again they came free, and I was
standing by the wheel with what we wanted."
" Hah !" sighed Ingleborough.
"But even then I had a chill, for the snoring
ceased and the Sleeper began to mutter, taking all the
strength out of me, till I felt that even if he or they
beneath the wagon should rouse up I could escape
through the darkness if I was quick."
"So you slhng the ri?es and bandoliers over your
shoulders, went down on your hands and knees, and
crept back?"
"No, I did not. I felt that there was not time,
and that I had better trust to the darkness to escape,
so I just shouldered the pieces and stepped out boldly
walking across the broad path of light."
"Good; but you should have struck off to your
right, so as to get where it would be more feeble."
"I thought of that," said West quickly; "but I
dared not, for fear of missing our wagon. SO I walked
boldly on, and almost ran against a Boer."
"Tut-tut-tut! Did he stop you?"
"No: he just said: 'Mind where you are coming!'
and passed on."


## p. 222 (#234) ############################################

222 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
- "Well?" said Ingleborough.
"That's all. I marched along to the wagon here
and stood the ri?es up before venturing to get in, for
I fancied that you were talking in your sleep and would
bring the sentry upon us. There, I've got the arms,
and I don't want such another job as that."
"Pooh! Nonsense, lad! The game has only just
begun! You ought to feel encouraged, for you have
learned and taught me how easy the rest of our job
will be! just a little cool pluck, and we shall succeed!"
"Very well!" said West. "I'm ready! What
next?"
"\Ye must lie down and wait till we hear the
commando on the stir, and then——"
"Yes," said West softly; "and then?"
"Let's wait and see!"

HAT seemed like a couple of the weariest hours
they had ever passed went slowly by, with
everything quite still in the laager; and at last West,
who was lying on his back, side by side with his com-
panion, whispered: "They're not going on patrol to-
night. We must creep out and escape on foot."
"Without knowing the way through the entrance
among the rocks, and with dozens of sentries about?
Can't be done!"
"Pst!" whispered West, for his quick hearing had
detected the approach of someone, and directly after
a light was ?ashed in under the tilt, a little whispering
followed after the dull rays were shut off, and once
more there was silence.
The pair lay a good ?ve minutes without attempt
ing to move or speak, and then West whispered:
"Two sentries."
"No: one and Fathead."
"How do you know? I daren't look, for fear they
should see the gleam of my eyes."

"I could smell him."
"Scented—out here?"
"Yes; I believe he'd put some scent on his hand-
kerchief and some pdmatum on his hair even if he
were going to be shot."
"Hist! Listen," said West quickly; "they're on
the stir."
Ingleborough started up, for a voice was heard
giving an order, and it was as if a stick had suddenly
been thrust into a beehive and stirred round.
"Right!" said Ingleborough, in a low tone. "Now's
our time! Take a long deep breath, and let's make
the plunge. It will be all right if you keep close
to me!"
West instinctively drew a long breath without
thinking of his companion's advice, for it was to him
like a re?ection of old boyish days when he summoned
up his courage to take a plunge into deep water while
wanting faith in his powers as a swimmer. But it was
only the making of the plunge.
Following Ingleborough, he dropped off the end
of the wagon, boldly led him to the ri?es, and together
in the darkness they slipped on the bandoliers, two
each, crossbelt fashion, slung their ri?es behind, put
on their broad felt hats well down over their eyes,
and then, imitating the Boer's heavy slouching walk,
they hurried on through the laager in the direction of
the horses.

It was, if possible, darker than ever, and they
passed several Boers, quite half of whom were leading
horses, and one of them startled and encouraged them
by growling out in Dutch: "Now then—look sharp,
' my lads!"
"We will!" whispered Ingleborough, as soon as
they had passed on; "but oh, if the ponies are gone!"
In another minute they knew that they were still
safely tethered as they had seen them last, while a little
search at the end of the empty wagon brought busy
hands in contact with their saddles and bridles.
"Oh, it's mere child's play!" whispered Ingle-
borough, as they hurried back to the ponies, which
recognised their voices and readily yielded to being
petted, standing ?rm while the saddles were clapped
on and they were girthed.
"Ready?" said West.
"Yes. Shall we lead them to where the muster
is being made?"
"No; let's mount and ride boldly up!" said West.
The next minute they were in the saddle, and,
stirred by the natural instinct to join a gathering of
their own kind, both ponies neighed and ambled to-
wards the spot where about ?fty men were collected,
some few mounted, others holding their bridles ready
for the order to start.
There was a startler for West, though, just as they
were riding towards the gathering patrol, one which

communicated itself to Ingleborough, for all at once
out of the darkness on their left a voice exclaimed:
"Here, Piet, have you moved my ri?e?"
"No," came back.
Then after a pause: "Here, what does this mean?
Mine's not where I left it! Come, no nonsense! We
may want them at any time! You shouldn't play tricks
like this; it might mean a man's life!"
The intending fugitives heard no more, their horses
hurrying them from the spot, expecting to hear an
alarm raised at any moment; but this did not occur.
It was too dark for the recognition of faces, and
the men were for the most part sleepy and out of
humour at being roused up, so that they were very
silent, thinking more Of themselves than of their fellows.
There was one tri?ing episode, though, which was
startling for the moment, for West's pony, being skittish
after days of inaction, began to make feints of biting
its nearest neighbour, with the result that the latter's
rider struck at it ?ercely and rapped out an angry oath
on two in company with an enquiry delivered in a ?erce
tone as to who the something or another \Vest was
that he could not keep his pony still.
Fortunately, and setting aside all necessity for a
reply, a hoarse order was given, causing a little con-
fusion, as every dismounted man climbed into his saddle,
and the next moment there was a second order to ad-
vance, when the leading couple went forward and the

rest followed, dropping naturally into pairs, fortunately
without West and his companion being separated.
Then began the loud clattering of hoofs upon the
stony way, while they wound in and out amongst-
ponderous blocks of granite and ironstone, trusting to
the leading horses, whose riders were warned of danger
in the darkness by the sentries stationed here and there.
Before they were half-way clear from the rocks
of the kopje, both West and Ingleborough were fully
convinced that to have attempted to escape on foot
in the darkness must have resulted in failure, while
minute by minute their con?dence increased in the
ultimate result of their ruse, for it was evident that
the couple of Boers next to them in front and in rear
could have no more idea of who they were'than they
could gain of their neighbours.
For every man's time was fully taken up in pro-
viding for his own and his mount's safety—much more
in seeking his own, for the sure-footed ponies were
pretty well accustomed to looking after themselves in
patches of country such as in their own half-wild state
they were accustomed to seek for the sake of the lush
growth to be found bordering upon the sources of the
streams.
There was not much conversation going on, only
the exchange of a few hoarse grunts from time to
time, suf?cient, however, to encourage the two prisoners
to think that they might venture upon an observation

or two in Boer Dutch, both imitating their captors' tones
and roughness as far as they could. But they did not
venture upon much, and carefully avoided whispers as
being likely to excite suspicion.
"Have you any plans as to the next start?" said
West.
"Only that we should go off north-west as soon as
we are well on the open veldt, and gallop as hard as
we can go."
"Which is north-west?"
"Hang me if I have the slightest idea! Have you?"
"No. But it does not matter. Let's get clear
away if we can, and shape our course afterwards when
the sun rises."
"Capital plan! Anything more?"
"I've been thinking," answered West, "that if we
turn off suddenly together the whole troop will go in
pursuit at once, and then it will be the race to the
swiftest."
"Of course! It always is!" .
"Oh no," said West drily; "not always: the most
cunning generally wins."
"Very well, then we shall win, for we are more
cunning than these dunder-headed Boers."
They rode on in silence after this for a few minutes,
gradually feeling that they were on level gound, over
which the ponies ambled easily enough; but they could
not see thirty yards in any direction.

EVERYTHING COMES TO THE MAN WHO WAITS. 229
"Look here," said Ingleborough gruf?y: "you've
some dodge up your sleeve! What is it?"
"Only this," replied West; "I've been thinking
that if we can get a hundred yards' clear start, and
then strike off to right or left, we can laugh at pursuit,
for they will have lost sight of us and will not know
which way to pursue."
"Yes, that's right enough, but how are you going
to get your hundred yards' start?" -
"I'll tell you how I think it can be done," and,
bending over towards his companion, West mumbled
out a few words in the darkness and Ingleborough
listened and uttered a low grunt as soon as his friend
had ?nished.
Then there was utter silence, broken only by the
dull clattering sound of the horses' hoofs upon the soft
dusty earth, West listening the while in the black
darkness till he heard Ingleborough upon his left make
a rustling noise caused by the bringing round and un-
slinging of his ri?e, followed by the loading and then
the softly cocking of the piece.
"Ready?" said Ingleborough, at last.
"Yes," was the reply.
"Then one—two-—three-—and away!" said Ingle-
borough softly.
At the ?rst word West began to bear upon his
horse's rein, drawing its head round to the right, and
at the last he drove his heels sharply into the pony's

?anks and wrenched its head round so suddenly that
the startled little beast made a tremendous bound off
towards the open veldt, its sudden action having a
stunning and confusing effect upon the line of Boers.
"Hi! stop!" roared Ingleborough directly, shouting
in the Boer-Dutch tongue, while as \Vest tore on his
companion stood up in his stirrups, ?red two shots after
him in succession, and then with another shout he set
spurs to his pony and dashed 'off as fast as his
mount would go.
The fugitives plunged one after the other into the
darkness on the little column's ?ank, and the burghers
saw them for a few moments ere they disappeared and
their ponies' hoofs began to sound dull before they re-
covered from the stupor of astonishment the sudden-
ness of the incident had caused.
Then a voice shouted ?ercely: "A deserter! Fire
and bring him downl"
"No: stop!" shouted the leader, in a stentorian
voice. "Do you want to shoot your faithful brother?"
There was a murmur of agreement at this, and
the rustle and rattle of ri?es being unslung stopped
at once.
"Who is the burgher who followed the traitor?"
continued the leader.
There was no reply, only a low muttering of voices
as the Boers questioned one another.
"Wait," continued the of?cer in command. "I

daresay our brother has wounded him and will
bring him back in a few minutes."
The Boers waited with their little force drawn
up in line and facing the black far-stretching veldt,
every man wondering which two of their party had
been traitor and pursuer, and naturally waited in vain.

QUERY: FREEDOM?
HE dash for liberty had been well carried out,
West getting his sturdy pony into a swinging
gallop before he had gone far, and keeping it up
straight away till he could hear Ingleborough's shout in
close pursuit, when he drew rein a little, till in its
efforts to rejoin its companion the second pony raced
up alongside.
"Bravo, West, lad!" panted Ingleborough, in a
low tone that sounded terribly loud in their cars, which
magni?ed everything in their excitement. "It's a pity
you are not in the regulars!"
"Why?"
"You'd soon be a general!"
"Rubbish!" said West shortly. "Don't talk or
they'll be on us! Can you hear them coming?"
"No; and I don't believe they will come! They'll
leave it to me to catch you. I say, I didn't kill you
when I ?red, did I?"
"No," said West, with a little laugh, "but you

QUERY: FREEDOM? 233
made me jump each time! The sensation was rather
queer."
"I took aim at an angle of forty-?ve degrees with
the horizon or thereabouts, to be exact," said Ingle-
borough pedantically; "and those tWO, my ?rst shots
with a Mauser ri?e, no doubt have travelled a couple
of miles at what they call a high trajectory. But what
glorious luck!"
"Yes; I never dared to hope that the plan would
succeed so well."
"Talk about humbugging anyone-why, it was
splendid!"
"But oughtn't we to go off at right angles now?"
said West anxiously, as he turned himself in his saddle
and listened.
"Quite time enough to do that when we hear
them tearing along in full pursuit, and that will not be
to-night."
"Think not?"
"I feel sure of it, lad! 01 course they can't hatch
it out in their thick skulls that their two prisoners were
the actors in this little drama: they can't know till they
get back that we have escaped."
"Of course not."
"And you may depend upon it that they'll stand
fast for about a quarter of an hour waiting for me to
come back, either with my prisoner alive or with his
scalp—I mean his ri?e, ammunition, and pony."


## p. 234 (#246) ############################################

234 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"And when they ?nd that you don't come back?"
said West, laughing to himself.
"Then they'll say that you've taken my scalp and
gone on home with it: think it is just the fortune of
war, and promise themselves that they'll ride out by
daylight to save my body from the Aasvogels and
bury it out of sight."
"And by degrees they will put that and that to-
gether," said West, "and ?nd that they have been
thoroughly tricked."
"Yes, and poor Anson will distil pearly tears from
those beautiful eyes of his, and we shall not be there
to see them rolling down his fat cheeks. \Vest, lad,
I never yet wanted to kill a man."
"Of course not, and you don't now!"
"That's quite correct, lad; but I should like to be
a grand inquisitor sitting on Master Anson for his rene-
gade ways and superintending in the torture-chamber.
My word, shouldn't he have the question of the water;
no, the rack; or better still, the extraction of his nails.
Stop a minute: I think hanging from the ceiling by his
wrists with a weight attached to his ankles, and a grand
?nish-off with the question of ?re would be more ?tting.
Bless him for a walking tallow sausage, wouldn't he
burnl"
"Ugh! Don't be such a savagel" cried West
angrily. "You wouldn't 'do anything of the kind. I
should be far more hardhearted and cruel than you'd

be, for I would have him tied up to the wheel of a
wagon and set a Kaf?r to ?og him with a sjambok on
his bare back."
"Oh!" exclaimed Ingleborough sharply.
"\Vhat's the matter?"
"And I've come away without having the oily
rascal stripped of his plunder."
"What! His diamonds?"
"Yes. I know he has a regular pile hidden in that
wagon of his, and, what's more, I know where to look
and ?nd them."
"Where?"
"Never you mind till the time comes! I have a
sort of prescient idea that some day we shall face that
fellow again with the circumstances reversed; and then
I'm going to have his loot cleared out."
And this and much more as the fugitives cantered
easily along through the darkness, giving their ponies
their heads and letting them increase the distance more
and more, till all at once West broke the silence by
exclaiming: "I say, Ingle, is it really true?"
"Is what really true—that Master Anson's a fat
beast?"
"No, no; that we have escaped and are riding
away at full liberty to go where we please? It seems
to me like a dream, and that in the morning we shall
awake and ?nd ourselves once again in that dreary
wagon."

"Partly true, partly imaginary," said Ingleborough
bluntly.
"What do you mean?" said \Vest, in a startled tone.
"It's true that we've made a jolly clever escape,
thanks to you; but it isn't true that we're at liberty
to go where we like."
"Why not?" said West wonder-ingly.
"Because you've got that despatch in your jacket
somewhere, I hope."
"Yes," said \Vest, after running his hand down
a seam. "It's safe enough!"
"Well, that despatch says we must go to Mafe-
king; so we're prisoners to duty still."
"Of course !" said West cheerily. "But look here:
it's of no use to tire our ponies. We're far enough
off now to let them walk, or dismount and let them
graze till we know which way to steer."
"It's all right; keep on, lad! We're steering as
straight as if we had a compass. I believe the ponies
know where we want to go, and took the right line
at once."
"Nonsense! You don't believe anything of the
kind. What makes you think we're going in the right
direction?"
"Because the clouds yonder thinned out a bit half-
an-hour ago, and I saw three dim stars in a sort of
arch, and continuing the line there was another brighter
one just in the place where it ought to be. I know

QUERY: FREEDOM? 237
them as well as can be of old: the big one sets just
in the north-west."
"Are you sure of that?" cried \Vest eagerly.
"As sure as that I bore off a little to the right as
soon as I saw that star, so as to turn more to the north
and straight for Mafeking. I don't guarantee that we
are keeping straight for it now the stars are shut out;
but we shall know as soon as it's day by the compass."
"Why don't we strike a light and examine it
now?" said West eagerly.
"Because we haven't a match!" replied Ingle-
borough. "Didn't our sturdy honest captors take every-
thing away but my knife, which was luckin in my
inner belt along with my money?"
"To be sure!" sighed \Vest.
"And if we had matches we dare not strike them
for fear of the light being seen by one Of the Boer
patrols."
"Yes," said West, with another sigh. "I suppose
they are everywhere now!"
At that moment the ponies stoppedshort, spun
round, almost unseating their riders, and went off at
full speed back along the way they had come; and it
was some minutes before they could be checked and
soothed and patted back into a walk.
"The country isn't quite civilised yet," said West;
"fancy lions being so near the line of a railway.
Hark; there he goes again!"


## p. 238 (#250) ############################################

238 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
For once more the peculiar barking roar of a lion
came from a distance, making the air seem to quiver
and the ponies turn restless again and begin to snort
with dread.
"Steady, boys, steady said Ingleborough sooth-
ingly to the two steeds. "Don't you know that we've
got a couple of patent foreign ri?es, and that they
would be more than a match for any lion that ever
lived?"
"If we shot straight!" said \Vest banteringly.
"There he goes again! How near do you think that
fellow is?"
'H
"Quiet, boy!" cried Ingleborough, leaning forward
and patting his pony on the neck, with satisfactory
results. "How far? It's impossible to say! I've heard
performers who called themselves ventriloquists, but
their tricks are nothing to the roaring of a lion. It's
about the most deceptive soundI know. One time
it's like thunder, and another it's like Bottom the
Weaver."
"Like what?" cried West.
"The gentleman I named who played lion, and
for fear of frightening the ladies said he would roar
him as gently as a sucking dove. Now then, what's
to be done?"
"I don't know," said West. "We did not cal-
culate upon having lions to act as sentries on behalf
of the Boers."

"Let's hear off more to the north and try to out-
?ank the great eat."
Changing their course, they started to make a
half-circle of a couple of miles' radius, riding steadily
on, but only to have their shivering mounts startled
again and again till they were ready to give up in
despair.
"\/Ve'd better wait till daybreak," said West.
"There's no occasion to," said Ingleborough, "for
there it is, coming right behind us, and we're going
too much to the west. Bear off, and let's ride on.
I don't suppose we shall be troubled any more. What
we want now is another kopje—one which hasn't been
turned into a trap."
"There's what we want!" said \IVest, half-an-hour
later, as one of the many clumps of rock and trees
loomed up in the fast lightening front.
"Yes," said Ingleborough sharply, "and there's
what we don't want, far nearer to us than I like."
"Where?" asked \1Vest sharply.
"Straight behind us!" .
"Why, Ingle," cried \Nest, in despair, "they've
been following us all through the night!"
"No," said Ingleborough, shading his eyes with
his hand; "that's a different patrol, I feel sure, coming
from another direction."
"What shall we do?"
"Ride straight for that kopje; we're between it

and the patrol, and perhaps they won't see us. If they
do we must gallop away."
"But suppose this kopje proves to be occupied?"
said West. "\Ve don't want to be taken prisoners
again."
"That's the truest speech you've made for twenty-
four hours, my lad," said Ingleborough coolly, "but,
all the same, that seems to be the wisest thing to do."
"Make for the kopje?"
"Yes, for we want water, shelter, and rest."
"But if the Boers are there too?"
"Hang it, lad, there aren't enough of the brutes
to occupy every kopje in the country; some of them
must be left for poor felloWs in such a mess as we are."
"Ride on and chance it then?"
"To be sure!" was the reply; and they went on
at a steady canter straight for the clump in front, a
mile or so away, turning every now and then to watch
the line of horsemen which seemed to be going at
right angles to 'their track. just as they reached
the outskirts of the eminence the leading ?les
of the patrol bore off a little and the fugitives had
the misery of seeing that the enemy they wished to
avoid seemed to be aiming straight for the place they
had intended for a refuge, while to have ridden out
to right or left meant going full in sight of the patrol.
To make matters worse, the sun was beginning
to light up the stony tops of the kopje, and in a very

few minutes the lower portions would be glowing in
the morning rays.
"Cheer up!" said Ingleborough; "it's a big one!
Now then, dismount and lead horses! Here's cover
enough to hide in now, and we may be able to get
round to the other side without being seen."
"And then?"
"Oh, we won't intrude our company upon the
enemy; let's ride off as fast as we can."
16

CHAPTER XXIII.

HE bottom and surroundings of the eminence af-
forded plenty of cover, and the fugitives pushed
on in and out among dense patches of low growth,
and, leading their sure-footed little ponies, they climbed
over and around piles and masses of stone that would
have been dif?culties even to mules, while twice over
West scaled a slope so as to carefully look down and
backward at the enemy.
This he was able to do unseen, and came down
again to report that the patrol was still making for the
kopje as if for rest, but that their movements were
too careless and deliberate for those of an enemy in
pursuit.
The far side of the pile of granite and ironstone
was reached in safety, placing the fugitives about a
quarter of a mile from the Boers in a direct line, but
quite a mile of intricate climbing if measured by the
distance round; and they paused in a green patch full
of refreshing beauty, being a wide ravine stretching up

into the height, and with a bubbling stream of water
running outward and inviting the ponies at once to
take their ?ll.
"This settles it at once!" said Ingleborough,
letting his bridle fall upon his mount's neck.
"Yes; we can go well in yonder, leading the
ponies along the bed of the stream. There is plenty
of cover to hide half a regiment."
"Of Boers," said Ingleborough shortly. "It will
not do for us."
"Why?" said Vv'est, staring. "We can hide there
till they have gone."
"My dear boy," said Ingleborough; "can't you
see? The beggars evidently know this place, and are
making for it on account of the water. We saw none
on the other side."
"Very well," said West sharply; "let's ride off,
and keep the hill between us and them."
"Too late!" said Ingleborough. "This way; come
on!"
For as he spoke there was the loud beating noise
of many hoofs, indicating that the whole or a portion
of the commando was coming at a gallop round the
opposite side of the kopje from that by which the fugi-
tives had come; and to have started then would have
meant a gallop in full sight of a large body of men
ready to deliver a ri?e ?re of which they would have
had to run the gauntlet.

"\Ve're entering another trap," said West bitterly,
as they led their reluctant ponies along the bed of the
stream, fortunately for them too stony for any dis-
colorationto be borne down to show the keen-eyed
Boers that someone had passed that way, and at the
same time yielding no impress of the footprints of man
or beast.
As far as the fugitives could see, the ravine went
in a devious course a couple of hundred yards into
the eminence, but, as it proved, nearly across to the
other side. It was darkened by overhanging trees and
creepers, which found a hold in every ledge or crack of
the almost perpendicular sides, and grew darker and
darker at every score of yards; but the echoing rocks
gave them full notice of what was going on near the
entrance, the voices of the Boers and the splashing
noise of their horses' feet coming with many repetitions
to drown any sound made by their own.
"It isn't a bad place!" said Ingleborough, as they
hurried on, with the ravine growing more narrow and
the sides coming more sharply down into the water.
"It strikes me that we shall ?nd the water comes out
of some cave."
Five minutes later Ingleborough proved to be quite
correct, for they paused at a rugged archway between
piled-up fern-hung blocks, out of which the water rushed
in a fairly large volume, but not knee-deep; and, upon
leaving his horse with his comrade and boldly wading

in, \Vcst found that the cave expanded as soon as the
entrance was passed, so that the spring ran outward
along a narrow stony bed, and on either side there
was a bed of sand of considerable width.
"Come along!" said West. "The water gets
shallower, and there is a dry place on either side."
Ingleborough waded in at once, but unfortunately
the ponies shrank from following, and hung back from
the reins, one of them uttering a loud snort, which
was repeated from the interior so loudly that the
second animal reared up wildly and endeavoured to
break away.
West dashed back though directly and relieved
his companion of one of the refractory beasts, when by
means of a good deal of coaxing and patting they
were ?nally got along for some yards and out on to
the sandy side, where they whinnied out their satisfac-
tion and recovered their con?dence suf?ciently to step
towards the running waters and resume their inter-
rupted drink.
"Ri?es!" said Ingleborough shortly, when West un-
slung his and stood ready, following his companion's
example as he stood in the darkness with his piece
pointing out at the bright stream with its mossy and
fern-hung framing.
"Did you hear anyone coming?" whispered West.
"No, but they must have heard our ponies and
be coming on," was the reply.


## p. 246 (#260) ############################################

246 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Let them come; we can keep the whole gang at
bay from here!"
But ?ve minutes' watching and listening proved
that they had not been heard, for the Boers were too
busy watering their horses, the voices of the men and
the splashings and tramplings of the beasts coming in
reverberations right along the natural speaking-tube,
to strike clearly upon the listeners' ears.
Three several times the fugitives stood on guard
with ri?es cocked, ready to make a determined effort
to defend their post of vantage, for the voices came
nearer and nearer, and splashing sounds indicated
movements out towards the mouth of the ravine; but
just when their nerves were strained to the utmost, and
they watched with starting eyes a corner round which
the enemy would have to turn to bring them within
range, the talking and splashing died out, and they
simultaneously uttered a sigh of relief.
"I couldn't bear much of this, Ingle," said West,
at last. "I half think that I would rather have them
come on so that we could get into the excitement of
a ?ght."
"I don't half think so, lad; I do quite," replied
Ingleborough.
"But you don't want to ?ght?"
"Of course not; I don't want to feel that I've

several Boers than they should kill me. However, I

hope they will not attack us, for if they do I mean to
shoot as straight as I can and as often as is necessary.
What do you say?"
West was silent for a few moments, during which
he seemed to be thinking out the position. At last
he spoke: "I have never given the Boers any reason for
trying to destroy my life, my only crime being that I
am English. So, as life is very sweet and I want to
live as long as I can, I shall do as you do till they
get disheartened, for I don't see how they can get at
us, and—--"
"Here, quick, lad!" whispered Ingleborough, swing-
ing round. "We're attacked from behind!"
West followed his example, feeling fully convinced
that the Boers had after all seen them seek refuge in
the cavern, and had taken advantage of their know-
ledge of the place to creep through some tunnel which
led in from the other side, for there was a strange
scuf?ing and rustling sound a little way in, where it
was quite dark. With ri?es pointed towards the spot
and with ?ngers on triggers, the two friends waited
anxiously for some further development, so as to avoid
?ring blindly into the cavern without injury to the
enemy while leaving themselves unloaded when their
foes rushed on.
"Can't be Boers!" said Ingleborough, at the end
of a minute, during which the noise went on; "it's
wild beasts of some kind."

"Lions," suggested \Vest.
"Oh no; they'd go about as softly as cats! More
like a pack of hyaenas trying to get up their courage
for a charge!"
"If we ?red and stood on one side they'd rush out!"
replied West. ,
"Yes," said Ingleborough grimly; "and the Boers
would rush in to see what was the matter. That
wouldn't do, for it's evident that they don't know we're
here."
"But we must do something, or they'll injure the
horses! Whyl" cried West excitedly; "it must be that
they've pulled the poor beasts down and are devouring
them."
"Without our little Basutos making a kick for
life? Nonsense! They'd squeal and kick and rush out.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
To West's astonishment his companion burst into
a prolonged ?t of gentle laughter.
"Here, come along!" he said. "Of all the larky
beggars! Here, you two ruf?ans, stow that, or you'll
smash up those saddles!"
Ingleborough. dashed in, followed at once by West,
and as they got in further from the cave's mouth they
dimly saw their mounts spring up from having a good
roll and wriggle upon the soft dry sand to rest their
spines and get rid of the larvae of some worrying per-
nicious horse-?y.

The moment the two ponies were on all-fours they
gave themselves a vigorous shake, and then whinnied
softly and advanced to their riders with out-stretched
necks, expectant of a piece of bread or some other
delicacy with which they had been petted from time
to time.
"Why, you larky little rascals! " cried Ingleborough,
patting the two beasts affectionately; "what do you
mean by frightening us out of our seven senses? I
mean frightening me, for you weren't scared a bit—eh,
West?"
"Frightened? It was horrible! I can understand
now why the Boers can't bear being attacked from
behind!"
"Of course! I say, though, no wonder children
are afraid of being in the dark." He turned to the
ponies, and said: "Look here, my lads, I suppose you
don't understand me, but if you could take my advice
you'd lie down to have a good rest. It would do you
both good, and if the ?ring did begin you'd'escape
being hit."
TO this one of the ponies whinnied softly, and then
moved gently to its companion's Side, head to tail,
bared its big teeth as if to bite, and began to draw
them along the lower part of the other's spine, be-
ginning at the root of the tail and rasping away right
up to the saddle, while the operatee stretched out its
neck and set to work in the same way upon the ope-

rator, upon the give-and-take principle, both animals
grunting softly and uttering low sounds that could only
be compared to bleats or purrs.
"They say there's nothing so pleasant in life as
scratching where you itch," said West, laughing. "My
word! They do seem to enjoy it."
"Poor beggars, yes! " replied Ingleborough. "I be-
lieve there's no country in the world where animals
are more tortured by ?ies than in Africa. The wretched
insects plunge in that sharp instrument of theirs, pierce
the skin, and leave an egg underneath; the warmth
of the body hatches it into what we ?shing boys called
a gentle, and that white maggot goes on eating and
growing under the poor animal's coat, living on hot
meat always till it is full-grown, when its Skin dries up
and turns reddish-brown, and it lies still for a bit,
before changing into a ?y, which escapes from the hole
in the skin it has eaten and ?its away to go and tor-
ture more animals."
"And not only horses, but other animals!" said
West quietly.
"Horses only? Oh no; the bullocks get them
terribly, and the various kinds of antelopes aS well.
I've seen skins taken off blesboks and wildebeestes
full of holes. And there you are, my lad; that's a
lecture on natural history."
"Given in the queerest place and at the strangest
time a lecture was ever given anywhere," said West.

"It is very horrible, though, for the animals to be tor-
tured so!"
"Yes," said Ingleborough thoughtfully; "but the
?ies must enjoy themselves wonderfully. They must
have what people in England call a high old time,
and—eh? What's the matter?"
"Be ready! " whispered West. "Someone coming;
there's no mistake now!"

CHAPTER XXIV.
A REAL ALARM.
INGLEBOROUGH drew in his breath with a hiss,
and once more stood on his guard with his com-
rade right in the darkness, and in front of the two
ponies, where a good view of the stream outside and
the corner rock fringed with ferns could be obtained.
For voices could be heard as of two men talking
together, while plash, plash, plash their footsteps in
the water echoed for some moments from the rocky
sides of the chasm, before they came leisurely into
sight round the corner and stood knee-deep looking
straight into the cave, little thinking of the peril in
which they were, for a couple of ri?es covered them,
and the slightest pressure upon the triggers would have
sent the long thin bullets upon their errand to pierce
the Boers through and through.
But no pressure came, those within the cavern
seeing clearly enough from the men's careless manner
that they felt perfectly safe and were upon no unusual
errand.

They were r0ughly enough clad, and their outer
garments showed that they had been slept in for some
time and exposed to all kinds of weather; but there'
was something about their mien, and more in the
words they let fall, which showed them to belong to a
superior type of Boer.
"Yes, there it is," said one of the two in Boer
Dutch, "just as it was ten years ago when I was
here on a hunting trip. The source is perennial,
and beautiful water. That's why I wanted Dietz to
come out of our way."
"Does it go in far?"
"About a hundred yards, and there the water
suddenly gushes out of the ?oor; but there are some
nasty holes about, plunging down no one knows how
deep, and I shouldn't like to venture in without a
light."
"Why didn't we bring a lantern?"
"Because we don't want to go burrowing into the
kopje."
"Speak for yourself. I do!" said the second man.
"Here, I've got plenty of matches—come along."
"No, thank you," said the ?rst. "One never knows
what may be in a place like that."
West pinched his companion's arm.
"What is likely to be there?"
"Who can tell? A lioness and her full-grown cubs,
perhaps, or a pack of jackals! Worse still, snakes or

some of the wandering bushmen with bows and poisoned
arrows."
"Hardly likely!" said the second Boer.
"I think very likely," said the ?rst speaker, peer-
ing so steadfastly into the cavern that for a few mo-
ments West felt certain that they were seen. "One
of the Kaf?r tribes would not enter that place to save
their lives."
"Why?"
"Because they believe that a great water demon
hides in the spring who rises up and seizes anyone
who approaches, drags him down, and devours him."
"All Of which must be perfectly truel" answered
the other Boer, with a sneer. "Of course you are
a believer?"
"I'm a full believer in its being dangerous to go
into eaves without proper lights," said the ?rst speaker
coldly, "and I think we are undergoing risks enough
every day from the rooineks' ri?es and their lancers'
spears, without chancing a fall down some horrible pit."
"Where there is a water demon!" said his com-
panion, with another sneer.
"just for the sake of gratifying a little idle curio-
Sity."
"Oh, very well then! I don't like to come to such
a natural curiosity without exploring; so here gOes
alone."
The next moment the ?rst speaker had stretched

out his hand and barred his companion's way with
his ri?e.
"What do you mean by that?" cried the Boer.
"To stop you going."
"What!" cried the other. "I shall go ifI please!"
"NO!" said the ?rst speaker sternly. "I order
you not!"
"You—you order me?" cried the other wrathfully.
"Yes; recollect that you are a soldier for the time
being, and under my command. I order you not to
go, for we have too much need of all our brave
burghers to defend the country to let any man risk
his life in a foolhardy adventure."
"Pish!"
"Silence!" said the other sternly. "I am going
back. Had I known of this, I would not have let you
come!"
"Look here," said the other insolently, "we are not
on duty now, and once for all I tell you that While I
serve I am not going to put up with bullying from
any man who is a step above me in the ranks."
The ?rst speaker looked at him sternly, and Ingle-
borough placed his lips close to West's ear.
"Look here," said Ingleborough, "if we shoot, both
take aim at that obstinate brute, and give the other
a chance to run for his life!"
A nod was the only answer, as both listened to
what was said further.

256 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"You fellows, because you get made ?eld-cornets
by a bit of luck, don't know how to contain your-
selves, and—-—"
"Back to your horse!" said the ?rst speaker, the
veins in whose forehead stood out in a network beneath
his ?ap-brimmed hat, while his voice sounded full of
suppressed fury.
"Back yourself!" cried the other. "I'll obey your
orders in the ?eld, but we of the Free State are getting
tired of the overbearing ways of you men of the Trans-
vaal. Put down your ri?e, sir! By all that's holy, if
you hold it towards me in that threatening way, I'll
send a Mauser bullet through you. If I die for it,
I will."
- At that moment, just as there seemed to be every
possibility of a deadly encounter between the two men,
there was a loud hail from beyond the rock, and, as
it was not replied to, another cry was heard, in com-
pany with loud echoing splashes iii the water, and
half-a-dozen Boers waded into sight, evidently in a high
state of excitement.
"Hullo there!" shouted the foremost, "didn't you
hear us call? We began to think you had fallen into
an ambush! Quick, back with you: there's a patrol of
the rooineks out yonder coming this way, the mounted
men with the spiked poles."
"Many or few?" said the man addressed as the
?eld-cornet, and, apparently forgetting his anger in
I 1

the excitement, he began to hurry away from the
cavern mouth, talking loudly the while. "I'll see! If
they'll come on, we'll stay here; if not, we might try
and surround them and capture the Whole gang!"
The next minute the walls of the gully were echo-
ing the hurried splashing made by the party, as the
last of them turned the corner and disappeared across
the veldt. »
"Phew! What a pity!" said Ingleborough, taking
off his hat to wipe his forehead.
"A pityl" cried West. What: the news that some
of our people are near?"
"No, no; I meant that the row came to an end.
I was in hopes that we were going to have a new
version of the Kilkenny cats, and two enemies of Old
England were going to tear each other to pieces and
leave only a tail behind."
"Oh, be serious, Inglel" said West excitedly.
"We might venture out now."
"Don't be rash! We've got to ?nd out what they
mean to do."
"Come along then, and let's leave the horses
where they are. We must try and climb up some-
where to see what is going on."
"Very well, but take care! These are awfully
breakneck walls to mount."
"Yes, but it has to be done! Why not up that
crack?"

\Nest pointed to a rift half-full of wiry-looking
shrubs mingled with ferns, which ran up the rocky wall
of the gully diagonally.
"Think you can do it?"
"Yes, it's easier than it looks. Let's try!"
"Right!" said Ingleborough. "Up you go!"
West waded across to the side, slinging his ri?e
as he went, then pulling his hat on tightly, he reached
up as high as he could, and drew himself up a foot
or two. Then, carefully taking advantage of the angles
and edges of projecting rocks for his feet and getting
hand-hold of the tough shrubs, he was soon up twenty
feet above the rushing stream.
"Come along!" he said. "It's not bad climbingl"
"Matter of opinion," replied Ingleborough, "but
here goes!" and he began to mount, while West went on.
"Oh yes," he said, "it's all right! Why, it puts
one in mind of the Lady—I say, lad, ugh l—that was
slippyl"
"Hold on then!" cried West excitedly, for one of
Ingleborough's feet glided over the edge of a stone,
which yielded, and he was left hanging by his hands,
to strive to get a footing.
"Get out!" said Ingleborough, panting. "That's
better. just as if I shouldn't hold on! Think I wanted
a cold bath?"
"You gaye me quite a turn!" said West. "Will
you leave it to me? I can manage it!"


## p. 259 (#273) ############################################

A REAL ALARM. 259
"Go on, you vain young cochmb! SO can I
manage it! If you don't look out, I'll be up ?rst!
Well, what are you stopping for?"
"Look down there!" said West.
Ingleborough held on tightly while he twisted his
head to see that the two ponies had hurried out of the
cave to wade to the place Where they had started from,
and were looking up wonderingly.
"Ha, ha!" laughed Ingleborough. "They're afraid
of being left behind! Here, you two, be Off back into
your stable," he continued, getting hold of a loose piece
of rock with the intention Of dropping it into the water
to scare the lookers-on.
"NO, no, don't do that!" said \Vest softly. "You
may scare them into cantering down into the midst of
the Boers!"
"Right," said Ingleborough, replacing the stone.
"I don't suppose they'll mind."
At that moment one of the ponies whinnied, and
the other took up the cry of discontent.
"Quiet, will you? Look here!" said Ingleborough,
speaking as if in the full belief that the two animals
understood every word. "If you make that row, you'll
have the Boers down upon us, and that will mean
new masters, with worse treatment than you get from
us! That's settled them," continued Ingleborough,
speaking again to his companion, and as it happened
the two animals did not repeat their challenging cry,

but began to nibble at the greenery overhanging the
water.
Meanwhile the climbing grew more dif?cult as the
adventurers got higher and more excited, for all at
once the rapid crack-crack-crack of ri?es began telling
of attack and defence, and making the climbers strain
every effort to get to the top, which was at last accom-
plished by West, who drew himself over the edge of
the rocks and lay panting for a few moments before
looking down.
"Can't you manage it?" he said; for Ingleborough
had come to a stand some twenty feet below.
"No!" was the reply. "My right foot has slipped
into a crack here, and is wedged tight. Don't wait
for me! GO on, only let's have all the news as soon
as you can!"
West's ?rst idea was to lower himself down; but,
feeling that one was enough to ?nd out all they wanted,
he obeyed his comrade's orders and went on climbing
upon all-fours what was now an easy slope with plenty
of cover in the Shape of bushes and huge blocks of
stone.
A few minutes brought him to the top of the
kopje, whence he had a clear view of all that was going
on, while the ?ring was now general.
He saw at a glance that the Boers had not at-
tempted to hold the natural stronghold, for upon dis-
covering their numbers, the half-troop of lancers, some

thirty in number, had begun to retire, and the Boers,
of whom there seemed to be about a hundred and
?fty, were streaming out in two directions, evidently
with the intention of surrounding and taking them
prisoners, both sides keeping up a steady ?re the while.
West stopped no longer than was necessary to
satisfy himself that the Boers were getting rapidly
farther and farther from the kopje, and then hurried
back down the slope to the top of the gully, where,
leaning over, he found Ingleborough busy at work,
apparently driving his ri?e barrel down into a crevice.
"Ahoy!" cried West.
"Hallo there! What news, lad?"
"Small party of lancers in full retreat, and the
Boers very strong in pursuit. They're a mile away now."
"Then we shall get no help from our people;
but, if they are taking the enemy away, that's all we
want. Coming down?" '
"Yes," said West, lowering himself over the edge
very cautiously, for it was terribly dangerous work,
and Ingleborough shivered and hung back, watching him
till his companion reached the ledge where he had
been checked.
"Hah!" sighed Ingleborough; "that's better. I've
been wishing for the last ?ve minutes that the stream
below was ten feet deep!"
"Why?" panted West, who was breathless from
his exertions.


## p. 262 (#276) ############################################

262 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"For you to fall into! But now help me to get
my boot! I'm afraid to lever it out with my ri?e-
barrel, for fear of bending it."
"Let me try!" said West, and, thrusting his arm
down into the crack, he got well hold of the boot,
gave it a jerk sidewise, and it was free.
"Look at that now!" said Ingleborough. "My
word! it's a ?ne thing to have been born clever. How
did you do it?"
"Pulled it out," replied West, smiling.
"Of course; but I couldn't! It took me all my
time to get it unlaced and to draw out my foot. Stuck,
for it was so wet!"
In another ?ve minutes, while the cracking of the
ri?e-?re was growing more distant, the boot was re-
placed, the dangerous descent continued, with several
slips and slides, each saving his friend in turn from a
bad fall, and the pair reached the water only minus
a little skin, to be welcomed by their ponies, who
came up to them at once, ready to be led cautiously
to the entrance of the gully.
But there was no need for the extra care, inspec-
tion proving that no Boers were left behind, and that
they were too far distant now to distinguish what went
on at the resting-place they had left.
"Think they'll make the lancers prisoners?" said
West, after they had stood scanning the level veldt
for some minutes.


## p. 263 (#277) ############################################

"Not unless they can surround them, and I should
give our cavalry credit for being too cautious to let
them do that!" said Ingleborough. "Now then, what
do you say for another try Mafeking-ward?"
"Forward!" was the reply, and after a glance at
the compass to lay down their course, the friends
mounted and, refreshed, though not much rested, they
cantered off, making a bee-line almost due north, with
the intention of cautiously approaching some farm on
their way to purchase food.

CHAPTER XXV.
AT TANTE ANN'S.
T was growing dark before a suitable place presented
itself, this being a typical Boer farm in a very
desolate part Of the veldt, the spot having been evi-
dently chosen by its occupants on account of the tiny
kopje and abundant supply Of water welling out, be-
sides being a perfect spot for the branch of farming
the owner carried on, there being pen after pen of
ostriches, the great foolish-looking large-eyed birds
staring at the two horsemen wonderingly as they ap-
proached the door where the owner stood looking
distant and glum, as he smoked his big pipe.
Yes, he said, he would sell them some provisions
for themselves and corn for their horses if they had
money to pay for what they wanted.
This was at once produced, and the farmer looked
on after summoning a huge Kaf?r to help with the
horses and get out the corn; while his fat wife, after
coming to the door to glare at the visitors, condescended
to put on a kettle to prepare them tea, and see if

there was a chicken that could be killed and broiled,
and some eggs for frying.
There were several bits or consultation carried on
by the husband and wife from time to time, and every-
thing Showed that the visitors were far from welcome.
"Never mind," said Ingleborough; "all we want
is a good meal, and we shall be off in the morning as
soon as it is light."
"That shed with the iron roof is to be our bed-
room, I suppose?" said West.
"Yes, and we're lucky to get that and a few sacks."
just then the Boer came slowly sidling up, smoking
hard the while, to know if they had seen anything of
the war, and he seemed deeply interested on hearing
that a Skirmish had been going on not so many miles
from his farm.
"Why are you two not ?ghting?" he said suddenly.
"Because we don't want to," was West's smiling
reply.
"But you are Englanders?" said the Boer.
"Yes, but all Englanders don't want to ?ght,"
said West, while Ingleborough looked on, quite un-
moved.
"Oh, don't tell me!" said the Boer, shaking his
head. "They all want to ?ght and kill the Boers before
robbing them of their homes and farms. Don't tell
me—I know!"
He walked away to where the Kaf?r was seeing

to the horses, and West noticed that he took a good
deal of notice of them, glanced two or three times in
the direction of his visitors, and then ran his hands
down their legs in a most professional way, narrowly
escaping a kick from West's steed, before he walked
thoughtfully back to his rough-looking house, into
which he was careful not to allow his guests to enter.
"We're to share the stable with the nags," said
Ingleborough; "but it doesn't matter. Let's go and
see how they are getting on," he continued, as the
Boer disappeared indoors. "We can't afford to have
them fed on some of his lordship's refuse. I know
something of the tricks of these gentlemen of old."
They entered the rough stable, where the big
Kaf?r was standing on one side and greeted them with
a heavy seowl.
"Well, Jack," said Ingleborough, "are the ponies
eating their corn?"
"Yes, baas," said the black gruf?y; "eat um all
fast." -
"Ah, I thought so," said Ingleborough quietly,
sniffing and blowing on the musty trash. "Do you
feed your horses on stuff like this?"
He turned so sharply on the Kaf?r that the man
shrank as if from a blow; but his questioner smiled.
"Not your fault, I suppose?"
"Baas say, 'Give ponies thaht,"' he replied apologe-
tical-ly.


## p. 267 (#281) ############################################

AT TANTE ANN'S. 267
"Of course, my lad," said Ingleborough, drawing
out a shilling and slipping it into the black's hand.
"Now you get some of the best corn, and see that
the horses eat it. You understand?"
' said the man, with a sharp click, as
his eyes glistened and he showed his white teeth in a
satis?ed grin. "Soon my baas go away, give them
good to eat."
"Yes, baas,'
"Is your baas going away?"
"Iss; saddle pony; go away."
As the black spoke he pointed to the farther end
of the long mud-walled shed, where another pony was
tied up.
just then the shrill voice of the Boer vrouw was
heard calling, and the Kaf?r gave a shout in reply.
"Tant' Ann want um," he said, and he ran out,
joined the lady at the door, and was dismissed to get
some fuel from a heap, while the farmer came out,
smoking away, and Ingleborough left the shed with
West as if to join him.
"Are you going to give him your opinion?" said
West.
"No: we can't afford to quarrel. The Kaf?r will
take care of our nags now, and get another 'tip for
his pains."
The next minute they were close up to their host,
who had evidently been thinking over the words which
had last been exchanged.

"You Englanders," he said, "think you are very
clever; but the Boers beat you before, and they're going
to beat you more this time, and drive you all into the
sea."
"Very well!" said West, smiling. "I hope they'll
give us time to get into the ships."
"Perhaps!" said the Boer, smoking more rapidly
"But it's all going to be Dutch
now! No more English!"
in his excitement.
"All right," said Ingleborough; "but I want my
supper very badly."
"Want to eat? Yes; come in! The vrouw says it
is nearly ready."
"That's right; then let's have it."
"You can come in the house," continued the
farmer, and Ingleborough raised his eyebrows a little
in surprise.
But a greater surprise awaited the pair on entering
the mud-?oored room to ?nd quite a decent meal
awaiting them on the table, and their sour-looking
heavy hostess ready to wait on them with a kind of
surly civility.
The pair were too hungry to think of anything
then but appeasing their appetite, and they made a
good meal, their host making no scruple about bringing
a stool to the table and taking a larger share than
either.
He said little, but his little keen eyes examined

everything in connection with his visitors' costume,
paying most heed to their weapons, while his wife saw
to the wants of all from time to time, retiring at inter-
vals to a second room which led out Of the ?rst and
seemed to have been added quite lately.
"You'll want to sleep soon?" said the farmer in-
quiringly, when the meal was ended.
"Yes, the sooner the better," said Ingleborough,
rising; an example followed by West; "and we Shall
be off in the morning early. We'll take a couple of
these cakes."
The Boer nodded.
"Shall I sell you some biltong?" he said.
"Yes, certainly."
"I will have it ready. Where are you going
now?"
"To look at the ponies."
"Oh, they are all well. My Kaf?r has seen to
them."
"But I suppose we are to Sleep out there?" said
Ingleborough.
"No," said the Boer; "you can sleep there," and
he pointed to a rough-looking bed in one corner of
the room. "My Kaf?r sleeps with the horses. My
vrouw and I sleep in the other room."
"Then as soon as we can we should like to turn
this dining-room into our bed-room," said Ingleborough.
"But we'll look at our ponies ?rst."

The Boer grunted and proceeded to re?ll his pipe,
while the two young men went out and across to the
rough shelter, where they found their ponies looking
evidently the better for a good feed, and the Kaf?r
grinning and ready to pat their plumped-out ?gures,
the ponies taking the touch of his hand as a friendly
caress.
"Eat a big lot," said the Kaf?r, in the Boer tongue.
"Ah, like this," and he held a native basket for their
inspection, at the bottom of which was a specimen of
the corn with which the ponies had been fed.
"That's right, jack! Capital; hard as shot! There's
another shilling for you!"
The Kaf?r grinned again with delight as he took
the money.
"Good baas!" he said. "Two good baas! Baas
want boy, jack come 'long with you!"
"Not this time, my lad!"
"Very glad to come 'long with good baas!" said
the man, in a disappointed tone of voice.
"No, we can't take you, my lad," said West, pat-
ting the big fellow on the Shoulder. "Have the ponies
saddled at daylight. We're going early."
The black nodded his head, and the pair, weary
enough now from their long journey, and drowsy after
their hearty meal, strode slowly back to the house, to
?nd that the table had been cleared, save thata couple
of big bread cakes lay on one end alongside of a little

pile of biltong, the sun-dried mahogany-looking strips
of ox-?esh so much in use among the rough farmers
of the veldt.
The dirty-looking room smelt hot and stuffy, but
a little window at the back had been thrown open,
and the soft air blowing from off miles of plain made
the place a little more bearable.
A common lamp had been lighted, and a streak
of light came from beneath the ill-?tting door which
led into the other room, from which the low murmur
of voices could be heard as the young men entered
talking cheerin together.
This announced their return, and the door creaked
upon its hinges, giving entrance to the farmer, who
pointed to the next day's provisions and signi?cantly
held out his hand.
"How much?" said West, and the man demanded
an unconscionable amount, which made the pair ex-
change glances. But Ingleborough nodded as much as
to say: "Pay the thief!" and the money was handed
over and taken with a grunt. After this the Boer passed
into the next room, closing the door after him; but
it did not prevent the acid voice of the vrouw from
reaching the visitors' ears as if to protest.
"The old scoundrel won't hand over the plunder,"
said Ingleborough, with a chuckle. "I hope she'll give
him what we didn't—~a thorough good tongue-thrashing."
He had hardly spoken when he found that he had

jumped at a wrong conclusion, for the door was pulled
open again and the Boer reappeared.
"Tante Ann says you are to make haste and put
out the lamp," he growled, "for she don't want to be
burned in her bed."
"All right, uncle," replied Ingleborough. "Good
night, and bless you for a ?ne specimen of the noble,
freedom-loving Boer. Say good night to Tante too,
and tell her that our sleeping chamber is the very per-
fection of domestic comfort."
"Hunk!" ejaculated the farmer, and he disappeared
again.
"I wonder that he did not turn upon you," said
West, rather reproachfully; "he must have understood
that you were speaking sarcastically."
"Not he," said his companion. "Thick-headed,
muddy-brained brute; more like a quadruped than a
man! The Kaf?rs are gentlemen to some of these up-
country farmers, and yet they are the slaves."
I "Too tired to discuss moral ethics!" said West
sleepily; "but really this place is awful. Agricultural
implements in one corner, sacks of something in an-
other, horns, saddles, tools—oh, I'm too sleepy to go I
on. Hallo! He has taken those two ri?es away that
were slung over that low cupboard."
"To be sure; so he has! Afraid we should steal
them, perhaps, and be off before he woke! I say, did
you notice how he examined ours?"


## p. 273 (#287) ############################################

AT TANTE ANN'S. 273
"Yes; I fancied he had noticed that they were
Mausers."
"Oh no. They were fresh to him. Well, I'm
going to take care that he doesn't help himself to them.
I don't know what you're going to do, but I'm going
to lie down on one side of that bed just as I am,
bandolier and all, and I vote we lay the ri?es be-
tween us."
"I shall do the same," said West. "\Vhat do you
say to leaving the door and window open for the sake
of the fresh air? No fear of lions here?"
"I don't know so much about that, but we should
get some warning from the horses and oxen. Bah!
It's not likely. What now?"
There was a heavy thumping at the door leading
into the other room, and the vrouw's shrill voice was
heard ordering them to put out the light.
"Tell her, West, that her royal commands shall
be instantly obeyed by her obedient slaves."
"Shan't," replied West. "That will quiet her,"
and he turned out the light, putting an end to its abo-
minable emanation of coarse petroleum, while the soft
starry light of a glorious night stole in, showing the
shapes of door and windows.
"Hah! That's better!" said Ingleborough, making
the rough bedstead creak as he laid himself gently '
down. "I hope none of these cartridges will explode.
Oh, how I can sleepl"
18

274 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"And so can I," sighed West, "even dressed up
like this," after laying his ri?e alongside of his com-
panion's, straight down the middle of the bed.
"We didn't tell Jack the Kaf?r to bring our shav-
ing-water at daybreak," said Ingleborough, who now
that he was in a horizontal position seemed to have
suddenly grown wakeful. "I say."
"Well?"
"I wonder how our dear friend Anson is!"
West made no reply.
"I say! West!"
"Oh, don't talk, please. I want to sleep."
"All right, you shall, till I see the pearly dawn
streaming. in through that little window at the back
here. I say, though, if you hear me turn round in the
night and the cartridges begin to pop, just wake me
up, or there may be an accident."
West again made no reply.
"And we Should have Tante Ann waking up,
when there would be a greater explosion still. There,
good night!"
"Good night."
Then silence, save that the cry of some prowling
creature far out on the veldt sounded wonderftu like
the baying of a dog.

CHAPTER XXVI. '
A DARK VISITOR.
AN hour must have passed away, during which
neither of the weary bearers of the despatch
moved. Then in a low whisper West spoke.
"Asleep, Ingle?"
"Asleep? No," was whispered back. "I can't
close my eyes."
"Neither can I."
"Why not?"
"Over tired and excited, I suppose. All this is
so strange too."
"What have you been thinking about?"
"At ?rst I could only think of the despatch and
wonder whether we Should get it to Mafeking. Then
I began thinking of that black out in the stable and
what he said."
"About his master wanting his pony saddled?"
whispered Ingleborough.
"Yes. What did he want his pony saddled for at
that time of night?"
18"

"How strange!" said Ingleborough. "That's what
kept on bothering me!"
"Ingle."
"Yes."
"Do you think that fellow meant treachery?"
"I don't know; but I'd believe in any treacherous
act on the part of a Boer."
"Would he be likely to ride off somewhere to
where there is a commando?"
"For the sake of getting us taken prisoners or
shot?"
"Or so as to get possession of our ponies! I saw
him examining them as if he liked them."
"So did -I."
There was silence again, and West spoke.
"Ingle," he said, "I can't sleep here; the despatch
seems to be sticking into me to remind me of my duty.
We shall rest better in our saddles than on this
wretched bed. What do you say—the free cool air
of the veldt, or this stuffy, paraf?ny room?"
"Let's be off, and at once!"
"We will. We can slip out quietly without wak-
ing these people, and most likely we are misjudging
the man, who has the regular racial hatred of the
British."
"Perhaps; but we must be careful, for if he heard
us going to the shed and meddling with the horses he'd
likely enough begin blazing away at us with his ri?e."

At that moment \Vest clutched his companion's
arm, for they heard no sound, but all at once the dark
silhouette of a man's head appeared framed in the
little back window against a background of starry points
which glistened like gold.
Ingleborough's hand stole to his ri?e, which he
grasped, as both held their breath; but he did not at-
tempt to raise it, for the head was thrust inside, and
a voice whispered the one word: "Baas."
"Yes," said West softly. "What is" it, my lad?"
"My baas take pony and ride away. Go to fetch
?ghting Boer to shoot good baas. You and good
baas him."
"Ah?" said West.
"Iss. jack put saddles on Basuto ponies; put
bridles on Basuto ponies. Good baas both come and
ride away. Tant' Ann never hear nothing. Sleep all
night."
"And if we go what will your baas do to you
when he comes and ?nds the ponies gone?" said West.
"Bad baas never see me again! Going home to
my country to-night."
"Ah, that's better!" said Ingleborough. "Here,
take the two ri?es, and we'll get out here. jack, my
lad, you're a trump, and you shall have ?ve two-shilling
pieces for this, to buy new blankets."
The Kaf?r chuckled and clicked with satisfaction
as he stood holding the ri?es till Ingleborough slipped

out, \Vest pausing to cram the bread cakes and bi!-
tong into their satchels, after which he too slipped
out, and the trio hurried towards the stables.
"How far has your baas to ride to the ?ghting
Boers?" West asked the Kaf?r.
"Long ride," replied the black. "Many Boers
yesterday, many Boers other day, many Boers come in
morning with baas."
"Then we're all right for a good start," said Ingle-
borough. "I say, West, you're always taking me into
some trap: hadn't I better lead?"
"You are leading now," replied West. "How do
we know that there are not a dozen of the enemy in
the stable?"
"What! Oh, nonsense! Come along!"
The ponies whinnied as they entered, and the
black struck a match and lit a wagon lantern, showing
that they were ready bridled and their heads tied up
to a rail, while examination proved that the saddles
were properly girthed ready for a start.
"Here, stop a minute!" said Ingleborough, as the
man began to unfasten the reims attached to the ponies'
heads. "Here, I promised you ?ve two-shilling pieces,"
and he counted them out ready in his hand, making the
black's eyes sparkle with delight in the lamplight.
"Stop," said West sharply; "the poor fellow's
losing his place, such as it is, by helping us. I have
our expenses money, and I shall give him a sovereign."


## p. 279 (#293) ############################################

A DARK VISITOR. 279
"Well, he deserves it," said Ingleborough, as
West pushed back his companion's hand containing the
silver coins with his left, and held out the sovereign,
which looked very bright and new in the yellow light
shed by the lantern.
A sudden change came over the Kaf?r's face at
once. Instead of the grinning white teeth and twinkling
eyes his lips were drawn tightly over his teeth, and
a scowl contracted his eyes.
"No, no, no," he cried, with child'like petulance,
in the Boer Dutch, sadly mutilated. "No want one.
Say ?ve big shillings."
"What!" cried West. "Why, this is worth twice
as much."
"No, no," cried the man angrily. "Want to cheat
poor black Kaf?r. No, no; Olebo want to help white
baas! White baas want cheat poor black Zulu!"
"Poor old chapl" said Ingleborough, laughing
merrily; "his education has been sadly neglected.
Here, Jack—Olebo, or whatever your name is—take the
sovereign, and you Shall have the ?ve two-shillings
pieces as well."
"Eh? No cheat Zulu boy?" cried the man doubt-
ingly.
"No, all right; catch hold. There, now you can
buy many blankets, and may you never be tricked
any worse!"
"Hah! Yes; buy lot, take home!" And the white

teeth were shown again as the coins were gripped
fast, including the sovereign, which was held up ?rst
to the light. "White shilling? N0: yellow farden."
"All right; but take it to an honest man, my lad.
Now then, untie those reims."
The black turned to obey, but stopped short and
stood staring away through the open side of the shed
for a few moments, with the light shining full upon
his face, showing his starting eyes, open mouth, and
dilated quivering nostrils.
"\Vhat's the matter? Can he hear a lion?"
whispered \Vest.
"Here, stop, stop!" cried Ingleborough. "Finish
your job!—\Ve've paid him too well and too soon.
He's off to run amok among the brandy and blanket
dealers."
For the black had darted outside, but in the gloom
they saw him suddenly throw himself down and lay
one ear to the ground.
"Yes, he can hear a lion," grumbled Ingleborough;
"but the ponies haven't caught it yet."
He had hardly ?nished speaking before the Kaf?r
sprang up again and dashed into the Shed, where he
reached up and dragged something from the rafters
which proved to be an elephant-hide shield with three
assegais secured to the handhold inside.
"Baas hold this!" he said excitedly. "Boer coming.
Olebo hear horses!"


## p. 281 (#295) ############################################

A DARK VISITOR. 28!
Half throwing the weapons to Ingleborough, who
caught them, and leaned them against his side while
he examined the charges of his ri?e, an action imitated
by West, the Kaf?r rapidly unfastened the reims, setting
the ponies' heads free, and then darted at the lantern,
opened the door, and blew out the light.
"Now come 'long," he whispered, and taking the
ponies' heads he placed himself between them and led
them along, stopping the next moment to hold them
steady while their riders mounted.
"Olebo run 'long with two baas show the way,"
he said. "Basuto ponies tumble over ostrich pens."
"Hah! Good idea! " said West, and, listening now,
he fancied he made out the sound of a troop of horse
in the distance; but Ingleborough said he could hear
nothing yet.
Leaving themselves to the guidance of the Kaf?r,
they found to their surprise that, instead of striking
straight off, he led them to the house, and then round
to the back, where the little window by whose means
he had stolen close to where they lay and given the
alarm stood open.
"Here, take your shield!" said Ingleborough.
"Wait a bit!" replied the black, chuckling.
"Hist! You'll have the old vrouw hear."
"No," said the black con?dently; "fast asleep.
Wicked old witch! Throw kettle at Kaf?r, hot water
burn back! Wait a bit; you see!"

282 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
Dependent as they were on the man's guidance
through the darkness amongst the enclosures, the fugi-
tives left him to himself for a few moments, wondering
what he was about to do.
They soon knew, for he stopped the ponies close
to the little window, left their heads, and went close
up, to begin fumbling about his spare garments, whence
came the chink of the coins he had just received.
"Matches," he said, and West made out that he
took a few from the box he held in his hand, and
then reached in at the window, chuckling softly.
"Ingle," whispered West, with horror in his voice.
"What's the matter?"
"Do you know what he's doing?"
"Nobbling a couple of the blankets because he
isn't going to stay for his wages?"
"No; I'm sure he has emptied the match-box on
the straw mattress, and is going to burn down the
house."
" Nonsense ! "
Crack! went a match by way of endorsement of
West's words, and the next moment the little ?ame
began to burn inside the Kaf?r's hands, lighting up his
exulting countenance as he waited till the splint of
wood was well alight.
"What are you going to do?" said West hoarsely,
as he leaned forward and laid his right hand upon the
black's shoulder.

"Don't shake light out!" was the answer. "Olebo
going make big ?re, roast Tant' Ann! Big fat witch,
soon burn!"
As the Kaf?r ?nished he lowered one hand, leaving
the match blazing brightly, and he was in the act of
leaning in to apply it to the little heap of matches he
had placed upon the loose straw mattress, when a
sharp snatch at his shoulder jerked him back, and the
burning splint dropped to the ground.
"Ah—h—-h!" growled the man savagely, and he
drew another match across the box he still held.
"None of that!" growled Ingleborough sternly.
"Wicked old witch!" said the black, in remon-
strance. "Burn Olebo! Don't give him enough to eat!
No good!"
"You come along," cried West. "I can hear the
Boers coming fast. Now then, lead the horses clear
of the pens!"

HE Kaf?r grunted, and began what Ingleborough
afterwards called "chuntering," but he obeyed at
once, leading the ponies at a quick walk in and out
amongst several ostrich enclosures, till they were quite
a quarter of a mile from the farm, from which there
came the buzz of voices and the occasional stamp of
a horse on the Still night air.
"No more wire fence!" said their guide, and in-
dicating that they should urge the ponies forward he
took his Shield and spears from Ingleborough, caught
hold of the mane of West's pony, and then as they
broke into a canter, ran lightly by the animal's side,
talking softly, and now and then breaking out into a
merry laugh.
"Ought burn Tant' Ann!" he said. "Wicked old
witch! Very fat! Make her good vrouw!"
"I'm afraid jack's morals are sadly in need of
improvement, lad," said Ingleborough at last.
"What a horrible ideal" replied West, with a

shudder; "and the worst of it is that the fellow seems
to consider that it would have been a good piece of
fun."
"Yes, it is his nature to, as we are told of the
bears and lions in the poems of Dr. Watts. I dare-
say the old woman had been a horrible tyrant to the
poor fellow!"
"But the hideous revenge!"
"Which hasn't come off, my lad! But the black
scoundrel's ideas are shocking in the extreme, and I
would not associate with him much in the future.
Here! Hi! Olebo, stop!"
The young man drew rein, and the black looked
up enquiringly.
"Lie down and listen for the Boers!"
The Kaf?r nodded, and trotted a dozen yards away
from the side of the ponies, threw himself down,
listened, jumped up, and repeated the performance
three times at greater distances before returning.
"No hear!" he said. "Gone other way."
"It would be safe then to strike a match and look
at the compass," suggested West, and, taking out his
box, he struck a light, shaded it in his slouch hat, and
then held the little pocket compass to it.
"Well, which way are we going?"
"Due cast."
"Then we'll turn due north, and travel that way
till to-morrow night, and see what that brings forth."


## p. 286 (#302) ############################################

286 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
Starting off again, they journeyed on, sometimes
at a walk, sometimes at an easy canter, so as to save
the horses as much as possible, while the Kaf?r kept
up, seeming not in the slightest degree distressed, but
ready to enter into conversation at any time, after
changing from one side to the other so as to hold on
by a different hand.
"Soon be daylight now," said West; "but I hope
this fellow does not expect to keep on with us, does he?"
"Oh no, I don't think so for a moment. We'll
pull up before sunrise at some sheltered place and have
a good look-out for danger before letting the ponies
graze and having breakfast. Let's see what happens
then!"
But the sun was well up before a suitable kopje
came in sight, one so small that it did not appear
likely to contain enemies, but suf?ciently elevated to
give an observer a good view for miles through the
clear veldt air.
"Looks safel" said Ingleborough; "but burnt Eng-
lish children fear the Boer ?re. Let's have a good
circle round."
This was begun, and the black instantly grasped
what was intended, and hanging well down from West's
stirrup-leather, he began to search the ground carefully
for tracks, looking up from time to time and pointing
out those of antelopes, lions, and ostriches, but never
the hoof of horse or the footprint of man.

"No Boer there!" he said. "No one come. Good
water," he continued, pointing to the slight tracts of
grass which had sprung up where a stream rising
among the rocks was losing itself in the dry soil, but
which looked brighter and greener as it was nearer to
the kopje, which was fairly furnished with thorn-bush
and decent-sized trees.
"Any Boers hiding there?" said West Sharply.
"Boers ride there on ponies!" replied the Kaf?r
decisively, as he pointed down at the drab dust. "No
ponies make marks."
"That's enough," said Ingleborough. "Come
along."
Without hesitation now they put their mounts to
a canter, rode up to the pleasant refreshing-looking
place, and after leaving the ponies with the Kaf?r and
climbing tO one of the highest points, took a good look
round. This proved that there was not a mounted man
in sight, and they descended to select a spot where
there was plenty of herbage and water for their steeds,
when they sat down and began to breakfast.
"Nothing like a ?ne appetite," said West, after
they had been eating for some little time; "but this
biltong is rather like eating a leg of mahogany dining_
table into which a good deal of salt gravy and furniture
Oil has been allowed to soak."
"Yes, it is rather wooden," said Ingleborough coolly.
"Must wear out a man's teeth a good deal."

"Eland," said the Kaf?r, tapping his stick of the
dried meat on seeing his companions examining and
smelling the food. "Old baas shoot eland, Olebo cut
him up and dry him in the sun. Good."
"\Vell, it isn't bad, O child of nature! But I say,
how far do you mean to come with us?"
replied the man. " Go Olebo
kraal, see wife. Give her big shilling and little yellow
shilling—Good?"
He brought out the sovereign from where it had

been placed, and held it up.
"Good? Yes," said \Vest, and he set to work to
try and explain by making the black bring out a ?orin
and then holding up his outspread ten ?ngers, when the
man seemed to have some idea of his meaning.
"Look here, I'll get it into his benighted intellect;
but I Should have thought that he would have known
what a sovereign was worth."
just then the Ka?ir nodded sharply, after examin-
ing the coin.
"Gold?" he said, in Dutch.
"Of course," said Ingleborough, taking out a
sovereign and ten more ?orins, which he placed in a
heap and at a Short distance from the little pile he laid
down the sovereign. "Look here, Olebo," he said,
taking up the ten ?orins. "Buy four blankets!"
The Kaf?r nodded, and his instructor replaced the
heavy coins in his pocket to take up the sovereign.


## p. 289 (#305) ############################################

NIGHT ON THE VELDT. 289
"Now, see here," said Ingleborough, holding it
out. "Buy four blankets."
"Ah!" cried the delighted black, snatching out his
own treasured coins, the gold in one hand, the silver
in the other. "Buy four blankets for Olebo wife," he
cried, holding forward the silver. Then putting it be-
hind him he held out the sovereign: "Buy four blankets
for Olebo."
"Now we've got it," cried West, laughing, and
watching the way in which the black hid his cash away.
"I say," he continued, to his companion, speaking in
English, "where does he put that money to keep it
safe?"
"I dunno,"
said Ingleborough. "It seems to come
natural to these Kaf?rs to hide away their treasures
cunningly. See how artful they are over the diamonds!
He doesn't put the cash in his trousers pockets, nor
yet in his waistcoat, nor yet his coat, because he has
neither one nor the other. I expect he has a little
snakeskin bag somewhere inside his leather-loincloth.
But here, I'm thirsty; let's have some water!"
As he spoke Ingleborough sprang up and walked .
towards the head of the spruit, followed by his com-
panions, and they passed the two ponies, which were
hard at work on the rich green herbage along the border
of the stream. Then, getting well ahead of them, all
lay down and thoroughly quenched their thirst.
"Now," said West, "what next? We ought to

go on at once," and he unconsciously laid his hand
upon the spot where the despatch was hidden.
"No," replied Ingleborough, "that won't do. \Ve
seem safe here, and we must hasten slowly. We're
ready enough to go on, but the ponies must be
properly nursed. They want more grass and a rest."
"The sun is getting hot too," said West, in ac-
knowledgment of his comrade's words of wisdom.
"We'll stop till evening, lad," continued Ingle-
borough, "and take it in turn to sleep in the shade of
those bushes if we can ?nd a soft spot. We had no
rest last night."
"I suppose that must be it," replied West, and
he joined in a sigh on ?nding a satisfactory spot beneath
a mass of granite from which overhung a quantity
of thorn-bush and creeper which formed an impene-
trable shade.
The black followed them, noting keenly every
movement and trying hard to gather the meaning of
the English words.
"Two baas lie down long time, go to sleep," he
said at last, in broken Dutch. "Olebo sit and look,
see if Boer come. See Boer, make baas wake up."
"No," said West; "you two lie down and sleep.
I'll take the ?rst watch."
Ingleborough made no opposition, and after West
had climbed up to a spot beneath a tree from which
he could get a good stretch of the veldt in view, the

others lay down at once and did not stir a limb till
West stepped down to them, when the Kaf?r sprang
up without awakening Ingleborough.
"Olebo look for Boers now," he said.
West hesitated, and the Kaf?r grasped the mean-
ing of his silence.
"Olebo come and tell baas when big old baas go
to fetch Boers," he said.
"So you did," cried the young Englishman warmly,
"and I'll trust you now. Mind the ponies don't stray
away."
The black showed his beautiful white teeth in a
happy satis?ed laugh.
"Too much grass, too much nice water," he said.
"Basuto pony don't go away from baas only to ?nd
grass." 7
"You're right!" said West. "Wait till the sun is
there!" he continued, pointing to where it would be
about two hours after midday, "and then wake the
other baas."
The Kaf?r nodded, and West lay down to rest,
as he put it to himself, for he was convinced that he
would be unable to sleep; but he had not lain back
?ve minutes, gazing at the sunlit rivulet and the ponies
grazing, before his lids closed and all was nothingness
till he was roused by a touch from Ingleborough.
The sun was just dipping like a huge orange ball in
the vermilion and golden west.

"Had a good nap, old fellow?"
"Oh, it's wonderful!" said the young man, spring-
ing up. "I don't seem to have been asleep ?ve
minutes."
"I suppose not. \Vell, all's right, and Black jack
is waiting to say good-bye. He wants to start off
home." 5
The Kaf?r came up from where he had been patting
and caressing the ponies, and stood looking at them as
motionless in the ruddy evening light as a great bronze
image.
"Olebo go now," he said, turning his shield to
show that the remains of his share of the provisions
were secured to the handle by a rough net of freshly-
plaited grassy rush. "Olebo see baas, both baas, some
day." He accompanied the words with a wistful look
at each, and before they could think of what to say
in reply he turned himself sharply and ran off at a
rapid rate, getting out of sight as quickly as he could
by keeping close to the bushes, before striking out
into the veldt.
"Humph! I suppose they are treacherous savages,
some of them," said Ingleborough thoughtfully; "but
there doesn't seem to be much harm in that fellow if
he were used well."
"I believe he'd make a very faithful servant,"
said West sadly. "I'm beginning to be sorry we let
him go."

"So am I. We shall feel quite lonely without
him. But the despatch."
"Ah yes, the despatch!" said West, pulling him-
self together. "Now then, boot and saddle, and a long
night's ridel"
"And a good day's rest afterwards! That's the
way we must get on."
A quarter of an hour after, they had taken their
bearings by compass and mounted, when the well-
refreshed ponies started off at once in a brisk canter,
necessitating the drawing of the rein from time to
time; and then it was on, on, on at different rates
beneath the wonderfully bright stars of a glorious night,
during which they passed several farms and one good-
sized village, which were carefully avoided, for they
had enough provisions to last them for another day,
and naturally if a halt was to be made to purchase
more it would have to be at a seasonable time.
"Yes," said Ingleborough laughingly, "it would
be a sure way of getting cartridges if we wanted them
and roused up a Boer farmer in the night. He would
soon give us some, the wrong way on."
"Yes," said West, "and there would be the dogs
to deal with as well. Hark at that deep-mouthed
brute!"
For just then the cantering of their ponies had
been heard by the watch-dog at one of the farms, and
it went on baying at them till the sounds grew faint.

294 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
Then it was on and on again till a strange feeling
of weariness began to oppress them, and they had
to ?ght with the desire which made them bend forward
and nod over their ponies' necks, rising up again with
a dislocating start.
At the second time of this performance West made
a great effort and began watching his companion, to
see that he was just as bad. Then the intense desire
to sleep began to master the watcher again.
"Hi, Ingle!" he cried. "Rouse up, and let's walk
for a mile or two."
"Yes, yes.—-\Vhat's that?" cried Ingleborough,
springing off his pony and cocking his ri?e.
For there was a sudden rushing noise as of a
great crowd of animals, of what kind it was still too
dark to see; but it was evident that they had come
suddenly upon a migratory herd of the graceful-limbed
antelopes that had probably been grazing and had been
startled into ?ight.
"Pity it was not light!" said Ingleborough, with
a sigh. "We could have got some fresh meat, and
then at the ?rst patch of wood and pool of water we
could have had a ?re and frizzled antelope-steaks."
But a couple of hours later, when they halted for
their rest and refreshment, it was stale cake, hard
biltong, and cool fresh water.
"Never mind, we're miles nearer Mafekingl" said
West. "How many more nights Will it take?"

NIGHT ON THE VELDT. 295
The answer to that question had not been arrived
at when they dropped asleep, lulled by the sound of
rippling water and the crop, crap, crop made by the
grazing ponies, and this time their weariness was so
great that sleep overcame them both. Ingleborough
was to have watched, but nature was too strong, and
both slept till sundown, to rise up full of a feeling of
self-reproach.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
A LOUD REPORT.
AYS of rest and nights of travel succeeded, during
which the despatch-riders began to wonder at the
ease with which they progressed.
"I thought it would be twice as hard a task!"
said West. "Here have we been two days without a
sign of a Boer! \Ve must be very near Mafeking now."
"Yes, very," said Ingleborough drily; "nearer than
I thought. Haltl"
He drew rein as he spoke, West's pony stopping
short at the same time as its companion.
They had been riding steadily on through the
night, and now as the ponies stood side by side they
stretched out their necks in the soft cool darkness, and
the sound of their cropping told that they were amongst
grass.
"Why did you pull up?" said West, in a cautious
whisper.
"For you to hear how near we are to Mafeking
'7
HOW.

A LOUD REPORT. 297
"Near?"
"Yes; can't you hear the ?ring?"
"No," said West, after a few moments' pause.
"Yes, now I do," he cried eagerly, for all at once
there was a dull concussion as if a blow had been
delivered in the air.
"A heavy gun," cried West excitedly.
"Hist!"
"I forgot," said West softly. "That must be one
of the Siege guns," he continued. '
"Yes," said Ingleborough, "and it must be near
daybreak, with the bombarding beginning. Be careful;
perhaps we are nearer the enemy than we thought."
At the end of a couple of minutes there was the
dull concussion of another heavy gun, and this was
continued at intervals of ten or ?fteen minutes during
the next hour, while the adventurers advanced cautiously
at a walk, keeping a sharp look-out through the trans-
parent darkness for a patch Of rocks or woodland which
might serve for their next halt. But day had quite
dawned before a suitable place of refuge presented
itself, in the Shape of one of the low kopjes.
"Dismount!" whispered Ingleborough Sharply, and
they spent the next ten minutes carefully scanning the
district round in full expectation of seeing some Sign
of the enemy.
But nothing worse was in view than two or three
of the scattered farms of the open veldt, and in the

distance a dark indistinct patch which appeared to be
a herd of grazing cattle, but so distant that neither
could be sure.
On their way to the patch Of rock and brush that
was to be their last resting-place before making a
dash for the beleaguered town, they struck upon
the trail going north and south, and in two places
scared off vultures from the carcass of an unfortunate
ox, shrunken and dried in the sun till little but the
bones and hide were left.
They were too distant to make out the smoke,
but steadily increasing ?re told plainly enough that they
were quite near enough for a dash into the town when
darkness set in that night.
"You think then that this will be the best way?"
said West, as they reached their Shelter without seeing
a Sign of danger.
"I am not sure yet!" replied Ingleborough. "In
fact, I'm very doubtful whether we Should not fail, for
the place is certain to be surrounded by the enemy,
and we should very likely be ridden or shot down."
Oliver West laid his hand upon the despatch,
pressing it so that the paper crackled beneath the cloth.
"Then we had better ride in as near as we dare,
and then try and creep in at the darkest time."
"Let's pray for the clouds to be thick then!" said
Ingleborough; "for the moon's getting past the ?rst
quarter. Last night would have done exactly."

"But we were not here. Hark at the ?ring!"
"Yes; it sounds as if Mafeking will be taken be-
fore we get there!"
"For goodness' sake don't talk like that!"
"Don't let's talk at all then. Let's get well into
shelter. But I see no sign of water yet."
Neither did the speaker after they had carefully
explored the rocky hillock, but fortunately there was
an ample supply of succulent grass for the ponies,
which were soon after luxuriating in a good roll, be-
fore grazing contentedly away, while their riders, after
another examination of the place and glance round
from the highest point, had to satisfy themselves with
a very scanty shelter and a much scantier meal.
"Never mind," said Ingleborough; "we shall be
breakfasting in luxury to-morrow morning, I hope, with
our appetites sharpened by the knowledge that we have
achieved our task."
"I hope so!" said West gravely.
"But don't doubt, my lad," cried Ingleborough
cheerily. "Don't be downhearted now we are so near!"
"I can't help it!" replied West. "I feel on thorns,
and my state of anxiety Will grow worse and worse
till we get there. Hark at the ?ring!"
"I can hear," said Ingleborough coolly. "Be very
deaf if I couldn't! There, that's the last scrap of cake,
so let's drown our troubles in sleep. You have ?rst
turn!"

"No," replied \Vest. "I feel too anxious to sleep!
You begin."
"Can't," was the reply. "If anything, I feel more
anxious than you do. I couldn't rest!"
"I wish we could canter gently on till we were
seen by the Boers, and then go on full gallop right
into the town ! " said West. "\Vould it be too dangerous?"
"just madness!" replied Ingleborough. "No; it
must be done with guile. They would cut us off for
certain."
"I'm afraid sol" said West. "Very well, then,
we must wait for the evening."
"And sit wakeful," said Ingleborough.
"Yes," said West. "Sleep is impossible!"
And sit there wakeful they did, hour after hour,
their only satisfaction being that of seeing their weary
horses enjoying a good feed untroubled by the in-
creasing heat, or the cares which harassed their masters.
_For as the sun rose higher the distant ?ring in-
creased, till it was evident that a terrible attack was
going on, and in his weariness and despair no words
on the part of Ingleborough had any effect upon West,
who felt convinced that before they could continue
their journey Mafeking would have fallen into the
enemy's hands. .
There was no further talk of sleep. The heat,
?ies, hunger, and a burning thirst were either of them
suf?cient to have kept them awake, without the terrible

feeling of anxiety and the alarms caused by bodies of
horsemen or lines of wagons journeying in the direc-
tion they were waiting to take.
Again and again parties of the Boers seemed to
be coming straight for the hiding-place, and West and
his companion crept on hands and knees towards their
ponies, getting hold Of their reims, and then crouching
by them ready to mount and gallop for their lives
should the necessity arise.
But it did not, and in a strangely-feverish dream-
like way the day glided on and evening at last
came, bringing with it wafts of cooler air and, what
was of more consequence to them still, a feeling of
hope, ror though the ?ring still went on, it had dwindled
down into the slow steady reports of one heavy piece
discharged at about the same rate as when they had
?rst heard the ?ring in the morning.
"And it tells its own tale with truthful lips!" said
Ingleborough. "The town is still holding out, and the
defenders have ceased to reply."
"Because they are nearly beaten!" said West sadly.
"By no means, you croaking Old raven!" cried
Ingleborough cheerily. "It's because they want to save
their ammunition! They only want to ?re when they
have something worth ?ring at. As for the enemy,
they have the whole town to shoot at, and keep on
pitching their shells in at random. There, don't be
grumpy ! "

"I can't help it!" cried West passionately. "Give
me credit for having kept up well till now. It's be-
cause we are so near success that I feel everything so
keenly."
"I know, old fellow, and you may trust me!" said
Ingleborough. "I didn't play a false prophet's part
just to encourage you. I'm speaking the simple truth!
just a little more patience, and you Shall deliver your
despatch."
"If I could only feel that!" cried \Vest. "It may
be the saving of Mafeking to receive news perhaps of
help being on the way."
"Be patient then! It will soon be night, and then
we'll mount and make our ?nal dash!"
"No," said West bitterly; "we shall have to make
it now. Look."

CHAPTER XXIX.
HARD PUSHED.
INGLEBOROUGH shaded his eyes and turned very
grave, for on gazing in the direction pointed out
by his companion's ?nger he saw a column of horse-
men creeping over the veldt as if coming straight for
their resting-place, while as they came nearer the eager
watchers could make out that the party were guard-
ing a long train of wagons drawn by great teams of
oxen. They found that there were two other teams,
not of oxen, but of ponies similar to their own, and
not dragging the great tilt-covered wagons, but some-
thing heavy and comparatively small.
"Guns!" said Ingleborough laconically.
"Yes, and heavy guns too!" cried West.
"You're right, lad; and they will not come near
us. It's an ammunition train, and they'll go straight
for Mafeking! That's another false alarm!"
Ingleborough was quite right, for the distant train
crept slowly on along the track till it grew dim and
distant as the sun sank lower and ?nally disappeared

in the haze of dust. But the troubles of the despatch-
bearers were not at an end, and they lay watching the
west with its great masses of lit-up clouds, glorious in
their colouring, till the last bright lights had died out,
before they turned to look in the direction of the east.
And then \Vest drew his companion's attention to the
fact that behind them the sky was perfectly clear, and
the pale moon, a couple of days past the ?rst quarter,
was gradually growing brighter and brighter in what
promised to be a perfectly unclouded night.
"Yes," said Ingleborough coolly; "we shall have
a glorious time for our ride."
"A glorious night for the Boer outposts to take
aim at us as we ride in."
"No," said Ingleborough coolly. "I think not!"
"What do you mean?" said West, turning sharply
upon his companion. "You have some fresh idea?"
"Well, yes. Being in such a pickle as this sets
a man sharpening his wits to try and make them keen."
"Of course. What are you going to do?"
"Wait a bit and see!" replied Ingleborough coolly.
"I'm sharpening still."
West turned away impatiently, to go, stooping
as low as he could, towards his pony, which was
straggling away, and bring it back to the bushes which
had helped to hide them all the day, after which they
sat in silence for about an hour, until it was quite
plain that the night was as dark as it was likely to

be. Then in a nervous excited way he turned to
Ingleborough again.
"Yes," said the latter, without waiting for West to
speak; "it will grow no darker unless we wait hours for
the moon to set, and by that time I hope we shall be
in Mafeking."
"What do you mean to do then?"
"Mount and ride steadily on at a gentle canter
till we get in touch with that ammunition train."
"But we shall be challenged by their rear-guard."
"Perhaps," said Ingleborough coolly; "perhaps
not. I reckon on getting pretty close up without. If
we are challenged, I want you to do as I tell you."
"Of course," replied West. "Anything to ful?l
our task!"
"Ready?"
"And waiting!"
"Then mount!"
Their ponies were waiting patiently by their sides,
and the next minute they had sprung into the saddles
and rode off in the direction taken by the train.
West asked no questions, for he was full of con-
?dence in his long-tried companion, and with the ponies
well refreshed and eager from their rest, they rode
steadily on, keeping a sharp look-out for danger, but
meeting with no adventure for quite a couple of hours,
by which time both felt that they must be getting near
to the end of their journey.

But they had nothing to guide them, for they were
off the track, and even had they been on, it would
have been impossible to follow it in the strange eerie
light shed by the quarter-moon. Once they had evi-
dence that they were in all probability going right, for
a horrible odour suddenly assailed their nostrils, making
them press their ponies' sides and go past something
indistinct at a gallop, holding their breath till they were
well beyond what was in all probability the body of
some wretched horse or ox that had died of overwork
and exhaustion.
"We must keep on now!" whispered Ingleborough.
"I feel'that we are going right."
"But the Boer laagers and outposts!" whispered
back \Vest.
"Somewhere ahead, lad; but we must leave some-
thing to chance. We are, say, within half-a-dozen miles
of Mafeking, so I put it; perhaps not more than two
or three. Keep a sharp look-out for lights."
"The enemy's?"
"Or friends'," replied Ingleborough. "There's a
good deal of chance now, and we must trust a little
to our luck."
"In other words, you mean make a bold dash?"
"Yes, but not a blind one! Iwant to put a little
gumption into what we do! You'll trust me?"
"I will!"
"Forward then, and give the ponies their heads!"


## p. 307 (#323) ############################################

HARD PUSHED. 307
West gave vent to a deep low "Hah!" of satis-
faction, and away they went, with their mounts seeming
to exult in the freedom from pressure on their bits,
keeping close together, and bounding along over the
level veldt as if perfectly familiar with the way, though
their riders knew it to be bespread with pitfalls in the
shape of the burrows made by the aardvarks and other
animals that made the wide open veldt their home.
The moon shone brightly now, though the light
was puzzling, and the distance ahead looked strange
and weird; but the pace at which they were going had
a peculiarly exhilarating effect upon both of the riders,
who seemed to share the excitement of their ponies.
For, guesswork though it was, West felt that Mafeking
must lie right ahead, and as they dashed on he began
to feel a kind of certainty that if left to themselves
their sagacious steeds would take them right into the
town.
A good four miles must have been passed over
in this way, and at last a fresh sensation began to
attack West, ?lling him with anxiety lest they should
be going in the wrong direction. For he argued that
they must before now, if right, have come upon Signs
of the besiegers, and he was in the act of leaning over
towards Ingleborough to make him acquainted with his
fears, when all doubt was chased away by a loud
challenge from I115 right, followed by a ?ash and a
report. '

That one shot was the opening note of an over-
ture, for directly after the balls began whistling over
their heads, and the ?rst reports grew into a loud rattle
followed by the trampling of horses and loud shouting.
"It's all right," said Ingleborough coolly; "they're
?ring at random. It's impossible to take aim on a
night like this! Can you see them?"
"No; only the ?ashes!" said \Yest excitedly.
"That's enough! Then they can't see us! We're
through their lines too, for they're ?ring behind us,
and I'll back our horses to beat theirs in a race."
Reports now began to ring out on their right, and
directly after they came from their left.
"Shall we shout?" whispered \Vest.
"No. What for?"
"We must be getting among our own people!"
"No such luck, my lad! Keep steadily on! Ah!
Poor beast!"
"What is it?" said \Vest excitedly, as his mount
stopped short, obeying its natural instinct and the love
of companionship of a gregarious animal. For Ingle-
borough's pony had suddenly uttered a peculiar neigh-
ing cry, reared up, and fallen backwards.
"Are you hurt?" whispered \Vest again.
"No; I just escaped! Quick; jump down."
West was on his feet directly, and Ingleborough
grasped his arm.
"I'd say ride for it alone, lad," he whispered, with

his lips close to his companion's ear; "but my way is
safest. Now down on your hands and knees and let's
play wild dog or baboon!"
"I don't understand you!" whispered West.
"Never mind; do as I do!" and the next minute
they were going along on hands and knees over the
level ground, feeling it quiver with the trampling of
galloping horses all round, while the ?ashing of ri?es
and the crackling reports seemed to be coming from
all directions.
So near to them came some of the horsemen that
West felt certain they must be seen; but there was
no hail, no whistling bullet, and, wearisome though the
way of progression was to the muscles and painful to
hands and knees, West kept on side by side with his
companion till the ?ring began to drop off and then
ceased, though the hurrying to and fro of horses still
went on.
"It was sooner than I intended," said Ingleborough
at last; "but I meant for us to dismount at last and
crawl. If we are seen the enemy will take us for
hyaenas or dogs."
He had hardly whispered these words before a
shot was ?red from their left, the bullet whistling over
them, when to the astonishment of \Vest, Ingleborough
uttered a snarling yelp, followed by an excellent imi-
tation of a dog's bark.
" Do as I do!" he whispered, and the next moment

he had thrown himself upon his side and lay per-
fectly still.
"What follyl" West was disposed to say; but he
followed his companions example, letting himself sink
sidewise like a dying quadruped, feeling the despatch
crackle beneath him as he lay listening to the trampling
of horses growing more distant, and waiting for Ingle-
borough to speak.
. "Seems a stupid sort of dodgel" said the latter
at last; "but I thought it better to let them think we
were hyaenas than human beings."
"But we had a narrow escape of being shot!"
replied West.
"Yes, and escaped. If they had taken us for
human beings we should have been either shot or taken
prisoners. Now we're safel"
"Safe, with this bright moon shining ready to
show every movement?"
"Then why move until we are safe, lad? The
enemy will not come near us so long as they think we
are dead animals."
"But if they make out what we are—how then?"
"How then?" said Ingleborough, with a low sar-
castic laugh. "\Vhy, then they'll behave like Boers, and
come and see if there's anything worth taking in our
pockets. They are sweet people! But wait a bit. As
soon as they are farther off we'll continue our journey."
"Without our horses?"

"Yes; poor beasts! I'm sorry they're gone; but
daybreak will show us that we are close to Mafeking,
I feel sure. We'll crawl on as far as we can, and
then get up and run for our lives."
"Yes; but you know how clever they are at
bringing down a running buckl"
"Some of them!" said Ingleborough drily.
"Well, if I am brought down, don't hesitate a
moment: out with your knife, rip open my jacket, get
the despatch, and run on."
"Do you mean that?"
"Of course."
"What about you? Are you to be left wounded
here on the veldt?"
"Yes: until the despatch reaches the proper hands.
Then come and save me if you can."
"I understand," said Ingleborough drily. "That's
it matters come to the worst! Let's hope they will
not!"
He raised his head a little and had a good look
round as soon as he had ?nished speaking, for all was
now very still, and as far as he could make out in the
eerie light there was not a Boer within sight.
"Now then," he said softly; "let's go on! No,
no; not like that. Crawl, man, crawl."
He only spoke in time, for West was about to
spring up. Then their painful imitation of some quad-
ruped recommenced, West following his comrade

patiently and unquestioningly till a change seemed to
come over the light.
"Morning coming fast!" said West.
"The sooner the better," was the reply; "for I'm
not sure that we are going right."
"I'm sure we're going wrong," said West quickly.
"Why?"
"Because we are going straight for that great
wagon laager."
"Yes; there's Mafeking, with its corrugated-iron
roofs, off to our right."
"Hah!" ejaculated West, for at that moment there
was a ?ash from the front of the laager they were ap-
proaching, followed by a tremendous roar and a hissing
sound overhead, as a shell winged its way towards the
town, whose outskirts were certainly not more than a
couple of miles away.
"We've wasted ever so much strength," said Ingle-
borough; "but never mind: we know exactly Where we
are. It's about two miles' run to the nearest houses.
\Vhat do you say—go on crawling, or make a dash?"
"It will be broad daylight directly," replied West,
. "then we shall be discovered, and become the mark
for every ri?e within range. I say let's get up and
walk steadily on till we see that we are discovered,
and then run for our lives."
"Wait a moment! Do you know how we shall
?nd out that we are discovered?"

"Yes," said \Vest coolly; "we shall have the bullets
whistling about us."
"Well, you are cool!" said Ingleborough. "That's
it; and in addition we Shall have some of the mounted
Boers coming at full gallop."
"Perhaps," said West; "and perhaps the Mafeking
outposts will begin ?ring to cover us. Now then, I
feel breathless to begin, for it's rapidly getting lighter.
Come on!"
They rose quietly, and set off, making straight for
the nearest building—a long, low, broad place with a
corrugated-iron roof which seemed to be perfectly de-
serted; but it had one advantage—it was the nearest
Object to where they were, and it would, if they could
reach it, form cover from which they could ?re upon
any mounted Boer who came in pursuit.
Then with the day broadening rapidly they walked
steadily on, with Shell after shell arching over their
heads, to fall and burst far in advance, right away in
vthe town; but there was no Sign Of pursuit for quite
ten minutes, and not a friend anywhere visible in the
outskirts the fugitives approached. '
"Now then," shouted Ingleborough suddenly; "be
cool, and as you run unsling your ri?e and be ready
for a shot, for I'm going to ?ght to the last."
"Make for that shed?"
"Yes. Forward; here they come."
Away they went, for \Vest at his companion's

warning had looked sharply round, to see about a score
of mounted Boers dashing after them at full gallop,
and the fugitives had hardly got into the full swing
of their stride before they heard arack, crack, crack,
the reports of ri?es far in the rear, and ping, ping,
ping, the whistling buzz of the thin bullets, several of
which came unpleasantly near.
"Open out half-a-dozen yards," said Ingleborough
"and lessen their mark! Think we shall reach that
shed?"
"No," said \Vest coolly. "It's farther off than I
thought. Let's stop at that clump yonder, and lie be-
hind it to ?re back."
"Very well; but they'll ring round us and we shall
be taken in ?ank and rear."
"Not till we've brought down two of them,' said
\Vest, through his teeth.
"Two apiece," said Ingleborough. "Now then,
put on a spurt, and let's get to that heap, or they'll
be down upon us before we're half-way to the shed.
Run!"
They did run, with all their might; but out on the
open veldt distances are horribly deceiving, especially
in the early morning light, and to the despair of the
fugitives the Boers came rapidly nearer, while the
clump of earth for which they made seemed to be as
distant as ever. The only thing they made out was
that it became more diffused, and they plainly saw that

it was a long ridge of earth freshly thrown up, evi-
dently from a ditch beyond.
"Why, it's a long ri?e-pit," cried Ingleborough.
"Run, lad, run; we must do it now!"
But the pursuing Boers were coming on fast, and
the fugitives felt that in a minute or so they would
be overtaken.
There was something, though, in their favour, for
as the enemy converged upon them the ?ring from a
distance ceased, those who were using their ri?es fear-
ing to hit their own friends.
"It's of no use; we can't do it!" panted West, as
Ingleborough, now that there was no need to try and
diminish the mark at which the Boers ?red, closed in
again. >
"Not two hundred yards away now!" said Ingle-
borough hoarsely.
"Let's turn and have a couple of shots at them!"
cried West.
"No: we should be bound to miss. Run, run!"
It was not the distance but the pace that was
killing, and Ingleborough was right. To have stopped
and turned to ?re, with their pulses throbbing, breath
coming in a laboured way, every nerve and muscle on
the jump, must have resulted in missing; and the next
moment the enemy would have ridden over them and
they would have been either shot or prisoners.
Knowing this, they tore on till the ri?e-pit was

only a hundred yards away. The foremost Boers
spread out like a fan not ?fty yards distant, and came on
at full gallop, with the result appearing certain that
before the fugitives had torn on despairingly another
score of yards their enemies would be upon them.
"My despatch!" groaned West to himself, and
then aloud: "Halt! Fire!"
True to his comrade in those despairing moments,
Ingleborough obeyed the order, stopped short, swung
round, and following West's example, he was in the
act of raising his ri?e to his shoulder with his quiver-
ing hands, when-—
Crack, crack, crack, crark, crack, crack, half-a-dozen
?ashes and puffs of smoke came from over the ridge of
the low earthwork in front, emptying four saddles, while
one horse went down headlong, pierced from chest to
haunch by a bullet, and the ?eeing pair saw the rest of
their pursuers open out right and left, to swing round
and gallop away back, pursued by a crackling ?re
which brought down six more before they were out
of range.
Meanwhile twice over the big gun from its earth-
work far away sent a couple of shells right over the.
fugitives' heads on their way to the beleaguered town,
and a few seconds later a cheery English voice had
shouted: "Cease ?ring!" Then a dozen men came
hurrying out Of the ri?e-pit where they had lain low,
to surround the exhausted pair.

"Hands up!" shouted their leader loudly. "\Vho
are you—deserters?"
"Deserters!" cried West hoarsely, as he pressed
his left hand upon his breast and let his ri?e fall to
the ground. "Despatch—Kimberley—Water—for Hea-
ven's sake—help!"
He sank upon his knees, for everything seemed
to be swimming round him before he became quite
blind.
- But he could hear still as he swooned away, and
what he heard was a hearty British cheer.

CHAPTER XXX.
A'r 'rui: GOAL.
" T has more than paid for it all!" said West that
night, when they lay down to rest after a wildly-
exciting day. ,
"Yes," replied Ingleborough, laughing. "I- felt
quite jealous!"
"I don't believe you!" said West sharply. "You
couldn't; they all made as much fuss over you as they
did over me, from the chief downward!"
"Well, I suppose they did; but I began to have
the horrors once!"
"Horrors?" _
"Yes; knowing as I did that they must be short
of food, I began to think that they were welcoming
us so warmly because we were something good to eat,
and all the feasting was the beginning of fattening
us up."
"Of course you did!" said \Vest drily.
"I say though," continued Ingleborough; "if it is
not a state secret, what was it the chief said to you
when he took you aside?"


## p. 319 (#337) ############################################

AT THE GOAL. 319
"Oh, it's no secret from you!" replied West.
"Let's have it then!"
"\Vell, ?rst of all, it was a lot of ?attery."
" Fl'attery? "
"Yes, about being so brave, and bringing the
Kimberley despatch through the Boer lines."
"That was not ?attery. You did bring the des-
patch to its destination very bravely."
"So did you!" said West sharply.
"Oh, very well, so did I then! It was we if you
like! Being buttered is not an unpleasant sensation
when you can honestly believe that you deserve it;
and, without being vain, I suppose we can feel that
our consciences are at rest."
"Never mind that!" said West hurriedly. "I don't
like being buttered, as you call it. The chief said then
that he should have to send another despatch back to
Kimberley, and that he should ask us to take it."
"\Vhat a cracker!" cried Ingleborough.
"Cracker—lie? I declare he did!"
"I don't believe you."
"Very well!" said \Vest stif?y.
"No; it is not very well! Come now, he didn't
say anything about us. He said you. Confess: the
truth!"
West began to hesitate.
"He—well—perhaps not exactly in the words I
said."

"That will do, sirl" cried Ingleborough. "You
are convicted of cramming—of making up a ?ctitious
account of the interview. He did not allude to me."
"But he meant to include you, of course!"
"No, he did not, Noll; he meant you."
"I say he meant both of us. If he did not, I
shanT go!"
"What!"
"I shall not go a step out of the way without my
comradel"
"What!" cried Ingleborough, holding out his hand.
"Well, come, I like that, lad, if you mean it."
"If I mean it, Ingle!" said \Vest reproachfully.
"All right, old chap! You always were a trump!
There, we'll take the despatch back! And now no more
butter! We're very brave fellows, of course, and
there's an end of it. I say, I wonder how Anson is
getting on."
"The miserable renegadel" cried West. "I Should
like to see the scoundrel punished!"
"Well, have patience!" said Ingleborough, laugh-
ing. "It's a very laudable desire, which I live in hopes
of seeing grati?ed. But don't you think we might as
well go to Sleep and make up for all we have gone
through?"
"Yes, but who is to Sleep with all this terrible
bombarding going on?"
"I for one! " said Ingleborough. "I'm getting quite

used to it! But I say, Ican see a better way of mak-
ing a fortune than keeping in the diamond business."
"What is it?" said \Vest carelessly. He was
listening to the roar of the enemy's guns and the crash
of shells, for the Boers were keeping up their bom-
bardment right into the night.
"I mean to go into the gunpowder trade, and—
oh dear, how——"
West waited for the words that should have followed
a long-drawn yawn, but none came, for the simple
reason that Ingleborough was fast asleep.
Ten minutes later, in the face of his suggestions to
the contrary, and in spite of the steady regular discharge
of artillery, sending huge shells into the place, West
was just as fast asleep, and dreaming of Anson Sitting
gibbering at him as he played the part of a monkey
?lling his cheeks with nuts till the pouches were bulged
out as if he were suffering from a very bad attack of
mumps. The odd part of it was that when he took
out and tried to crack one of the nuts in his teeth he
could not, from the simple fact that they were diamonds.

CHAPTER XXXI.
BAD FOR ONE: GOOD FOR Two.
"IT'S a bad job—a very bad job," said West, with
a sigh, as he mounted one of the pair of very
excellent ponies that had been provided for the des-
. patch-riders by the gallant chief in command at Mafe-
king, With the laughing comment that the two brave
little animals ought to consider themselves very lucky
in being provided with two such masters, who would
take them right away from the beleaguered town,
where, if they stayed, their fate was bound to be that
they would be minced into sausages or boiled down
into soup.
They were two beautiful little beasts; but West
always sighed and said it was a bad job whenever he
mounted, for his heart was sore about the pony he had
lost before they entered Mafeking.
"I say, young fellow," said Ingleborough, with one
of his grim smiles: "how much longer are you going
to stay in mourning?"


## p. 323 (#341) ############################################

BAD FOR ONE: GOOD FOR TWO. 323
"Stay in mourning?" said West, staring, as he
bent forward to pat his mount's back.
"Yes: for those two ponies we lost; because it
seems to me very absurd! To begin with, it's down-
right folly to bemoan the loss of one pony when you
have been provided with another equally good; secondly,
it is more absurd to bemoan a pony at all; and thirdly,
it is the most absurd thing of all to be mourning for
one that in all probability is not dead."
"Oh, they're both dead enough by this time!" said
West bitterly. '
"Mine may be, for it was hit; but from the way
it reared up and kicked out it had no bones broken,
and these Basuto ponies are such hardy little beasts
that I daresay it got better; while yours was so good
that you may depend upon it some Boer has it nipped
tightly between his legs, and is making the most of it."
"I hope you are right!" said West. "And there,
I will not mourn for them, as you call it, any more,
but make the best of things. Let's see; this is the
sixth day out from Mafeking."
"Seventh," said Ingleborough correctively.
"Of course; so it is, but I lose count through
being so intent upon the one idea of getting back to
Kimberley. Do you think we shall manage to get
through the Boer lines?"
"Think? Why, we've got to get through them.
\Ve shouldn't be long if we could only ride straight

away, and not be always running right on to some fresh
party who begin to make game of us directly."
"That's rather an ambiguous way of speaking,
Ingle," said West, laughing, as he caressed his pony.
"If anybody else heard you he would think you meant
that the Boers bantered and chaffed us."
"But nobody else does hear us, and you think that
I mean that they begin to pump out bullets at us just
as if we were a pair of springboks. I say, I'm be-
ginning to think that we are leading a charmed life, for
it is wonderful what escapes we have had from their
long-carrying ri?es."
"I'm beginning to think in a much more matter-
of-fact way," replied West; "and I think this, that ?ve
hundred yards' range is quite long enough for any ri?e
used on active service. I know that when one takes
aim beyond that distance one is very doubtful of
hitting."
"I feel so after half that distance," replied Ingle-
borough, and then: "Hullo! See something?"
"Yes; I thought we were going to have a good
long ride in peace this morning, but look yonder!"
The two young men drew rein and leaped to the
ground, each hurriedly getting out his glass, for the
commandant at Mafeking had supplied them with fresh
ones, to steady it by resting it upon the saddle he had
just quitted, their well-trained ponies standing perfectly
I motionless.


## p. 325 (#343) ############################################

BAD FOR ONE: GOOD FOR TWO. 325
"What do you make of it?" said Ingleborough,
scanning a mistily-seen dark line right away beneath
the sun.
"Wagons trekking," replied West quietly.
"Friends?"
"Who can say? I think not. Reinforcements and
stores on the way to the besiegers, I should think."
"I'm afraid you are right! Well, we had better
let the nags feed while we lie down and watch, for I
don't think they have seen us yet."
"Very well," said West. "I'm tired of so much
running away!"
The next minute they were lying amongst some
stones and their ponies grazing, Ingleborough coolly
?lling his pipe and lighting it with a burning-glass, but
keeping a watchful eye upon the long train of wagons
and horsemen plodding along at the customary rate of
about two miles an hour, and ready at any moment
to spring upon his pony in case a party of the enemy
should make up their minds to try and drive in the
two ponies when they caught their eye.
This he knew was doubtful, for it was beginning
to be a common sight upon the veldt—that of a wounded
or worn-out horse or two picking up a scanty living
from the grass and green points of the shrubs, while
an investigation generally proved that the poor brutes
were not worth the trouble of the ride. 7
Still, on the other hand, the suspicious nature of

the Boers might prompt them to see whether riders
were near the grazing animals, and an opportunity for
capturing a prisoner or two be theirs.
The pair kept a keen look-out; but it seemed for
a long time that they were to be left in peace, the
long line of wagons and horsemen plodding steadily
onward, completely blocking the way the bearers of the
Kimberley despatch had to take.
At last, though, just after West had expressed his
opinion that the Boers were too intent upon getting
their heavy guns on towards Mafeking, Ingleborough,
unnoticed by his companion, made a sudden movement,
dropping his pipe and altering the small lenses of his
?eld-glass, through which he lay gazing, supporting
himself upon his elbows.
"Hah!" said \Vest, who was similarly occupied;
"they've got four heavy guns and a tremendous lot Of
stores. Wouldn't one of our generals give something
to have his men so arranged that he could cut them
Off in all directions! The country is so open, and not
a kopje in sight. What a prize those guns would be!"
"Yes," said Ingleborough sharply; "but there is
no British force at hand, so they are going to surround
us instead." '
"What!" cried \Vest excitedly.
"That they are, and no mistake!" continued Ingle-
borough, slewing himself round so as to look in a diffe-
rent direction.


## p. 327 (#345) ############################################

BAD FOR ONE: GOOD FOR TWO. 327
"You don't mean—oh, Ingle! Three strong bodies
coming from behind, north'and south. Why, we're
trapped!"
"We are, my lad; for here they come from the
front." I
\Vest turned his glass again in the direction of the
long line of wagons after his look round, to see that
a party of the Boers were riding out straight for them.
"Trapped; but we must dodge between the wires,
eh?" cried 'VVest, who, like his companion, had made
at once for where his pony was grazing. "Hah!
Look out, Inglel"
Ingleborough was looking out, but left helpless.
\Vest had caught his pony, but his companion had
startled the other by the suddenness of his approach,
and, throwing up its head, the little animal cantered
off with his rider after him.
"Stop, stop!" shouted West. "You only scare
the brute more."
"Right!" said Ingleborough sadly, and he stopped
short and began to return. "There!" he cried, as West
sprang into his saddle; "you have the despatch. Off
with you through that opening! I won't hinder you!
I'll turn prisoner again for a change."
"Lay hold of my pony's tail and run! I'll keep
him to a canter, and change with you as soon as
you're tired!" said West, scanning the opening between
the end of the Boer line and the party of horsemen

away to his left who were making straight for them,
lying towards the middle of the line, where the big
guns were being dragged along.
"No good!" said Ingleborough. "Off with you,
and save your despatchl"
"Can't leave you, old fellow! Do as I tell you!"
cried West. "Hook on!"
"I will not! They won't kill me if I throw up my
hands! Save your despatch if you can!"
"Obey orders, sirl" roared \Vest ?ercely, "and
don't waste time! I'm going to trot after your mount,
and he'll join us."
"Hah! Bravo, sharp brains!" cried Ingleborough
excitedly, and twisting the long thick hair of the pony's
tail about his left hand he ran lightly after his com-
panion, the pony West rode uttering a shrill neigh as
they went off, which made the other stop, cock up its
ears, answer, and come galloping after them, so eager
to join its fellow that it brushed close past Ingleborough,
who caught the rein without trouble.
"Right!" he shouted, and the next minute he was
in the saddle, with the ponies cantering along side by
side.
"More to the left!" cried West. "The Boers are
bearing away to cut us off!"
This was plain enough, and the fugitives saw that
if a fresh party started from the end of the long line
they were bound to be cut off.


## p. 329 (#347) ############################################

BAD FOR ONE: coon FOR TWO. 329
"Never mind," cried Ingleborough; "we may get
away! Those fellows are quite a mile from us, and
their mounts will be pumped out if they push forward
like that. Easy, easy! Let the ponies go their own
pace!"
Settling down into a canter, the fugitives now be-
gan to look away to their left, where they had seen
the other parties closing them in from their ?ank and
rear.
"Hallo! Where's the rest of the enemy?" cried
West.
"Yonder, out of sight! The ground lies lower
there; but I say, these fellows are coming on at a
tremendous rate! Gallop or they'll cut you off."
"Then we'll gallop!" cried West. "We, old fellow!
Just as if I were going to leave you behind!"
"Very nice of you," said Ingleborough merrily;
"but you're not ?t for a despatch-rider. You're about
the worst I ever knew of!"
"Because I won't forsake a friend?"
"Friend be hanged! There's no friendship in war-
time. Ah, here come some of the ?ankers."
"Yes, I see them," said \Vest; "but what does
this mean?"
For all at once the galloping party on their right
—that which had come straight from the centre of the
Boer line—began to pull up until all were halted in
the middle of the plain.

"They see their companions coming," said Ingle-
borough, "and that we are safely cut Off. Well, it is
giving uS a better chancel"
"But they're turning and folding back," cried \Vest
excitedly. "Here come the others, full gallop! Look,
look, how they're opening out! Gallop full speed now!
No, no. Look, look! Why, Ingle, those are not ri?es
they're carrying—they're lances."
"You're dreaming!" growled Ingleborough. "Never
mind what they're carrying; they're going to cut us off,
and we've got to save that despatch!"
"And we Shall save it too!" cried West, his voice
sounding full of exultation. "Those are our Lancers——
a regiment of them!"
"You're right!" cried Ingleborough excitedly now,
and he began to draw rein. "Look at the Boer line.
There's proof ! They're turning back from the front
and hurrying up their rear so as to form laager round
their big guns. Hurrah!" he yelled, rising in his stir-
rups to wave his hat.
"And hurrah a hundred times more!" yelled West,
following his companion's example, as he saw now in
no less than four directions little clouds of horsemen
moving over the widely-spreading plain.
The next minute they had their glasses out and
were watching the Boers—a line no longer, but broken
up into what at ?rst seemed to be wild confusion, out
of which order began to form, for whoever was in

command of the reinforcements on their way to Mafe-
king possessed enough Soldierly knowledge of what 'was
the best thing to be done under the circumstances. As
the wagons in front were wheeled round to retire upon
the centre formed by the four heavy guns, and those
from the rear were hurried up to join in making a
great square, cloud after cloud of mounted men galloped
forward to seize upon any patch of shelter to hold
against the advancing British force.
"It's well meant," said Ingleborough, without taking
his eyes from his glass; "but they will not have time
to form a strong laager. Why, our men will be among
them before a quarter of an hour is past."
"Before ten minutes!" cried \Vest, in wild excite-
ment. "Hurrah! Trapped this time! Look right across
the laager; there are men coming on there!"
It was so, and Ingleborough cheered wildly again.
For the British general must have had abundant infor-
mation of the coming convoy, and had taken his
precautions and made his plans so accurately as to
timing the advance that he had completely surrounded
the long line with cavalry and mounted infantry, who
now raced for the laager, heedless Of the ?re opened
upon them by the Boers. The enemy only ?red a
few shots, and then, ?nding themselves taken in front,
?ank, and rear, made for their horses and took ?ight
in every direction, but not before the Lancers got among
them and dotted the veldt with horse and man.


## p. 332 (#350) ############################################

332 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
The Boer commander and those with gun and
wagon worked well, bringing their heavy guns to bear
on the main advance; but they were not directed at
masses of men in column or line, but at a cloud of
cavalry covering the plain and mingled with the enemy's
own ?ying horse, so that before a second discharge could
be belched forth from the two large guns which were
re-loadcd, the Lancers, Hussars, and Volunteer Light
Horse were among the gunners, and it was every man
for himself, sazwe guz' pm.
West and Ingleborough were so intent with their
glasses, watching the utter rout of the Boers, that they
did not see a body of Lancers bearing down upon them
at a gallop, and the noise of the scattered ?ring kept
up by the Boers drowned the trampling of hoofs, till
there was a shout which made the two despatch-bearers
start round in their saddles, to see a dozen sun-browned,
dust-covered Lancers galloping at them with weapons
levelled, headed by a young of?cer waving them on
with his ?ashing sword.
"Up hands!" yelled Ingleborough, and glass and
hat were thrust on high.
It was only just in time, the of?cer raising his
sword as he reined up by West and caught his arm.
"Hallo!" he roared, as his men surrounded the
pair with lances at their breasts; "who are you?"
"Despatch-riders—Mafeking to Kimberley," cried
West.


## p. 333 (#351) ############################################

BAD FOR ONE: GOOD FOR TWO. 333
"Where are your despatches then?" cried the
of?cer sharply.
"Here!" cried West.
"Yah!" cried the young of?cer. "I thought I'd
caught two Boer generals directing the ?ght. What
a jolly sell!"
"You've got something better among you!" said
Ingleborough, joining in the laugh which rose among
the men.
"Have we? What?"
"There are four heavy guns yonder, and a tremen-
dous wagon train."
At that moment trumpet after trumpet rang out,
and the men burst into a wild cheer, for the mounted
Boers were scattering in all directions, ?ying for their
lives, and it was plain enough that a tremendous blow
had been in?icted upon a very strong force, the cap-
ture of the convoy being complete, and those in charge
who had not succeeded in reaching their horses readily
throwing down their arms.
"We'll, we've whipped!" said the young of?cer of
Lancers, taking off his helmet to wipe his streaming
face. "They can't ?nd fault with us at home for this,
my lads! Here, open out; we must join in driving
these ragged rascals back on the centre. Here, you
two," he cried, turning to West and his companion,
"I must take you both in to my chief, for I dOn't
know that I ought to take your bare word."

"Well, I don't think there's much of the Dopper
about either of us."
"No," said the of?cer, "but the Boers have got
the scum of Europe and America with them, and you
may be two little bits."
"Want our ri?es?" said \Vcst coolly.
"No; but don't try to bolt, either of you: it would
be dangerous. My boys are rather handy with the
lance!"
"Sol see!" said West, glancing at the points
glistening at the tops of the bamboo shafts, several of
which looked unpleasantly red.
"And so I felt," said Ingleborough grimly, "for
one of them pressed my ribs."

CHAPTER XXXII.
DOWN BY THE SPRUIT.
HE trumpets were ringing out again to call the
various parts of the force together, a couple of
regiments being sent in pursuit Of the only body Of the
defeated Boers which showed any cohesion, the greater
part of those who had reached their horses and escaped
doing this to a great extent singly, and the rest of that
day was passed in gathering in the wagons, disarming
the prisoners, and making all secure in the laager, which
was now formed about a spruit that offered an ample
supply of good fresh water.
The capture proved to be far greater than was at
?rst surmised, for in addition to the four heavy guns
with their wagons and special ammunition, scores of the
great lumbering Dutch wagons were full of ri?es and
cartridges. Besides these, there was an ample supply
of ordinary stores, and, in addition to the many spans
of oxen, hundreds of captured horses and several ?ocks
of sheep.
By night all was made secure in the great camp,

and the despatch-riders were made welcome at the mess
presided over by the cavalry General, who with his staff
eagerly listened to the adventurers' account of their
journey, and to their report of the state of beleaguered
Mafeking.
That night the pair Slept in peace in the well-guarded
camp after debating about their continuance of their
journey the next morning. '
But when morning came the General demurred to
letting them go.
"You must wait a day longer," he said, "until my
boys have done more to clear the way, for your road
must be full of revengeful Boers, the remains of the
force we defeated yesterday, and I am certain that
neither you nor your despatch would reach Kimberley
if I let you go!"
"\Ve are very anxious to be off, Sir," said West,
in a disappointed tone.
"And I am very anxious that the Kimberley people
should have your good news, my lad," said the general,
smiling, "and the news too of how we have taken the
guns and stores meant to be used against Mafeking;
but, as I have told you before, I don't want the news
you are to carry to be found somewhere on the veldt,
perhaps a year hence, along with some rags and two
brave young fellows' bones."
"Thank you, Sir," said West quietly; "but when do
you think we might continue our journey?"

"That depends on the reports I get in from the
men still away in pursuit."
The men in camp were in high glee, for they had
been struggling hard for weeks to get to conclusions
with the enemy, but without success, while now their
highest expectations had been more than ful?lled; but
there was plenty of sorrow to balance the joy, many
poor fellows having met their end, while the number
of injured in the hospital ambulances and tents made
up a heavy list.
West and Ingleborough saw much of this, and spent
no little time in trying to soften the pangs endured by
the brave lads who lay patiently bearing their unhappy
lot, suffering the agony of wounds, and many more the
miseries of disease.
There was trouble too with the prisoners, and
West and his companion were present when a desperate
attempt to escape was made by a party worked upon
by one of their leaders—a half-mad fanatical being
whose preachings had led many to believe that the
English conquerors were about to reduce the Boers to
a complete state of slavery.
The attempt failed, and the leader was one of those
who fell in the terrible encounter which ensued.
Both West and Ingleborough were witnesses of the
resulting ?ght, for the attempt was made in broad day-
light, just when such a venture was least expected, and,
after those who seized upon a couple of score of the

captured horses and tried to gallop off had been re-
captured, the young men worked hard in helping to
carry the wounded to the patch of wagons that formed
the ?eld hospital.
"Ugh!" said West, with a shudder, after he and
Ingleborough had deposited a terribly-injured Boer
before one of the regimental surgeons; "let's get down
to the spruit and wash some of this horror away."
"Yes," said Ingleborough, after a glance at his own
hands; "we couldn't look worse if we had been in the
?ght! Horrible 1"
"It's one thing to be in the wild excitement of a
battle, I suppose," said West; "but this business after
seems to turn my blood cold."
Ingleborough made no reply, and the pair had
enough to do afterwards in descending the well-wooded,
almost perpendicular bank to where the little river ran
bubbling and foaming along, clear and bright.
"Ha!" sighed West; "that's better! It was horrible,
though, to see those poor wretches shot down."
"Um!" murmured Ingleborough dubiously. "Not
very! They killed the sentries ?rst with their own
bayonetsl" -
"In a desperate struggle for freedom, though! But
there, I'm not going to try and defend them!"
"No, don't, please!" said Ingleborough. "I can't
get away from the fact that they began the war, that
the Free State had no excuse whatever, and that the

enemy have behaved in the most cruel and merciless
way to the people of the towns they have besieged."
"All right! I suppose you are right; but I can't
help feeling sorry for the beaten."
"Feel sorry for our own party then!" said Ingle-
borough, laughing. "Why, Noll, lad, we must not
holloa till we are out of the wood. This last is a pretty
bit of success; but so far we have been horribly beaten
all round."
"Yes, yes; don't talk about it," said \Vest sharply;
"but look over there. We needn't have been at the
trouble of scrambling down this almost perpendicular
place, for there must be a much easier spot where
that fellow is walking up."
"Never mind; we'll ?nd that slope next time, for
we shall have to come down again if we want a wash."
They sat down chatting together about the beauti-
fully peaceful look of the stream, while Ingleborough
lit his pipe and began to smoke.
"It does seem a pity," said Ingleborough thought-
fully, exhaling a cloud of smoke: "this gully looks as
calm and peaceful as a stream on old Dartmoor at
home. My word! I wish I had a rod, a line, and
some ?ies! There must be ?sh here. Ishould like to
throw in that pool and forget all about despatch-bearing
and guns and ri?es and men using lances. It would_
be a treat!"
"It looks deep and black too in there," said West.

"Yes, a good day's ?shing in such a peaceful—Ugh!
Come away. Let's get back tO the camp."
"\Vhy? What's the matter?" cried Ingleborough,
starting up, in the full expectation Of seeing a party of
the enemy making their way down the farther bank to
get a shot at them.
But West was only pointing with averted head
down at the deep black pool, and Ingleborough's face
contracted as his eyes took in all that had excited
\Vest's horror and disgust.
For there, slowly sailing round and round just
beneath the surface, were the white faces of some half-
dozen Boers, wounded to the death or drowned in their
efforts to escape the British cavalry, and washed down
from higher up by the swift stream, to go on gliding
round and round the pool till a sudden rising of the
waters from some Storm should give the stream suf?-
cient power to sweep them out.

"LET'S see; this will take us round by the hospital
wagons," said Ingleborough. "I vote we go
round the other way, for we don't want any more
horrors now!"
They chose a different direction to return to their
temporary quarters in the camp, one which took them
round by the row upon row of captured wagons and
the roughly-made enclosure into which the prisoners
had now been herded, and where they were doubly
guarded by a strong party of mounted infantry, who
had stringent orders to ?re at the slightest sign of trying
to escape.
"They'll accept their lot now, I expect," said Ingle-
borough. "Who are these with this next lot of wagons?
Non-combatants, I suppose I"
"Yes; drivers of the provision wagons and traders,"
replied West. "Why, that's the man we saw going up
out of the spruit."


## p. 342 (#360) ############################################

342 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Yes," said Ingleborough, and as he spoke \Vest
noted that the man who had been seated at the front
of one of the wagons suddenly turned his back and
walked round to the other side.
West turned to Ingleborough.
Ingleborough turned to West.
They stood looking enquiringly in each other's
eyes for a few moments before the latter said suddenly:
"Which way will you go?"
"Left," said Ingleborough.
"And I'll go right."
They started at once, walking towards the wagon
that had taken their attention, Ingleborough making for
the front where the man had disappeared, and which
necessitated passing the team of bullocks crouching
down to ruminate over the fodder that had been cut
for them, while \Vest hurried round by the rear, the
young men timing themselves so exactly that they met
after seeing a pair of stout legs disappear between the
fore and hind wheels of the wagon where the man they
sought to face had dived under.
Quick as thought, West and Ingleborough separated
and ran back lightly and quickly, this time to come
upon the man they sought just as he was getting heavily
upon his legs again, evidently in the belief that he had
not been recognised.
He was thoroughly roused up to his position,
though, by Ingleborough's heavy hand coming down

upon his shoulder and hoisting him round to face the
pair.
"Hallo, Anson!" cried Ingleborough banteringly;
"this is a pleasant surprise!" while West's eyes ?ashed
as he literally glared in the cowardly scoundrel's face,
which underwent a curious change as he glanced from
one to the other, his fat heavy features lending them-
selves to the dissimulation, as he growled out slowly:
"Don't understand."
"What!" cried Ingleborough, in the same bantering
tone; "don't you know this gentleman—Mr. Oliver
West?"
"Don't understand!" was the reply, and directly
after: "Good night, Englishmen; I'm going to sleep !"
The next moment the heavy-looking fellow had
turned his back again, stepped to the front part of the
wagon, and sprawled over part of the woodwork as he
tried to draw himself on to the chest before getting
inside.
But Ingleborough was a strong man, and he proved
it, for, stepping behind the man, he caught him by the
collar of his jacket and the loose part of his knicker-
bocker-like breeches, and dragged him off the wagon,
to plant him down in front of West.
The result was that their prisoner began to rage
out abusive words in Dutch, so loudly that in the exas-
peration he felt, Ingleborough raised his right foot and
delivered four kicks with appalling vigour and rapidity

—-appalling to the receiver, who uttered a series or
yells for help in sound honest English, struggling the
while to escape, but with his progress barred by West,
who closed up and seized him by the arm.
The outcry had its effect, for the called-for help
arrived, in the shape of a sergeant and half-a-dozen men,
who came up at the double with ?xed bayonets.
"\Vhat's all this?" cried the sergeant sharply, as
he surrounded the party.
"Only a miracle!" cried Ingleborough. "This so-
called Boer, who could not speak a word of English,
has found his tongue."
"What are you, prisoner—a Boer?" cried the
sergeant.
"Ah, yah, yah," was the reply, gutturally given;
"Piet Retif, Boer."
"Well, sir, orders are that the Boer prisoners are
not to be ill-used," said the sergeant. Then, turning to
the prisoner: "This your wagon and span?"
"Ah, yah, yah, Piet Retif."
"He says Yah, yah, sir," said the sergeant, "which
means it is his wagon."
"Oh yes, it is his, I believe," said Ingleborough.
"Then what have you against him?"
"Only that he's a renegade Englishman, a man who
deserted from Kimberley to the Boers."
"It's a lie, sergeant," cried the man excitedly.
"That's good English," cried Ingleborough. "I

told you I had worked a miracle; now perhaps I can
make him say a little more. He's an illicit-diamond
merchant and cheat as well, and his name is not Piet
Retif, but james Anson, late clerk to the Kimberley
Company. What do you say, West?"
"The same aS you," replied \Vest.
"It is a lie!" cried the man. "Piet Retif, dealer
in mealies and corn."
"MealieS and corn!" cried Ingleborough scornfully.
"The man is what I say: an utter scoundrel, cheat,
and, worse than all, a renegade and deserter to the
Boers."
Anson's jaw dropped, and his face seemed to turn
from a warm pink to green.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
ANOTHER START.
EFORE Anson's jaw had time to return to its place
the sergeant and his men sprang up to attention,
looking as stiff as if on parade.
West was the ?rst to see the reason, and he nudged
Ingleborough, just as a stern voice asked what was
wrong.
"Bit of a row, sir, between the two despatch-riders
and this prisoner, sir," replied the sergeant. "Prisoner
charges these two gentlemen with assaulting him. Says
he's a Boer!"
The new-comer, who had four of?cers in atten-
dance upon him during what was apparently a tour of
inspection of the camp, turned sharply on the two
friends.
"I cannot have the prisoners ill-treated," he said.
"Why is this?" _
"Because he is not a Boer, sir,' said Ingleborough
sharply. "This man was in the company's of?ce with
us at Kimberley. He is little better than a thief, or

worse, for he is a receiver of stolen goods, an English-
man, an illicit buyer of diamonds, and a renegade who
gave information to and deserted to the Boers."
"That will do," said the General. "Half of your
charges would condemn him. Sergeant, see that this
prisoner is carefully guarded. He will be tried later
on. I am too busy to attend to such matters now."
Anson gave vent to a gasp, after listening to the
general's orders for his safe custody.
But, though he was listening to the orders given,
his eyes were otherwise employed. They were half
closed, but ?xed intently upon West, and they did not
quit his face till the sergeant clapped him on the
shoulder, saying: "Now, Mr. Piet Retif, this way!"
Then he started violently, and was marched off
to be placed with certain of the prisoners who were
the most carefully guarded.
"Did you notice anything in particular just before
Anson was led off?" said Ingleborough.
"No. Poor wretch. I'm sorry for him!"
"Keep your sorrow for a more worthy object, my
lad, and mind and give that fellow a wide berth if ever
he gets his liberty again."
"Which he will, of course."
"Well, perhaps so, for the Company can't give the
diamond-buyer all they would like! But when he does
get free, you be careful!"
"Why, what harm can he do me?"


## p. 348 (#366) ############################################

348 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Can't say," said Ingleborough abruptly; "but
something or another ill you may take it for granted
he will do. I've been watching his face, and read
what it means! Of course, he doesn't like me, for I've
been ?ghting against him all along; but somehow he
seems to hate you, and, mark my words, he'll try his
best to do you a mischief! He gives you the credit of
being the cause of all this trouble!"
"But I've not been!" said \Vest.
"No; I've done the scoundrel ten times the mischief
that you have, for I disliked him from the very ?rst
day we met. He was too oily for me, and I always
thought that he would turn out a bad one. I'm the
culprit, but he means to let me alone and to take all
the change out of you! That's all—only don't give him
a chance!"
"Not I; but we shall not see much more of him,
I suppose."
"What? There'll be a trial in a day or two, and
I've got a pill for my gentleman."
"What do you mean—not a lead pill?"
"Tchah! Nonsense. I mean to ask for the scoun'
drel's wagon to be searched. I was afraid they would
let him go back to it."
"The wagon? Of course," said \Vest thoughtfully.
"I had forgotten that."
The young men's eyes met as if they were trying
to read each other's thoughts; but no more was said

then, and the next morning \Vest and Ingleborouin
were summoned to the General's wagon.
"Good morning," said the of?cer sharply. "Your
despatches are, of course, very important, and it is urgent
that they should be delivered at once?"
said West eagerly. "Then we may
17
"Yes, sir,
go on at once?"
The General smiled.
"No," he replied; "all through the night scouts
and natives have been coming in, and in general from
different sources one has a great variety of news; but
in this case, coming from parts widely asunder, I get
the same announcement. Stung by the defeat I have
given them and the loss of their convoy and big guns,
they have been collecting in great force, evidently to
try and surround me in turn and recover all they have
lost."
"Then we had better make a dash for it at once,
sir, before the way is completely closed," said West.
"The way is completely closed, young man," said
the General gravely. "East, west, north, and south,
there are strong commandos with guns, and there is
only one way open for you."
"And that is ?" said West excitedly, for the General
had stopped.
"By going nearly due west, and cutting your way
through."
"Cutting our way through!" said West blankly,

350 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
and he turned to look at Ingleborough for an expla-
nation, but the latter only shrugged his shoulders.
"Ah, you are both puzzled!" said the General,
smiling. "You want to know how you are to cut your
way through! I'll tell you: by keeping with me and
letting my fellows clear the road for you!"
"But--—" began West.
"There is no 'but' in the matter, sir,
11
said the
General. "You are both willing messengers; but you
cannOt do impossibilities. If you go on in your own
way you will be either shot down or captured, and in
either case your despatches will fall into the enemy's
hands."
-" Unless I destroyed them ?rst!" said West bitterly.
"'Of course. That is what you would try to do,
my lad, if you had time. But as you would naturally
defer that till the last extremity, the probabilities are
that this necessary task would be left undone. Ri?e-
bullets ?y very swiftly, and the Boers' traps are cleverly
set, as our people are ?nding to their cost."
"But the despatches must be delivered, sir," said
West excitedly, "audit is my duty to go on at any
risk!"
"And mine to do two things, young gentleman,"
said the General, speaking very sternly. "One is, to
assist you in the task you have in hand; the other, as
I ?nd that Kimberley iS being hard pressed, to try and
cut my way through to the help of the brave people

who are holding it against great odds. Now, as the
two objects work together, your way must be with us.
I may not be able to force my way through, but I can
certainly see you well on your way."
"Then we are to stop with your cavalry brigade,
sir?" said West, in disappointed tones.
"Certainly, as long as I am making a forward
movement, which will commence at once. If I ?nd it
necessary to diverge from the course laid down, on
account of the extent of the convoy I have captured
and the number of prisoners, I shall give you fair
warning, so that you may make a dash for yourselves.
There, gentlemen, I am busy. You will attach your-
selves to my staff, and help keep a watch over the
loot in diamonds."
Taking this to be a dismissal, the two young men
retired to talk the matter over in their own quarters.
"I don't like it!" said West excitedly. "We have
our orders as to what we are to do about the des-
patch! Ought we to let a cavalry general override
those instructions?"
"I suppose so," replied Ingleborough. "Perhaps,
after all, he is right."
"Right?"
"Well, he knows from good information the state
of the country, and we do not. It would be better for
your despatch never to be delivered than for it to fall
into the enemy's hands."


## p. 352 (#370) ############################################

352 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Of course!"
"Then why not take matters as you ?nd them?
Are we not going to take news for our General over
yonder, and reinforcements as well?"
"Yes, I hope so," replied West; "but one does
not like when one's plans are made to have them inter-
fered with."
"Of course not," said Ingleborough, laughing; "but
we started with ?xed plans from Kimberley, and we've
been interfered with and baf?ed ever since."
"But we did get the despatch to Mafeking!"
"Yes, even when it seemed quite hopeless; and
we're going to get the answer back to Kimberley yet."
"I hope so," said \Vest gloomily.
"Bah! \Vhat a grumbler you are, Noll! Nothing
seems to satisfy you! Haven't we turned the tables
completely upon that fat pink innocent?"
\Vest nodded his head.
"Isn't he prisoner instead of us?"
"Yes, that's true!"
"And hasn't he proved your innocence and his
own guilt before those of?cers?"
"Yes, he has done that!" said \Vest, with his
puckered face smoothing out.
"Then just confess that you are a growling, dis<
contented, hard-to-satisfy young humbug."
"I do--frankly!" cried West, laughing outright.
"Come, that's something; and I begin to think


## p. 353 (#371) ############################################

that I will forgive you and stick to you after all, instead
of following out my own ideas."
"Your own ideas?" said West, looking at his com-
panion enquiringly. "What were those?"
"\Vell," said Ingleborough, in his dry stolid manner;
"Shakespeare was a very able man."
"My dear Ingle," cried West, staring, "whatever
has Shakespeare got to do with your plans?"
"Everything, you young ignoramus. Doesn't he
say something about there being a tide in the affairs
of men which, taken at the ?ood, will lead to fortune?"
"I believe so; but I wish he could point out the
tide that would take our live barque safe into Kimberley."
"Ah, but you see he does not; his works were
written for people living in a wet country where there
are plenty of rivers and seas. He didn't know any-
thing about the veldt, and, in fact, he was not very
strong in his geography, or he wouldn't have written
about the sea coast of Bohemia."
"There," cried West, "you're getting into one of
your long-winded arguments, and I'm waiting to hear
your plans!"
"Oh, they are only these!" said Ingleborough very
gravely. "Being a poor man and seeing the tide at
its height, I thought to myself that there could be no
harm in annexing a rogue's plunder when it is as plain
as the nose on one's face that we have as good a right
to it as all the Of?cers and Tommy Atkinses of this

brigade. I came to the conclusion that I'd get you
to stand in with me on fair halves principle, and go
off with the diamonds in that barrel, calling at Kimberley
as we go to leave that despatch, and then going on to
the Cape, and then home."
"No, you did not, Ingle," said West quietly; "so
don't talk bosh! Look, they're striking tents, inspanning,
and getting off."
"By George! so they are. And hallo! what does
this mean—an attack?"
"A battery of Horse Artillery guns," cried West.
"Then we are going on in real earnest."
"Yes," said Ingleborough, "and so our friends the
Boers will ?nd."

CHAPTER XXXV.
THE NET AND THE FISH.
HE start was made more quickly than either West
or Ingleborough had anticipated; in fact, the cele-
rity was wonderful considering that the cavalry brigade
was burdened with the great convoy of wagons captured
from the Boers. I
But there was a keen soldier in command, and
one who knew how to be ready for every emergency
likely to occur in an enemy's country.
As the two despatch-riders mounted their ponies,
the cavalry regiments were in motion, some taking up
ground in advance and on the ?anks, while two more, a
Lancer and a Dragoon regiment, stood fast ready for
action as rear-guard, giving the six-gun battery an 4
opportunity to Off-saddle and rest their horses, fresh
from a twelve-mile march that morning.
The wagon lines were in perfect order, steadily
moving off after two of the big newly-captured guns,
freshly manned by picked crews, the other two being
reserved for the centre of the train and taking up their
23*

position easily enough, drawn as they were by double
teams of sturdy ponies which made them far more
mobile than would have been the case if trusted to the
slow-moving oxen.
"They won't attempt to use those guns if we are
attacked," said \Vest, as he watched the preparations
going on; "our men will be quite ignorant of how to
work them."
"Our men will try if the necessity comes," said
Ingleborough con?dently; "and that's half the battlel"
"Yes," said West; "but it's hardly likely that the
enemy will attack so well-armed a body of men."
"They will, though, and do us no end of mischief
if they get the chance."
But the General for the ?rst three days gave the
enemy no chance, for he carefully avoided kopjes and
broken ground, keeping out a cloud of mounted men
scouting in every direction, and camping each night on
the banks of some spruit.
In fact, every military precaution was taken on
defensive principles, for the captured convoy was too
valuable for any risks to be run by attacking one or
other of the commandos trying to hem in the brigade.
It was soon found that the Boers were in motion
in front, rear, and on both ?anks, awaiting an oppor-
tunity to swoop down and stampede sheep, cattle, and
horses, spread confusion amongst the men, and so
open up a chance to re-capture the guns and stores.


## p. 357 (#375) ############################################

THE NET AND THE FISH. 357
But no chances were given, for everything had
been arranged, and during seven days' march \Nest had
a ?ne experience in the manoeuvring of a cavalry
brigade. So, in fact, had the enemy, but theirs was
at a bitter cost.
Finding that the British force would not attack
any of the natural strongholds nor step into any of the
traps contrived at river crossings where the perpendicular
banks were ?lled with trench, pit, and shelter, but that
the carefully-guarded convoy went on slowly towards
safety day after day, the enemy became more daring,
changed their tactics, and gathered together for attacks,
getting their guns into action ready for their own cap-
tured artillery to be halted, and with a few we!!-
directed shots at a tremendously long range to put the
carefully planted guns out of action and compel a rapid
retreat.
If they surrounded the convoy in their thousands
with knots of mounted ri?emen, there was a rush, a
?ying cloud of dust kicked up, and away went half
the Horse Artillery battery to one knoll, the other half
to another, and before the intention of the General
could be grasped the shells were falling fast among
those knots, bursting and untying them in an appalling
way which littered the dry earth with dead horses and
men; while, whenever a bolder dash than usual was
made to capture either of the half-batteries, the Boers
found that, mobile as they were, the British cavalry

could nearly double them in swiftness of evolution, and
Lancers and Hussars cut them up and sent them ?ying
in every direction.
Day after day this went on, with the result that the
reinforcements the enemy received were pretty well
balanced by the constant dribbling away of ambulance
wagons loaded with wounded men.
"Isn't it splendid?" Ingleborough kept on saying.
"Why, we could go on journeying like this for months.
I like this defensive game! Chess is nothing to it!"
"So do the Boers like a defensive gamel"
"Yes," said Ingleborough, laughing. "Did you
hear what one of the Boers taken said to the of?cer
in command of the prisoners' guard?"
"No. I did not catch it; but I saw our men laugh-
ing. What was it?"
"He said our of?cers did not ?ght fair, and when
our man asked him what he considered was fair
?ghting, the scoundrel gave him to understand that we
ought to attack them when they were well entrenched
in a kopje ready to shoot all our men down."
"\Vell," said West, "what did our of?cer say?"
"Laughed at him, and told him that if they were
so very anxious to ?re at targets we would arrange
butts for them with a series of mantlets and a good
supply of the Bisley Running Deer. But that wasn't
the best of it," said Ingleborough, laughing; "what do
you think the fellow said?"

"I don't know," said West, who was watching the
evolutions of a couple of the Light Horse Volunteer
regiments and as many of the Lancers, for, tired of
the plodding life of keeping with the tremendous baggage
train for a whole week, the two friends had ridden out
in advance over a wide open series of rolling downs
covered with dry scrubby growth, parched t0 grayness
by the torrid sun.
Ingleborough laughed heartily for a few moments.
"There they go," he said, pointing to the leading
troop of the Hussar regiment as- it disappeared over a
ridge about a mile in advance. "Let's make for that
wave-like place."
"Very well," said West; "I suppose we shall be
safe there!" '
"Safe enough, of course, for our men have swept
it clear! Forward! How the ponies enjoy a gallop!
But I didn't tell you what the miserable ruf?an said."
"No," cried \Vest, enjoying the motion as much
as the ponies. "This is delightful after all that slow
walking; but we had better turn back when we have
seen what those fellows are about! Now, what did the
Boer say?"
"Said he had always heard we were cowards at
Majuba; now he knew for himself."
"The insolent hound!" cried West. "What did
our of?cer say?"
"That it was lucky for the Boer that he was a

prisoner, for if he had been free he would have tasted
a ?ogging from the ?at of a sabre. But hullo! where
are our men?" cried Ingleborough, as they reached the
crown of the low ridge and looked down at a strip of
open veldt, beyond which was another ridge.
"Gone over there!" said \Vest quietly. "They
must have galloped!"
"Shall we follow, and come back with them?" said
Ingleborough.
"\Ve may as well," was the reply; "they must be
_trying to cut Off some of the Boers."
"Or going in for a charge to scatter them, for we
want no more prisoners. Come on, then; Ishould like
to see the charge!"
.The ponies seemed to Share their desire, for, an-
swering a slight pressure on their ?anks, they spread
out and went down the slight Slope like greyhounds,
avoiding as if by instinct the holes and stones with which
the veldt was dotted away in front.
"Steady, steady!" cried West. "We don't want tO
overdo it!" '
"Of course not," shouted Ingleborough; "but my
word, what delicious air, and what a place for a gallop!
I should like to see a herd of antelope appear on that
ridge to the left. I should be obliged to go after them;
we might get one for the Of?cers' mess."
"There they are, then!" cried West.
" \Vhere ? " said Ingleborough.

"Coming over that continuation of the ridge a mile
away to the left. No: mounted men! Ingle, old chap,"
cried West excitedly, "they're the party our men have
cut off! They've headed them, and they're trying to
escape by this opening!"
"By jingo! No!" cried Ingleborough. "Our men
have gone off to the right, I believe, and those Boers
have seen us. Noll, old fellow, we've come a bit too
far. Steady! Right turn! Now off and away, or some-
body else will be cut off or shot; perhaps both of us,
for we're in for it once more."
"Oh no," said West coolly; "be steady, and we'll
show the Boers how English fellows ride!"
"Yes, but hang it all! It's showing the beggars
how we ride away." '
"Never mind; we must ride for the convoy.'7
"But we can't," cried Ingleborough savagely;
"there's another party cutting us off."
"Forward then over the ridge in front! Our fellows
must have gone over there." 4
"No, I don't think they did."
"Then we will," cried West excitedly; "that must
be south and west. Forward for Kimberley; it can't be
far now; and let's deliver the despatch."
"Hold hard! Look before you leap!" shouted
Ingleborough ; and, rising in his stirrups, he gave a hasty
glance round, to see Boers here, Boers there, in parties
of from six to a dozen, spreading out as they came

362 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
along at a gallop, forming more and more of a circle,
till there was an opening only in one direction—to the
south-West—and after grasping this fully he turned to
\Vest as he settled himself in his saddle.
"Why, Noll, lad," he cried, "it's like the drawing
of a seine-net in Cornwall, with us for the shoal of
mackerel. They've got it nearly round us, and if we
don't start, in another ten minutes we shall be enclosed.
It looks ?shy, and no mistake!"
"Then come on!" cried \Nest.
"Off with you, but at a gentle gallop. \Ve must
nurse our nags, for the obstinate brutes will make it a
long chase."
As he spoke he pressed his pony's sides, and away
they went together at a long easy gallop, their mounts keep-
ing so close together that the riders' legs nearly touched,
and the brave little animals taking stride for stride and
needing no guidance, the best management being to
give them their heads and perfect freedom to avoid all
the obstacles which came in their way in the shape of
rock, bush, and the perilous holes burrowed in the soil
by the South African representatives of our rabbits.
Once settled down in their saddles, with the opening
in the Boer net straight before them, the fugitives had
no dif?culty in carrying on a conversation, and this
ensued in the calmest matter-of-fact way concerning the
predicament in which they had landed themselves.
"It's very awkward, Noll!" said Ingleborough.


## p. 363 (#381) ############################################

THE NET AND THE FISH. 363
"But, to use your favourite argument, it seems all
for the best," replied \Vest. "\Ve can easily reach the
open ground yonder before the enemy, and then ride
right away."
"If," said Ingleborough.
"If they don't stop when they ?nd us likely to go
through the horns of tile dilemma they have prepared
for us."
"And lie down and begin shooting?"
"Exactly! Their bullets will go faster than our
poniesl"
"Yes, but we shall put them at full speed, and
they will ?nd it hard to hit us at a gallop."
"I hope so 1" said Ingleborough. "My word! How
they are coming on!"
"Yes; but they will not get within ?ve hundred
yards of us!" cried West excitedly.
And so it proved, for as the horns of the partly-
?nished circle drew nearer, that nearness proved to be
nearly a thousand yards from point to point, while
half-way between, and with their ponies racing over the
ground stretched out like greyhounds, the two despatch-
riders dashed through, forcing the enemy to alter their
course as they were left behind.
"That's done it!" cried West joyously. "Now then
for Kimberley; it can't be very far away!"
"Sit close!" cried Ingleborough. "They'll ?re now
if they can do so without hitting their friends."


## p. 364 (#382) ############################################

364 A DASII FROM DIAMOND CITY.
\Vest glanced back to his right, and saw the truth
of his companion's words, for the next minute the ?ring
was commenced on both sides, the bullets coming over
their heads with their peculiar buzzing sound, and the
dusty soil being struck up here and there as the fugitives
tore along.
"This will put their shooting to the test!" cried
\Vest, leaning forward to pat his pony's neck.
"Yes; it will puzzle the best of them!" replied
Ingleborough. "I'm not afraid of their marksmen, but
I am of the ?ukes. However, we're in for it! Easy
now! \Ve're getting more and more ahead as they
close in. There, those behind are obliged to leave ofr
?ring for fear of hitting their friends."
Ingleborough was right, for after another useless
shot or two the ?ring ceased, and it became a chase
where success, barring accidents, would rest with the
best and freshest horses.
Knowing this, the fugitives eased their ponies all
they could after placing a greater distance between them .
and their pursuers, but keeping a good look~out ahead
and to right and left, knowing full well as they did that
the appearance of fresh Boers ahead would be fatal to
their progress.
Half an hour glided by, during which ?rst one and
then the other glanced back, but always with the same
result of seeing that some two or three dozen of the
enemy were settled down to a steady pursuit.

"How long do you think they will keep this up?"'
said West at last.
"Well, if they are French mercenaries they'll give
up directly; if they are Germans they'll stick to our
heels for hours; but if they're all Free Staters or
Transvaal Boers they'll go on till they drop or we do.
The stubborn, obstinate mules never know when they
are beaten!"
"Then they're not French adventurers!" said West.
"Nor yet Germans!" said Ingleborough. "No;
we've got the genuine Boer after us; and it's going
to be a long chase."
"How far do you think it is to Kimberley?"
"just as far as it is from Kimberley to here!"
replied Ingleborough gruf?y.
"Thank you for nothing!" snapped out West.
"What's the good Of giving foolish answers?"
"What's the good of asking foolish questions?
Look here, lad, we may as well look the position in
the face."
"Of course."
"Very well, then; we've got a score and a half
or So of Boers after us, meaning to take us prisoners
or shoot us down."
"Oh yes, that's plain enough!"
"Very well! Then as to distance to Kimberley,
the General has dodged in and out so to avoid the
enemy that, though I know a little about the country,

I'm regularly puzzled as to where we are. I think it
lies out here, but whether Kimberley is ?ve miles away
or a hundred I don't know. \Nhat I do know is that
the surest way of getting there is to make right away
west for the railway. Once we can hit that——-'
"Yes, I see, and if we keep it on our right, riding
south, we shall get there."
"That's correct, my lad, but recollect this: we left
the town invested, and you may depend upon it that
I
the enemy are round it in greater strength than ever,
so that how we are to get through their lines when we
reach them I don't know."
"Neither do I!" said West. "But we did not know
how we were to get into Mafeking! Still we did it,
and we're going to do this somehow."
"Ah, somehow!"
"Look here," said West, after another glance back
at their pursuers: "do you think you could put matters
in a blacker light if you were to try?"
"To be frank, old fellow," said Ingleborough, laugh-
ing, "I really don't think I could!"
"No more do I!" -
"But look here: it's as well always to look the
blackest side full in the face. Then you know the
worst at once, and can act accordingly. Hooray! One
to us!" shouted Ingleborough, glancing back.
"What is it? I see one of the enemy broken down
and another pulled up to help him. It's two to us."

"There, you see now the good of looking at the
worst of it."
"It's quite cheering!" cried West.
"Not very,' for the rest are making a spurt."
"Let them!" said West. "Our ponies are full of
go. We will not push them unless absolutely obliged."
"Words of wisdom! A long, steady pace wins.
Keep on; we can afford to lose a little ground, for we
have been gaining for some time!"

CHAPTER XXXVI.
CLOSE PURSUIT.
OUR after hour passed, and the chase continued
over the wide rolling veldt, the fugitives making
their course more and more westerly so as to hit the
railway, hoping every time they reached the top of one
of the wave-like ridges to ?nd that they were close
at hand.
But it was always the same—veldt, veldt, veldt,
stretching on towards the horizon, with a village or
farm once in a way, and the enemy always at the
same distance behind, keeping doggedly on.
Twice over, though, the fugitives had scraps of
encouragement from one of their pursuers pulling up,
and in each case another drew rein and stopped with
him.
4 At last a spruit was reached, with the fresh
bubbling water tempting the escaping pair to alight in
a way only to be understood by one who has been
similarly situated.
It was just after the Boers had pulled up to let

CLOSE PURSUIT. 369
their horses walk after a long ascent, and they were
still going on at the same pace, when West checked
his pony.
"It's of no use; we must drink," he said. "Dis-
mount, unsling your ri?e, and get behind that stone
and try and hold the enemy in check while I water the
horses and ?ll the bottles."
Ingleborough said nothing, only obeyed, and the
next minute West was leading the ponies down to the
shallow crossing, leaving his companion with his ri?e-
barrel resting upon the big stone that formed a natural
breastwork.
Seeing that the pair had stopped, the Boers began
to press forward, even after Ingleborough had ?red
twice; but the next shot made them pull up short,
open out, and take up position, beginning to return
the ?re then.
A few minutes later the horses had had a good
drink, the bottles were re-?lled, and all was ready on
the far side Of the spruit for continuing the ?ight.
West shouted to his companion, who placed a
block of stone about the size of his head upon the
natural breastwork and ?red twice, dropping down
directly after and wading to the side Of the gully,
where he threw himself upon his breast, drank deeply,
and then waded across to rejoin his companion. Then
they were off again at a canter, getting a good quarter
of a mile on their road before the Boers discovered by
24

a careful ?anking approach that they had given up
their defence of the spruit and dashed on.
"They'll be after us now at full speed!" said
West, as he stood up in his stirrups gazing back.
"No," said Ingleborough; "they'll stop there, I
daresay, for an hour to give their horses water and
rest, thinking that they can lull us into the belief that
they have given up the pursuit; and then they'll come
on again, following us steadily so as to trap us as soon
as it is dusk."
"I don't think you are right," said West; "but it
is of no use to argue about it. We shall see!"
The day wore on and they saw nothing but the
wide-spreading brown veldt, with no Sign of the great
river, no mountain ridge or other Object familiar to
Ingleborough during his travels through the country.
"No," he said, in reply to a question from West,
"I can't make out anything, only that we are going
south-west. The country is so big, you see. All I can
say is that we must be going right. We're making
for the river, and we can't do better. It may be many,
many miles away still!"
"Well, let's keep on. There's one comfort: the
enemy don't seem to be after us."
"No," said Ingleborough, after a good look back,
and speaking very drily; "they don't seem to be, but
I don't trust them. They mean to run us down; but
we'll give them their work ?rst."


## p. 371 (#389) ############################################

CLOSE PURSUIT. 371
In this spirit the fugitives rode steadily on hour
after hour till the evening came, and then there was
nothing for it but to look out for some halting-place
with cover and feed for the ponies.
"We can't keep on without giving them a rest,"
said Ingleborough; "for we may have to ride all day
to-morrow."
"What?" cried West. "You surely don't think
we're so far off still?"
"I don't know anything, lad," replied Ingleborough;
"for, as I said before, the country is so big, and it is
quite possible that we may have two or three days'
journey before us yet."
"But food—rest?" faltered West.
"My eyes are wandering everywhere in search of
food," replied Ingleborough, "and I keep on hoping to
come upon a farmhouse somewhere in sight. That will
mean food, either given, bought, or taken by threaten-
ing with our ri?es. As to the rest, we'll have that
when we get into Kimberley."
Night fell without a sign of spruit, pool, or farm;
but it was a bright, clear time, with the stars giving
them suf?cient light to keep on in the hope that was
growing desperate that they must soon come upon some
stream. But they hoped in vain, and the ponies at
last began to grow sluggish and indisposed to proceed
whenever some patch of bush was reached in the midst
of the dried-up expanse.
24*


## p. 372 (#390) ############################################

372 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"There, it's of no use," said Ingleborough; "we
may as well let the poor brutes browse upon such
green shoots as they can ?nd! They'll be all the
fresher for the halt. As for us, we must feed upon
hope and the remembrance of the good things we have
had in the past."
"Don't let's give up yet!" replied \Vest. "It is
cool travelling, and every mile brings us nearer to
safety."
"Very well; but we shall ?nd it hard work to get
the ponies along."
So they rode on, with their mounts growing more
and more sluggish for a while, and then West suddenly
uttered an exclamation.
"What is it?" cried Ingleborough. "Your nag?"
"Yes; he has suddenly begun to step out briskly."
"So has mine," said Ingleborough. "It's all right.
Give yours his head—they sniff water. I half fancy I
can smell it myself; the air comes so cool and moist."
just then one of the ponies snorted, and the pair
broke into a canter which lasted for about a quarter
of a mile, when they dropped into a walk, for the
ground was encumbered with stones; but almost directly
a pleasant refreshing odour of moist greenery saluted
the riders' nostrils, and then the ground was soft and
yielding beneath the ponies' hoofs, then rough and
gravelly, and the next minute the riders were gazing
down at the re?ected stars, which became blurred as

the ponies splashed into water and then lowered their
muzzles to drink.
"A great pool?" said West.
"No; hark!"
West listened, to hear the rippling trickle of running
water.
"A river!" he said excitedly.
"Yes, and it may be the Vaal. If not, it will be
one of the streams running into it."
"And we must keep on this side and follow it
down."
"Well, no," said Ingleborough, with a little laugh;
"seeing that the Boers are after us, I think it will be
safer to follow it down from the other side."
"Very well! What shall we do—-—get down and
wade ?" ,
"I would rather keep dry," replied Ingleborough.
"Let's wait till the ponies have drunk suf?cient, and
then try if it is safe enough for them to walk across.
I think it will be, for you can hear how shallow it is!"
"Yes," said West; "close in here; but what is it
farther out?"
He stood up in his stirrups and followed the
re?ection of the stars for some distance.
"It's a big river, Ingle," he said, "and it would
be madness to try and ford it in the dark."
"Very well; let's get a good drink as soon as the
ponies have had their share, and then follow the river

down till we come upon a place where they can graze
and we can rest."
This plan was followed out, the ponies being
hobbled at a spot where there seemed to be plenty of
feed, while amongst the dense bushes and rugged
stones which barred their way a snug resting-place was
soon found, where, after cautiously making their way
down to the river bank and allaying their thirst, the
fugitives lay down to rest, listening to the sound of
falling water not far away. Then, in perfect forget-
fulness of Boers, despatches, and all the dangers of
their way, both dropped into the deep sleep produced
by exertion—a sleep which lasted till the sun was once
more beginning to ?ood the earth with light.

CHAPTER XXXVII.
ROUGH WORK.
IT was the sound of a deep breath which put an end
to West's slumber, and he opened his eyes to lie
staring at two more, big, brown, soft, and peaceful-
looking, not a foot away from his own.
It was some moments before full wakefulness came
and he realised where he was, and that it was his pony,
well-fed and rested, mutely asking him whether he was
not going to mount and ride off again.
It was then that the thought of danger asserted
itself, and he raised his head and looked sharply around,
to see that they were amongst stones and bushes where
the bank went precipitously down to a beautiful winding
river ?owing amongst abundant verdure. Close by him
lay Ingleborough, still fast asleep, and beyond him the
other pony, still cropping away at the rich green growth
which sprang up among the stones. Then, as far as
he could see, West made out nothing but the beauty
of the spot upon which they had stumbled in the dark-
ness of the night. He rose to his knees stif?y enough,

and was in the act of getting upon his feet, realising
that the beautiful greenery formed a riband on either
side of the river, beyond which was the open veldt,
when he dropped down again to reach out and grasp
Ingleborough's shoulder, for in his rapid glance he had
caught sight of a party of mounted men out in the
full sunshine about half-a-mile away. They were
walking their horses, and it seemed for certain to be
the whole or a portion of the enemy of the previous
day, for he recalled, What had not struck him at the
time, that one of the Boers was mounted upon a grey
horse, and one of the others he could see from where
he watched was similarly mounted.
"Plenty of grey horses about, of course!" he
muttered; "but this seems to be the oneI saw yester-
day."
"\Vhat's the matter?" said Ingleborough.
"Hist! Keep quiet!" repliedWVest. "The Boers
are upon us! Look!"
Ingleborough rose cautiously, took a long earnest
look through his glass, and put it back.
"Yes, there they are," he said coolly; "there's that
chap again on the white pony. Good job we didn't try
to ford the river in the darkness. \Vhy, we should
have been swept away."
West glanced for a moment in the direction of the
stream, and grasped the truth of his companion's words,
before scanning their position and taking it in at once.

0.)

"We can't get over yonder," he said quickly.
"No," replied Ingleborough. "That cuts two ways.
Neither can they attack us from that quarter; so our
rear is safe."
"We shall not be able to escape north," continued
West.
"No; we are shut in there."
"Nor yet south, for they would pick us off easily
before we could get through the rough ground to gallop
away."
"Quite right, lad; and they are advancing on our
front. Noll, my boy, there is only one thing to be
done."
"What is that?"
. "Turn that patch of rocks there into our fort, and
hold out till they've shot us down, or we've shot them,
or they've made us surrender."
"What about provisions?"
"Plenty of water," said Ingleborough coolly, nodding
towards the river.
"\Ne're nearly famished now."
"Yes, lad! I certainly feel as if I could peck a
bit of something if I had the chance. But come,
there's no time for talking. There's a ready-made
fort for us, and the next thing is to get the ponies
into cover. I say, I was right! I knew that the
enemy would stick doggedly to our trail till they ran
us down."


## p. 378 (#396) ############################################

378 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"Look here!" cried West: "I'm going to crawl to
those rocks and try and cover you while you follow
with the ponies."
"No need," replied Ingleborough; "the poor things
have eaten till they can eat no more, and they'll follow
us right enough. Let's try and get under cover before
we are seen."
West hesitated for a moment, for the thought arose
that the Boer party might ride away and try to ?nd a
ford, but a glance showed him that in the brief period
which had passed since he awoke and saw them the
enemy were much nearer, and, following his companion's
example, he began to crawl on all fours towards the
clump of rocks pointed out, the horses quietly following
them.
They had about ?fty yards to go through a cover
of bushes and lumps of rugged stone, but before they
were half way there West cried impatiently: "I don't
like it; the Boers must see the horses directly. Let's
mount and make a dash for it."
"Very well!" replied Ingleborough quietly. "Per-
haps it would be best!"
"Then as soon as you are up we must ride towards
them till we are clear of these bushes, and then off we
go to the right."
"Good; but it must be sharp work, for of course
they will see us the moment we are up!" answered
Ingleborough.


## p. 379 (#397) ############################################

ROUGH WORK. 379
"We must risk it, Ingle," said West. "We never
could keep them at bay. Let's have action: it would
be horrible to be lying behind a rock with the sun
beating down upon us. Now then, get hold Of your
rein!"
There was a few moments' pause while the pair
crept alongside of their ponies. Then West drew a deep
breath and cried: "Mount!"
As he uttered the word he glanced over his pony's
back at the advancing enemy, and saw that they had
caught sight of the two animals, halted, and were in
the act of taking aim at them. But neither West nor
Ingleborough paused, raising a foot to the stirrup and
being in the act of springing up, when the reports of
about a dozen ri?es rang out, and West's rein was
jerked out Of his hand as he was thrown upon his back,
while his pony made a series Of tremendous bounds,
the last of which took it into the river with a plunge
.Of about a dozen feet right into a deep pool. The
water splashed on high, glittering in the sunshine, and
the next minute the unfortunate beast was ?oating slowly
away towards the swift current, just feebly pawing at
the water, and on raising its head it fell again with a
heavy splash.
"They can shoot well!" said Ingleborough coolly.
West turned his gaze from the dying pony, irri-
tated beyond measure by his companion's easy-going
coolness, and then saw the full extent of their trouble,

for Ingleborough's pony had sunk upon its knees and
then lain gently over upon its Side, to die instantly
without a struggle, one of the Boers' bullets having
passed right through its brain.
"Might have been worse!" continued Ingleborough.
"They did not hit us!
see us now.
Come along, lad! They can't
Follow me, and let's creep to the fort.
Keep down, lad; keep down."
West had involuntarily dropped on all fours as
Ingleborough spoke, and none too soon, for another dozen
bullets came rattling over them, cutting the twigs and
spattering amongst the rocks, while several passed close
to them with a buzzing sound.
"There!" cried Ingleborough the next minute. "No
question now about what we're going to do. Here's
our fort; there's plenty of water; and the Boers have
shot our provisions ready for us. \Ve must cut some
of the meat up for biltong, and eat as much as we can
while the rest of it is fresh."
"For heaven's sake don't talk of eating!" cried
West. "Look here: let's creep along through the cover
and try and get away."
"On foot, followed by mounted men? No good; we
should be pumped out in less than a couple of hours!"
"Then let's make the brutes pay dearly for what
they've done!" cried \Vest angrily. "Now Ingle, let's
prove to them that we can use our ri?es too! I'm
going to Shoot every horse I can."

"Yes," said West, whose ri?e-barrel rested in a
crack between two stones.
"Then ?re away; but don't waste a shot!"
"Trust me!" cried \Nest grimly. "Now then, ?re;
and remember the despatch!"
He took careful aim as he spoke, and drew trigger,
with the result that one of the Boer ponies stopped
short, spun round, ?ung its rider, and galloped madly
away. ,
The next moment Ingleborough's ri?e cracked, and
a second pony began to walk on three legs, while the
party opened out, galloping so as to form a half-circle
about their enemies, the two ends resting on the river
bank and forming a radius of about three hundred yards.
"Sixteen more ponies to bring down," said Ingle-
borough; "and those two dismounted men will take
cover and begin to stalk us."
"That's what the whole party will do!" said \Vest
bitterly. "We shall hit no more ponies: they'll get
them all into cover, and then come creeping nearer
and nearer."
At that moment Ingleborough ?red again right
in front where one of the Boers dismounted among
some trees. '

"There's one more though," said Ingleborough,
for the poor brute he had ?red at reared up and then
fell, to lie kicking on its ?ank. "Try for another your-
self, lad!"
Before he had ?nished speaking W'est had ?red
again, and another pony was hit, to come tearing to-
wards them, dragging its dismounted rider after it, for
the man clung to the reins till he was jerked off his
feet and drawn along the ground some ?fty yards,
when his head came in contact with a stone, and
he lay insensible, his pony galloping for another
hundred yards and then falling, paralysed in its hind-
quarters.
And now the Boers' bullets began to rattle about
the stones which protected the hidden pair, keeping
them lying close and only able to ?re now and then;
but they got ch'ances which they did not miss of bring-
ing down, killing, or disabling ?ve more of the enemy's
ponies, which upon being left alone began to graze,
and naturally exposed themselves.
Maddened by their losses and inability to see their
foes, the Boers kept reducing the distance, creeping
from stone to bush and from bush to stone, rendering
the defenders' position minute by minute one of greater
peril.
But the danger did not trouble West. It only in-
creased the excitement from which he suffered, and,
with his eyes ?ashing in his eagerness, he kept on

showing the Boers where he lay by ?ring at every
opportunity, religiously keeping his aim for the ponies,
in the full belief that before long the Boers would
retire.
"It's no good to play that game!" cried Ingle-
borough suddenly, and he made a quick movement,
turning a little to his right and ?ring.
There was a hoarse yell, and a man sprang up
not above a hundred yards away, dropped his ri?e,
and turning round he began to stagger away.
"You are ?ring at the Boers, Ingle," cried West
excitedly.
"Yes: it was time !" growled Ingleborough, through
his teeth, with his voice sounding hoarse and strange.
"I've hit three. Two haven't moved."
"What's the matter?" asked West, in a tone Of
anxiety, for he felt that something serious had happened
to his comrade.
"Don't talk," growled Ingleborough angrily. "Look!
Those two. Fire!"
Two of the Boers away to West's left front had
suddenly sprung up, and bending low were running
towards him, evidently making for a patch of bush,
out of which a mass of grey stone peered, not a hundred
yards from the young men's shelter. Feeling now
that it was life for life, West glanced along the barrel
of his ri?e, waiting till the Boers had nearly reached
their goal, and then, just as the second dashed close

behind his leader, West drew trigger, shivering the next
moment, for as the smoke rose he saw one of the men
lying upon his face and the other crawling back on
all-fours.
"Good shot l" said Ingleborough hoarsely, and then
he uttered a deep groan.
"Ingle, old fellow, what is it?" cried West.
The only answer he obtained was from his com-
rade's piece, for the latter ?red again, and another Boer
sprang into sight not a hundred yards away, fell upon
his knees, and then rolled over.
"Ingle, old fellow," cried West; "don't say you're
hurt!" '
"Oh!" groaned Ingleborough. "Wasn't going to,
old man; but that last brute got me."
"Hurt much?"
"Much? It's like red-hot iron through me. Oh,
if I only had some water!"
"\Vater?" cried West, springing up. "Yes; I'll
get some."
Crack, crack, crack! Half-a-dozen ri?es rang out in
different directions, and in an instant West suffered for
his thoughtless unsel?sh act, for he felt as if someone
had struck him a cruel blow with a sjambok across the
face from the front, while someone else had driven the
butt of his ri?e with all his force full upon his shoulder-
blade—this blow from the back driving him forward
upon his knees and then causing him to fall across

Ingleborough. Then for a few moments everything
seemed as'a blank.
"Hurt much?" came the next minute, as if from
a distance.
' "Hurt? No!" said \Vest huskily, and he made an
effort and rose to his knees. Then, stung to rage by
an agonising pain which stiffened him into action, he
levelled his ri?e once more, took a quick aim at a
couple of the Boers who were running towards them
in a stooping position, ?red, and distinctly saw one
of the two drop to the ground.
The next moment someone ?red over his shoulder,
and the other went down, just as West's ri?e dropped
from his hand and he fell over sideways, yielding to a
horribly sickening sensation, followed by a half-dreamy
fancy that someone had felt for and got hold of his
hand, to grip it in a way that was at ?rst terribly pain-
ful—a pang seeming to run up from hand to shoulder.
The pain appeared to grow worse and worse, then
deadened, and came again, and so on, like spasms of
agony, while all the time the ?ring went on from all
around.
"Poor old Ingle l" was about his last clear thought;
"they've killed him, and now they're ?ring till they've
quite frightened me! Oh, how they keep on shooting!
Get it over, you cowardly brutes—nearly a score of
you against two! Oh!" he groaned then: "ifI could
only have delivered my despatch!"

His left hand was raised painfully to his breast to
feel whether the paper was still safe; but the pain of
the effort was sickening, and his hand glided over
something wet and warm and sticky.
"Poor old Inglel Blood!" ?ashed through his
brain, as the ri?e reports rang out from very close
now, and then all was blank.
The end of everything seemed to have come.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
THE SURGEON'S WORDS.
" AD enough, poor fellow; but I think I can pull
them both round. Nothing vital, you see, touched,
and these Mauser bullets make wonderfully clean
wounds!"
"And the other?"
"Bad ?esh-wounds—great loss of blood. I just
got at that artery in time."
West heard these words spoken by someone whose
head kept getting in his way as he lay staring up at
the great bright stars directly overhead, and it seemed
very tiresome.
He tried to speak and ask whoever it was to move
aside; but his tongue would not stir, and he lay per-
fectly still, trying to think what it all meant, and in a
dull far-off sort of way it gradually dawned ppon him
that the people near him were talking about the Boers
he had somehow or another and for some reason shot
down.
Then, as he thought, the calm feeling he was en-

joying grew troubled, and he began to recall the fact
that he had been shooting somebody's ponies to supply
somebody else with food, and that he must have been
mad, for he felt convinced that they would not be nice
eating, as he had heard that the fat was Oily and the
?esh tasted sweet. Besides which, it would be horrible
to have to eat horse?esh at a time when his threat
was dry with an agonising thirst. Then the terrible
thought forced itself upon him that while shooting
down ponies he had missed them and killed men
instead, and once more all was blank.
The next time the power of thinking came to the
poor fellow all was very dark, and a jarring pain kept
running through him, caused by the motion of his hard
bed, which had somehow grown wheels and was being
dragged along.
Cattle were lowing and sheep bleating. There
were shouts, too, such as he knew were uttered by
Kaf?r drivers, and there were the crackings of their
great whips.
After a while he made out the trampling of horses
and heard men talking, while in an eager confused way
he listened for what they would say about those two
wounded Boers, one of whom had'nearly bled to death
before that artery was stopped. These, he felt, must
be the Boers he shot when he ought to have shot
ponies.
And as he got to that point the trouble of thinking

THE SURGEON'S WORDS. 389
worried his brain so that he could think no more, and
again all was blank.
At last came a morning when West woke up
in a great room which seemed to be familiar. There
were nurses moving about in their clean white-bordered
dresses, and he knew that he was in some place ?tted
up as a hospital. Several of the occupants of the beds
wore bandages suggestive of bad wounds, and to help
his thoughts there came from time to time the dull
heavy reports of cannon.
He did not recollect all that had preceded his
coming yet; but he grasped the fact that he had been
wounded and was now in hospital.
He lay for a few minutes with his brain growing
clearer and clearer, and at last, seeing one of the
nurses looking in his direction, he tried to raise one
hand, but could not. The other proved more manage-
able, and in obedience to a sign the nurse came,
laid a hand upon his forehead, and smiled down in his
face. \
"Your head's cooler!" she said. "You're better? "
"Yes," he replied: "have I been very bad?"
"Terribly! We thought once that you would not
recover."
"And Ingleborough?"
"Ingleborough? Oh, you mean your companion
who was brought in with you?"
West nodded: he could not speak.

"Well, I think he will get better now!"
"But his wound: is it so bad?"
"He nearly bled to death; but you must not talk
much yet."
"Only a little!" said \Vest eagerly. "Pray tell
me, he will get better?"
"Oh yes: there's no doubt about it, I believe."
"Oh, thank goodness!" cried West fervently.
"But what place is this?"
"This? Why, Kimberley, of course!"
"Ah!" cried West excitedly, and his hand went
to his breast. "My jacket!"
"YOur jacket?" said the nurse. "Oh, that was all
cut and torn, and soaked With blood. I think it has
been burnt."
"What!" cried West. "Oh, don't say that!"
"Hush, hush! What is this?" said a deep, stern
voice. "Patient delirious, nurse?"
A quiet, grave-looking face was bent over West's
pillow, and the poor fellow jumped at the idea that
this must be the surgeon.
"No, sir; no, sir!" he whispered excitedly, catching
at the new-comer's arm. "I am better: it is only that
I am in trouble about my clothes."
"Clothes, eh?" said the doctor, smiling. "Oh,
you will not want clothes for two or three weeks yet."
"Not to dress, sir," whispered West excitedly;
"but I must have my jacket. It is important!"


## p. 391 (#411) ############################################

TIIE SURGEON'S WORDS. 391
"Why?" said the surgeon, laying his hand upon
the young man's brow soothingly.
"I was bringing on a despatch from Mafeking
when I was shot down, sir," whispered West excitedly.
"It was sewn up for safety in the breast."
"Indeed?" said the doctor, laying his ?ngers on
the lad's pulse and looking keenly in his eyes.
"Yes, sir, indeed!" said West eagerly. "I know
what I am saying, sir."
"Yes, you are cool now; but I'm afraid the jacket
will have been burned with other garments of the kind.
Of course, the contents of the pockets will have been
preserved."
"Oh, they are nothing, sir," cried West piteously.
"It is a letter sewn up in the breast that I want. It
is so important!"
"Well, I'll see!" said the doctor gravely, and,
signing to the nurse who had been in attendance, he
left the ward, with West in a state of feverish anxiety.
At last, to West's intense satisfaction, the horribly
blood-stained garment was brought in, and his hand
went out trembling to catch it by the breast, fully ex-
pecting to ?nd the missive gone.
"Yes," he cried wildly, "it is here!"
"Hah! " cried the doctor, and, taking out his knife,
he prepared to slit it up, but West checked him.
' "No," he panted: "the Commandant. Send for
him here!"

"My good lad, he is so busy, he would not come!
Let me cut out the message and send it to him."
"No," said West ?rmly; "I will not part from it
till he comes."
"But really——-"
"Tell him a wounded messenger from Mafeking
has a letter for him, and he will come."
West was right: the magic word Mafeking brought
the Commandant to his bedside; and as soon as he
came up he stopped short and made what little blood
poor West had left ?ush to his face, for he cried:
"Hullo! Why, it is our illicit diamond-dealer! I
thought we were never to see you again!"
"It is not true!" cried West. "The man who
denounced me lied!"
"Then you have been to Mafeking?"
"Yes, sir: Mr. Ingleborough and I."
"And brought back a despatch?"
"Yes, sir: here it is!"
"Where?" said the Commandant, glancing down
at the stained tunic on the bed.
"Open it now, sir," said \Vest to the doctor, who
took out his knife again, slit the cloth, and drew out
the big letter, terribly soaked with its bearer's blood.
"Bravo! Brave messenger!" cried the Commandant,
grasping West's hand before tearing open the packet
and ?nding enough of the despatch unstained to allow
him to decipher the principal part of the text. "Hah!"

he cried, when he had ?nished, "on the whole good
news; but," he continued, glancing at the date, "you
have been a long time coming."
"Have I, sir? We lost no time!"
"The poor fellow has been lying here for a fort-
night, Sir," said the surgeon.
"A fortnight ago? Why, that was the day when
the reconnoitring party returned with the captured
sheep and cattle. Yes, I remember now: they had a
brush with the Boers up the river. Of course, yes:
they were attracted by the ?ring, and saved two young
Englishmen. You are one of them?"
"Yes, Sir."
"Well done, then! Our raiding party did good
work, though they did have a desperate ?ght after-
wards to get through the Boer lines. Getting better?"
"Yes, Sir," said West, with a sigh of relief: "now
that I have got my despatch safely into your hands!"
"But what about your bad character?"
"It was a false accusation, Sir!" cried West in-
dignantly. "The man who denounced me was the
criminal himself."
"Well, you have done your duty so truly that I
believe you in preference to him."
"But I shall be able to fully clear myself, sir,
soon, for this man is a prisoner now with the cavalry
brigade. Has that come into the town yet, Sir, with
the prisoners, guns, and the convoy they captured?"

"Hah!" cried the Commandant: "this is news in-
deed! Has the brigade captured all you say?"
"Yes, sir," said West, and he told all that had
taken place up to the time of he and Ingleborough
being cut Off and chased by the Boers.
"\Ne knew nothing of this l" said the Commandant.
"We are prisoners ourselves; but your news gives us
hope of a speedy release, for the General is not one
to let the grass grow under his feet."
"He is not, sir!" said West. "Then you shall
bring me and the man who accused me face to face."
"The sooner the better, my lad!" said the Com-
mandant warmly. "How soon will he be up, doctor?"
"Within a fortnight, I hope, sirl" was the reply.
"Then goodbye for the present, my lad!" said
the Commandant. "Your long-delayed despatch will
send a thrill of hope through all here in Kimberley,
for it breathes nothing but determination to hold the
Boers at bay."
"May I say one word more, sir?" said West ex-
citedly.
"What do you think, doctor?" ,
"He has said enough, sir, and if he talks much
more we shall have the fever back. Well, perhaps
he'll fret if he does not get something off his mind."
"What is it, then?" said the Commandant.
"I had a brave comrade to ride with the des-
patch, sir."

"To be sure, yes, I remember. What about him?
Not killed, I hope?"
"No, sir, but badly wounded, and lying somewhere
here."
"Poor fellow! I must see him. There must be
promotion for you both."
"If you would see him, sir, and speak to him as
you have spoken to me," said West, with the weak
tears rising to his eyes.
"Of course, yes! There, shake hands, my lad:
you have done splendidly! Don't worry about the
diamond charge! I can feel that it was a contemptible
lie! Now, doctor, take me to your other patient."
"Ha!" sighed West, nestling back on his pillow
with a calm look of content in his eyes, which closed
directly after for a sleep that lasted ten hours at the
least.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
ANSON IN A HOLE—AND SOMETHING ELSE.
" ON'T worry about the diamond charge!" said the
Commandant; but Oliver West did, day after
day, though he got better fast and was soon able to
go and sit with Ingleborough, who slowly recovered,
as a man does who has had nearly all the life-blood
drained from his body. West worried, and Ingle-
borough did too; for those were anxious days, those
in Kimberley, which brought strong men low, even
near to despair, while the wounded, weak, and sick
were often ready to think that relief would never come.
West and Ingleborough recovered from their
wounds only gradually, to suffer with the rest, re-
turning to duty when really un?t, while the deadly
work went on, the men braving the shell and shot
with more spirit when they knew that the women and
children were safe within the mines.
Then came the day of relief, and with it the
feeling that a long night of misery and despair had
ended; and that night West and Ingleborough grasped

hands, the former's pale sallow face lighting up with
something of his old look, as he exclaimed: "Now, if
the General would only march in with his prisoners,
and bring Anson before us face to face!"
Everything, the proverb says, comes to the man
who waits, and certainly it was so here, for the day
did come when the General rode in at the head Of
his dashing cavalry brigade, and, what was more, with
the prisoners, and with them Anson, very much re-
duced in weight.
There was something more than mere eagerness
to be freed from an accusation which led the two
young men down to the General's camp next morning
to wait until they could see him in their turn.
On their way they sought out the sergeant who
had had Anson under his charge, and he grinned at
them in recognition.
"You were about right, gentlemen," he said,
"about that prisoner."
"What about him?" said West eagerly.
"About his being an Englishman. I've seen a lot
of him along with the other prisoners, andhe's as
English as can be. Piet Retif! Why, he's got james
Anson written on the tails of his shirts—that is, what
he's got left."
"But look here, sergeant," said Ingleborough
anxiously: "what about his wagon?"
"Oh, that's all right, sir! Loaded up."

"Has he had the run of it?"
"Not he, sir. He wanted to, but I only let him
get some under-toggery, shirts and such. I couldn't
refuse him that !"
"Did he go alone?"
"Yes, sir."
"Quite ? "
"Well, not quite, sir, because I was with him."
"Hah!" sighed Ingleborough, in a tone full of
relief.
"I've stuck to him, by the General's orders, ever
Since. Like a leech, sir," said the sergeant, in con-
clusion—"like a leech."
The cavalry Genera! welcomed the young men
warmly, and, as it happened, the same four of?cers
were with him, ready to join in the greeting.
"I never expected to see you two fellows again,"
said one of them, laughing. "I was out with my men
when you were cut off. Why, you must have had a
very narrow escape!"
"Of course," said the General, laughing; "but
that has been the fashion: we have all had narrow
escapes. Well, you got safely in with your despatch?"
"We got in with our despatch, sirl" said West
rather grimly, "but not safely"; and he brie?y told
their adventures.
"Bravo! Well done!" was chorussed.
"Why, you two will have to join the 'regulars!"

said the General. "We can't have men like you for
volunteers! Think it over, and, if you decide to join,
come to me, and I'll see what I can do! Now then,
I don't want to be rude; but I have no time for ordi-
nary visitors. You sent word in that you wanted to
see me on important business. What is it?"
"You speak," said Ingleborough, and West began.
"\Ve want to know about the prisoner taken that
day, sir—the man who said he was a Boer."
"I remember," cried the General. "I have him
safe."
"When is he to be tried, sir?"
"Can't say; he will be handed over to the autho-
rities who see to such things now. You said he was
a renegade who had joined the Boers."
"Yes, sir, after being charged with illicit diamond-
dealing with the Kaf?rs working at the great Kimberley
mines; and we want you to give orders for the wagon
he had with him to be searched."
"His wagon searched?" cried the General. "How
am I to know which wagon he had?"
"The sergeant knows where it is, sir," replied
West; "and we could recognise it directly."
"But why do you want it searched—what for?"
"For diamonds, sir, that he brought away from
Kimberley, and which you have brought back."
"H'm! Diamonds, eh? This sounds interesting!"
said the General. "You think he has some there?"


## p. 400 (#420) ############################################

400 A DASH FROM DIAMOND CITY.
"We both believe he has, sir, and of great value."
"\Vhat do you say, gentlemen?"
"Oh, let's have the search made by all means!"
cried one of the of?cers, laughing. "It may mean
salvage and loot, and all sorts of good things!"
"Very well! Take the matter up, and I'll see the
search made! Let the prisoner be present, of course.
I'll be ready in half-an-hour."
Punctually to the minute the General was ready,
and he walked down through the temporary camp to
where the wagon stood among scores of others, while
the sergeant and four men stood by with Anson, who
looked shifty and uncomfortable, wincing suddenly as
he caught sight of West and Ingleborough, and then
gazing sharply about at the mounted Lancers on duty
as patrols, for the prisoners were many, and there had
been several attempts at escape.
The General looked at him sharply, and then at
the wagon.
"Is that your wagon, prisoner?"
"It was till you took it!" replied the young man
surlily.
"What do you say, sergeant?"
I!
"Yes, sir, answered the sergeant, with military
brevity. "I marked it with my knife the day that it
was taken."
As he spoke he laid a ?nger upon a couple of
notches he had made in the woodwork.

"Now then," said the General, "before I have the
wagon examined——"
Anson's eyes twitched.
"Repeat the charge you made against this man!"
continued the General. ,
Ingleborough now ?rmly repeated almost word for
word what he had before said, and charged Anson
with being an illicit diamond-dealer.
"And upon what do you base this charge?" said
the General sternly.
"The personal knowledge of myself and friend
here," replied Ingleborough. '
"All lies, General," cried Anson excitedly. "Those
two are charging me with what they did themselves.
They were illicit diamond-dealers, and when they were
found out they tried to plant the crime on me. All
liesl"
"Crime? Yes," said the General thoughtfully.
"Yes; I suppose it is one of the greatest crimes that
a man can commit in Kimberley. All lies, eh! Well,
sir, not all, for it is evident from your speech that you
are an Englishman and not a Boer. _I judge too that
you were in the company's of?ce at Kimberley."
"Oh yes, General," said Anson; "that is true,
and through the plotting of these two men I was
turned out of my situation."
"And then deserted to the Boers?"
"No, General. I was obliged to do something for

a living, so I bought a wagon to go in for trade; but
I was captured by the Boers and they have kept me
a prisoner ever since. Then you fought the Boers and
beat them, and took me prisoner again. That's why
I'm here."
"An Englishman—prisoner to your own country-
men? Why did you not declare what you were?
What did he say his name was, sergeant?"
"Said he was aBoer and his name was Piet Retif,
sir," said the sergeant, with a look of disgust at Anson's
fat face.
"Yes; that looks black against him!" said the
General. "He is taken with the Boers, while those
who charge him are men of trust, being chosen to
bear despatches."
"Because they were not found out, sir!" cried
Anson. "There never was a worse pair of cheats
and tricksters."
"Perhaps not!" said the General. " SO you were
a prisoner with the Boers, my man?"
"Yes, General, and very glad to see the British
troops come up and gain such a success."
"You said that you was a dealer in mealies and
corn," growled the sergeant.
"Well, a man must do something for his living."
"Of course," said the General. "Well, you look
simple and innocent enough."
"I am, sir, really!" cried Anson.

"And never engaged in illicit diamond-dealing?"
"Me, sir? Never," cried Anson virtuously. "I
was only charged by those two to save themselves!
Then they got on, and I was trampled down."
"And joined the Boers out of revenge, 'eh?"
"No, sir: it was all fate and accident."
"Well, fate is very unkind to us sometimes, my
man," said the General. "That is your wagon and
span of oxen, you say?"
"Yes, sir."
"Well, you have prospered by your change. What
did you say you traded in?"
"Provender, sir—mealies and corn."
"And you?" cried the General, turning sharply
to West. "What do you think he deals in?"
"I believe he deals in diamonds, sir,"
West.
"Why?" said the General.
"For one reason, sir, because my friend, in whom
I have perfect faith, caught him in the act."
"Yes: anything more?"
replied
"I know him to be a cowardly liar, sir, and——"
"Oh!" groaned Anson. "I never heard anything
like it."
"Go on," said the General.
"Lastly, sir, because he set it about that I had
volunteered to carry a despatch to Mafeking so as to
get away with the diamonds I had smuggled."

"And did you?" said the General.
"I got away to Mafeking with the despatch!"
said West, smiling. .
"And where are the diamonds in question?"
"My friend and I believe that they are in James
Anson's wagon," said West bitterly, for he felt bitter
then against the traitor, whose proceedings he recalled
when they were prisoners. Later on he felt a little
sorry for his words.
"Oh!" cried Anson, throwing up his hands and
looking appealingly at the General, who ?xed him
with his eyes.
"Well," he said; "what have you to say to this?"
"It's abominable, sir—it's atrocious—it's cruel!"
" Then you have no smuggled diamonds with you ? "
"NO, sir," cried Anson excitedly. "They charged
me once before, and had my wagon searched by the
police."
"And did the police ?nd any?"
"No, sir, not one! It was a blind, sir, so that
they might carry off theirs by throwing the police Off
the scent. I'll be bound to say they have a lot with
them now!"
"Well, I doubt that!" said the General, smiling.
"Where would they carry them?"
"Oh, sir, you don't know what artful tricks are
played!" said Anson eagerly.
"Oh, I've heard of a few since I came to South

Africa; but I don't think it likely that a couple of
despatch-riders would carry many illicit diamonds with
them!"
"Have the butts of their revolvers examined, sir,
and the stuf?ng of their saddles," cried Anson. "I
have heard of the butts of ri?es being bored to hold
a lot."
"So have I!" said the General; "but I fancy a
wagon would be more likely to supply hiding—places!"
"Oh yes, sir, but the police inspector searched my
wagon, and did not ?nd any."
"You would have no objection, of course, being
perfectly innocent," said the General, "to some of my
men searching your wagon?"
"Of course, I shouldn't like it, sir, but—-" 7
"But? Ah, you mean conquest gives me the right
of search?"
"It's like casting a slur on a man's character,
sir."
"But it makes it shine out the brighter when you
are proved to be innocent! Here, sergeant, this case
begins to be interesting! Search our friend's wagon."
Anson tried to master a wince, and merely shrugged
his shoulders, standing with his hands in his pockets
While the sergeant and his men commenced their task,
examining every part of the wagon while the of?cers
waited patiently, lighting up and smoking their cigars
until the sergeant came back to make his report.

"\Vell, what have you found?"
"Nothing but these, sir," replied the sergeant
stif?y. "Tucked away behind the doubled tilt they
were, sir," and the man held out a revolver, Anson's
swordstick, and his little mahogany ?ute-case.
"Humph! No diamonds, sergeant?"
"Not so much as a pin or ring, sir," replied the
man.
"Are these yours, Mr. Piet Retif? " said the General.
"The walking-stick and the ?ute-case are mine,"
said Anson coolly. "The pistol must be the driver's.
I had a ri?e; but your men took that away."
"Nothing else?" said the General.
"Nothing else, sir. We looked everywhere,"
replied the sergeant, and he offered his superior the
objects he had brought; but the General shrugged his
shoulders and looked at his of?cers, who each examined
the revolver, stick, and ?ute-case, and passed them
back to the sergeant.
"Well, gentlemen," said the General, turning to
West and Ingleborough: "you hear. What have you
to say now?" .
"The prisoner owned to these things being his!"
said Ingleborough.
"No, I didn't!" said Anson sharply. "Revolver
isn't mine."
"Only lent to you, perhaps," said Ingleborough,
taking the weapon from the sergeant's hands and
cocking it, making Anson wince.

" I'm not going to ?re," said Ingleborough, smiling
contemptuously, as he held the pistol in both hands
with his thumb-nails together on the top of the butt.
Then, pressing the cock sidewise, the butt opened from
end to end upon a concealed hinge, showing that it
was perfectly hollowed out and that half-a-dozen large
diamonds lay within, closely packed in cotton wool.
Anson turned clay-coloured.
" 'Tisn't mine!" he cried. "I know nothing
about it!"
"Well, never mind," said the General; "it is ours
now. An interesting bit of loot, gentlemen!"
There was a murmur of voices at this, and as
soon as the pistol had been handed round the butt
was closed with a sharp snap, and the General turned
to Ingleborough again.
"Well, sir," he said: "is that all?"
"I am not sure," replied Ingleborough; "but I
am suspicious about that stick."
"You think it is hollowed out?"
"Yes, sir," said Ingleborough, and, taking it in
his hands, he drew it apart, dragging into the light
from its sheath a handsome Damascened three-edged
blade, which he held against the cane, proving that
the blade went right down to the ferrule at the end.
"What about the handle?" said one of the Of?cers
eagerly, as Ingleborough thrust back the blade into its
cane sheath.

"That is what I suspect!" said Ingleborough, and
he carefully examined the silver-gilt tip, but twisted
and turned it in vain, for there seemed to be no way
of opening it, till all at once he tried to twist the
sheath portion beneath the double ring which divided
hilt from sheath, when the handle turned for about
half-ansinch and was then drawn off, disclosing a
hollow shell lining which held another deposit 0
diamonds packed in cotton wool.
"More loot, gentlemen ! " said the General, smiling.
"What comes next?"
"The ?ute," cried two voices together, and Ingle-
borough opened the case, showing the three joints
?tting tightly in the velvet-lined compartments.
"A silent musical instrument!" said the General,
smiling.
"Can anyone play the overture to the Crown Dia-
monds?" said one of the aides-dammit merrily.
' "This is the overture!" said another, and Ingle-
borough took out two joints [in turn, perfectly empty,
?tted them together, and then took out the top joint, to
put that in its proper position, before raising the in-
strument to his lips and running up and down the
gamut.
"Nothing there," said the General.
But Ingleborough lowered the ?ute, held it in both
hands, and drew it apart at the tuning-slide, held it
Sidewise, and then unscrewed the top plug, showing an

bpening, out of which he shook a magni?cent gem of
great size and perfect make.
"Bravo!" cried the General excitedly. And then:
"I'm afraid, Mr. Dealer in mealies and corn, the judg-
ment will go dead against you. Have you done?" he
continued, turning to Ingleborough.
"Not quite, sir!" replied the latter. "Come, West,
don't let me get all the credit for unmasking the
scoundrel."
"Look here," cried Anson viciously, "I protest
against being called a scoundrel! Those are my private
savings, invested in what were bought honestly."
"I think, sir, you had better keep your tongue
silent until we have quite done!" said the General.
Then, turning to the two young men, he bade them
go on. -
"Come, \Nest," said Ingleborough, "you suspect
where our friend who is no scoundrel has hidden more
diamonds, do you not?"
"Well, yes," said West, rather unwillingly, for the
whole business disgusted him.
"Speak out, then! I am sure it is in the same
place as I think he has more plunder; but you shall
have your turn now." '
"No, no; go on," said \Vest warmly.
"If you suspect that there is some place un-
searched," said the General sternly, "speak out, sir."
"Then I believe, sir," said \Vest, "that if the water-

cask that is slung under the wagon is opened you will
?nd a number of diamonds hidden there!"
There was a burst of excitement at this, everyone
present speaking save the sergeant, who did a bit of
pantomime which meant: "Of course!" for he bent
down and gave his leg a sounding slap.
"Yes," said Ingleborough; "that is where I meant."
"Why, I thought 0' that once," cried the sergeant,
"and then I says to myself: 'That's too stoopid a
place; no one would hide diamonds where they're sure
to be found'; but I crept underneath on my hands and
knees and gave it a swing so as to make the water
wash about inside. That satis?ed me, andI came
away."
"You have hit the mark, Mr. West," said the
General, smiling. "There is no doubt about it! Look
at the prisoner's face!"
Anson tried hard to pull it back into its normal
shape, for he had been gazing at West with a malignant
look that meant anything from a ri?e-shot to a stab
with a bayonet.
"Now, sergeant, see if you can do better this
time!" cried the General, as Anson's mouth shut with
a click.
Then he stood fast with his brow wrinkled and
his hands clenched, waiting expectantly with the rest of
those present until the cask was set free from the
raw-hide reins by which it was slung under the hind

part of the wagon, and then rolled out, giving forth
the regular hollow sound of a barrel half full of liquid.
"Only sounds like water!" muttered the sergeant,
and he set it running, to soak into the dry ground, and
draining out as much as he could, before giving an
order to the nearest man to take hold of one end while
he raised the other, both men looking stern and severe
in the extreme. Then together they gave the cask a
lusty shake, and the sound which followed was that of
some shovels full of pebbles rattling in the inside.
The next minute they had set the cask down on
end with a grin of delight, which was taken up by their
fellows, while a satis?ed smile dawned upon the faces
of the az'des-de-camp.
"Here, stop that fellow!" shouted one of the
of?cers, for, in spite of his heaviness, Anson proved
that he could be active enough upon occasion, and
this was one; for, seizing his opportunity, he dived
under the wagon, and by the time the soldiers had run
round to the other side he was off, dodging in and
out among the wagons in the mad idea that he could
escape; but before he had gone a hundred yards he
came out suddenly upon a mounted man, and the next
instant he went sprawling over a lance- shaft, and the
steel-shod butt end was planted upon his back to
keep him from rising.
"Pity you should have taken all that trouble!"
said the sergeant, as he came panting up, followed by

his men, " because we might want you to tell us all
a bit about the value of them stones! Now then, up
with you. Let him get up, Lancer! And see here, my
lad, if you cut and run again—being a prisoner caught
in the act of trying to escape—my men have orders
to ?re, and you're so broad and fat that they are sure
to bring you down ?rst shot."
Anson glared at the men's ri?es and ?xed bayonets,
but he said nothing, marching back between the men
to the spot where he had left the General and his old
fellow-clerks; but the barrel had been carried to a
place of safety, and those who had witnessed his dis-
com?ture had gone.
Half-anhour later he had been marched out of
the camp, and was under lock and key in the military
prison, a sentry being posted at the door.

CHAPTER XL.
WINDING UP.
HE adventures of Oliver West and his friend Ingle-
borough were pretty well at an end; and it was
time, for between wounds and exposure they had been
brought to a state which necessitated plenty of rest and
comforts to enable them to quite recover themselves,
Of feasting, praising, and complimenting they had their
?ll—more than enough, West said, for he declared that
the hues of returning health which were coming into
his cheeks were only blushes caused by the way in
which people talked about his bravery, dash, "and all
that stuff."
Ingleborough took it all more contentedly.
"I don't mind their praising us!" he said. "Frankly,
I rather like it; and, without bragging, I think we did
earn it all!"
"Well, we did run some risks!" said West; "and
of course it's much nicer for our friends to know that
we escaped and are alive and well."
"And a jolly deal nicer for us too But what do

you say to joining the army? After what the General
said I think we might both get commissions."
"Perhaps," said West; "but it's doubtful now that
everything is settling down. I feel disposed to invest
my share of the loot and to stop on with the company
after the splendid offer they have made me. Hadn't
you better do the same?"
"I'm nearly half disposed to, Noll," replied Ingle-
borough; "but more than half inclined to go into the
police altogether. I've had an invitation, and I think
the life would suit me better than settling down to a
desk. Yes, this settles it! I shall go on to Norton '
and say 'Yes."'
"Well, I'm sorry," said West; "but at the same
time I'm glad, for you'll make a splendid of?cer!"
"Here, hold hard! I don't want to hear you begin
puf?ng me. By the way, you heard the news about
Fatty Anson?"
"No, not a word!" cried West excitedly.
"Promoted."
"Nonsense! What a shame!"
"It's a fact, my lad! He has just received his
commission in Mrs. Partington's Brigade."
"What!" cried West. "Oh, this is some bit of
chaff!"
"Oh no!" said Ingleborough, laughing. "It's a
fact. The regiment employed by the old lady to help
her keep out the Atlantic with a mop."

"Bah! You mean that he has been sentenced
with other convicts to help to build the Cape'break-
water?"
"Good boy! Quite right! For ?ve years!" replied
Ingleborough.
"Well," said West thoughtfully, "I suppose he
deserves it, and I hope he will become a better fellow
when he has served his time."
