<lb/><p rend="center italic">Notes in the Case of <persName>V V</persName>, a Native of <settlement>L L*</settlement> in the <region>Mantumba District</region>, both of whose hands have been 
hacked or beaten off, and with reference to other similar cases of Mutilation in that <region>District</region>.</p>

<lb/><p>I FOUND this man in the <placeName>. . . . . station</placeName> at <settlement>Q*</settlement> on<geogName><space extent="3" unit="words"/></geogName>, and learned that he had 
been kept by the missionaries for some years, since the day when a party of <term type="collective">native teachers</term> had 
found him in his own town, situated in the forest some miles away from <settlement>Q*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>In answer to my 
inquiry as to how he came to lose his hands, <persName>V V</persName>’s statement was as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>“<term type="collective">State<orgName></orgName> soldiers</term> came from <settlement>P*</settlement>, and attacked the <settlement>R R* towns</settlement>, which they burned, killing 
people.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They then attacked a town called <settlement>A B*</settlement> and burned it, killing people there also.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>From 
that they went on to <settlement>L L*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective"><settlement>L L*</settlement> people</term> fled into the forest, leaving some few of their 
number behind with food to offer to the soldiers&#8212;among whom was <persName>V V</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers came 
to <settlement>L L*</settlement>, under the command of a <term type="collective">European</term> officer, whose <term type="collective">native</term> name was <persName>T U</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers 
took prisoner all the men left in the town, and tied them up.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Their hands were tied very tight 
with <term type="collective">native</term> rope, and they were tied up outside in the open; and as it was raining very hard, 
and they were in the rain all the time and all the night, their hands swelled, because the thongs 
contracted.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His (<persName>V V</persName>’s) hands had swollen terribly in the morning, and the thongs had cut into 
the bone.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers, when they came to <settlement>L L*</settlement>, had only one <term type="collective">native</term> a prisoner with them; he 
was killed during the night.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At <settlement>L L*</settlement> itself eight people, including himself (<persName>V V</persName>) were taken 
prisoners; all were men; two were killed during the night.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Six only were taken down in the 
morning to <settlement>Y Y*</settlement>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term> ordered four of the prisoners to be released; the fifth was a 
Chief, named <persName>R R R</persName>.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This Chief had come back to <settlement>L L*</settlement> in the night to try secretly to get some 
fire to take back into the forest, where the fugitives were hiding.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His wife had become sick during 
the heavy rain in the forest, and the Chief wanted the fire for her; but the soldiers caught him, and 
he was taken along with the rest.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This Chief was taken to <settlement>P*</settlement>, but he believes that on the 
way, at <settlement>Z Z*</settlement>, he tried to escape, and was killed.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>V V</persName>’s hands were so swollen that they 
were quite useless.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers seeing this, and that the thongs had cut into the bone, beat 
his hands against a tree with their rifles, and he was released.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He does not know why they 
beat his hands.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The <term type="collective">white man</term>, <persName>T U</persName>, was not far off, and could see what they were doing.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
<persName>T U</persName> was drinking <term type="foodstuff">palm-wine</term> while the soldiers beat his hands with their rifle-butts against 
the tree.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His hands subsequently fell off (or sloughed away).<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When the soldiers left him by the 
waterside, he got back to <settlement>L L*</settlement>, and when his own people returned from the forest they found 
him there.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Afterwards some boys&#8212;one of whom was a relation&#8212;came to <settlement>L L*</settlement>, and they found 
him without his hands.”</p>

<p>There was some doubt in the translation of <persName>V V</persName>’s statement whether his hands had been <lb/>

    <pb facs="liv_020059_0077" n="0077"/>
<fw><seg rend="center">77</seg></fw>
cut with a knife; but later inquiry established that they fell off through the tightness of the 
<term type="collective">native</term> rope and the beating of them by the soldiers with their rifle-butts.</p>

<p>On the <date when="1903-08-14">14th August</date><!-- Not sure about year -->, I again visited the <orgName>State</orgName> camp at <settlement>Irebu</settlement>, where, in the course of 
con<!-- - --> versation with the officer in command, I made passing but intentional reference to the fact that 
I had seen <persName>V V</persName>, and had heard his story from himself.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I added that from the boy’s statement 
it would seem that the loss of his hands was directly attributable to an officer who was apparently 
close at hand and in command of the soldiers at the time.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I added that I had heard of other 
cases in the neighbourhood.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The Commandant at once informed me that such things were 
impossible, but that in this specific case of <persName>V V</persName> he should cause inquiry to be instantly made.</p>

<p>On my return from the <geogName>Lulongo River</geogName> I found that this remark in passing conversation had 
borne instant fruit, although previous appeals on behalf of the boy had proved unsuccessful.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
The <persName>Commissaire-Général of the <region>Equator District</region></persName> had, learning of it, at once proceeded to <geogName>Lake 
Mantumba</geogName>, and a judicial investigation as to how <persName>V V</persName> lost his hands had been immediately 
instituted.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The boy was taken to <settlement>Bikoro</settlement>, and I have since been informed that provision has 
been made for him and a weekly allowance.</p>

<p>When at the village of <settlement>B C*</settlement>, I had found there a boy of not more than 12 years of age 
with the right hand gone.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This child, in answer to my inquiries, said that the hand had been 
cut off by the <term type="collective"><orgName>Government</orgName> soldiers</term> some years before.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He could not say how long before, but 
judging from the height he indicated he could not then have been more than 7 years of age 
if now 12.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His statement was fully confirmed by <persName>S S S</persName> and his relatives, who stood around him 
while I questioned him.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The soldiers had come to <settlement>B C*</settlement> from <settlement>Coquilhatville</settlement> by land through the 
forest.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They were led by an officer whose name was given as “<persName>U V</persName>.”<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>His father and mother 
were killed beside him.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He saw them killed, and a bullet hit him and he fell.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He here showed 
me a deep cicatrized scar at the back of the head, just at the nape of the neck, and said it was 
there the bullet had struck him.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He fell down, presumably insensible, but came to his senses 
while his hand was being hacked off at the wrist.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I asked him how it was he could possibly lie 
silent and give no sign.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He answered that he felt the cutting, but was afraid to move, knowing that 
he would be killed if he showed any sign of life.</p>

<p>I made some provision for this boy.</p>

<p>The names of six other persons mutilated in a similar way were given to me.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The last of 
these, an old woman, had died only a few months previously, and her niece stated that her 
aunt had often told her how she came to lose her hand.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The town had been attacked by 
<term type="collective"><orgName>Government</orgName> troops</term> and all had fled, pursued into the forest.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>This old woman (whose name was 
<persName>V W</persName>) had fled with her son, when he fell shot dead, and she herself fell down beside him&#8212;she 
supposed she fainted.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>She then felt her hand being cut off, but had made no sign.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When all 
was quiet and the soldiers had gone, she found her son’s dead body beside her with one hand 
cut off and her own also taken away.</p>

<p>Of acts of persistent mutilation by <term type="collective"><orgName>Government</orgName> soldiers</term> of this nature I had many statements 
made to me, some of them specifically, others in a general way.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Of the fact of this mutilation and 
the causes inducing it there can be no shadow of doubt.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>It was not a <term type="collective">native</term> custom prior to the 
coming of the <term type="collective">white man</term>; it was not the outcome of the primitive instincts of savages in their 
fights between village and village; it was the deliberate act of the soldiers of a <orgName><term type="collective">European</term> 
Administration</orgName>, and these men themselves never made any concealment that in committing 
these acts they were but obeying the positive orders of their superiors.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>I obtained several specific 
instances of this practice of mutilation having been carried out in the town of <settlement>Q*</settlement> itself, when 
the <term type="collective"><orgName>Government</orgName> soldiers</term> had come across from <settlement>P*</settlement> to raid it or compel its inhabitants to work.</p>
