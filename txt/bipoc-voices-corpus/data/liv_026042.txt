A Negro Clergyman at Nazareth.
WE mentioned
some months
ago that the
Rev. Henry
Johnson, one
of the Sierra Leone Native
clergy, was studying Arabic
in Palestine, with a view to
cope with the active Mohammedan
emissaries who
are trying to spread their
blighting faith—if such a
fatalistic system can be
called a "faith"—in West
Africa. Mr. Johnson has
spent most of his time in
Jersualem, where he could
have competent teachers;
but he lately made a tour
northward to recruit his
health. His impressions
of Nazareth and the Mission
there will interest our 
readers:—
Night had closed in upon
us when we arrived at Nazareth. Nothing could have been
more lovely than the peculiar
brilliancy of the moon that
night. She wanted but wo
days to the full. Our way being diversified by alternations
of hill and dale, the ride proved
extremely interesting. Now,
the moon is shaded by a hill,
now she bursts upon us with
increased lustre, and so she
continued playing at bo-peep
with us as it were: the effect
was strikingly beautiful. At
about a quarter past seven P.M. I was safely lodged under the hospitable
roof of Mr. Zeller.
Nazareth impressed me most favourably. I could wish I had had a
longer time to spend there, that I might have studied for myself the manners and customs of the
inhabitants, and form my own theories and conclusions. But this I hope yet to do at some future
occasion.
I made no excursions to places which are easily accessible from Nazareth, as, not being
sufficiently strong, I did not consider it prudent to
yield to the temptation, lest I should have a relapse. The next best thing
I did was to ascend with Mr. Zeller and Mr. Huber one of the hills by
which Nazareth is encompassed, and from the highest point I gained a
most delightful panoramic view of a large extent of country. Mount
Tabor, raising majestically above other hills, first attracted my attention.
Then at a distance I saw Mount Gilboa. From another point I could take
in nearly the whole range of Carmel. The great plain of Esdrealon, reaching far, was distinctly
visible; and several places were pointed out, but I
could not exactly take all in at the moment, confused as I was by the
new character in which the Bible history appeared to my wondering
gaze.
During my stay I had an opportunity of seeing together many of the
members of Mr. Zeller's congregation. His Sunday Bible-class was converted into a kind of
missionary meeting, at which I was present to give
an account of the work of the Society in West Africa. The meeting was
quite packed, and all seemed much interested in hearing the accounts I
gave of the wonders which God has wrought by His servants amongst a
once degraded people. Mr. Huber, formerly a missionary at Badagry,
interpreted my address. Mr. Huber still retains a strong affection for
Africa; and never is he more interested or more communicative than
when conversation turns upon Missions in West Africa.
The earnest attention paid by the people to the
address—their hearty
and harmonious singing—their devout attitude when prayers were being
offered up—all struck me forcibly, and convinced me of the real work
that is being carried on at Nazareth, amid discouraging influences of
various kinds. On another occasion I met the women of Mr. Zeller's
sewing-party, to whom I made a few remarks.
The day before I left I was privileged to see another most deeply interesting department of the
Society's work. I accompanied Mr. Zeller
to the schools to witness an examination of the children. First of all I
was taken to the Preparandi students. They were examined in Scripture,
grammar, and geography. I was quite pleased to observe how thoughtfully they answered the
questions put to them. Evidently they had been
taught to think before speaking, and hence they appeared to know what
they were about. After a good hour's catechising, they took up their
violins, and three of them performed most creditably on the instrument.
We went next to the boy's day-school. There were nearly 100 children present, the countenances
of many of whom wore marks of high
intelligence. The examination was conducted partly by Mr. Zeller, and
partly by the native deacon and the schoolmaster. It was soon manifest
to me that Scripture was the children's forte. The first class astonished
me by giving, with hardly the slightest perceptible hesitation, the con-
tents of each chapter of the Gospel of St. Luke and the Acts of the
Apostles. It is a fact which I fancy many who are older than they can
never perform with even an approximate readiness. Of course everything
was done in Arabic. Pointing out places on the map of America was
another branch of their performances. To make matters short—the children showed off most
creditably, and no one could have witnessed the examination without feeling inclined to give a
just need of praise to the
teachers, who have evidently been doing their doty. As an old school-
master myself, I know the nature of the difficulties which have first to be
overcome before pupils are sufficiently presentable to the critical eye of
strangers. We finished by paying a visit to the infant school. I have
already said that I was pleased with Nazareth; I was not at all disappointed at its appearance.
At Nazareth He was brought up who came down from heaven for our
salvation. That retired spot was well suited to Him for preserving an
absolute obscurity while the period of preparation lasted. I tried now and
then to abstract my thoughts from present local surroundings, in order to
fix them upon scenes and objects painted by the imagination as probably those amid which He had
lived and moved. I did not require adventitious aids such as those with Franciscan monks were
ready
to supply out of the Church of the Annunciation (so called) to kindle
emotion, or to deepen a pious and reverential feeling for the home of the
despised Nazarene. I came away after a brief stay of three days, full of
thankfulness for the privilege I had enjoyed of visiting a spot which, for
sacred associations, takes its rank among such places as Bethlehem and
Capernaum and Jerusalem—places which have derived their importance
principally from events that occurred in them at various periods of the
Saviour's life.
As regards the Society's work which is being carried on by their faithful
missionaries, I can speak, with my limited means of observation, in terms of
the highest encouragement. Considering the adverse influences at work,
one is surprised to find that instead of being altogether neutralised, the
work is daily gaining a fresh accession of strength. Schools are a great
instrument of good in Mission work, as I can testify from experience;
and therefore I look forward without any misgivings to the future of
the work at Nazareth. The instruments which are being imparted to the
children are solid in character, and much leavened with the moral teachings of a pure Gospel,
and therefore, under God's blessing, success must
follow. I do not pretend that there is not much to discourage the heart
of the earnest missionary. It will not be supposed that I have been de-
scribing a Utopian state of perfection. No; on the contrary, the object
of my remarks is simply to show that there being so many features of
hopeful interest apparent, efforts should be more earnestly and willingly
put forth to extend and consolidate the work, both at Nazareth itself and
in the out-stations, that so, instead of being confined, the blessing may
reach the many thousands who are still ignorant of the redemption
wrought out long ago by the Saviour in this land of His birth, His
sufferings, and His death.  HENRY JOHNSON.
