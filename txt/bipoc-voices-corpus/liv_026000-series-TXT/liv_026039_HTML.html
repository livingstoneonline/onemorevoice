  <p>From Devon, Mr. Budd writes in 1872:�</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">"I am thankful to be able
    to say, that if the Devon
    Indians are improving in their
    temporal condition, they are,
    I humbly trust, no less im-
    proving in their spiritual. If
    we may judge of the tree by
    its fruit, I witness enough to make me hope that they are
    growing in the Divine life,
    and increasing in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
    An increasing thirst for the
    Word of God is manifest by
    their regular attendance on
    the preached Word; their
    punctual attendance on all the
    means of grace; as well by the
    labour and toil they will take
    in travelling so far in the cold
    and snow to be present at each
    returning Sacrament day.
    Christ Church tells that the
    population in Devon is growing; it is sometimes full to
    overflowing. The regularity
    of the responses in the services, and the hearty singing,
    show that the congregation
    understand and value the services. The Cumberland House
    Indians have begun to build
    houses for themselves like the Devon Indians. Here they assemble on
    Sundays, and, as many of them can read in their own language, they have
    their books both Prayer-book and the New Testament, and can hold
    regular services among themselves."</p>
