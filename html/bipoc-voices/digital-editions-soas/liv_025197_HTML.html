  <h5 style="text-align:center;"><em>Letter from Rev. Charles Pamla to Rev. W. B. Boyce, dated
      Fernley, Tsomo, July 26th, 1872.</em></h5>
  <p>It is scarcely four months since I have been sent to this station, and the Lord has owned my
    labours here; a hundred and eighty heathens have been converted in my Circuit. More than one
    hundred is composed of adults, and the rest young people. We have been going from kraal to kraal
    in gathering these: one native chief and his family has been brought in, and many of his
    councillors.</p>
  <p>I visited about thirty kraals. And we had services morning and evening, and preached, and held
    prayer-meetings, from hut to hut, and many out-door services. Hundreds of the heathen came to
    hear us, and after these services in the day-time, we had a great deal of talk about Jesus,
    telling them how God loved the world, and gave His only Son to save sinners. Many of them broke
    into tears, and came forward as penitents; and after a long struggling in tears, they at last
    found their Saviour, and rejoiced with an unspeakable joy. The Europeans are very thinly
    scattered in this territory, but there are eight added to the Society since my coming here.</p>
  <p>I hold a service in English occasionally for the Europeans at their own request. I have formed
    an English class, which I meet in the Mission house, which is composed of ten members at
    present. Some of these express their joy now in the Saviour, who have also showed their regret
    and repentance by coming forward as penitents along with the natives during the service, and
    were not ashamed to confess Christ before men.</p>
