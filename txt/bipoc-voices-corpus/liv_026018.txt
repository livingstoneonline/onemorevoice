  TAMAHANA TE HAUPARAHA.
  [...]
  
    My heart said, "What shall I do for my people to make them work, not
      to be too much idle? For if they were idle, then there would be too much
      talk, and fights would come."&#8212;When I was at Auckland, I had read
      about Peter the Great, king of Russia, who learned to work that he might
      teach his people. My heart had thought I should be like him.&#8212;Then
      I had a meeting after prayers in the evening. Many people came.
      I said to my people, "It is the wish of my heart to make a town like the
      white man's." then they said, "It will be very hard. We cannot do it."
      But I said, "The English have only two hands, and two feet, and one
      heart; not four hands, or four feet. We, also, have the same number.
      The only difference between us is, that their skin is white. Let us try."
      Martyn* said so too, and another chief. Then the
      people said, "Very
      well." I said, "Let us build the church first, then our houses. God's
      house first, man's the second, then He will bless our work." My people
      said, "Very well." Then I said, "Go and cut the wood." They went,
      and I went too. We had no minister then. He was sick at Wellington.
      God alone was our minister. We finished the church. It was but a
      little one; not the large one my father had begun. Then my people
      began to make their own houses. But some liked to stay in the old pa, in
      their little dirty houses, and not come to the new town; so I burned all
      the old houses in the old pa. It was a very great fire. The flames rose
      up high: the people cried when they saw them, but I did not. I was
      very happy to burn all the bad ways. I told them not to make little
      houses, Maori way, but like English, with two rooms and a chimney, and
      only one family to live in one house. Then I built my house.<a href="#note2"
        id="note2back">* I made
      four rooms, two down stairs and two up stairs. It was made English
      way, with Maori carving. All the English liked my house, but I do
      not like to talk about it, lest it should seem proud. Then all the people
      made their houses English way. It was the first time a Maori town had
      been built English way.
    
    Then I began to think again. I thought, "What shall I do?
      The town is finished, the church is finished, the houses of the
      people are finished. What shall I do?" I thought, "I will go and
      buy a cow." We had no cows then. It took a great deal of money
      to buy a cow at that time. I sold some land to the English, and
      my friends lent me some money the English had given them for making
      the road. Then I went to Wellington to buy a cow. When my people
      saw my cow they laughed. They said I was proud, taking the English
      ways. I said, "Never mind, you will see." By-and-bye the cow had a calf.
      Then I thought very much. I said, "What shall I do? I do not know how
      to make milk or butter, but I will try." So I got some flax and made a
      strong rope, and I caught hold of the cow, and tied it round her horns, and
      tied her very tight to a tree. My people feared the cow very much: they
      all ran away. I milked the cow: I milked her every day, for there was
      no one else who could do it then. Then I thought, "How shall I make
      butter?" There were no English to teach me, and I did not know how. I
      thought very much, and I prayed to God to help me. I had read, in a
      newspaper, that one way to make butter was to tie the milk up in calico,
      and put it in the ground; but I feared to do that, lest it should get dirty.
      Then I thought of a bottle. I found one, and I put the milk into it. I
      shook, shook very long, till I was tired. Then I gave it to my wife. She
      shook, then she grew tired, then I shook again&#8212;a long time. The afternoon
      came, and the sun began to go down, but the butter did not come.
      Then I was very sorry. I thought, "This cannot be the right way, it is
      so long." But then, at last the butter came, and we all laughed, and
      were very happy. Then Ruta [Ruth, his wife] put it in water, and made
      it all right.

      a Missionary, received the gospel, and was afterwards baptized, with Tamahana, by the name of
