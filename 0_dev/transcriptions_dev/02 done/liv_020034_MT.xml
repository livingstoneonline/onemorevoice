                        minds of all present, and after due deliberation, a Mission, to consist of
                        native teachers, was resolved upon. The accomplishment of this benevolent
                        design, with the preparatory proceedins, is described in letters received
                        under various dates from teh <persName>Rev. James Read</persName>. His first
                        allusion to the subject, contained in a letter dated in May last, is as

                        of efforts of a similar kind on behalf of a number of natives belonging to
                        the <term type="collective">Tambookie</term> tribe of <term
                            type="collective">Caffres</term> :&#8212;</p>
                    <p>In a former communication, I mentioned the desire some of our people had
                        expressed to do something for the poor <term type="collective"
                            >Bushmen</term>, <term type="collective">Tambookies</term>, &amp;c. They
                        had intended to execute their wishes long before the present time, but the
                        measles retarded the undertaking. Now, however, by the blessing of God,
                        nearly all in the settlement who had been affected by this disorder have
                        recovered, and the first thing to be attempted is the accomplishment of this
                        work. Four native brethren have been
                        chosen,<!-- Do we need to add a persName here to indicate that there's a reference to four people, even though they are unnamed? MT -->
                        two for the <term type="collective">Bushmen</term>, and two for the <term
                            type="collective">Tambookie</term> Chief,
                            <persName>Kallagalla</persName>. With those for the <term
                            type="collective">Bushmen</term>, four native brethren will be
                        associated as assistants, to be employed in cultivating the ground, building
                        houses, &amp;c. The first thing thought of, after the Bible and
                        Missionaries, was a plough; the Bible in one hand, and the plough in the
                        other. It is by such means as these the curse is removed, the earth yields
                        her increase, the thorn and brier is not only figuratively but literally
                        removed; and if the fir-tree and myrtle do not come up in their place, we
                        shall have the peach, apple, fig, pear, and grape.</p>
                    <p>To obtain the plough a subscription was proposed, and one engaged to give a
                        plough-share<!-- not sure if this is one word or italicized because of the line break. MT -->,
                        another the coulter, another the wheels; others contributed other parts, and
                        now the plough is standing ready. Considerable interest has been excited,
                        and although our people are suffering greatly from poverty, partly from the
                        effects of the late war, and partly from the failure of their last harvest,
                        yet they have given, we may say, beyond their power; all seemed ansious to
                        bring a small offering for the brethren and the <term type="collective"

                        descriptions, such as seed, wheat, barley, <term type="collective"

                        field-cornet, and others, will accompany them to see them settled, assit
                        them in putting up temporary houses, getting out the water, ploughing,
                        &amp;c. It is just the time for ploughing and sowing. Thus we are
                        lengthening our cords as well as strengthening our stakes, and we trust we
                        shall <unclear><!-- have no idea what this word is. MT --></unclear>out on
                        the right hand and on the left.</p>
                    <p>In almost every portion of the Missionary field there are indications of the

                        <seg rend="right">51</seg> importance of native agency. The value of that
                        agency, wherever pains have been betowed in preparing it, is seen in the
                        gratifying results which have hitherto attended it. Already much has been
                        effected by this species of instrumentality in the <region>South
                            Seas</region><!-- or bloc? -->; and we trust, ere long, to witness far
                        larger and more delightful results from the augmented attention now being
                        paid by our Missionary brethren to the training of teachers from among their
                        converst, so that the piety and talent of their churches may be called forth
                        and suitably applied. It is a source of rejoicing that <bloc>Africa</bloc>
                        is also yeilding her share of similar fruits. The annexed plate is inteded
                        to represent a highly delightful and exhibilarting scene, as described by
                        the <persName>Rev. Mr. Read</persName>, of the <settlement><geogName>Kat
                                River</geogName> settlement</settlement>.
                            <persName>Boosman</persName>, an old <term type="collective"
                            >Hottentot</term> disciple, had been introduced to
                            <persName>Kallagalla</persName>, a <term type="collective"
                            >Tambookie</term> Chief, and after opening his heart, full of holly
                        affection adn ardent aspirations, he followed the Chief. We give the scene
                        in <persName>Mr. Read</persName>'s own graphic language :&#8212;</p>
                    <p>I returned from my journey the day before yesterday; by the blessing of God I was able to accomplish all we wished and prayed for. We left two native teachers with <persName>Kallagalla</persName>, the <term type="collective">Tambookie</term> chief, on the <geogName>Kei River</geogName>; we left them without gold or silver, <unclear cert="low">purse</unclear> or scrip, or two coats, without a wagon, and with only about a pail of millet, and a pound of coffee. They had no expectation of getting any thing from the <term type="collective">Tambookies</term>. You would have been pleased with the first interview. <persName>Boosman</persName>, one of the teachers, and old <term type="collective">Hottentot</term> disciple, wept when he saw <persName>Kallagalla</persName>, and said, "<persName>Kallagalla</persName>, my heart opens now that I see you; I thank God that he has brought me to you, and I give myself up to serve you; where you flee I'll flee, whether in the mountain, plain, or river; where you die I am ready to die. I am come to you to show you and your people the way to heaven, and you can know by me that God is no respecter of persons; for as you see I am one of the most despicable and unseemly of mankind, but God has opened my heart and given me to see the way of salvation through Jesus Christ his Son, and now my desire is that you and all men may hear the joyful news and be saved." <hi rend="italic">I shall never forget his leaving us, trudging after the chief with his blanket on his shoulders, and sincing and weeping as he went.</hi></p>
                    <p>Three weeks after, on our return to the place, we found them labouring in season and out of season, going from <foreign xml:lang="af">kraal</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="af">kraal</foreign>, making known the Saviour. <persName>Kallagalla</persName> wishes to have the water out upon his ground. I hope our people will assist him.</p>
                    <p>We went on forty miles further, but on account of the state of the country did not succeed in finding the <term type="collective">Bushman</term> Chief, <persName>Madoor</persName>, in less than twelve days, but we fixed upon a spot, and commenced working; for although we have have not a Missionary ship, we have a Missionary plough, and hope at last to have a Missionary wagon. We got out the water from a fountain, cultivated a large extent of land, sowed a half a sack of ppotatoes, some barley, wheat, beans, peas, <term type="collective">Caffre</term>-corn, and millet, all for the poor <term type="collective">Bushmen</term>. I never worked harder in my life, nor with greater pleasure. You might have seen me sometimes with the axe, sometimes with the spade, and sometimes holding the plough, and I had strength equal to my day. We built two temporary houses. At last <persName>Madoor</persName> and some of his people made their appearance, and the <persName>Queen of Sheba</persName> could scarcely be more happily surprised than <persName>Madoor</persName> was, at seeing what was doing for him. Next morning we dressed him in a suit of clothes, which the people of <settlement><geogName>Kat River</geogName></settlement><!-- collective here? MT --> had sent for him, and he at once underwent a most pleasing transformation, and appeared delighted beyond measure. "I always said," observed <persName>Madoor</persName>, "that I had friends who would one day make their appearance."</p>
                    <p>We left him three native brethren, and a boy, one as a native teacher, and two to cultivate the land, build houses, &amp;c. We left them with few clothes, little food, no wagon, and wanting many things which an <term type="collective">English</term> Missionary would require. May the Lord follow up with his blessing our poor weak endeavours.</p>
                    <p>I had a pious band with me. We had prayer-meetings morning and evening, and our great <persName>Zerubbabel</persName> made mountains become plains. Simply as we go to work, this undertaking costs us considerably more than we can spare. I hope you will set a subscription on foot for us to help this good work.</p>
