PREFACE
Much of the oral native philosophy is too plain
and therefore too frank for civilised ears. This is
particularly true in regard to some of the proverbs
relating to the relation between men and women.
In this collection, sayings of that class are carefully
omitted. This omission is not inconsistent with
primitive Sechuana custom. Old people never
mentioned such sayings in the presence of youth or
of uncircumcised adults, whom they always classed
with the children.
It is the author's belief that had these aphorisms
been collected thirty years ago, this book could have
been enlarged to nearly three times its size. With
the spread of European speech and thought in South
Africa, these primitive saws are fast being forgotten,
and in order to arrest this process, the author appeals
to all students of Sechuana to:—
(a) communicate to him any Sechuana proverbs
known to them which are not included in this book;
(5) point out errors (if any) in the translations, or
wrong readings in the originals; and

PREFACE
(c) draw his attention to any European proverbs
which would be better equivalents to the correspond-
ing Sechuana proverbs given in this book.
When it is borne in mind that I wrote the book in
England, where there was no one versed in the lan-
guage to whom I could go for advice, this request
will I hope be found reasonable.
That there are many more unrecorded proverbs I
have no doubt. For it will be observed that many
of the maxims in this collection are of pastoral
origin and refer to all kinds of game; yet (with the
exception of the allegorical reference to the buffalo in
No. 490) I cannot recall any proverbs referring to
the Nare (Buffalo), the Phofu (Eland), the Kukama
(Oryx) and the Tshephe (Springbok). The meat
of these animals in the early days was a "feast of
the gods" among the Bechuana, who had various
ingenious ways of preparing it.
The skin of the last-named antelope was used for
carrying babies on the backs of their mothers or
their nurse-maids, and also as mats or as grain bags.
The hides of the other three beasts were applied to
several domestic uses, including mats, milk-sacks,
sandals, whips, shields, ropes, etc., so that they were

indispensable in the indoor and outdoor activities of
the Bechuana.
The Phofu, in addition, has a huge lump of kidney
fat for which Bechuana herbalists paid a very high
price, using the suet for mixing medicine.
These proverbs pay much attention to less useful
game (vide Nos. 71-77, also 580-590 and 643-651
etc.) and it seems incredible that such useful animals
of other days as the above-named four could have
entirely escaped proverbial notice.
Any information on the subject will be gratefully
received by the author.
In searching for equivalents I have profitably
consulted the following works, viz.,—
National Proverbs (Palmer): England and France;
Wood's Dictionary of Quotations;
Barton's Collection of English and German Pro-
verbs;
Ruebenkampf's 1,200 der gebr&uchlichsten Franzosi-
schen Sprichw&rter.
Hazlitt's English Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases;
Harbottle's Dictionary of Latin Quotations;
Wander's Deutsches Sprichworter-Lexikon; and
The British Empire Universities Modern English
Illustrated Dictionary.
The result will I hope serve the additional purpose

INTRODUCTION
MAFOKO A PELE
The Bechuana.
The object of this book is to save from oblivion,
as far as this can still be done, the proverbial ex-
pressions of the Bechuana people, who inhabit the
Bechuanaland Protectorate, Southern Rhodesia, the
Northern Divisions of Cape Colony, including Griqua-
land West, the whole of the Orange Free State and
the Western half of the Transvaal.
According to traditions, the Bechuana migrated
from the far interior during the fifteenth century.
Some Central African places, hundreds of miles
north of Bechuanaland, now occupied by tribes
speaking entirely different languages, bear such
Sechuana names as Naka-tsa-Pudi (Goat's-horns)
and Mosi-oa-Thunya (the smoke explodes).
Their Disposition and Habits.
Historians describe the Bechuana as the most
peace-loving and timid section of the Bantu. Their
statements, however, do not seem to be quite in
accord with the facts; for, fighting their way south,
from the Central African lakes, some of the Bechuana

tribes became known as "The People with the
Sharp-spear." And if I am not much mistaken
they were the only Natives who indignantly, though
vainly, protested against the South African Defence
Act which debars Native citizens from joining the
Citizen Volunteer Force.
Before the annexation of Bechuanaland to the
Empire, a British Commissioner reported as follows
to the War Office concerning one Bechuana trit>e—
the Barolong:—
"They are by nature far from being bellicose. They
only desire to be left alone to cultivate their land,
tend their stock and hunt in the Kalahari Desert.
A great proportion of them have assumed garments
of European cut, missionary work has been actively
prosecuted amongst the Bechuana and numbers
are now professing Christians. They are represented
as apt scholars, and generally as being morally and
intellectually superior to the native tribes of the
coast."—6?. B. and I. War Office.
As if to modify his information regarding the
peaceful habits of the Bechuana, the same officer
further says: "The Chief Montsioa was said in
1880 to be able to put in the field 800 well equipped
horsemen."
But the proverbial phrases in this book do seem

The next Sechuana paper was Mahoho a Becwana
(the Bechuana News), a monthly review of current
news and religious comments. It was issued by the
Mission Press at the Kuruman Moffat Institute and
ran successfully for a number of years. The Revs.
A. J. Gould, R. Price, John Brown and various
other agents of the London Missionary Society each
succeeded to the editorship, and the little sheet
increased in size and popularity until it became a
fair-sized periodical with a very smart cover. During
the first week of each month the native peasants
in Bechuanaland, and elsewhere, used to look for-
ward to its arrival as eagerly as the white up-country
farmers now await the arrival of the daily papers.
How little did the writer dream, when frequently
called upon as a boy to read the news to groups of
men sewing karosses under the shady trees outside
the cattle fold, that journalism would afterwards
mean his bread and cheese.
The Lutherans subsequently started a monthly
which ran under the editorship of Revs. W. Behrens,
L. Meyer and other missionaries at Bethanie (Trans-
vaal). Its title is Moshupa-tsela (The Guide), and
I believe that the Rev. R. Tonsing, a young Mis-
sionary who grew up among the Bechuana, is the
present editor.

SECHUANA PROVERBS
The first native-owned paper was Koranta ea
Becoana (the Bechuana Gazette) founded by Chief
Silas Molema in 1901. It appeared weekly, was printed
partly in English and ran for seven years at Mafeking.
Chief Molema has the distinction of being the first
Mochuana who started a day-school in Bechuanaland,
teaching Natives to read and write English. He
opened his school in 1878 and conducted it alone
in the native chapel, started by his father, until the
Wesleyan Mission took it over, ten years later, and

"It is said that an English peasant uses a voca-

shepherd uses at least 4,000. His language possesses

and to convey any message upon matters which
affect mankind in common."
The comparison here is perhaps not quite fair to
the European. For it must be remembered that the
breeding and tending of cattle is the occupation
most honoured among the Bechuana, and that those
who follow it command a large vocabulary, not
merely because they are shepherds (though, as such,
they are familiar with an enormous number of
technical terms), but because they are likely to be
the most intelligent and the best informed members
of the community, rather than the reverse. In the
days when neither schools nor books existed in the
country, they would acquire this vocabulary—and
learn to use it with purity and correctness, from their
parents, and especially from their mothers,
k The best Sechuana speakers known to me owe
their knowledge to the teachings of a grandmother,
or a mother, or both, just as I myself, as a pioneer
Sechuana journalist and translator, am indebted
to the teachings of my mother and two aunts. Again,
most of the prominent Bechuana have, like myself,
been shepherds for some period of their lives, if not
the whole.

A reference to the following pages will show that
most of the proverbs originated on the pastures
or the hunting-field, and the wealth of the Sechuana
vocabulary lies in the same direction. For instance,
one can easily translate into Sechuana such outdoor
phrases as " a group of boys," "a band of harvest-
ers," " a herd of cattle," " a flock of sheep and goats,"
"a flock of springbok," "a troop of hartebeest,"
and "a herd of wildebeest." In addition to the
regular translation of these phrases, they are ordin-
arily referred to in such short nouns of multitude as
thakana, letsema, matlhape, marele, serapa, lotlhaka
and bodumo respectively. But the moment we
leave these concrete objects on the veld and seek
to express abstract ideas, the elasticity is at an end,
and the poverty of the language comes painfully into
prominence. But it is a fact that notwithstanding
its shortcomings, Sechuana is not only fully equipped
for the expression of thought, but that it also includes
proverbial sayings that find close parallel even in
European folk-lore.

Further Comparisons.
The similarity between all pastoral nations is such
that some passages in the history of the Jews read
uncommonly like a description of the Bechuana
during the nineteenth century. In the Psalms the
similarity is so emphasized that it seems difficult
at times to persuade oneself that the writer was not
a Mochuana, e.g. Psalm 144. 11-14 and numerous
other passages. The same thing may be said of the
stories of the Patriarchs contained in the Pentateuch.
The late Bishop Colenso once wrote as follows in
reference to his translation of the Bible into Zulu :—
"Some of these difficulties would only occur to
one in the same position as myself, engaged as a
Missionary in translating the Scriptures, and, there-
fore, compelled to discuss all the minutest details
with intelligent Natives, whose mode of life and habits
and even the nature of their country so nearly corre-
spond to those of the ancient Israelites, that the very
scenes are brought continually, as it were, before
their eyes and vividly realized in a way in which an
English student would scarcely think of looking at them.1

The whole truth about a fact cannot always be
summed up in one pithy saying. It may have
several different aspects, which, taken separately,
seem to be contradictory and have to be considered
in connexion with their surrounding circumstances.
To explain this connexion is the work of a sermon
or essay, not of a proverb. All the latter can do is
to express each aspect by itself and let them balance
each other.
Sechuana Orthography.
One difficult point in regard to this language is
presented by its different systems of orthography.
These are five. We have firstly an Anglican spelling
of Sechuana; secondly, a Congregational; thirdly,
a Lutheran, and fourthly, a Wesleyan, besides the
fifth spelling of Sechuana used by the Natives
in their own newspapers. The Natives cannot under-
stand why the missionaries who have perfected the
orthography of the Zulu, Xosa, Suto and Pedi—
other Bantu languages in the same sub-continent—
cannot agree upon the orthography of this particular
one. They all seem unanimous on one point only,
that it should be written with twenty letters of the
alphabet, using some of these twenty letters to

represent more than one sound. The confusion is
not diminished by the action of some missionaries
in Bechuan&land who are, it seems, trying to ignore
the Native Press, including Sechuana papers which
are not only encouraged, but also found helpful by
missionaries in Zululand, Kaffraria and Basuto-
land.
It is hard to see how the Bechuanas, who do not
number much more than a quarter of a million, can
be benefited by learning to write their language
in five different ways. In fact we have more than
five, for the Lutherans on the south bank of the Yaal
use Berlin Sechuana books, and those on the north
bank use Hermannsburg Sechuana books. On cross-
ing the Vaal, a Lutheran Mochuana finds his hymn-
book utterly useless; and as translations of the
same well-known hymns differ not only in spelling
but also in the wording, a good memory is not of
much help to him.
How different from the European churches in
the same country, where visitors are not only pro-
vided with free hymn-books, but have the added
satisfaction of singing their own familiar hymns in
an Anglican, Baptist, Congregational or Methodist
church in the same metre, the same rendering, the
same orthography and the same number of verses.

It is comforting to know that this anomaly is con-
fined to Sechuana and that Zulu, Xosa and Basuto
worshippers have no such worry. That beautiful
and elastic South African language—the Xosa—
is the result of a blending together of various dialects,
co-ordinated by means of one common orthography.
The work was carried out by missionary writers
with native assistance. Sesuto literature also owes
its present state of perfection to native co-operation
with the missionary bodies working in Basutoland.
It seems that the confusion in Sechuana is going
to be a lasting one. A few years ago some mission-
aries gathered to take the initial steps towards co-
ordination and co-operation in the output of Sechuana
literature, beginning with a common orthography.
This was a praiseworthy act, as the present confusion,
by dissipating energy, is apt to hamper missionary
enterprise among Sechuana-speaking Natives. They
invited the author to attend their conference and
give his advice; but when the fact was announced,
a sharp letter came from London regretting that the
missionary agents had invited the author to have a
say in the deliberations over the method of writing
his own language.
This ignoring of intelligent Natives in a discussion
concerned with their language is responsible for the

deplorable fact that Sechuana is systematically
"murdered" in those day schools where the verna-
cular is taught. The head teacher is usually the
white missionary, who, even if a good linguist must,
except in rare cases, have the accent and use the
idiom of a foreigner, and the pupils invariably drop
their mothers' accent and speak the language "as
teacher speaks it." In the course of time, when it is
decided to impart the language through native
tutors, the latter will all be speaking a kind of
"School Sechuana " with accents varying according
to their tuition, but all equally alien to native speech.
Basuto and the Letter "R"
This is well exemplified in the case of the Sesuto
language. The Basuto, who have benefited morally
and intellectually from Continental missionary enter-
prise, have now adopted the uvular " r" instead of
the lingual " r." They have caught this pronuncia-
tion from the French and Swiss missionaries of the
Paris Evangelical Mission. This change of pro-
nunciation has spread so rapidly that at the present
time—less than 80 years after this mission com-
menced work in Basutoland—the majority of Basuto
(quite half the older generation and nearly all the
younger Basuto) have adopted it.
