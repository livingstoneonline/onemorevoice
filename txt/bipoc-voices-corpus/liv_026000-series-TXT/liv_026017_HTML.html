<h5 style="text-align:center;'">THE DAHOMIANS.</h5>
<p>My grandfather was no warrior, and only enlarged his dominions by 
conquering one kingdom; my father, nine; but my brother fought 79 
battles, in which he subdued several petty kingdoms; and I myself have 
fought 209, in which I subdued many great kings and kingdoms. In 
my brother's reign the king of Weemia, and his army of several hundred 
thousands, were destroyed, myself being then head general. The king's 
head we have preserved to this day, with flesh and hair on; the heads of 
his generals we distinguished by giving them places on each side of the 
doors of our fetish houses; those of his captains have paved all before 
the doors; and the heads of the common soldiers we have set round the 
walls of the palace of our ancestors, as close as they can lie, being in 
circumference about three miles.</p></div>
