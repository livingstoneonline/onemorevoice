						<p>The Craft family watched and waited as civil war unfolded across the Atlantic in the United States. In 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, and a US victory over the Confederacy soon followed in 1865. William and Ellen decided to return to their home country with their large family in tow. William Ivens stayed behind to complete his schooling, and passed the exam for Cambridge University – news that made headlines across the Atlantic. He represented to both newly freed African Americans and their white supporters the potential for advancement were Black men and women given the opportunity.</p>

						<p>In November of 1865, Ellen’s mother Maria traveled to England – to much regard from the press on both sides of the Atlantic. The monthly London <em>Freed-Man</em> described the emotional reunion at the Great Northern station, King’s Cross, between mother and daughter. Ellen brought one of her own children to meet their grandmother for the first time:</p>

						<p p class="leftmargin">An anxious trembling pale-cased lady-like woman, with a little boy by her side, having more of the dusky shadow on his brow than his mother, met that parent so dear to them, who seemed like one risen from the dead. (Anonymous 1865)</p>
							
						<p>Maintaining an expanding family proved difficult for the Crafts, however. Although proximal to the monied elite in England, the Crafts themselves were not endowed with intergenerational capital and status. As a result, William and Ellen were forced to give up their home at 12 Cambridge Road and move to Shepherd’s Bush by late 1867 (Anonymous 1989; Craft 1867).</p>

This map of London, circa 1863, depicts the location of the Craft home at 4 Lawn Place in the Shepherd’s Bush neighborhood, just west of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. Unlike today, the area in 1867 was sparesly populated.</p>

						<p>In 1868 they were living in Brixton, at 124 Stockwell Park Road, where Ellen gave birth to another daughter, Mary (Green 2018, 27). By early 1869, they had moved again to 5 Atkinson Place, Brixton Road (Craft 1868; Clark 2023c). The couple “had been thrust into this English upper-class environment for which neither their background nor their income had prepared them,” writes scholar Dorothy Sterling. “[E]ager to stand on his own feet,” Sterling asks (1988, 44), “[h]ow was William to earn a living appropriate to their new station in life?”</p>

The building that houses the current Black Cultural Archives (BCA) in Brixton, London, in 2023. That the BCA are located in Brixton speaks to the importance of the neighborhood and community to the history of Black Britons.</p>

						<p>The Crafts’ move to Brixton foreshadowed how this once swampy countryside would transform into a center of Black cultural life. The district, now home to the Black Cultural Archives, stood just a few blocks from where the Craft boys attended school. The Craft residency in Brixton marked the first in a long line of Black activists who lived there. Jamaican-born Olive Morris, who fought for Black women’s and squatters’ rights in the 1970s, and activist-novelist Alex Wheatle, both called Brixton home. The community was also the site of the 1981 Brixton uprising, during which Black activists protested the deaths of thirteen young Black men and women as well as the Metropolitan Police’s racist stop-and-search policy (Aboagye 2022).</p>

						<p>Yet the Crafts’ tenure in Brixton would not be long. Although they had lived for nearly two decades in England, William and Ellen felt the revolutionary promise of Reconstruction, even from across the broad pond. The post-Civil War years in the United States represented a moment of unprecented opportunity and hope for African Americans, many of whom were newly free. William and Ellen returned to the United States in 1869 with all but two of their British-born children, where their freedom was, at least on paper, thereafter guaranteed by a constitutional amendment (Green 2018, 27). To borrow W. E. B. Du Bois’ words (1935, 26), the Crafts took their chance to stand for “a brief moment in the sun.” Despite what they had already experienced at the hands of white Americans, scarce could the Crafts imagine white Southerners’ violent rejection of Black freedom.</p>

William Ivens must have become very well acquainted with this building and the area, as his parents left him and his brother here to study when they journeyed back to the U.S.</p>

						<p>William Ivens and Brougham stayed behind in England to finish their education. Although it is unclear what year the boys began school at Brixton Lodge, by 1871 they were listed among the school’s boarding pupils. With the rest of their family across the ocean, William and Brougham appeared in the 1871 England census at the Brixton Lodge on Atkinson Place with schoolmaster Thomas Royal Quicke and upwards of thirty other male “scholars” (one of whom was born in “Hayti”) (“1871 England Census” 1871). Additionally, at some point during their years in England, Brougham was even sent to Boulogne, France, to study (Anonymous 1878d).</p>

						<p>The year after his family departed for the United States, fifteen-year-old William Ivens passed the University of Cambridge Local Examinations (University of Cambridge 1871, 19). By the following spring, this news had spread across the Atlantic and was reported widely and publicly among the Craft’s friends and indeed throughout the Northeastern United States.</p>

No known copyrights. Although <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> misspelled his name as “W.J. Craft,” William Ivens made international news when he passed the Cambridge University exam in 1871. However, in a rhetorical turn illustrative of how contemporaries and historians alike have whitewished the history of abolition and Black activist movements, the article turns its attention to Theodore Paker and his musket, after only two sentences about William Ivens.</p>

						<p>“The son of those runaway fugitive slaves William and Ellen Craft has just passed the first examination of Cambridge university, England,” boasted Maine’s <em>Sun-Journal</em> in March of 1871. The following month, the <em>New York Examiner and Chronicle</em> announced that, “W. J. Craft, son of William and Ellen Craft, whose escape from slavery some years ago made such a sensation, has passed the first examination of Cambridge University, England.” The news even made its way into <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>: “Among the boys who have passed the first examination of Cambridge University, England, is W. J. Craft. He is the son of WILLIAM and ELLEN CRAFT, now in Georgia – a State from which they escaped as fugitive slaves years ago” (Anonymous 1871a; Anonymous 1871b; Anonymous 1871c).</p>

						<p>William Ivens represented to both newly freed African Americans and their white supporters the potential for advancement were Black men and women given the opportunity, and the community held him up for his accomplishments.</p>
