PREFACE.
HOPE that the following tale of adventure, in a part
S e of the world hitherto but little known, will prove
o interesting to my young readers. I have not
W P attempted to convey through it a lesson in geo-
graphy; indeed, although I think that I can trace
the route taken by my friend Andrew Crawford and his com-
panions, as he does not mention the names of the rivers and
Jakes they navigated, or of the forests and plains they traversed,
I cannot be very positive about the matter. I judge, from the
animals and trees and plants he describes, that they must have
passed through the southern portion of Tropical Africa, and,
travelling in the direction of the Cape, reached at last that
wide, level, and sandy table-land called the Kalahari Desert,
which extends from near the shore of the Atlantic almost
across the continent under the Tropic of Capricorn.
Though the soil is of a fine light-coloured sand, and it con-
tains no flowing streams, it abounds with animals: antelopes
of several descriptions, quaggas, zebras, elephants, rhino-
ceroses, and even lions. The Creator has devised the means
of support, both for man and beast, which man would not have
thought of.
In the first place, many basin-shaped tracts exist, where the
water, draining to the centre, remains either above the soil in

PREFACE.
pools, or beneath it, to be reached by digging wells; then,
again, the alluvial soil in hollows of the beds of ancient rivers,
becoming baked by the sun, holds the rain as in clay vessels
for many months together. Thus the chief necessary of life is
partly but not entirely supplied. Buried deep beneath the
sandy soil, and thus protected from the scorching rays of the
sun, grow a large number of tuberous roots, the stalks which
rise from them creeping along the ground, and putting forth
large leaves for their still further protection. The tuber, the
leroshúa, grows to the size of a child's head, and contains a
mass of cellular tissue, filled with a fluid like that of a turnip.
Water-melons also grow in profusion on this arid soil. One of
them, the Cucumis caffer, is of large size—the cattle of a tra-
veller, Mr. J. Macabe, crossing the desert, lived on them for
twenty-one days, and when water was at length reached ap-
peared not to care for it. Numerous animals eat both roots
and fruits, satisfying their hunger and quenching their thirst.
A large portion of the so-called desert is also covered with
grass, and extensive patches of bushes and even clumps of
trees are also scattered over it. Many other wonderful arrange-
ments exist for the support of animal life in that arid region,
exhibiting the unfathomable wisdom of the Creator, and his
care for the support of those wild beasts of the desert, his crea-
tures. Then let not man ever doubt God's love and protecting
care, but, like my friends, in all the trials of life, and though
surrounded by difficulties and dangers which may appear in-
surmountable, struggle on, doing what is right and brave,
assured that there is One above who watches over those who
put their trust in Him.

CHAPTER I.
ON BOARD THE " OSPREY "--OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA.
RADENSE mist hung over the ocean; the sky above
our heads was of a gray tint; the water below oui
feet of the colour of lead. Not a ripple disturbed
its mirror-like surface, except when now and then
a covey of flying-fish leaped forth to escape from
w their pursuers, or it was clove by the fin of a
marauding shark. We knew that we were not far off the
coast of Africa, some few degrees to the south of the Equator;
but how near we were we could not tell, for the calm had
continued for several days, and a strong current, setting to the
eastward, had been rapidly drifting us toward the shore.
Notwithstanding that the sun was obscured, his rays found
means of heating the atmosphere, so that we felt much as if
we were surrounded by a hot damp blanket.
I had already made a trip to the West Indies, and two to
this terrible coast; and as I had escaped without an attack of
yellow fever, or cholera, when the Liverpool owners of the
brig Osprey-commanded by Captain Page, an old African

OBJECT OF THE VOYAGE.
trader-offered me a berth as supercargo, I willingly accepted
it. We were bound out to the Cape of Good Hope, but had
arranged to touch at two or three places on the coast, to trade
and land passengers. Among other places we were to call at
St. Paul de Loando, to land a Portuguese gentleman, Senhor
Silva, and his black servant Ramaon. Our object in trading
was to obtain palm-oil, bees'-wax, gold dust, and ivory, in
exchange for Manchester and Birmingham goods; and for
this purpose we had already visited several places on the
coast, picking up such quantities as could be obtained at
each of them. We had not, however, escaped without the
usual penalty African traders have to pay—two of our men
having died of fever, and two others, besides the captain,
being sick of it. The first mate, Giles Gritton, and another
man, had been washed overboard in a heavy gale we en-
countered on the other side of the Equator, and we were
now, therefore, somewhat short-handed. The first mate was
a great loss, for he was an excellent seaman and a first-rate
fellow, which is more than could be said of the second mate,
Simon Kydd. How he came to be appointed mate seemed
unaccountable; unless, as he was related to the owners, in-
terest might have obtained for him what his own merits cer.
tainly would not. Taking him at his own value, he had few
superiors, if any equals.
I felt much for Captain Page. He took the loss of his first
mate greatly to heart, and thus the incapacity of the second
contributed considerably to increase his malady. Day after
day he grew worse, and I began to fear much that his illness
would end fatally. He was as good and kind a man as ever
lived, and an excellent sailor.
I had not been knocking about the ocean altogether with
my eyes shut, and had managed to pick up a fair amount of
nautical knowledge. I did not intrude it unnecessarily; I had

WHY I CAME TO SEA.
15
a notion that I was regarded with a somewhat jealous eye by
those who considered me a mere landsman. I certainly under-
stood more about navigation than Mr. Kydd, but that is not
saying much. There were few things which I could not do,
from handing, reefing, and steering, to turning in a dead-eye,
and setting up the rigging; and few situations in which the
fickle winds and waves were likely to place a ship with which
I was not prepared to contend. Blow high or blow low, I
felt myself at home on the ocean. My father had objected to
my becoming a sailor, and had placed me in his counting-
house. The sedentary life of a clerk was, however, not to my
taste, and I was very glad to abdicate my seat on the high
stool on every decent pretext. Still I had done my duty
when there, and my conscience was at rest on that score.
Misfortunes overtook my father's house; speculations were en-
tered into which proved unsuccessful; and his long-established
and highly-esteemed firm got into inextricable difficulties.
In vain he and his partners struggled to maintain their credit.
The final crash came, and although my mother's marriage
settlement saved the family from penury, he had no capital
with which to recommence business. I was too young to take
bis place. One of his partners died broken-hearted, and he
had not the energy left to undertake the onerous duties he
would have been called upon to perform. He and my mother
and sisters retired to a modest cottage in Cheshire; while his
boys, of whom I was the third, had to seek their fortunes in
the world. He had done his duty by us. He had given us a
good education, and ever striven to instil into our minds the
principles of true religion and honour. I shall never forget
his parting advice when I started on my first expedition.
"Ever trust in God, Andrew," he said. "Recollect that you
were bought with a price,' and are not your own. You
have no business to follow your own fancies, or to gratify any

MY FATHER'S ADVICE.
of the propensities fallen nature possesses, even though we do
possess them, notwithstanding what the devil and the world
may say to the contrary. God has given you a body, but ever
remember that he has given you a mind to regulate that body.
To the animals he has given bodies, and indued them with
instincts which we may say are unerring; whereas man's mind,
in consequence of sin, is prone to err; but then again, in his
mercy, he has enabled man to seek for strength from above to
counteract the effects of sin, and so to regulate his mind that
it may properly guide the body. I have no faith in high
principles, unless those high principles are kept in order by a
higher influence. Therefore, Andrew, read your Bible daily
for guidance; go daily to the throne of grace for enlighten-
ment and direction, that you may keep your high principles
bright and ever fit for action. Do not trust your feelings ;
they may mislead you. Do not trust the world or your com-
panions; they may prove faithless monitors or guides. Do
not trust, as people say, 'manfully to yourself.' Self often
proves treacherous." More to the same effect my father said.
I have given briefly his observations. I did my best to carry
out his counsel; and through it gained the calmness and
courage with which I encountered difficulties and dangers
which would otherwise have appalled and overwhelmed me.
I was never addicted to talking to my companions of myself,
or my principles and feelings; and I sometimes blame myself
for not endeavouring more perseveringly to inculcate on others
those principles which I knew to be so true and valuable. I
now mention the subject, because I can say on paper what my
lips have often refused to utter. But I have said enongh
about myself.
We had several other passengers on board, who, notwith-
standing the risks which they knew must be encountered on
the African coast, had, for the sake of seeing the country, come

CONCERNING OUR PASSENGERS.

on board with the intention of proceeding on to Cape Town,
to which, as I said, we were ultimately bound. I will men-
tion first Captain Stanley Hyslop, a near relation of mine, a
nephew of my mother's. He was a military officer, and
having sold out of the service, was going to settle in the Cape
Colony, where his parents already were. He was accompanied
by two younger brothers. David was one of the nicest fellows
I ever met. He had been educated as a surgeon, and purposed
practising in the country. The youngest, Leonard, or Leo, as
we always called him, was an amusing little chap, always
thinking funny things and saying them, and yet there was a
simplicity about him which was very attractive. He had been
sent to school in England, but being considered somewhat
delicate—not, certainly, that he looked so—it was recom-
mended that he should return to breathe his native air at the
Cape. David was also, I should say, an enthusiastic naturalist,
and the hope of increasing his knowledge at the places we
might visit, had, besides his regard for me, induced him to take
his passage on board the Osprey, just as his brother expected
to get a few days sporting while the brig remained at anchor.
I had seen but little of Stanley, but for David I had always
felt a warm regard.
There were, however, two other members of the family, in
one of whom, at all events, I must own I felt still more in-
terested, although I knew that it would not do for me in my
present situation to exhibit my feelings. My cousin, Kate
Hyslop, was a very pretty, engaging girl, who had a short
time before left school. She was also full of spirit, while she
was right-minded and sweet-tempered. Her younger sister,
Isabella, or Bella as she was called, was quite a little girl.
She also had been at school; but her parents naturally could
not bear to have her left behind, and so Kate had undertaken
to complete her education ; and from the time we sailed she

PETER TIMBO'S HISTORY.
was most assiduous in her attempts to do so. Sometimes I
fancied she gave her almost too much teaching. When her
brother, however, made a remark to that effect, she answered
that it was important not to lose time, as opportunities might
be wanting by-and-by; and when once they arrived in the
colony, she knew that there would be so many interruptions
and hindrances, and she might have so many other duties to
perform, that Bella might not get the due amount of know-
ledge she wished her to possess. Blow high or blow low,
Kate always made Bella learn her lessons. Sometimes hold-
ing on by the leg of a table in the cabin during a gale, there
the two sisters would be found with their books. Both were
capital sailors, as people say—that is, they were never ill at
sea; so that they were not inconvenienced as most other
people would have been by the tossing and tumbling of the
stout brig.
They were attended by an old negro, Peter Timbo by name,
who was the most watchful of guardians. He was the cap-
tain's servant, and had always accompanied him in his shoot-
ing expeditions when he was before staying at the Cape.
Timbo, also, from what I heard him say, knew more about his
native country than any one on board. He was born at some
distance from the sea, not far from the Equator. When he
was just growing into manhood, his village had been attacked
by another tribe, and ho, with several companions in misfor-
tune, had been carried off to the coast. He was there shipped
on board a Portuguese slaver, which, venturing to the north
of the line, was chased and captured by a British man-of-war.
Timbo, having a fancy for a sea life, and being an active, in-
telligent fellow, had been allowed to enter on board her. After
serving for some years, he had been discharged at the Cape ;
where, after following several pursuits, he had become a ser-
vant to my uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Hyslop. Peter was

Joquacious and ever merry, and it was pleasant to hear him
give way to one of his hearty laughs. He had thick lips, a
huge flattish nose, and somewhat high head, covered with
thick curling wool, now beginning to show signs of turning
gray. Although he understood English perfectly, he still
spoke it in a somewhat negro fashion, which often gave
piquancy to his expressions; but from the way his master
treated him, and from the affectionate care he seemed to take
of the younger members of the family, it was evident that he
must be a worthy man, notwithstanding his want of personal
attractions.
"Ah, Massa Andrew, we nebber know as kind God does
what is good for us," he remarked to me one day. "I bery
sorryful when slaver people carry me off from my home in
Pongo country. I t'ink I go to die, dat dere was no God to
look after poor black fellow. I know only of Fetish, and I
afraid of Fetish. Den I get among white men, and I see and
hear much dat is bad, and still I t'ink dere is no God. Den
years pass by, and I hear of de merciful Saviour, who die for
me; and I say, 'Dat is just what I want,' and I learn to be
Christian. But I will tell you anoder day more about myself;
I now go to get ready de cabin dinner."
I told Timbo that I should keep him to his promise, as I was
much interested in the short account he had given of himself.
We had four other passengers—Mr. John and Mr. Charles
Rowley, and Miss Julia Rowley their sister, who seemed very
nice people, but they kept themselves rather aloof from me,
as well as from the mate, though they were friendly enough
with the passengers, whom they considered their equals.
The last person I need name was a young Irishman, Mr.
Terence O'Brien, who was of no profession that I could find
out, but proposed settling as a colonist at the Cape. I have
thus at once run off a brief description of my companions, of

THE SICK CAPTAIN AND HIS SON.
the last mentioned of whom, at that time, I knew compara-
tively little. Having said thus much of them, I will con-
tinue the thread of my narrative.
"How is the weather, Andrew ?" said Captain Page as I
went into his cabin. We had the skylight off, to let in as
much air as possible, but yet it felt hot and stilling. He
was very pale. His lips were of a bluish tinge, and his
eyes were sunken and dim. On a locker close by him sat a
young boy with a book before him, from which he was in vain
endeavouring to read. I saw that Natty had been crying, for
tears bedewed the page. He was the captain's only son. His
mother was dead, and rather than leave him on shore to the
care of strangers, his father had brought him on this African
voyage. "It was a choice of two evils," he said to me one
day. "The boy's constitution is good, and we must not let
him be exposed to the night air or hot suns up the rivers, and
he will probably stand the climate better than most of us."
Such indeed had been the case, and Natty had been well, and
had until now been full of life and spirits—the favourite of all
on board. He and my young cousin Leonard soon struck up
a friendship, and were of course always together. For once
Natty had left his friend to remain by the side of his father.
The captain had been speaking to him, for his voice ceased as
I appeared.
I replied to the captain's question, " No signs of a change,
Captain Page. We hove the lead, but found no bottom.
We must still be some distance off the coast."
"I trust so," was the answer. "Heave the lead every
quarter of an hour, and let me know when we are in soundings.
Take another cast at once, and then come back."
I told the mate. "Why, I did so not twenty minutes ago,"
he answered. "What does the old man want us to do it again
for ?"

OBSTINACY OF THE MATE.
21
"The captain knows this coast well, Mr. Kydd," I answered.
"We may be thankful to get an anchor to hold as soon as we
get into shallow water."
Seeing the mate did not seem disposed to obey, I took the
lead, and calling to two of the hands, prepared to heave it.
"No, no," observed Kydd, " that is my work ;" and taking
the lead from me, hore it carelessly. "No bottom," he
answered; " I should think not, indeed, out here."
It appeared to me that as the line ran out the whole length,
he could not be mistaken. Returning to the cabin, I made my
report to the captain. "Andrew," he said, " sit down; I want
to have a few words with you. I am going to that haven
whence I shall never come back. I feel that I shall not hold
on much longer to life. I have not been a successful man,
and leave my boy but ill provided for. As to my friends,
there are none that I can think of who are able to help him;
and the few acquaintances I have who could do so, I cannot
trust. The thought of what will become of my orphan boy
weighs heavily on me. Andrew, you are young and healthy,
and may Heaven preserve your life for many years! I have no
great claim on you, but Andrew, as you hope Heaven will watch
over you, do you keep an eye on my boy. Do for him the
best you can. I have seen enough of you to know that you
will act wisely and kindly. I do not desire to have him
pampered and spoiled by riches, if I could give them, but I
cannot bear the thought of his being left friendless and in
poverty to fight his way through this often hard and cruel
world. You will see to this, Andrew? I am sure you will."
"I will, Captain Page ; I promise you," I answered, and I
took his cold clammy hand.
Poor Natty was all this time sobbing violently. The truth
that he was going to lose his father burst upon him, and that
father had ever been kind and indulgent.

22
A TRUST.
"That is well, that is well," murmured Captain Page. "I
trust to you to be his human protector, and to One"—and he
turned his eyes upward—"who will ever be a Friend of the
fatherless."
The captain said a good deal more, and made various
arrangements about Natty. Desiring me to get some papers
from his desk, he showed me how I could obtain the little
property he was likely to leave.
"I wish I could see the brig safely brought to an anchor,"
he observed after a long silence. "It is a nasty coast at best.
With a breeze we could work off it, but while this calm lasts
we cannot help ourselves from being carried wherever the
current takes us, till we get into water shoal enough for
anchoring. I shall be happier when once we can bring up,
for if we do not, we may, when we little expect it, be driven
on shore; and let me tell you, Andrew, what with the surf and
the sharks, few of us are likely to escape with our lives. I
know this coast well, and a sandy beach, exposed to the whole
sweep of the Atlantic, is even more dangerous than a rocky
shore. It must be time again to heave the lead. Go on deck,
Andrew, and see how things are."
I found the passengers seated under an awning, which the
mate had riggel at their request. He himself was walking up
and down the deck, coming the officer in fine style, and
endeavouring to make himself agreeable to the young ladies.
Ho evidently anticipated the moment when he should have
the command; indeed, he seemed to fancy himself the master
already. When I told him that the capitain desired me again
to heave the lead, he appeared not to hear me, but continued
talking to Miss Rowley with the insinuating air he knew so
well how to assumc. Miss Hyslop took but little notice of
him when he addressed her, and turned away, giving her atten-
tion to Bella's lessons, or going on with any work she might

have in hand, for she never was a moment idle. She was
admirably fitted for colonial life; indeed, I may say, for any
position in which she might be placed. If she had become
a duchess, she would not have been an idle one.—I again
addressed Mr. Kydd. I told him that the captain wished to
have the lead hove.
"The old man is always issuing his orders through you,
Mr. Crawford," he answered at length, in a scornful tone. "I
know, I should think, what ought to be done, and I will do it.
And I beg you will not interrupt me when I am talking to
ladies." He added the last sentence in a whisper, sufficiently
loud, however, for Miss Rowley to hear him.
"As the captain has been too ill to take an observation for
some time, I suppose that you know our correct longitude, Mr.
Kydd. He, at all events, considers that we are close in with
the African coast; and, as you are aware, it would be a terrible
thing to have the brig cast on one of the sandbanks which lie
off it," I remarked.
"No fear of that," he answered scornfully. "We shall
have a breeze soon, probably, and then we will stand to the
westward, and run down to the latitude of Loando. We are
not many degrees from that, at all events."
"The captain is a good seaman, and he has his reasons for
ordering the lead to be hove," I answered. "If the calm
continues, he wishes us to anchor as soon as the water shoals
sufficiently."
"Shoals sufficiently !" repeated the mate, in the same scorn-
ful tone; "we have no line on board to reach the bottom,
I'll warrant." The mate unintentionally spoke loud enough
for the gentlemen to hear him.
"Come, Mr. Kydd, I suppose you intend to obey the captain's
orders," said Captain Hyslop, coming up to where we were stand-
ing. "It seems to me that he has good reason for giving them."

THE MATE'S REFUSAL.
"I believe, sir, that I am chief officer of the Osprey, and
that I know my duty," said the mate. "It is not customary
for passengers to interfere with the navigation of the ship."
"Certainly not, sir," answered Stanley; "but I trust all on
board will obey the captain's orders while he is able to give
them."
"That will not be for long," muttered the mate in an
undertone. "I intend to do what is necessary, and I do not
see that there is any use to keep heaving the lead out here
almost in mid-ocean."
"But are we in mid-ocean, Mr. Kydd ? The captain con-
siders that we are close in with the coast," remarked Stanley.
"Faith, there is going to be a row," I heard Terence
O'Brien exclaim to young Mr. Rowley. "See! I would like
to be after giving them a poke. It would be rare fun."
"It would not be rare fun if the captain is right," was the
answer.
"Am I to report to Captain Page that you decline heaving
the lead, Mr. Kydd ?" I said at length, seeing that he made
no movement to obey the order.
"Do as you like, Mr. Crawford. I am not going to be
dictated to by any man on board," replied the mate in an
obstinate tone.
"The captain is very ill, as you know, and I fear your
conduct will greatly vex him and tend to aggravate his disease,"
I said, still unwilling to return below. "I hope you will let
me heave the lead if you will not do it yourself."
"Are you hired to navigate this ship, or am I?" he said in
an angry tone, turning round to me. "I am chief officer, and
unless the captain comes on deck to give his commands, I in-
tend to do as I think fit. If you touch the lead, I shall con-
sider it an act of mutiny, and order the crew to put you in
irons."

TIIE CAPTAIN ON DECK.
25
I did not wish to bring things to extremities, and yet I
could not bring niyself to tell the captain how the mate was
behaving. I waited, but waited in vain, to see whether he
would change his mind. "He still stood with his hands in his
pockets, casting defiant looks around. I was in hopes that
Stanley and the other gentlemen would interfere; but they re-
mained silent, though somewhat astonished at the mate's be-
haviour. At last, finding there was no help for it, I went
back to the cabin.
"I am sorry to say, Captain Page, that Mr. Kydd seems to
consider that there is no necessity for heaving the lead, and
refuses to do so at present," I said on entering. "I will do
anything you wish, and again carry your orders if you desire
me."
"I must go on deck myself then," said the captain, attempt-
ing to rise. "Help me on with my clothes, Andrew. I feel very
weak, but if he forces me to it, I must go." I assisted the
captain to dress, with the help of Natty. "Here, give me your
arm, Andrew; it is a stronger one than poor Natty's. I must
do it, though it kills me."
I felt the poor captain tremble all over as I helped him along
to the companion-ladder. He climbed up with the greatest
difficulty ; indeed, without my assistance he could not have got
along. He at length reached the deck. He could scarcely
stand, and was obliged to hold on by the companion-hatch.
His face was pale as death. His white hair hung down on
each side of his forehead, over which the skin seemed stretched
like thin parchment. His lips had lost all colour, and his
blue eyes, as he gazed around, had an unnatural brightness.
"Mr. Kydd," he said, "you have compelled me at a severe
cost to come up on deck. I order you to heave the lead.
And, men," he cried out, "assist the mate to carry out my
orders."

-
DEATH OF CAPTAIN PAGE.
Kydd was now obliged to obey. Going to the chains, he
hove the lead. I looked over the side to watch him, and saw
by the way the line slackened that bottom was found. Just
at that moment I heard some one cry out, "See ! see! What
is the matter with the captain ?" I ran aft. He had fallen
to the deck. "Oh, father, father! speak to me!" cried
Natty, who was by his side. I lifted up the old man's head.
David Hyslop had hastened to him, and was kneeling on the
deck holding his hand. "He has swooned," he said. "He
should not have left his bed."
"Can you do anything for him ?"
"We will carry him below, but I fear the worst," he
whispered.
Just then the sails of the brig gave a loud, thundering flap,
and yet there was no wind; but I felt that a huge wave coming
along the ocean had passed under her. The passengers looked
at each other with an expression of dismay in their counte-
nances, not knowing what was next going to happen; while
David and I, with the assistance of Stanley and Mr. Rowley,
began to carry the captain down below. Not without difficulty,
as he was somewhat heavy, we placed him on his bed. David
again felt his pulse.
" It is all over, I fear," he said in a low voice, so that Natty
could not hear. "Bring a glass ! I cannot feel his heart
beating." His brother brought a small glass from their sisters'
cabin, and David held it over Captain Page's mouth, and again
felt his heart. "He is gone," he said. "No human skill can
restore him."
Natty, who had been standing outside, now sprang into the
cabin. "Oh, tell me!" he said, looking imploringly up at
David, " tell me!—is my father likely to get better? Why
will he not speak to me?"
David did not reply, but made a sign to me to lead him out of

BREAKING THE NEWS.

the cabin. I saw my cousin close the old man's eyes as I took
Natty by the hand and led him to the main cabin. I thought
I would tell him at once what had happened; but a choking
sensation came into my throat, and I could not utter a word.
"Is father not getting better," he asked, after a time. "Why
did he not speak to me just now?"
"I am afraid he is not getting better," I replied; "but come
on deck." The idea struck me that I would get one of the
young ladies to speak to him, as they would tell him of his
loss with more gentleness than any one else. When we reached
the deck he saw Leo, who ran up to him, and took him aft to
show him a large shark he had been watching swimming about
close astern. I seized the opportunity of speaking to Miss
Rowley, and told her what had happened.
"Oh, no, no; I am sure I cannot speak to the child. I
should not know what to say," she answered. " Just tell him
yourself. I do not suppose boys are likely to be much
affected by such an occurrence."
I could not help giving her a look expressive of the surprise
and pain I felt. Could that elegant young lady be so heartless
and indifferent to the sorrow of others ? My cousin Kate was
sitting a little further off, out of hearing of her brother and
Natty.
" The captain is dead," I said, in a low voice; " but his poor
boy does not know it."
"Is the kind old man really gone?" she exclaimed, looking
up into my face, and a tear starting into her eye. "Oh, how
sad for poor Natty! But he must be told; and yet he will feel
it dreadfully."
"Will you tell him then, Kate?" I asked. "It is necessary
to do so at once, and yet it is hard to wound his feelings."
"Yes," she said; "I will try, even though it would greatly
pain me. Yes, yes !" she continued. "Come here, Natty,

UNSEASONABLE SATISFACTION.
and sit down by me.—You need not be afraid, Andrew, I will
speak gently to him."
I was sure she would. Her sweet couptenance showed me
how much she felt for the boy. I did not hear what she said,
but she took his hand, and looked kindly into his face. He
saw the tears in her eyes as she went on talking, and then, at
length, he seemed to comprehend the truth, and began to sob
violently. I saw her take both his hands, and cast on him a
look of sympathy, of more avail just then than any words she
could have uttered. Directly after he started up, as if to run
to the cabin where his dead father lay; but she held him back
by gentle force; and then he sat quiet, and sobbed and sobbed
as if his young heart would break; and she again began to
speak so soothingly to him, looking so kindly into his face,
her tears falling fast, that I knew he was gaining the comfort
he needed.
The mate meantime, hearing what had happened, went into
the cabin, as if to satisfy himself. When he returned on deck,
I saw that he could scarcely conceal his satisfaction as he looked
about with an air of authority.
"Men," he said—for the crew had come up, a rumour
having reached them of what had occurred—"I am now
captain of this brig, and you will have to obey my orders. :
You understand me. I am not going to have any of the
nonsense we had before; what I say I'll have done, and if
there's any slackness, look out for squalls."
Captain Page, I should have said, had been accustomed to
have prayers every morning and service on Sunday,a practice
not common, I am sorry to say, in those days aboard merchant-
men. The good old customs of our forefathers had long been
given up, when, rough as seamen might have been, there were
far more God-fearing men among them than at present; so I
have read. I ani afraid Kydi onded to this practice of the

SORROW OF THE CREW.
29
captain's, as well as to the kind and gentle way in which he
ruled his crew. The men touched their hats in recognition of
his authority; but I saw from the looks they cast at him, that
they held him in very different estimation to their late master
A stricter captain, perhaps, might have kept them in better
order. Many of them were somewhat rough hands; but still
his kindness had won their hearts, and, rough as they were,
they now showed unmistakable signs of sorrow for his death.
When the mate ceased speaking, and turned aft with a
conceited air, I saw them talking together, and casting no very
complimentary looks towards him. The old boatswain, indeed,
Jeremiah Barker, took but little pains to conceal his indigna-
tion. No sooner was the mate's back turned than he lifted up
his fist with a threatening gesture, which made me fear greatly
for the future discipline of the ship. As to expostulating with a
fellow like Kydd, I knew it would be utterly useless ; and I
was afraid that even if Stanley or the other gentlemen spoke
to him, he would be as little likely to attend to them as to
me.
I must confess that the captain's death and this conduct of
Kydd made me forget altogether the almost dying injunctions
of the former to anchor as soon as we got into shallow water.
The latter also seemed entirely to have forgotten that we were
already in soundings.
"Well, sir," he said, coming up to Stanley, "I suppose we
must see about getting the old man buried. I am no hand at
preaching or praying, and so I will ask you to read the funeral
*service. We will do all things ship-shape and right."
"Why, sir," exclaimed Stanley, in a tone of indignation,
"the poor man's breath is scarcely out of his body! You
would not throw him overboard at once surely !"
"We have to manage that sort of thing pretty sharply out
in these latitudes," answered Kydd. "I shall be wanting his

A LAST LOOK AT THE DEAD.
cabin, too; and as it may be two or three days before we reach
Loando, we cannot have him buried on shore. We are not far
off that place, and I hope we shall be able to get an observa-
tion in a short time, and see exactly where we are."
"You are now master of the vessel, and I shall not interfere
with your authority," said Stanley ; "but I think it would be
more decent to wait as long as we can for the sake of the poor
little boy there. When his feelings are more calm he would
like to see his dead father."
"Oh, certainly, sir, as you please, as you please," said the
mate, turning away. "I will give you another hour to indulge
your fancy, but I have no maudlin feelings of that sort."
If the look of unutterable disgust which passed over my
cousin's countenance could have made Kydd ashamed of him-
self, he would have hid his face; but he continued pacing the
deck and turning his head about as if considering which order
he should next issue. I saw Kate at length take Natty down
into the captain's cabin, and I thought it best to allow her and
the boy to be alone there together at that sad moment. The
boatswain then came aft and said that he and the crew wished
" to see their late captain.
"What is that for ?" asked Kydd, and I thought he was
going to refuse the request.
"He was our friend, and we would like to have a last look
at his kind face," answered the boatswain.
"Well, if the passengers do not mind your going into the
cabin, I do not," said the mate, turning aside.
Perhaps he did not quite like the expression of old Barker's
countenance. I led the way into the cabin, and the crew came,
one by one, following the boatswain
"Well, you was an honest, kind man as ever lived, and
that's more than can be said of him who has stepped into your
shoes," said old Barker, apostrophizing the captain. "He is

BURIAL OF THE CAPTAIN.
less of a sailor than your little finger was; and as to sense, he
has not as much as was in your thumb-nail." The remarks of
the other men, as they passed by, were still less complimen-
tary to the new master; and had he heard them, he might well
have doubted his power of keeping his crew in order. I felt,
indeed, very anxious, for though I had thought very little of
Kydd, I was not aware how he was despised and detested by
the men.
I more than ever wished that a breeze would spring up, that
they might have something to do, and that we might get away
from this dangerous part of the coast. The calm, however,
still continued, and at length the time came for lowering our late
captain into his ocean grave. The sailmaker came aft with
the boatswain to superintend the operation of enclosing him in
a hammock, into which they fastened a pig of iron ballast.
" Them sharks shan't have him, nohow," observed the
sailmaker; "for though the bottom may be a long way off, he
will reach it pretty quickly, and lie quiet there till the day
when we all come up from the land or sea—it will not then
matter where we have lain in the meantime-to answer for
ourselves. I only wish I was as sure to give as good an ac-
count of myself as he is."
"Be quick there !" cried the mate from the deck. "There
is a breeze coming up, I have a notion, and we shall have to
trim sails. I wish to get this business over first."
Kate had been keeping Natty by her side while this was
going forward. Two of the other men now came below and
assisted to carry the captain's body on deck, where my cousin
Stanley had got his prayer-book, and stood ready. The old
boatswain had thrown a flag over the body, now placed on a
plank, one end of which projected out of a port. While the
funeral service of the Church of England was read, not a sound
was heard except the unrepressed sobs which burst from poor

STILL A CALM.
Natty's bosom, and the creaking of the yards and blocks as the
brig moved imperceptibly from side to side. Then came the
dull, sullen sound of a plunge, as, old Barker lifting up the end
of the plank, the body slid off into the water. As I looked
over the side I could see the white shrouded figure descending
into the depths of ocean. Just as it disappeared, I caught
sight of the dark form of a huge shark gliding towards it; but
I had hopes that it had sunk far below the creature's reach
before he could seize it.
"Stow away that plank," said the mate, the instant the
captain's body had been launched overboard. "I wish this
breeze would come, though," he added, glancing round.
Still he gave no orders to heave the lead, as the late captain
had advised. I knew well enough that to remind him would
only make him less likely to do it, so I said nothing, though
I kept looking over into the water to see if there was any
change of colour which might be produced by our getting
nearer the land. Now again came one of those sullen flaps of
the sails, showing that though we might seem to be at rest,
the vessel was occasionally moved by no gentle force; and I
could distinguish, as I looked eastward, a smooth undulation
which seemed rolling away in that direction. Still the sky
remained obscured as before, and a gauze-like mist hung over
the ocean. The atmosphere felt hotter and more oppressive
than ever. The passengers remained on deck, for the cabins
were almost unbearable. The ladies were trying to read or
work, but Kate alone continued to ply her active fingers.
Miss Rowley scarcely turned a page, while little Bella kept
looking with her large blue eyes at poor Natty, who sat with
his head resting on his hands, utterly unable to recover him-
self. As I looked over the side I observed that the undula-
tions I have spoken of became more and more frequent, on
each occasion, as they passed, giving the brig a slow shake, and

making the sails flap loudly as before. The crew were talking
together, and, led by old Barker, were ranging the cable for
anchoring, Mr. Kydd having disappeared below. Suddenly he
returned on deck.
"Who ordered you to do that?" he exclaimed in an angry
tone. " Did I tell you I was going to bring the ship to an
anchor?"
"No, sir," answered the boatswain; " but any one who is
acquainted with these parts must know that it is the only thing
to be done to save the brig and our lives. For who can tell
that we may not be ashore any moment !"
"You are a mutinous rascal," exclaimed Kydd. "I
will not allow the brig to be brought to an anchor till I see fit.
We are fifty miles off the coast, and more than that, perhaps."
"What, with fifty fathom only under our keel!" exclaimed
the boatswain. "What is the meaning, too, of these breakers
away in the south-east ? Mr. Kydd, we must anchor, and you
ought to know it."
I looked out in the direction towards which the boatswain
pointed. The sun was already sinking into the ocean, and his
rays lighted up a line of foam, or what looked like it, in the
south-east.
Kydd, on the boatswain's remark, broke out into a furious
passion, and, hurrying into his cabin, appeared again with a
brace of pistols in his hand. Placing them in his belt, he
walked the deck, muttering incoherently to himself. No one
interfered. I felt unwilling to go below, though the steward
called me to supper. The sun had long disappeared—the moon
rose, and shed a bright silvery light upon the ocean. It was
perfectly calm; and as, on looking round, I could see no breakers,
nor hear their sound, I at length turned in. I was too anxious,
however, to sleep long. On going on deck and again looking
out, there I saw, not a quarter of a mile off, a black ledge of

rocks rising some feet out of the water. The brig was drifting
by them at a rate which showed how strong a current was
running. What was my surprise to see a boat coming off from
the rock. "What is that?" I asked.
"Why, I have treated one mutinous rascal as I intend to

treat you if you follow his example," answered Kydd, who
heard my question.
I was too much astonished to speak. After pacing the deck
for a few minutes I went below to consult with Stanley.
"We must put him under arrest," he said at length. "But
go on deck and learn how the men take the proceeding."

KYDD AND THE BOATSWAIN.
35
On my return I found the boat alongside. The crew
climbed on board. Could they really have executed so
barbarous an order! Great was my relief to find the boat-
swain among them.
"You rascals, I ordered you to land him on these rocks!"
exclaimed Kydd, when he caught sight of the old man.
"So we did; and he ordered us to take him off again,"
answered one of the crew. "We have as good a right to obey
him as you, Mr. Kydd. If you was to die, like the captain
and first mate, he's the only officer left to take charge of the
brig."
Kydd was a coward. This answer silenced him, and with-
out uttering a word he went below.
The passengers assembled at breakfast the next morning
with anxious faces. They knew that something was very
wrong, but could not exactly tell what. The calin continued.
A thick mist hung over the ocean as on the previous day, the
rocks were no longer in sight, the vessel floated tranquilly on
the treacherous waters. Kydd had completely recovered him-
self. He had the awning spread, and with a smiling counte-
nance invited the passengers to come on deck, and tried to
make himself agreeable to Miss Rowley. Some time thus
passed. At last I saw the boatswain and several of the men
coming up.
"Mr. Kydd," said the former, "I have to ask you whether
you intend to anchor, and try to keep the ship out of danger
or not?"
"Not till the land is in sight, and I see the necessity,"
answered Kydd quite calmly. He said nothing more for a
minute or so. Then suddenly he exclaimed in a furious tone,
"But I am not going to be dictated to by a set of mutinous
scoundrels." I need not repeat all his words.
Just at that moment I heard that peculiar low, suppressed

THE BRIG ON SHORE.
roar which a seaman knows so well to indicate breakers.
I begged the mate to listen, telling him what I had heard,
but he was deaf to reason, and declared he would only anchor
when he saw fit. He seemed to have gone out of his mind,
and I felt that I should be justified in assisting the crew in
putting him under restraint; but he was in reality as much
in his senses as ever, though under the influence of his passion
and obstinacy. Just at that moment another roller came in
toward the brig from the westward, and the next instant all on
deck were almost thrown off their feet. A blow was felt which
made her shake fore and aft, and the water, which had
hitherto not even rippled against her side, now broke over her
in a shower of spray. The passengers started up. Kate
clasped her little sister round the neck, and seized the arm of
her brother David, who was standing near her. "What is
the matter? what has happened?" shrieked out Miss Rowley in
an attitude expressive of her terror.
"We are on shore," cried some of the men; "that is what
has happened."
Such was too truly the case. The old captain's warnings
had been neglected, and his prognostications were thus terribly
fulfilled.

JOASTFUL as the mate had been, he turned deadly
i pale as he saw the dangerous position in which
the brig was placed. When, however, she lay
quiet-the sea not again breaking over her—he
recovered himself. The crew meantime, led by
Barker, had gone aloft, without his orders, to furl sails, the
first thing under the circumstances to be done.
"Get the boats out," he said at length. His voice had lost
its usual authoritative tone. "We must warp the vessel off."
"No easy matter to do that," observed the boatswain. "I
know what these banks are made of, and it will be a hard job to
find holding ground. Which way will you haul her off, sir?"
" The way she came on," answered the mate.
." That was sideways, I have a notion," observed old Barker.
* You will not get her off so."
I soon saw, by the manner the brig lay over, that Barker
was right; but without sounding round her, it was impossible
to judge properly what to do. I suggested that this was the
first thing to be done. "Give your advice when it is asked,
Mr. Crawford," said Kydd, walking up and down the deck.
" Be smart there with the boats ! "
While he was speaking, another wave came rolling in and

struck the vessel with greater force than the former one, break-
ing over the fore part of the deck.
"We must get the boats over to the starboard side," said
Barker (the vessel's head was to the north). "They will be
stove in if we attempt to lower them on the outer side."
"What are you afraid of, man?" exclaimed Kydd. "Why,
the sea is as smooth as a mill-pond between these rollers. Am
I to be obeyed, or am I not? Here, lower this boat first. We
will have her round on the other side before the next roller
comes in."
Several of the men hastened to obey him. The boat was
cleared, and two of the crew jumping into her, she was lowered.
Just, however, as she reached the water, before the others
could follow, another far heavier roller came gliding towards
us. "In board for your lives, lads!" I cried out, but the men
either did not hear me or despised the warning. The wave
struck the boat and dashed it with tremendous force against
the counter, sweeping them off towards the shore. They held
out their hands imploring assistance.
"If we get the starboard-quarter boat lowered we shall be
in time to save them, Mr. Kydd," I said; and without waiting
for his reply, Barker and I, with Jack Handspike, assisted by
some of the gentlemen, lowered the boat. Scarcely, however,
had we seized the oars, when we heard a loud shriek, and one
of the poor fellows disappeared beneath the surface. A shark
had taken him. The other, who was at a little distance, saw
his companion's fate, and cried out to us to make haste. We
pulled away as hard as we could lay our backs to the oars, old
Barker steering. But just before we reached the man, bis
arms were thrown up, and down he sank. He, too, had
become the prey of one of the rapacious monsters of the
deep. We now returned on board, the boat remaining per-
fectly quiet on the starboard side. No attempt had been

USELESS EFFORTS TO MOVE THE BRIG.

made in the meantime to sound round the vessel. I offered
to do it.
"I have made up my mind to haul her off astern," answered
Kydd. "We will carry a kedge out in that direction.
" As you please," I said. "It may be right, but it may be
the wrong way."
"It is my way, at all events," was the petulant reply.
It was necessary to get the long-boat into the water to carry
out the kedge. Before this could be done, she had to be
cleared of all sorts of articles stowed in her. It took us some
time. The fate of their companions had thrown a damp over
the spirits of the men, and they did not work with their ordi-
nary activity. I could not help looking out seaward now and
then, thinking that heavier rollers might be coming in, when
our position would be truly dangerous. Where we were all
this time we could not ascertain,—whether we were on a sand-
bank at a distance from the coast, or on the coast itself. In
either case the danger was great. At last we got a kedge out
right astern, and the crew manned the capstan. They worked
away for some time. It seemed to me that the anchor was
coming home. I was sure of it indeed, for not an inch did
the vessel move. I meantime had got hold of the hand-lead,
and hove it ahead. There was ample water there, at all
events, for the brig to float. I then ran with it aft and
dropped it over the taffrail. The water was evidently much
shallower at that end of the ship. We had been working
away all that time, therefore, to haul her still faster on to the
bank. I was determined not to stand this any longer.
"Perhaps, Mr. Kydd, you will try the depth of the water
astern as well as ahead," I said; "and it strikes me that if we
were to attempt to haul her off the other way, we might have
a better chance of success."
"Leave that to me," he answered in the same tone as before.

AN IGNORANT GREENHORN.
" Round with the pauls, my lads," he sung out. "We will
soon have her afloat."
"I am not going to step another foot round the capstan
without I know that we are trying to haul off the right way,"
said Barker, who overheard what I had said.
This remark made the mate furious. The men followed
Barker's example. Mr. Kydd swore and stamped about the
deck, declaring that there was a mutiny.
"No mutiny, sir," answered old Barker; " but our lives are
worth as much to us as yours is to you."
"Take that then !" cried the mate, rushing forward toward
the old man and striking him a blow which brought him to
the deck. "Who is going to oppose me now?"
I thought the boatswain was killed, for he lay motionless.
The crew, indignant at the way one they looked upon as their
friend was treated, threw down the pauls, and refused to work
any longer. Jack Handspike alone remained firm in entreating
them to obey orders. "Mr. Kydd is now master of the ship,
and if we do not obey him, whom are we to obey ?" he said.
While the dispute was going on, the passengers taking no
part in it, the mist which had hitherto hung over the sea
slowly lifted, and looking to the eastward I saw a line of coast,
fringed with mangrove bushes, and blue mountains rising in
the distance. "The land I the land! we are all right!" cried
some of the crew. "I for one am not going to stop here and
be bullied by an ignorant greenhorn !" cried one. "Nor I,"
exclaimed another. "Well, mates, let us take the old boat-
swain, who was our friend at all times, and see what is to be
got on shore. Would any of you ladies and gentlemen like to
come with us?"
Captain Hyslop now stepped forward. "My men," he
said, "I know what you are likely to find on yonder coast,
and I entreat you to remain on board till we see if we can get

A STATE OF MUTINY.
41
the brig off. The probabilities are that the boat will be upset
in the surf as you attempt to land, and if not, when you get
on shore there are savage people, who are as likely as not to
murder you immediately."
"Oh, that's all humbug!" cried one of the men, "just to
make us remain. Mates, are we to go, or are we to stop and
get abused by this ignorant fellow ?"
The crew, one and all, with the exception of Handspike,
were in a state of mutiny. I spoke to them, but they would
not listen to me. "Well, you may go with us," they said,
" but go we will. We do not want to leave anybody behind."
Without attempting even to bring the anchor on board, they
lifted the still insensible boatswain into the boat, and in spite
of the entreaties of the ladies and Stanley's warnings, shoved
off. Kydd not till then seemed to recollect that he had
pistols in his belt. Drawing one, he senselessly fired, but the
men were too far off to be injured. They answered with
loud laughs and gestures of derision, and away they pulled.
We had now only one boat left, and she was too small to weigh
the anchor. I begged Stanley and David and one of the Mr.
Rowleys to come with me in her, however, to sound round
the vessel. Kydd by this time was almost beside himself
with rage, and did not interfere with us. We found, as I
suspected, that the brig had driven broadside on to a long
sandbank, an eighth of a mile in width, but how long we could
not tell, for the water was deep on the outer or port side of the
vessel; ahead it was also sufficiently deep to float her; and
should the wind come off shore, I was in great hopes that we
might yet forge her off. Astern, however, the water was far
more shallow; and, indeed, the senseless efforts which Kydd
had made had contributed to drag her still further on. It all
depended, however, upon the wind coming from the eastward.
A westerly wind must inevitably prove our destruction, as

THE CREW MURDERED BY NATIVES.
with the sea which broke against her in that perfect calm, it
was clear that the breeze would have the effect of driving her
further on, and sending the sea completely over her. Our
position was a truly fearful one. Stanley, however, who was
no seaman, did not seem to dread it so much, but Handspike
and Timbo fully agreed with me that we should be prepared
for the worst. Deserted by the crew, even should the wind
come off the shore, we could with difficulty make sail, and
then it would be a hard matter to navigate the vessel. We
only, hoped, however, that they would return on finding the
unattractive appearance of the coast. The mist clearing away
to the west, the rays of the sun glanced almost horizontally
across the waters, over which they cast a ruddy glow, showing
us the boat just as she reached the shore. I went aloft with
a spy-glass to watch her, and could make out a number of dark
figures hurrying down to the beach. She stopped for some
time when at no great distance, and the people in her seemed
to be holding a conversation with those on shore. She then
pulled on, and directly afterwards I saw her surrounded by the
dark figures, who seemed to be running her up the beach.
Presently, to my horror, I perceived some of the crew running,
and the blacks apparently pursuing them. Now one was
struck down, now another. It was too evident that the in-
fatuated men were being murdered by the savages. Soon all
pursuit ceased; and here and there I could see figures stretched
their length and motionless on the sand. Then I made out
a crowd of blacks dancing and leaping, so it seemed to me,
round the boat. A new alarm seized me. I was afraid that
they might attempt to come off, and treat us as they had done
the crew. Anxious to watch them, I did not descend till the
shades of night, which rapidly came on, hid them from my
sight. I then returned on deck, and taking Stanley and
David aside, told them what had occurred.

PETER TIMBO'S ADVICE.
43
"We must defend ourselves to the last," he answered, " if
they do come. It will be better to die fighting than let them
get on board. What do you advise ?"
"We have nearly a dozen muskets," I said, "and with our
two guns we may make a stout defence. I do not think they
would wish to encounter our firearms, even though they pos-
sibly have some themselves."
"I am afraid that fellow Kydd will be of no use to us,"
observed Stanley. "He seems beside himself. We will hear
what Timbo says, however. He knows more of these people
than any of us."
Timbo was standing at no great distance, and Stanley called
him up. I told him what I had seen.
"Not surprised," he observed. "De white men make dem
slave, and so when dey catch de white men dey kill dem.
Dat's it; but dey no come off at night. No fear of dat. Dey
t'ink we one slaver; and if we fired a gun, dey no come off at
all."
This information was cheering, as we thought we could rely
on Timbo's knowledge.
"Would you consent to go on shore and gain their friend-
ship?" I asked. "If they know that we are not their ene-
mies, they may possibly be disposed to help us; for as to
getting off the brig, I fear greatly it is not to be done."
He hesitated. "Yes," he said at length ; "I go to-morrow
morning. I talk deir lingo; and if dey come from up de
country, as I t'ink, I make friends wid dem."
I agreed to accompany him, with David and the younger
Mr. Rowley. Darkness at length came on; and as the mist
settled once more over the ocean we were unable to see many
fathoms on either side of the vessel. We made these arrange-
ments without consulting Kydd, for his conduct had been such
that we felt it would be useless ; indeed, when I looked round

KYDD'S TREACHERY.
I could not distinguish him on deck. All this time the brig
lay tolerably quiet, for though the sea every now and then
struck her, and I feared sent her even more on to the bank,
yet it did not break over sufficiently to wash anybody off the
deck; the after part, indeed, remained perfectly dry. Here
the ladies had collected, with the two boys, while the five
gentlemen passengers, Jack Handspike, Timbo, and I, busied
ourselves in getting up the muskets and ammunition for them
and the guns. "We are going to fire," I heard Stanley say,
and soon afterwards Timbo appeared with a hot poker from
the galley fire, and our guns were discharged in succession.
" Dat keep de niggers away," he observed, returning to the
galley. I was surprised that Kydd made no inquiry when the
guns were fired. As I was going aft I saw a figure come up
the companion-hatch. I could make out that he had a number
of packages under his arm. I was sure it was the mate, and
my suspicions were aroused, though I could scarcely tell what
he was going to do. I pointed him out to Stanley, who was
standing near the mainmast. "We will follow him, at all
events," he answered. As we got aft we saw him leaning
over the quarter, and evidently engaged in hauling up the
boat.
"Mr. Kydd, what are you about ?" exclaimed Stanley,
seizing him by the arm. "Are you going to leave the brig ?"
"I am captain, and who dares question me?" was the
* answer.
" You shall not deprive us of our only boat, at all events,"
said Stanley. "If you leave the vessel, it must be on a raft,
or swim for it."
Kydd made no answer, but continued leaning over the side.
We saw that he was dropping something into the boat. It
seemed that he was about at that instant to throw himself
over, when Stanley seized him and dragged him back. As hie

45
did so Kydd let go the painter, and before I could spring for-
ward and seize it, the boat had drifted away from the vessel.
I would have jumped overboard and swam to her, I was on
the point of doing so—when David, who had followed us,
stopped me. .
"Stay, Andrew !" he exclaimed. "We are surrounded by
sharks. I saw three just before dark. You would be their
prey in an instant."
Meantime Kydd was struggling with Stanley, who however
quickly overpowered him.
"I was not going to take the boat," said Kydd, " whatever
you may fancy. I am captain of this vessel, and I have a
right to do what I like. It was through your fault that the
boat got away, and you are answerable for that. Let me go,
I say !"
Stanley released Kydd, who slunk away without uttering
another word.
" This is not a time for disputes," said my cousin. "We
must be ready for resistance should the blacks come off to us ;
though I hope that Timbo is right in supposing that they will
not venture from the shore till daylight."
So short a time did the occurrence I have described take,
that the ladies were scarcely aware of what was happening
till it was over.
"What is the matter, Stanley ?" asked Kate.
"Nothing to alarm you, my dear sister. I trust all will
yet be well. There is every sign of the calm continuing; and
perhaps in the morning, when the wind comes off the land,
we may get the brig afloat. What do you say, Andrew?".
"I hope we may," I answered, " as she has not struck very
hard."
" Had not you and Bella better go below, Kate, with Miss
Rowley, and Leo and Natty will attend on you! We men

PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE.
must remain on deck to do what is necessary should any fresh
emergency arise."
Kate begged to remain also, but David, and the Rowleys
joining him, persuaded the young ladies at length to retire to
the cabin. Timbo followed them to light the cabin lamp, and
I saw them, as I looked through the sky-light, seated at the
table, Kate having a large book before her, which I recognized
as the old captain's Bible. She was reading from it to her com-
panions, the two boys and Bella listening with earnest looks,
though Miss Rowley seemed to be too much alarmed to pay
any attention. The young Irishman and the two Rowleys
now exerted themselves as much as the rest of us in making
preparations to defend the vessel.
" If there were boarding-nettings, we should find them use-
ful," said Stanley. "Mr. Kydd, have you any on board ?"
"No, sir," was the answer. "We do not carry such things;
and, for my part, I think all this preparation is useless. The
blacks are not likely to come off to attack us, and if they do,
we could very soon drive them back again."
" If we are properly prepared we may," said my cousin ; and
we all continued the work we had in hand.
• Besides the firearms we had a few ship's cutlasses ; and at
Timbo's suggestion we fastened all the knives and axes we
could find to some long spars, to use them as boarding-pikes.
We ran lines also along the sides between the rigging to answer
in a measure the purpose of boarding-nettings; and before the
morning broke, we were as well prepared as we could expect
to be to resist an attack. We were looking out for the rising
sun, when I felt a light wind fan my cheek. I said nothing,
but again I felt it blow stronger.
"We shall have the wind off the shore soon," I cried out,
"and we must be ready to trim sails to make the most of it."
"Who is issuing orders on board this vessel ?" I heard


## p. 47 (#51) ##############################################

A BREEZE OFF THE SHORE.
47
Kyild exclaim. "Mr. Crawford, I am the man to say what is
to be done."
"If you will tell us what to do, we will take good care to
do it," Stanley said to me, in a low voice. "There is little
use in listening to that fellow."
The breeze came stronger and stronger; and by the time
the first streaks of early dawn appeared over the land, there
was a strongish breeze blowing, hot, and smelling of the arid
sand and damp mangrove marshes."
"Faith, there is but little of the spices of Araby," I heard
Terence O'Brien observe to one of his friends.
" Those who know how to handle ropes, come and help me to
trim the sails," exclaimed Kydd. "Handspike, you are the
only man under my orders. You go to the helm."
We all set to work to trim the sails. Senhor Silva and
his servant, who had hitherto not done much, now joined
with a will. The canvas blew out, and the yards creaked
and strained, but not an inch was the vessel moved. Kydd
then ordered us to run fore and aft; but the light weight
of a few people on board the stout brig produced no percep-
tible effect.
" Had we the boat, and could we carry an anchor out, we
might get the brig off," I observed to Stanley. "But, I fear,
now it is hopeless, unless, indeed, we were to build a raft.
With that we may do something, though there will be no
slight risk in the undertaking."
"If you think it can be done, we will do it," said Stanley.
"Certainly," I said, "it is our only chance."
"Then it shall be done," he exclaimed. "Mr. Kydd, we
wish to build a raft to carry out the anchor."
Kydd was about to reply, but the captain's look silenced
him. All hands now set to work to collect all the spare spars
and planks to be found. We got up also a number of small

casks from below, in which palm-oil was to be stowed; and
this assisted us greatly.
"Massa," said Timbo, coming up to Stanley, "me t'ink it
better to have two raft. Suppose no get de brig off, den we
want dem to get away. Suppose de niggers come off, den
what we do? We not stay here for eber."
"A wise suggestion, Timbo," said his master. " Crawford,
will you undertake to build another raft? Mr. Kydd seems
busy with the one forward."
Senhor Silva and his servant had, they told us, once assisted
in building a raft to escape from a wreck, and were well able
to lend a hand. While the rest of the party were collecting
materials, I went aloft, anxious to see what the negroes on
shore were about. The mist which usually hangs over the
land at early dawn had by this time disappeared. With my
glass I could distinguish the boat on the beach, and a number
of people moving about. As, however, they did not seem
preparing to launch her, I hoped that we might have time, at
all events, to get our rafts ready; and quickly again descended
with the satisfactory intelligence. Believing that there was
but little prospect of getting the vessel off, we did not scruple
to use the hatches and bulkheads, and, indeed, to rip off the
inner planking. It would require, we saw, two rafts of con-
siderable size to carry so many people with any degree of
safety even in smooth water. Still, what other prospect had
we of saving our lives? I had not for a moment allowed my
mind to dwell more than I could help on our too possible
fate; indeed, it would almost have unmanned me to contem-
plate the hardships to which the young ladies must inevitably
be exposed even at the best. However, we were doing all
that men could do under the circumstances, and that kept up
our spirits. Kydd had become somewhat humbled by this
time, and worked away like the rest of us, without taking any

leading part; indeed, several of the rest of the party were far
more expert in constructing the rafts than he was.
The water, as I said, remained smooth inside of us. We
now set to work to launch our rafts. Kydd took charge of
the one forward; I of the after one, at the construction of
which I had assisted. Having cut away the bulwarks, we
worked them over the side with the capstan bars, and then
lowered them as gently as we could with ropes. Mine, I
found, was somewhat the largest, and floated higher than
the other out of the water. We had now to fit masts and
sails to them. Fortunately there was a number of spare
oars on board, so that our time was not occupied in making
fresh ones. I however thought it well to have one long one
to serve as a mast. The important business of provisioning
our rafts had next to be attended to. We first got up four
water-casks, which we secured in the centre of the raft. Round
them we formed a strong railing, with a raised platform, on
which a few of the party could sit well out of the water,
which I feared, as soon as there was any sea, would wash over
the main part.
I saw Kydd hurrying on with his preparations. "Now,
Miss Rowley," he said, "I hope you will entrust yourself to
my charge. I ought to know better how to manage a raft
than those landsmen," and he cast a glance at me; "and I
promise to take good care of you and your brothers."
I did not hear what the young lady said, but directly after-
wards I saw her being lowered down on to Kydd's raft.
Her brothers and the young Irishman followed.
"Come, Handspike; we want you," sung out Kydd, stand-
ing up on the raft.
"No, no," answered Handspike. "The landsmen, as you
say, will want my help, and I must go aboard the other."
While this was going on, I saw that Timbo had gone aloft.

LEAVING THE BRIG.
Presently he came gliding down by a backstay on deck.
"Quick ! quick! Massa Andrew," he exclaimed. "No time
to lose ! De niggers coming off in de boat! If we stop and
fight, dey take away de rafts. If we sail off, dey come
Saboard vessel, and stop and steal and get drunk, and we get
away."
Kydd overheard him. "Shove off !" he cried out to his
companions. They obeyed him; and immediately the raft
was clear of the vessel, he began to hoist his sail.
"Stop! stop !" I cried out. "Take more of our party on
board! Senhor Silva and his servant will go with you !"
He paid no attention to my shouts, but continued hoisting
his sail, though I saw the gentlemen on board were expostu-
lating with him.
"We must all go, then, on the one raft," I said. "I trust
it will hold us, although it was treacherous of the mate to go
away, leaving the party thus unequally divided."
"I am sorry our friends are under no better charge," said
Stanley. "But, Andrew, we are ready to place ourselves
under your and Handspike's guidance. Timbo, too, will be
of no slight service; so that we need not complain of what
has occurred. We have no time to lose, though."
Jack and Timbo now going on to the raft, assisted the rest
of the party to descend. I was the last to leave the unfortu-
nate brig. As I looked round I did not see Natty. "Where
can he be?" I exclaimed. I sprang up the side. My young
charge had fallen on the deck, and lay concealed from those
on the raft by the bulwarks in the fore part of the vessel.
"Hold on for a moment," I cried out; "I will bring him
down to you." I lifted the poor boy up in my arms. A fall-
ing block or spar, I conjectured, had struck his head and stunned
him. Had I not discovered his absence, how dreadful would
have been his fate left alone on board the brig. To my great

joy he soon recovered. Jack Handspike received him in his
arms as I lowered him down, and I following, without delay

hoped, not hurry themselves in coming off, so that we might
have a considerable start of them should they pursue us.
The raft was, as may be supposed, deeper in the water than
I could have wished; at the same time, in that sunooth sea,
it was well capable of supporting us all. My hope was that
we should be picked up by some cruiser or passing merchant
vessel, and that we might not have long to remain on it. Still,
the risk was a fearful one, but it seemed better than ventur-
ing to the shore after we had discovered the savage disposi-
tion of the natives. If they had murdered the seamen, there
was no reason to suppose that we should escape the same
treatment.
The mate's raft, being lighter, had already got a consider-
able distance ahead. Our sail, however, was larger than his;
and as we had hands enough to lower it quickly, we could
venture to carry it longer in the increasing breeze. We got
out the oars also, which contributed to urge the raft through
the water. We thus, in a short time, had nearly overtaken
the mate and his companions. Few of us spoke much. We
were all too anxious for talking. Senhor Silva advised that
we should alter our course, as soon as we had got out of sight
of the brig, to the southward, hoping that we might be picked
up by some vessel bound to Loando, the nearest European
settlement on the coast. One thing was certain, that should
the wind shift to the eastward we should have no choice, but
should be compelled to run back for the land. .
We had placed Kate and Bella on the most secure part of
the raft, with the two boys, while we spread a piece of
awning, which projected a little way over their heads, thus
affording them some shelter from the hot rays of the sun.
The water remained smooth, and was bright and clear; and
could we have forgotten that it might at any moment be tossed
into huge waves, there was little to give us a sense of danger.

THE BLACKS AT THE BRIG.
53
Jack Handspike was at the heln, and tended the sheets while
the rest of us pulled ; I kept an eye on the halliards, ready
to let go should the breeze increase too much for our sail. We
had brought a telescope, through which, every now and then,
I took a glance astern to ascertain whether the negroes had
reached the brig. We were gradually getting to a distance
from her, so that our white sails would have looked almost
like specks on the ocean, unless seen through a spy-glass, and
those that remained on board we hoped the savages would not
know how to use. Presently I saw the bright flash of a gun,
and, a few seconds after, the sound came booming across the
water; then, once more looking through the glass, I caught
sight of several dark objects moving above the bulwarks. There
was no doubt that the blacks must have reached the vessel ;
but whether or not they had discovered us remained un-
certain. All we could do was to use our best exertions in
getting away from them, by rowing as hard as we could and
keeping our sails spread to the breeze. By this time we had
come abreast of the other raft. I hailed her, and told what
I had seen.
"Never fear," cried out Kydd. "We will drive them back
if they do come."
He exhibited several muskets which he had placed on his
raft. We also had taken a couple, and a small quantity of
ammunition.
We had got some little way ahead of the other raft, when
I proposed hauling down the sail, not to run away from her.
I was about to do so, when the wind, which had hitherto been
getting somewhat lighter, fell altogether, and we were left on
a perfect sea of glass, the other raft being about a quarter of
a mile away from us. The heat was very great ; and as we
had been rowing all day, we felt scarcely capable of further
exertion. We had also, we hoped, got beyond the reach of

A NIGHT ON THE RAFT.
the negroes, as it was not likely they would follow us so far
out to sea. Timbo asserted that they were black fellows from
the interior, as he did not think the coast natives would have
murdered the crew. As we had brought an ample supply of
provisions, we took our meals regularly. Timbo bad provided
a small charcoal stove, with which we could boil water, and
make our tea and coffee-a great luxury under the circum-
stances. We had, however, to economize our fuel, of which
there was but a small quantity. Considering all things, our
spirits rose wonderfully; and I believe every one of us hoped
before long to fall in with a vessel and be taken on board.
"Our friends on the other raft seem to be making them-
selves merry," observed Stanley. "Listen. They are singing!"
So indeed they were. The sound of their voices, though so
far off, reached us across the smooth water. We had brought
some cloaks, with which we wrapped the young ladies up;
and they lay down on the platform I have described, under
the awning, to sleep, the remainder of us dividing ourselves
into watches. The watch below, as we called it, placed them-
selves on the other side of the platform, to seek such rest as
could be found. I know, when it was my turn to lie down, I
slept as soundly as I had ever done in my life. The two boys
lay down close together ; but during the night I heard poor
Natty sobbing. He had awoke, it seemed, and recollected his
loss. It was sad to hear him in the still silence of the night
out there on the ocean. Poor fellow 1 he at length sobbed
himself to sleep again.
I woke up, feeling a gentle moving of the raft, and, rising
to my feet, found that the night wind had again come off the
shore, though it seemed rather more to the northward than
before. We again hoisted the sail, as we were not far enough
out to be in the track of any traders.
The night at length came to an end ; and when the dawn

WHERE ARE OUR FRIENDS ?
55
once more broke, we found the same mist as on the two pre-
vious mornings hanging over the ocean. The young ladies
and the boy were still sleeping. We looked round, but could
nowhere discover our companions. That was, however, what
might be expected, as the mist greatly circumscribed our view.
I was standing by Timbo's side.
"I fear dis calm weader not last much longer," he observed
to me. "I hope we soon get aboard ship; for if it come on
to blow, den we in bad way."
"We must pray to Heaven to protect us," I said.
"Yes, Massa Andrew. If Heaben no protect us, den it be
bery, bery bad indeed."
"We must not, however, alarm the young ladies," I ob-
served; "so do not express your fears, but let us pray that a
vessel may be sent to relieve us. Now, I think we had better
prepare breakfast. It will cheer our spirits."
Soon after this Kate and little Bella appeared from under
their awning.
"My father would have had prayers, I think," said Natty to
me, in a low voice.
"He would, I am sure; and so will we," I answered ; and
before going to our meal, we offered up a prayer to Heaven for
our protection, and Kate read a chapter from her Bible,
which she had not forgotten to bring.
The hours after this sped slowly on. Once more the mist
lifted. We looked round for the raft. It was nowhere to be
seen.
"I trust no accident has happened to it," said Stanley. "It
would be a sad fate for the Rowleys and that pretty girl."
I could not suppose this, and yet I could not account for
its disappearance should Kydd have continued steering the
course we had agreed on. On sweeping the horizon with my
glass, I made out a small sail in the distance to the southward.

56
A SAIL SIGHTED.
It was, however, so far off, that, in consequence of the slight
mist which still remained, I could not be certain whether it
was the top-gallant sail of some ship rising above the water or
the bow-sail of the raft. I gave the glass to Jack Hand-
spike.
"To my mind it is the raft," he said. "The lighter sails
of a large vessel would not look so clear as that does."
If Jack was right, there could be no doubt that the mate
had purposely altered his course for the sake of getting away
from us. I could not help thinking that he was fully capable
of such treachery. Soon after this, again sweeping the horizon
with the glass, my eye fell on the topsails of a vessel far away
to the north-west. I pointed it out to Jack, and both he and
Timbo were of opinion that she was standing toward us on a
wind, and that if we continued running as we were doing, she
would before long be up with us.

CHAPTER III.
ON BOARD THE SCHOONER.
A YUR spirits, which had naturally been at a low ebb,
oh were greatly cheered by the sight of the strange sail.
Ba S he had evidently a strong breeze with her, stronger
than we should like when it reached us, as it pro-
bably would do before long. Already, indeed, it
had freshened, and the sea had got up considerably.
This made us more than ever anxious to be seen and taken on
board. Gradually her topsails rose above the horizon. We
watched her anxiously. Although we were not seen, Timbo
and Leo could not resist an impulse to stand up and wave
towards the stranger. She was standing steadily to the south-
ward, gradually edging in towards the land. Our hopes
increased of cutting her off. We made her out to be a large
topsail schooner—a rakish-looking craft. Nearer and nearer
she drew. Still she came on so fast that we began to fear
that we should not get sufficiently to the westward to be seen,
for though we could make her out clearly, and could now see
her hull, we were so low in the water, that unless those on
board were keeping a bright look-out, they might easily pass us.
"What do you think, Timbo? Shall we get up with her ?"
asked Stanley.
" Not quite sure, massa. If dey look dis way, den dey see

We had no flag or any spare spar to raise above the mast.
We could only, therefore, make all the speed possible, still
hoping to cut her off.
"Why not fire our muskets ?" said David. "Their sound
will surely reach the vessel, and call the attention of those on
board to us."
"A good idea," I exclaimed; "get the muskets ready."
Stanley was to fire one and Jack the other at the same
moment, for we feared that we should not otherwise be heard.
"Now is the time to fire," I said; "and we will continue
till we wake up the crew of the stranger." The muskets were

fired, but no change in her course was observed. "We must
fire again as fast as we can load," I said; and we kept blazing
away every three or four minutes.
At length Jack Handspike gave a loud shout. The schooner
was coming up to the wind. Her foretopsail was thrown
aback, and she lay hove to. "We are seen! We are seen!"
we exclaimed, one after the other. Presently a boat was
lowered; she came gliding over the water towards us. As she
approached we saw that she had a crew of dark, swarthy men,
evidently not English. They hailed us in a foreign language.
Senhor Silva replied, and a short conversation ensued.
"They are my countrymen," he said, for he spoke English
well. "The schooner is, I understand, a Portuguese man-of-
war, and you will be kindly treated on board."
"We are indeed fortunate," said Stanley.
"Oh! say rather that God has been very merciful to us,"
said Kate, looking out towards the beautiful vessel which rose
and fell on the fast increasing seas at no great distance from
us.
" The officer desires to know whether you would like to be
towed on board or would prefer getting into the boat," said
Senhor Silva.
I was naturally anxious to preserve the raft, and begged
that we might be towed; but Stanley requested that his sisters
and the boys, at all events, should be taken into the boat.
Senhor Silva joined them. We now proceeded rapidly towards
the vessel. I saw Timbo and Jack eyeing her narrowly.
"She seems to be a fine man-of-war schooner," I observed,
"and a craft of which the slavers must have no little dread.
We thought the Osprey a clipper, but yonder schooner, I
suspect, could easily have walked round her."
"Not know 'xactly," observed Timbo. "She may be man-
of-war schooner, but she very like some slavers I have seen."

RECEIVED ON BOARD.
"Senhor Silva surely must know," I observed, "and he
told us positively that she was a man-of-war."
When we got near the schooner the boat cast off, Senhor
Silva saying that he would go on board, and send her back
for us.
"I wish I had gone with them," observed Stanley on hear-
ing this. "I do not like their appearing on board a strange
vessel without David or me to protect them."
"Oh, but Leo will do that," said David. "He is quite
escort enough for them till we can get alongside."
As we approached still nearer the schooner we hauled
down our sail. In a short time the boat returned and towed
us alongside. The crew of the stranger were looking out
eagerly at us over the bulwarks, and ropes were now thrown
to assist us in getting on deck. An officer stood at the gang-
way and politely welcomed Stanley, Senhor Silva who stood
by interpreting for him. Kate was seated on a chair, with
Bella by her side.
"Oh, they are very kind and polite," she said to her
brother as soon as he went up to her. "This is indeed a
fine man-of-war."
She was certainly a remarkably fine vessel, and I saw that
she mounted six broadside guns and a long gun forward; but
as I had not been on board many English men-of-war, and
never any foreigners, I was not well able to judge of her.
She had a numerous crew, of every colour and shade, from the
fair European down to the dark tint of the darkest African.
Our stores and the various articles we brought on the ra?t
were now hoisted on board, and the structure which had
cost us so much pains to build was cast adrift. The officers, I
observed, all wore jackets and straw caps, which I fancied was
not usual for officers of men-of-war; but probably on account of
the heat of the climate the usual custom was departed from,

POLITE TREATMENT.
61
Senhor Silva and the captain of the schooner were walking
up and down the deck conversing eagerly. At length Senhor
Silva stopped as he was passing me, and said, "I have found
an old friend in the captain of the Andorinha (the Sea
Swallow), and we are happy to meet each other again. He
begs that you and our other friends will consider yourselves
as welcome and honoured guests on board. I have told him
that we have lost sight of the other raft, and he promises to
keep a look-out for her. He has already given directions to
have cabins prepared for you, and begs that you will make
yourself as thoroughly at home as possible."
This was indeed satisfactory news. Timbo, Jack, and
Ramaon were sent forward, where they were well received by
the crew; for although Jack could not make himself understood,
nor understand what was said, Ramaon was always ready to
interpret for him. The wind, which had been for some time
increasing, now blew half a gale, and we had great reason to
be thankful that we had got on board so fine a craft. The
captain insisted on giving up his cabin to Kate and Bella,
and Stanley and David had another prepared close to them,
while a third was devoted to the accommodation of Senhor
Silva and I, the two boys being placed in another rather
more forward. Not only were we comfortably accommodated,
but a handsome dinner was, soon after we got on board, placed
on the table. The captain announced himself as Senhor
Marques da Costa. He was very polite, and a good-looking
man, though somewhat dark even for a Portuguese. This, I
concluded, arose from having been a long time on the coast.
He understood but little English, so we had to carry on our
conversation chiefly through our friend Senhor Silva. He,
however, never seemed tired of interpreting for us. When
the captain heard that we wished to proceed to the Cape, he
expressed his regret that his duties required him to remain on

A PLEASANT TIME.
the coast. He could not, he said, indeed promise to land us,
for some little time, at Loando, but he begged to assure us
that we were heartily welcome on board. Several of the
officers sang very well, and after dinner guitars were produced,
and they sang numbers of their national songs: somewhat die-
away sort of melodies I thought them, but Kate said they
were very pretty, and expressed a wish to learn the guitar.
Directly one of the officers undertook to instruct her, and
presented her with a handsome instrument, which he said he
hoped she would keep in remembrance of her visit to the
Andorinha. The time thus passed very pleasantly on board.
Still having some doubts from what Timbo had said about the
vessel, I asked Jack, whom I met the next morning, what he
thought of her.
"Well, sir," he answered, "the people seem a free-and-easy
set, rather fond of gambling—but that's the way with these
foreigners; and most of them wear long ugly knives stuck in
their belts, which is not the fashion with English seamen ;
but these Portuguese are odd fellows, and that is how I
accounts for it."
With Timbo I had no opportunity for some time of speak-
ing. Next morning I saw that the Portuguese flag was flying
from the schooner's peak, while a pennant waved from her
mast-head. Certainly the officers did their best to amuse
their fair guests and us. Next day, after dinner, some of the
men were called aft to dance their national dances, but I can't
say much for them. I saw that one or two of the men were
always aloft on the look-out, and while the crew were engaged
as I have before described, one of the look-outs gave a shout
from aloft, and presently two of the officers went up the rig-
ging with glasses at their backs. I saw them looking eagerly
to the southward. Presently they returned on deck and re-
ported their observations to the captain. The breeze, which

A STRANGER IN SIGHT.
63
had before been fresh, had by degrees been falling, and now
failing us altogether, the schooner lay becalmed with her sails
flapping against the masts. From this I concluded that a sail
had been sighted—a slaver possibly. The officers continued
talking together, while one of them, who had gone aloft, re-
mained there, his eye constantly fixed in the direction in
which I supposed he had seen the stranger. I was about
to go aloft with my spy-glass, when Senhor Silva came on
deck.
"The captain says that passengers going up the rigging will
interfere with the duty of the ship," he observed; "you must
remain on deck."
I thought this was very odd, but of course obeyed. The
schooner lay without moving on the calm ocean. Some time
passed. The officers continued pacing the deck, looking even
more anxious, I fancied, than before. At length, as I swept
the horizon with my telescope, I observed a white sail rising
above it. I looked again, and made out the royals and part of
the top-gallant-sails of a square-rigged vessel. I shut up my
glass quickly, however, as I saw the captain looking somewhat
angrily towards me.
"You had better go below," said Senhor Silva, coming up
to me. "Ask no questions, and do not say what you have
seen. It will be better for you to do as I advise, and before
long I will explain matters to you."
As I had no inclination to go below, I begged to be excused
doing so; indeed, I was anxious to learn the character of the
stranger, and to observe what was going forward.
"Well, do as you like," said Senhor Silva; "bat I tell you
your presence on deck may possibly annoy our friends."
The stranger approached rapidly, bringing up the breeze
with her. Presently the captain issued some orders to his
crew, and a number of them went aloft with buckets of water,

A CHASE.
with which they drenched the upper sails. In a short time
some cat's-paws began to play over the ocean, our royals swelled
out to the breeze, and the helm being put up, we stood away
to the northward. Still the vessel in the south-west, having
far more wind, quickly overhauled us. Our lower sails were
now wetted, and every inch of canvas the schooner could carry
was packed on her. I soon discovered that, instead of pur-
suing, we were pursued by the stranger. This, if the schooner
we were aboard was a man-of-war, seemed unaccountable.
Portugal was at peace, so I fancied, with all the world; besides
which, the stranger did not appear very much larger than the
schooner—a craft which, if she was of the character Senhor
Silva had asserted, was not likely to run away. In a short
time I made out the stranger to be a brig with taunt masts
and square yards-remarkably like a man-of-war. As she
drew nearer I saw, to my astonishment, the glorious old flag
of England waving from her peak. I looked and looked again.
I could not be mistaken. The schooner, now beginning to
feel the wind, made rapid way through the water; which,
stirred up into wavelets, hissed and bubbled under her bows as
her stem clove a passage through it. Faster and faster we
went, as the breeze, which had now overtaken us, increased,
and, filling our sails, made the yards and masts crack and
crack again. The countenances of the officers, as they saw the
speed at which we were going, brightened considerably, and I
saw them smiling as they gazed astern at our pursuer. Pre-
sently a puff of smoke issued from the bows of the brig, and
the sound of a gun was heard across the ocean. Another and
another followed. The Portuguese only laughed, and made
mocking gestures towards the brig. I was glad that Kate
and her brothers were below, for they naturally would have
been anxious at seeing what was going forward. The An-
dorinha was undoubtedly a fast craft, and there seemed little

OUR PURSUER.
65
probability, if the breeze continued, of the brig overhauling us.
That she was a British man-of-war, I had no longer any doubt.
What then could be the schooner? It was now late in the
day, and I saw that there was every probability of her escap-
ing. Still, unless she was a slaver, I could not account for the
anxiety of her crew to avoid communication with the British
man-of-war. The Portuguese crew made every effort to keep
ahead, by throwing water on the sails as soon as they dried.
Sails were also rigged close down to the water on either side,
and several of the crew went below with shot, which they
slung in hammocks in the hold, under the idea, I believe, that
their weight, as the vessel pitched into the seas, would urge
her forward. Two of the officers were at the helm steering
her, every now and then exchanging remarks as to the best
course to be pursued. The brig, I saw, was also doing her
utmost to come up with us, and had also rigged out studding-
sails on either side, with lighter sails above the royals, often
called sky-scrapers, as well as sails hanging from the lower
studding-sail booms. The Portuguese colours were flying at
the peak of the schooner, but I observed that the pennants
had been hauled down. Again the brig fired, but without any
other effect than making the captain utter a low scornful
laugh, and drawing from the crew gestures of contempt.
When I first saw the brig I had hopes that we should be able
to get aboard her; for, polite as Senhor Silva and the Portu-
guese captain were, I could not help wishing, for my fair
cousins' sakes at all events, that we were in better company.
Night was drawing on. It threatened to be dark, for there
was no moon, and I saw the mist rising which so often hangs
over the water in those latitudes, near the coast. Still, astern
I could distinguish the brig standing on in our wake with all
the sail she had hitherto carried, in spite of the still increasing
breeze. The Portuguese captain and his officers stood care-

OUT OF SIGHT.
fully watching their spars strained to the utmost by the almost
cracking canvas, every now and then glancing astern at their
pursuer. I kept my eye fixed on her. Now it seemed to me
that she was again coming up with us. My hopes revived
that she would bring the schooner to, and settle the doubts as
to her character. As I was looking at her, I saw what looked
like a vast cloud floating away from her mast-head. Some of
the Portuguese saw it too, and cheered loudly. Her top-gallant-
sails, if not her topsails, had been blown away, probably with
their respective masts; but the thickening gloom prevented us
seeing the exact nature of the damage she had received. The
Portuguese no longer feared being overtaken, but still they
continued standing on as before. A few minutes afterwards
we altogether lost sight of the brig. The mist, as I expected,
came on, and at length the steward announcing supper, being
very hungry, I went below to partake of it. The Portuguese
captain and Senhor Silva were in very good spirits, and cour-
teous as usual. I had said nothing about the brig, and was
about to mention her appearance when Senhor Silva stopped
me.
"There is no use talking about that matter, Mr. Crawford,"
he observed. "The young ladies will not be interested by it,
and-you understand me,I will explain matters by-and-by."
Of course after this I said nothing, and we all parfed, when
we retired to our berths, very good friends. The next day no
sail was in sight. My cousins were on deck, and the officers
treated them with the same attention as at first. With Timbo
I had not exchanged words, but I got an opportunity at last
of speaking to Jack Handspike without being observed. I
asked him if he had seen the man-of-war brig, and what he
thought of the matter.
"Yes, I did see her, and a rum thing I thought it for another
man-of-war of a friendly nation to run away from her. To

DOUBTS AS TO SCHOONER'S CHARACTER.
67
tell you the truth, Mr. Crawford, I have a notion that this here
craft"
What he was going to say I could not tell, for at that
moment one of the Portuguese officers passing, took my arm,
and led me to where Senhor Silva was standing.
"Our friends do not like to see you talking to your people,"
he observed in an undertone. "Remember they do not know
who we are, and they have some suspicion as to our character."
I thought the excuse a poor one, but yet was unwilling to
give any offence, and therefore refrained from again addressing
either Jack or the black.
For two days the schooner continued out of sight of land;
but the third morning when I came on deck I found that she
had been headed in towards it, and as soon as the sea-breeze
commenced she ran in under all sail towards the mouth of a
river which opened out ahead of us. On either side were dense
woods of mangroves, appearing to grow directly out of the
water, while on our starboard hand was a glittering sand-
bank, and stretching across the river appeared a line of white
breakers, which I fancied must completely bar our ingress.
David came on deck at that moment. I pointed them out to
him. "Surely we cannot be going in there ?" he said. Just
then Senhor Silva came up to us and said the captain begged
that we and all idlers would go below, as we were about to
cross the bar, and that as occasionally the seas broke on board
in so doing, it might be dangerous to remain on deck. We
could but obey. What could take us into the river? I wondered.
Presently I felt the vessel rise to a sea, then she pitched into
it, then rose again, and in a few minutes she was gliding on in
smooth water. I thought we must be inside the river, but
again I felt her rise and once more pitch two or three times,
then again she glided on as before. From this I knew that we
must have passed over two bars, such as are frequently found

at the mouths of the rivers on the west coast of Africa.
"What can the vessel be about ?" said David. I could not
enlighten him; and at length, wishing to satisfy our curi-
osity, we made our way on deck. We were running up the
river, with thick woods on either side. It had the appear-
ance of a long lake, for we had already lost sight of the sea,
though I knew by the current in which direction it was. In a
short time we caught sight of a number of low cottages and
sheds standing in a cleared space at a little distance from the
banks. The crew sprang aloft and furled sails, and in a few
minutes the schooner was brought to an anchor. Several
canoes now came alongside, and in one of them was a fat black
fellow with a cocked hat and red jacket, and a piece of stuff
which looked very like an old flannel petticoat fastened round
his waist. The captain bowed very politely to him, as did his
officers, and he returned the salute in the same fashion. I
asked Senhor Silva who he was ?
"Oh, he is King Mungo," he said; "a very important
person in these regions. The schooner has come here on a
diplomatic mission, and though he is an ugly-looking savage,
we must treat him with every respect."
After the first greetings were over the captain ushered King
Mungo and three of his sable attendants, dressed in old nan-
keen jackets and tarry trousers, into the cabin. Kate's aston-
ishment was naturally very great when she saw them. His
majesty bowed to her with profound respect; and I saw him
afterwards, whenever he had the opportunity, casting glances
of admiration at her. Senhor Silva accounted to Captain
Hyslop, as he had done to me, for our entering the river.
"If we are to wait any time, I should like to go ashore and
see the nature of the country," said Stanley. "We shall pro-
bably be able to get a little sport."
Senhor Silva hesitated, and then addressed the Portuguese

captain. "King Mungo declines to guarantee your safety,
and without that it would be madness to go into the interior,"
he answered.
"But we can keep along the banks of the river, and we may
find some sport there," said Stanley.
Again Senhor Silva brought forward many reasons for this
being inadvisable. "To say the truth," he added, " as I
before explained to our young friend here, my countrymen do
not altogether trust us, and it would not be wise to offend
them."
This answer did not satisfy Stanley, but he made no re-
mark. Wine and spirits were now placed on the table. His
majesty, I observed, after taking a glass or two of the former,
applied himself with warm interest to the latter beverage,
which soon produced a visible effect. His eyes rolled, and he
began to talk away in a thick, husky voice. Senhor Silva
again whispered a few words to Stanley, who thereon recom-
mended Kate and Bella to retire to their cabin. It now ap-
peared to me that the captain and King Mungo were warmly
engaged in bargaining; judging by their gestures and way of
speaking. The captain pressed more spirits on his guest. He
would, it seemed, have continued drinking till he was unable
to move, had not one of his attendants whispered in his ear,
and at length snatched the glass out of his hand. The bargain-
ing now once more went on, and seemed to be concluded to
the satisfaction of both parties. At length his majesty rose,
and supported by his attendants, made his way on deck,
whence he was lowered in no very dignified state into his
canoe. He was followed on shore by the captain and two of
his officers, and a boat's crew well armed. I observed that
the schooner's guns were run over to the side nearest the
village, which they thus completely commanded. As he was
shoving off Stanley begged that he and I might be allowed to

accompany him. David evidently wished to go, but told me
that he would remain for the protection of his sisters.
"I do not quite like the look of things," he said ; "and
take care that you and my brother do not go far from the
shore."
I said I would be cautious, and persuade Stanley to follow
his advice. Scarcely had we landed when there appeared,
coming through the woods, a long line of men, women, and
children, walking one behind the other. As they drew nearer
I saw that they were bound together with rough ropes fastened
tightly to their necks by collars. At intervals at their sides
walked several savage-looking blacks, with muskets on their
shoulders and thick whips in their hands. There were a dozen
or more huts built of bamboo, the walls and roofs covered with
the leaves of the palm-tree. Some were of good size, from
twenty to fifty feet in length, and of considerable breadth.
At the further end of the village was another, three or four
times the size of the largest. Stanley and I made our way
towards it, but the disagreeable odour which proceeded from
it as we approached almost drove us back. We persevered,
however, and on looking through the door our indignation was
excited to find that it was full of human beings—a dense mass,
packed almost as closely as they could exist. They were
sitting down in rows, and on a nearer examination we dis-
covered, to our horror, that they were secured to long bars
which ran across the building. Below were rough benches on
which they might sit, but they could only move a foot or two
to the right hand or the left. There were men, women, and
children. Many of the poor little creatures were crying
bitterly, while their mothers were moaning and weeping, as
they tried to comfort them. Some of the men were trying to
sing, as if to show indifference to their sufferings, but the
greater number sat supporting their heads on their knees, with

looks expressive of despair. Outside were several savage-
looking negroes armed with muskets, who every now and then
took glances through openings in the side into the interior, to
observe, apparently, if any of the prisoners were trying to
escape.
"Why, these poor beings must be slaves; and, Andrew, the
schooner must be a slaver," exclaimed my cousin.
" There is no doubt about the matter," I answered. "I
have for some time suspected it; nay, I was almost certain of
the fact when she ran away from the English man-of-war.
What do you advise, Stanley ?"
" That we leave her immediately," he answered.
"But where are we to go?" I asked.
" Anywhere, rather than remain on board so abominable a
craft," he replied.
"That may be very difficult, if not impossible," I remarked.
"We cannot leave her in this place, and I am afraid that the
captain would not venture near any English settlement to
land us."
"We must try him, however," he said. "We must bribe
him. I would pay any amount I can command to be quit
of her."
We agreed to keep Kate in ignorance as long as possible. Just
then two white men appeared on horseback, swarthy, ill-look-
ing fellows, one tall and thin, and the other short and paunchy,
both dressed alike in wide-brimmed straw hats and nankeen
jackets and trousers. We found that they were the principal
slave-dealers on the coast, having, as we afterwards discovered,
several barracoons at numerous other stations, and parties con-
stantly engaged in capturing and purchasing slaves. The
party of slaves who had just arrived were made to halt, and sit
down on the ground under the shade of the barracoons. After
this several men opened the front of the building, and led out

the slaves, linking them together as the others had been. In this
state they were marched down to the water's edge, where two
dozen or more large canoes had collected. As soon as these were
filled they pulled away towards the schooner. I counted the
blacks as they passed, and at least two hundred human beings,
including several small children, were carried on board the
vessel. The captain of the slaver touched me on the shoulder
and pointed to the boat, signifying that we were to return
on board. We of course obeyed-indeed, what else could
we do l—though we intended to beg Senhor Silva to request
him to land us at the nearest European settlement, either
Portuguese or French, if he would not take us to an Eng-
lish one, which, of course, we could scarcely expect him
to do.
As soon as we reached the vessel the anchor was hove up,
and, towed by several boats and canoes, she proceeded down
towards the bar. We found our friends in great agitation on
board on discovering the character of the vessel. Kate was
almost in tears.
"Poor creatures! Where are they going to carry them to
in that dark hold? Why, there is scarcely room I should
think for one hundred, instead of the number who have been
placed below."
"They are but a small portion, I fear, of his intended cargo,"
I answered. "From what I have heard, many more than
those who have already been brought on board will be stowed
away. A large vessel like this will carry between five and six
hundred human beings. I trust, however, that the captain is
more humane, and will be content with those he has already
obtained."
"I wish we could manage to let them go again," said Leo.
"What right have people to carry off their fellow-creatures,
even though they are blacks. I am sure they did not come

OUR HORROR AND ANNOYANCE.
willingly, for I saw many of them crying, and refusing, till
they were beaten, to go down into the hold."
"If you could think of a plan, I would help you," said
Natty. "I wish we could manage to restore them to their
friends and to their native villages."
I was pleased to see this feeling in the boys, although it was
hopeless; for, unless captured by a cruiser, the poor blacks
were not likely ever again to visit their native land, or to set
foot on shore until they had reached the coast of Brazil. I
had seen something of the slave-trade on my former visits to
Africa, and was well acquainted with the whole system.
When crossing the bar, we were all as before ordered below.
The wind was blowing off the land, and with a strong breeze
we dashed through the breakers. I felt by the way the vessel
pitched that they were of some height, and I confess I was
glad when at length I found that she was well outside, and
once more gliding through the waters of the Atlantic. Stanley
now addressed Senhor Silva, and begged him to urge the cap-
tain to land us at the nearest European settlement.
"I will do what I can," was the answer; "but I am
sorry to tell you that, as we have all now been let into too
many of his secrets, he purposes carrying us across to the
Brazils."
This information made Stanley very indignant.
"My friend," said Senhor Silva, "there is no use exhibit-
ing any anger; but if you will leave matters in my hands I
will do the best I can for you."
I can scarcely describe the horror and annoyance we all felt
on finding out the character of the vessel we were on board.
During all hours of the day and night, but especially at night,
the cries and groans of the unfortunate slaves reached our
ears. Once my curiosity induced me to look into the hold,
but the horrible odour which proceeded from it, and the sight

QUITTING THE SLAVER.
of those upturned faces, expressive of suffering and despair,
prevented me ever again desiring to witness the sight.
Once more we were close in with the land. Senhor Silva
came to us in the cabin. "I am glad to say that I have made
arrangements with the captain to land you," he said. "There
is another barracoon near this, from whence more slaves are to
be brought off, and if you wish at once to go on shore you can
be conveyed there. A heavy surf is however setting on the
beach, and I am afraid that there is some risk. It is a wild
place, too, and you will probably have many hardships to endure
before you can reach any European settlement."
"Oh, we would go through anything, so as to get out of
this vessel !" exclaimed Kate. The same sentiment was echoed
by the rest of us.
"I fully sympathize with you," said Senhor Silva, "and
will inform the captain of your determination. I will lose no
time, lest he should change his mind. He knows that I hate
this traffic in which he is engaged as much as you do."
We at once prepared to quit the slaver, and on going on
deck found the boat alongside. The captain and his officers.
were collected at the gangway to bid us farewell, but we could
with difficulty restrain our feelings of abhorrence in spite of
the politeness with which they treated us. Notwithstanding
the unprepossessing appearance of the shore, we thankfully
hurried into the boat. Timbo and Jack followed us. Ramaon
stood on the deck. His master called to him. He replied in
Portuguese.
" The scoundrel!" said Senhor Silva. "He has been tempted
to turn slaver, and tells me he has entered aboard the vessel as
a seaman. I am well rid of him then."
I was glad to hear these expressions from our friend, because
I was afraid, from his intimacy with the slave captain, that he
himself was engaged in the traffic. The slaver remained hove

to while we pulled towards the shore. As I saw the heavy
surf breaking ahead of us, I felt great anxiety for what might
occur. The boat, however, was a large one, and the cockswain
was an old seaman, who seemed calm and collected as he stood
up and surveyed the breakers through which we had to pass.
The crew kept their eyes fixed on him as they pulled on.
Now we rose to the summit of a sea; now they stopped row-
ing; now again they urged the boat forward, bending to their
oars with might and main. On we dashed. The waters
foamed on either side. A huge sea came rolling up astern.
Once more we stopped and allowed it to break ahead of us.
Again the helmsman urged the crew to pull away. We dashed
on, and the next instant rushed up on the sandy shore. Some
twenty or more blacks were there to receive us, and dashing
into the water, they seized the boat and dragged her up,
and before another sea broke we were high up on the beach.
The crew assisted us to run forward, Stanley helping Kate,
while David took little Bella in his arms, and sprang over the
bows on to the sand. The rest of us followed, Jack catching
hold of Natty and Timbo of Leo, and carrying them up out of
reach of the water. I saw Senhor Silva putting some money
into the hands of the cockswain. "Now," he said, "we are on
shore, we must consult what is next to be done." Our clothing,
and the small amount of articles we had saved from the wreck,
together with numerous packages brought by Senhor Silva,
were next handed out and piled together high up on the beach.
A little way off we saw a few huts and a large barracoon,
similar to those on the banks of the river from which the
slaves had been embarked. On the shore were hauled up a
number of canoes. Scarcely had we landed when a troop of
slaves were seen issuing from the barracoon, and led by their
captors down to the beach. Several were put on board the
boat, which at once shoved off and pulled for the schooner.

A CATASTROPHE.
The canoes were now launched, and in each a dozen or more
negroes were embarked. The boat passed through the surf
in safety; then one canoe followed, then another. The third
had scarcely left the shore when a huge sea came rolling in.
We trembled for the unhappy beings on board. Those who
were paddling her must have seen their danger; but their
only hope of escape was to paddle on. It was vain, however.
The sea struck her, and in an instant over she went, and all
those on board were thrown into the raging surf. The crew,
accustomed to the water, struck out for their lives, swimming
to the nearest canoe ahead; but the unfortunate slaves, unable
to swim, were quickly engulfed. Some cried out for help;
but others sank without a struggle, perhaps glad thus to
terminate their miseries. Out of all those on board the
canoe, which must have contained some twenty human beings,
only three or four escaped. One reached the shore; the others
were taken on board by the canoes ahead. Notwithstanding
this the remainder shoved off, and passing through the surf,
put their cargoes on board. They then returned, and the
schooner, letting draw her head sheets, stood out to sea.

CHAPTER IV.
OUR JOURNEY INLAND.

EVRA
TE sat on the shore under the shade of some tall
trees on the outskirts of the forest, which came
down in an apparently impenetrable mass nearly
to the coast. Our eyes were turned towards the
slave-schooner, which now, under all sail, was
standing on, with her freight of living merchan-
dise, at a distance from the shore. We were thankful to be
out of her; yet our position was a trying one. We could not
tell what dangers and difficulties were before us. In front
was the dark rolling sea, which broke in masses of foam at our
feet; behind us was the thick forest, through which on one
hand a creek had forced its way into the ocean, though its
mouth was impassable for boats on account of a sand-bank
which ran across it ; while on the other side was a clear space,
in which stood the barracoons and huts of the native slave-
dealers. The blacks had taken little notice of us, leaving us
to our own devices, probably, till we might be compelled to
appeal to them for assistance. Close to us were piled up the
articles we had saved from the wreck, as well as others which
Senhor Silva had purchased from the captain for his own
and our use.
We had been silent for some minutes. "What is to be

WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
done, Stanley ?" said David at length. "Are we to proceed
to the north, or south; and how are we to travel? We can-
not carry all those things, that is certain."
"It must depend on whereabouts we are, the direction in
which we proceed," answered Stanley. "The slave captain
took good care to keep us in the dark as to that point; but
perhaps Senhor Silva can inform us."
"Indeed, my friend, I am sorry to say I cannot," said the
Portuguese. "It is only now that I breathe freely, and can
assure you that although I appeared on friendly terms with
the captain of yonder vessel, I hate the work in which he is
engaged as much as you do; and though by a heavy bribe I
induced him to land us, he would not tell me where he pur-
posed putting us on shore, lest we might reach some settle-
ment, and give notice of his being on the coast before he can
leave it altogether for South America. Though he has
already four hundred slaves on board, he will probably, if he
can find them, take two or three hundred more before he con-
siders he has his full cargo."
"Dreadful !" exclaimed Kate. "I would rather go through
any dangers on shore than have remained longer on board that
terrible vessel."
"So would I," said Bella. "I fancy I still hear the cries
of those poor little black children." Timbo and Jack shook
their fists at the vessel.
"Oh yes; Natty and I often talked of how we could set
them free!" exclaimed Leo; "and only wished that the Eng-
lish man-of-war would come and catch them. If I become
a sailor, I would rather be engaged in hunting slavers and liber-
ating the poor blacks than in fighting Frenchmen, or any other
enemies."
"One thing I would advise is, that we leave this coast and
proceed to the highlands in the interior," observed Senhor

Silva. "You saw that range of blue mountains as we ap-
proached the shore, though they are now hidden by the trees?
They form the Serra do Crystal. They are but thinly in-
habited, and though travelling along them will be rougher
work than on the plains, yet we shall enjoy fresh breezes and
a more healthy climate than down below."
"To the mountains, then, in the first place let us proceed,"
said Stanley, springing to his feet. "After that we can
decide which way to take; but, for my own part, I should
prefer moving towards the south. We shall be going home-
wards, and may be better able to send a message to our
friends at the Cape. It is a long distance, but we shall, no
doubt, hear from them if we have patience, and, in the mean-
time, maintain ourselves in the most healthy region we can
find. There is, at all events, no lack of game, and we shall
probably be able to obtain fruit and vegetables sufficient for
our wants."
"An excellent plan!" exclaimed David. "We shall thus
be able to add largely to our knowledge of natural history;
and if Kate and Bella do not object to live a savage life for
so many- months, I think we can make our stay not only satis-
factory, but in many respects delightful."
"I am glad to do whatever you wish, my brothers," said
Kate; "and I think I shall enjoy the life you propose very
much. I wish I had a few more books to teach Bella froin ;
but we must make the most of those we have: and I will
undertake to cook for you and tend the house, for I suppose
you do not intend living out in the woods all the time?"
"Oh no, no," said David. "Wherever we settle to remain
we must at once build a house, where you and Bella can live
in comfort, and where we can stow our stores and collections
of natural history." .
Of course I agreed to my cousin's plan; and, indeed, I

SEEKING ASSISTANCE.
thought it, under all circumstances, the most advisable.
Even should we reach one of the Portuguese settlements, we
might not be able to find a vessel to carry us to the Cape;
besides which, they are mostly unhealthy, and it would be far
better travelling along the mountains than having to spend
any length of time at one of them. I was afraid, however,
that Senhor Silva would not so readily agree to this plan, as
he might be anxious to reach Loando. I was relieved when I
heard him say,–
"Well, my friends, I approve of your proposal ; but we
must not wait here an hour longer than is necessary. At
night we shall find unhealthy vapours rise from yonder river,
and the sooner, therefore, we get away from its banks the
better."
"But we have no horses or waggons to carry our goods," I
observed, looking at the pile of property before me. "Even
if each of us were to take a heavy package, we could not
carry it."
"I will see to that," said Senhor Silva. "I think I can
secure the services of some of those negroes, although they
may not be willing to venture far into the country. Mr.
Crawford, will you come with me, and we will see what can
be done?"
I started up with my gun in my hand, for I did not like
the appearance of the black savages. I remembered the way
the poor crew of the Osprey had been treated, and thought it
possible, if we were taken unawares, that we might meet the
same fate.
" The case is very different here," said Senhor Silva in
reply to my remark as we walked along. "Those poor men
fell victims to the treachery not so much of the blacks, as of
some of the white slavers who had but a short time before
carried off a number of their kindred and friends. I heard

the story on board the schooner. They had enticed theni
down to the coast on pretence of trading, and then surround-
ing them, had captured some forty or fifty of their number.
and carried them off on board their ship. Those who had
escaped, very naturally vowed vengeance against the first
white men they might meet, of course not distinguishing be-
tween English and Portuguese. Thus the unfortunate crew
of the brig became their victims. They would, had we landed
before they had had time to ask questions, very probably have
put us all to death. We have had, indeed, a providential
escape."
We found that the slave-dealers and most of their followers
had already taken their departure-probably to avoid render-
ing us any assistance. They had only come down to the
coast to embark their captives, and had gone back again, my
companion supposed, to obtain a fresh supply. We found,
however, about a dozen men, who came out when Senhor Silva
called them in their own language. When he assured them
that we were friends, and that we would treat them honestly,
they agreed, without hesitation, to act as our bearers as far
as the Crystal Mountains. Beyond them they declined going,
saying that they had enemies on the other side who would
certainly, if they found them, kill them, or carry them off as
slaves, or, they added, "very likely eat us, for they are terrible
cannibals." As soon as the arrangement was made, they all
came leaping and hooting and rushing against each other, like
a set of school-boys unexpectedly let loose for a half holiday,
or a party of sailors on shore after a long cruise.
While the blacks were arranging our property into fit
packages for carrying, the two boys and I accompanied David
to the mouth of the river, which, as I said, was lined with
mangrove bushes, a ledge of rocks which ran out some way
enabling us to get a view up the stream. We had thus an

AN AFRICAN RIVER SCENE.
opportunity of examining those curious trees. Innumerable
roots rose out of the water, lifting the trunk far above it, and
from its upper part shot off numerous branches with bright
green foliage, which grew in radiated tufts at their ende.
Many of them were bespangled with large gaily-coloured
flowers, giving them a far more attractive appearance than
could be supposed, considering the dark, slimy mud out of
which they grew. From the branches and trunk, again, hung
down numberless pendulous roots, which had struck into the
ground, of all thicknesses—some mere thin ropes, others the
size of a man's leg—thus appearing as if the tree was supported
by artificial poles stuck into the ground. David told me
that the seeds germinate on the branches, when, having
gained a considerable length, they fall down into the soft mud,
burying themselves by means of their sharp points, and soon
taking root, spring upwards again towards the parent tree.
Thus the mangrove forms an almost impenetrable barrier
along the banks of the rivers. On the other side of the
stream, indeed, we saw that they had advanced a considerable
distance into the ocean, their mighty roots being able to stem
even the waves of the Atlantic. Near where we stood the
ground was rather more open, and we saw the black mud
covered with numberless marine animals, sea-urchins, holo-
Thuria, or sea-slugs, crabs, and several other creatures, many
of brilliant hues, which contrasted curiously with the dark
mud over which they were crawling. The roots of the trees
were also covered with mussels, oysters, and other crustacea.
But the most curious creature was a small fish which I had
before seen, called by sailors Jumping Johnny. David called
him a close-eyed gudgeon (periophthalmus). He was of the
oddest shape, and went jumping about sometimes like a frog,
and sometimes gliding in an awkward manner over the mud.
We were watching one of them when Leo cried out, " Why,


## p. 85 (#89) ##############################################

FATE OF JUMPING JOHNNY.
85
the fish is climbing the tree-see, see !" And so in reality
he was, working his way up by means of his pectoral fins,
David supposed in search of some of the minute crustacea
which clung to the roots. Jumping Johnny, having eaten as
much as he could swallow, or slipping off by accident, fell
back into the mud, when we saw issuing sideways from under
the roots a huge crab. David said he was of the Grapsus
family. Suddenly he gave a spring, and seized the unfortunate
Johnny in his vice-like gripe, and instantly began to make
his dinner off the incautious fish, who, as Leo said, would
have been wiser if he had kept in the water, and not at-
tempted to imitate the habits of a terrestrial animal.
As we looked up the stream we saw numerous birds feeding
along the banks. Among them were tall flamingoes, rose-
coloured spoonbills, snow-white egretts, and countless other
water-fowl.
"I am glad we have been able to witness this scene here,"
said David, "where we can benefit by the sea breeze; for such
deadly miasmas rise from these mangrove swamps, that the
further we keep off from them the better."
While we were watching we saw a canoe, paddled by half a
dozen blacks, dart out from the mouth of a creek which had
been concealed by the thick trees. We drew back, not know-
ing whether the people in the canoes might prove friends or
foes. Another followed at a little distance, and proceeded up
the stream. They were impelled by paddles with broad blades ;
and the sound of voices reached our ears as if they were sing-
ing.
"I do not think they can be enemies, or they would not be
so merry," said Natty.
"I hope not," I observed.
"If we could stop them we might hire their canoes to con-
vey us up the river."

86
OUR JOURNEY COMMENCED.
: "It might be dangerous to do so," said David, "on two
accounts: they might prove treacherous, and the miasmas
rising from the stream might also possibly give some of us
fever. I think we had better let them go on their way, and
proceed as Senhor Silva proposed."
Returning, we found the party ready to start. We told
Senhor Silva about the canoes.
"I think you did wisely to let them go," he remarked.
" Unless we were under the protection of their chief man, or
king, as he is called, we could not tell how they might behave.
We must use great caution in our intercourse with these people.
When we have shown them that we are friends, and desire to
do them all the good in our power, we, I hope, shall find them
faithful; but they have become so debased by their intercourse
with the white people, and especially, I am sorry to say, with
my countrymen, who often deal treacherously with them, that
they cannot be depended on. They in return, as might
naturally be supposed, cheat and deceive the whites in every
way. The sin, I confess, lies at the door of the more civilized
race, who ought to have set them a good example."
The negroes quickly disposed of the loads, hanging them
over their backs in cloths, the ends of which were fastened to
their foreheads. In the same way the women carry their chil-
dren and household goods. As they could not manage the
whole, the remainder was divided among our party, Kate and
Bella, as well as the boys, insisting on carrying a portion.
Thus we all set out, Senhor Silva and Timbo bringing up the
rear.
"It will be as well to watch the bearers," observed Senhor
Silva. "Although they may be honest, it is possible that
they may take the opportunity, if not looked after, of run-
ning off with our goods."
Our path first led through the forest near the banks of the

river, of which we occasionally got glimpses. It was here of
considerable width, bordered by mangrove bushes. In one or
two places there were wide flats covered with reeds. Suddenly,
as we passed a point of the river, I saw drawn up what hail
much the appearance, at the first glance, of a regiment of
soldiers, with red coats and white trousers.
"Why, where can those men have come from? " I cried
out.
David, who was near me, burst into a langh, in which his
sisters and the boys joined. "Why, Andrew, those are birds,"

approach."

A SENTINEL.
A second glance showed me that he was right; and a very
curious appearance they had.
"See! there is the sentinel."
As he spoke, one of the birds nearest to us issued a sound
like that of a trumpet, which was taken up by the remainder;
and the whole troop, expanding their flaming wings, rose with
loud clamours into the air, flying up the stream. We went
on, and cutting off a bend in the river, again met it; and here
our bearers declared that they must stop and rest. We ac-
cordingly encamped, though Senhor Silva warned us that we
must remain but a short time, as we wished to reach some
higher ground before dark. A fire was lighted for cooking;
and while our meal was preparing, David and I, with the two
boys, went down nearer the banks to see what was to be seen.
We observed on the marshy ground a little way off a high
mound, and creeping along, that we might not disturb the
numerous birds which covered the banks or sat on the trees
around, we caught sight of another mound, with a flamingo
seated on the top of it, her long legs, instead of being tucked up
as those of most birds would have been, literally astraddle on it.
"That is one of their nests," whispered David. "The
bird is a hen sitting on her eggs. Depend upon it, the troop
is not far off. See, see! there are many others along the
banks. What a funny appearance they have."
Presently a flash of red appeared in the blue sky, and look-
ing up, we saw what might be described as a great fiery triangle
in the air sweeping down towards us. On it came, greatly
diminishing its rate, and we then saw that it was composed of
flamingoes. They hovered for a moment, then flew round and
round, following one another, and gradually approached the
marsh, on which they alighted. Immediately they arranged
themselves as we had before seen them, in long lines, when
several marched off on either side to act as sentinels, while the

rest commenced fishing. We could see them arching their
necks and digging their long bills into the ground, while
they stirred up the mud with their webbed feet, in order to
procure, as David told us, the water-insects on which they
subsist. They, however, were not the only visitors to the
river. The tide was low, and on every mud-bank or exposed
spot countless numbers of birds were collected—numerous
kinds of gulls, herons, and long-legged cranes—besides which,
on the trees were perched thousands of white birds, looking at
a distance like shining white flowers. They were the egretta
flavirostris. Vast flocks of huge pelicans were swimming along
the stream, dipping their enormous bills into the water, and
each time bringing up a fish. They have enormous pouches,
capable of containing many pounds of their finny prey.
" Could we kill one or two we should get a good supply of
fish for supper," said David; "for the pelican stows them
away in his pouch, where they remain not only undigested, but
perfectly fresh, and not till it is full does he commence his
meal. However, as we have no canoe, even were we to kill
one we could not get him."
While we were looking on, a huge bird, descending from the
sky, it seemed, pounced down into the water, quickly rising
again with a large fish in his mouth.
"Ah, that fellow is the fishing-eagle of Africa—the Haliætus
vocifer," said David. "His piercing eye observed his prey when
he was yet far up in the air. See how like a meteor he
descended on it! Now he flies away to yonder rock; and there,
see! he has begun to tear his fish to pieces. How quickly he
has finished it—and listen to that curious shriek he is uttering,
and how oddly he moves his head and neck. It is answered
from those other rocks. The birds are calling to each other,
and from this the fishing-eagle has gained his name of vocifer."
Leo was for shouting and making them fly off. "No, no; let

AN UNEXPECTED SIGHT.
them feed," said David. "We have frightened the flamingoes
once; and how would you like to be disturbed in your dinner?
We must get Kate to come and look at them."
While we were watching the birds, an enormous head
emerged from the water at a short distance from us. Leo and
Natty, who were a little in front, started back, Leo exclaim-
ing, "What can it be? What a terrific monster !" A huge
body rising after the head, the creature swam slowly up the
stream.
"Why, that must be a hippopotamus," observed David, watch-
ing the creature in his usual calm way.
"It looks to me the size of an elephant," exclained Leo.
"Run, run, run! If he were to attack us he would swallow
us up in a mouthful."
"I do not think it has even noticed us," said David. "It
will be time enough to run when the creature lands. See !
there is another."
As he spoke, a second and then a third hippopotamus ap-
peared, following the first. The creatures, indeed, had truly
terrific countenances; their backs in the water looking, as Leo
had declared, nearly as large as those of elephants.
"But. see, there are some other creatures nearer ! " cried
Natty. "Oh, what are they? What fearful jaws !"
He pointed to the bank close below us, and there we saw,
just scrambling out of the water, three huge crocodiles. There
was no mistaking them. We knew at once by their long snouts
and terrific jaws, their scaly backs and lizard-like tails, their
short legs and savage eyes. They seemed in no way afraid
of the hippopotami, which they kept watching as they swam
by.
"I little expected to get a sight of these monsters," said
David. "But seel they take no notice of us, and we need not
be afraid of them."

ON THE MARCH.

I had my gun, and instinctively levelled at the head of the
nearest hippopotamus.
"Do not fire," said David. "Even if you were to kill the
beast we could not get him, and it would be cruel to slaughter
him without any object in view. He intends us no harm ;
we ought to allow him to enjoy the existence the Creator has
given him."
The hippopotami swam by and dived, and presently we
saw them rise to the surface with a quantity of weeds in their
mouths, which they chewed leisurely as they swam on. The
crocodiles meantime crawled up on the bank and lay basking
in the sun, enjoying its warmth, and looking at that time, at
all events, as if they had no evil intentions. It was a curious
scene, and gave us an idea of the vast amount of animal life to
be met with in that region.
. "I think it would frighten Kate, brave as she is, to see those
huge monsters," said Leo.
"Oh, no," answered David. "Bella might be somewhat
alarmed ; but I am sure Kate would be as much interested as
we are in witnessing this curious sight. We will get her to
come, but warn her beforehand what she is to expect." :
We accordingly hastened back to the camp, but found we
had been so long absent that it was now time to proceed; and
the bearers taking up their loads, we continued our march.
Senhor Silva assured Kate and Bella they need not be disap-
pointed at missing a sight of the flamingoes, as they would
have many opportunities of seeing troops of those magnificent
birds, which are found in vast numbers throughout that region.
The woods as we proceeded appeared full of life. Birds
flitted among the boughs, and monkeys of all sorts sprang here
and there, chattering and hooting as we passed. Soon after
this we emerged from the wood and entered a beautiful prairie
-a natural clearing covered with grass or low shrubs and

flowers. As yet we had fallen in with no inhabitants. « Oh,
but see!" exclaimed Leo. "There are some huts ahead. Shall
we go and pay the people a visit ?" The boys ran on. I
thought Senhor Silva would have called them back, but he
allowed them to proceed. At all events, he knew that if the
huts were inhabited, the people were likely to prove friendly.
The boys stopped before the seeming huts, and began to exa-
mine them. We saw them walking round and round, and
they then finally climbed to the top of one of them. After ap-
parently satisfying their curiosity, they came back towards us.
" They are not huts," exclaimed Natty, "but curious
mounds, three or four times as high as we are."
"What do you say to those mounds or clay-built domes
being the houses of ants, and built entirely by themselves ?"
said Senhor Silva.
As we approached we saw a dozen or more such mounds,
scattered about at short distances from each other. Having
got to a secure distance from the last, two of our bearers put
down their loads, and advancing towards it with the poles
they carried, began to attack it with heavy blows, knocking off
one of the small turrets on the side. Instantly a white ant
was seen to appear through the opening thus made, apparently
surveying the damage done. Immediately afterwards, hun-
dreds of other ants came to the spot, each carrying a small
lump of clay, with which they began to repair the damage ;
and even for the short time we remained, they had made some
progress. We could discover, however, no outlet or opening
in the mound; nor, except at the hole made by our bearers,
were any ants seen. We, however, could not remain to watch
the progress of the work. Just as we were going, one of our
bearers, much to my regret, commenced a still more furious
attack on the citadel, exposing the whole centre to view, when
it appeared crowded with thousands and tens of thousands—50

FORTRESS OF TERMITES.

it seemed—of ants, who issued forth with pincers stretched
out, evidently intending to attack us. David caught up one
of the ants to examine it; but we were all too glad hurriedly
to make our escape. We found the creature, on examining it,
to be a quarter of an inch in length, with a flat hard head,
terminating in a pair of sharp horizontal pincers, something
like the claws of a crab.
Several, who, in spite of our flight, caught hold of us, bit
very hard, and did not fail to draw blood. Senhor Silva, as
we marched on, gave us a very interesting account of these
white ants, with the habits of which he was well acquainted,
as he told us he had had one of the mounds cut completely in
two, so as to examine the interior. The under part alone
of the mound is inhabited by the ants; the upper portion
serving as a roof to keep the lower warm and moist for hatch-
ing the eggs. His description put me somewhat in mind of
the Pyramids of Egypt. · The larger portion is solid. In the
centre, just above the ground, is the chief cell, the residence of
the queen and her husband. Round this royal chamber is
found a whole labyrinth of small rooms, inhabited by the
soldiers and workmen. The space between them and the outer
wall of the building is used partly for store-rooms and partly
for the purpose of nurseries. A subterranean passage leads
from a distance to the very centre of the building. It is cylin-
drical, and lined with cement. On reaching under the bottom
of the fortress, it branches out in numerous small passages,
ascending the outer shell in a spiral manner, winding round
the whole of the building to the summit, and intersecting
numerous galleries one above the other, full of cells. The
outer end of the great gallery, by which the niound is ap-
proached, also branches off into numerous small ones, so as to
allow a passage into it from various directions. As the ants
cannot climb a perpendicular wall without difficulty, all their

ALL ABOUT TERMITES.
ascents are gradual. It is through this great passage that they
convey the clay, wood, water, and provisions to their colony.
To give you a correct idea of the way these curious mounds
are built and stocked with inhabitants, I should tell you that
the perfect termites are seen at certain seasons in vast quanti-
ties covering the earth, each having four narrow wings folded
on each other. They are instantly set upon by their enemies
—reptiles of all sorts, and numerous birds—who eat such
quantities, that out of many thousands but few pairs escape
destruction. There are besides them in their fortress vast
numbers of labourers, who only issue forth with caution to
obtain provisions and materials for their abodes. When these
discover a couple of the perfect termites who have escaped
destruction, they elect them as their sovereigns, and escorting
them to a hollow in the earth which they at once form, they
establish a new community. Here they commence building,
forming a central chamber in which the royal pair are en-
sconced; while they go on with their work, building the
galleries and passages which have been described, till the
inound has reached the dimensions of those we have seen.
The king in a short time dies, but his consort goes on increas-
ing in bulk till she attains the enormous length of three
inches, and a width in proportion. She now commences lay-
ing her eggs, at the rate, it is said, of nearly sixty in a minute.
This often continues night and day for two years, in which
time fifty million eggs have been laid. These are conveyed
by the indefatigable labourers to the nurseries, which are thus
all filled. When hatched, they are provided with food by the
labourers. There is another class, the soldiers. These are
clistinguished by the size of their heads, and their long and
sharp jaws, with which they bravely attack any intruders.
When any unwary creature appears to attack their abode, first
one comes out to see what is the matter. IIe summons others,

OUR ENCAMPMENT.

and directly afterwards vast numbers issue forth, doing battle
with the greatest courage. When any of them are knocked
over, instantly recovering themselves, they return to the assault
with a bravery and courage surpassed by no other creature in
creation. The labourers meantime are exerting themselves to
the utmost to repair the damages which have been effected in
their fortress. Those who have watched their proceedings
state that in a single night they will repair a gallery, which
has been injured, of three or four yards in length. We were
thankful that in our attack on the termites' fortress we had
escaped with only a few bites ; but probably had we remained
longer in their neighbourhood we should have received far
more severe injuries.
Travelling on for several days, we emerged into some
open ground, where we prepared to encamp. We selected a
spot somewhat above the plain, and our bearers at once set to
work to cut down poles. These they planted in circles, and
interwove them with branches of palm-trees, forming walls which
afforded sufficient shelter from the night wind; then bringing the
tops close together, they thatched them over with leaves of the
same tree. We of course all assisted, and in a short time a number
of small circular huts were formed sufficient to accommodate the
whole of the party. A quantity of wood was collected, to keep
up blazing fires to preserve us from the attacks of wild beasts.
We were at a sufficient distance, however, from the skirts of
the forest, not to be taken totally unawares. Still, it was con-
sidered necessary to place guards round the camp, two of our
party and two of the blacks remaining on the watch all night.
Before darkness closed in, we saw numbers of monkeys in the
trees, watching us with curious looks, leaping from bough to
bough, and chattering and grinning, wondering apparently who
the strangers could be who had thus ventured into their do-
main. The two girls had a hut to themselves. We had

NIGHT SOUNDS.
formed a second wall of sticks round it, so that should any
wild beast approach unseen, it could not force an entrance,
which Senhor Silva told us had sonietimes occurred. The moon
rose in an unclouded sky, and cast a mild light over the scene.
In the distance were the lofty mountains, on either side the
dark woods, and far away to the west was the ocean we
had left behind. It was a beautiful scene, such as I had
not expected to witness in that region, and we were all
more than ever thankful that we had escaped from the
slaver. Still, I could not banish from my mind the spectacle
I had witnessed on board, and my thoughts went back to the
unhappy beings crowded on the slave-deck of that fearful
craft. I was reminded that we were in Africa by the cries
which proceeded ever and anon from the surrounding forest.
Now there was a loud roar, with a suppressed muttering, which
it would be hard to describe, and which I afterwards learned to
distinguish as the voice of the monarch of the woods; not that
he often ventures here, for his rule is disputed by the tremen-
dous gorilla, the creature who had only a short time before
been discovered in this region. We were, however, we con-
cluded, on the most southern verge of his territory, and we
therefore scarcely expected to encounter one. We kept our
fires blazing through the night, and thus avoided any attacks
from lions or panthers, or any other wild beasts.
The morning broke brightly, though we could see the mist
hanging over the far distant coast. Birds flew about among the
trees and across the prairie in all directions, uttering their
varied notes; and the monkeys came forth, skipping from bough
to bough, muttering and shrieking at us as on the previous
evening, as if they had not as yet satisfied their curiosity.
While Kate, assisted by Timbo and Jack, prepared breakfast,
I accompanied Stanley and David, with the two boys, to shoot
some birds for our next meal. I had heard so much of ser-

pents and wild beasts, that I expected every instant to see a
snake wriggling its way through the grass, and about to fasten
its fangs in our legs, or to twine its fearful coils round our
bodies. I could not help also looking anxiously at every
bush, expecting to have a lion or a panther spring out on us.
David acknowledged that he had a similar feeling. Stanley,
however, laughed at our apprehensions, assuring us that snakes
were not nearly so common as were supposed, or how could
the almost naked blacks make their way through the country,
though he acknowledged that lions and panthers were in some
places justly dreaded; "But then," he observed, " we can the
more easily defend ourselves against them. A well-aimed
bullet will settle the fiercest lion we have to encounter."
We had good sport, and shot several varieties of birds.
Among them was a partridge, of a gray colour; and David
said that they were its loud calls we had heard in the forest
the evening before, summoning its mate. He had observed
them sleeping side by side on a branch of a tree where they
have their home, and the bird which was first there did not
cease calling till its mate arrived. We also shot several par-
rots, of a species known as the African damask parrot. They
are pretty birds, and their habits are very interesting. Had we
not positively required them for food, I should have been unwill-
ing to kill them. We had seen numbers flying towards a stream
which ran into the river we had passed on the previous evening.
They there assembled, making a great deal of noise, and huddled
and rolled over each other, frolicking together, and dipping their
feet into the water, so as to sprinkle it over the whole of
their bodies. Having enjoyed an ample bath and amused them-
selves for a time, they flew off to the forest whence they came.
There we saw them sitting on the branches, cleaning their
feathers. The operation over, they flew off in pairs, each pair
seeking its own nest or roosting-place, separate from the

CARPENTER BIRDS.
others. David said that this species is noted for conjugal
affection, for they never separate till one or the other dies,
and the survivor then pines to death for its mate. The boys
were very anxious to catch one alive for Bella, but we could
not succeed in so doing. Coming near a dead tree, we saw
several hollows, evidently formed by art. Leo climbed up to
one of them, and putting in his hand, drew out a beautiful
little bird, with a throat and breast of a glossy blue-black,
having a scarlet head and a line of canary-yellow running from
above the eyes along the neck. The back also, which was
black, was covered with yellow spots. Here David brought
his knowledge to bear; and said, from its habits, he should call
it the carpenter bird. When the birds pair, they fix on a tree,
the wood of which has been sufficiently softened by age to
enable them to work upon it with their bills. They then take
out a circular opening, about two inches in diameter and about
two deep. Next they dig perpendicularly down for about four
inches, the last hollow made serving as their nest. They line
it softly, and the female, laying her eggs, is able to hatch them
without much risk of an attack from birds of prey.
"I suppose monkeys do not eat birds," observed Leo; "or
I suspect our little friend would very soon be pulled out of its
nest."
"Just as you have done, Leo," observed Stanley; "and pro-
bably the poor little bird took you for a chimpanzee, or per-
haps even for a gorilla."
"But neither chimpanzees nor gorillas eat animal food,"
observed David. "They live upon roots, fruits, and leaves ;
and do not amuse themselves by bird-nesting."
I need not mention the other birds we shot, but, pretty
well loaded, we returned with our prizes to the camp. Break-
fast over, we packed up and proceeded on our journey, leaving
our huts for the occupation of the next comers.

CHAPTER V.
TIE DOMAINS OF THE GORILLA.
TUZE travelled on for two days, and still the mountains
V were not reached; but they grew higher and
Ak clearer as we advanced, and we had hopes of get-
ting to them at last. My young cousins bore the
journey wonderfully well. When we came to
y difficult places, her brothers and I helped Kate
along, making a seat for her with our joined hands. We could
thus make but slow progress, and she entreated us to allow
her to walk, declaring that she was not at all fatigued; while
Timbo or Jack carried Bella on their back, and with long
sticks in their hands trudged on merrily. We caught sight of
several wild animals. On two or three occasions buffaloes
crossed our path, but at too great a distance for a shot. We
killed, however, a wild boar, which afforded a fine meal for
our party. Natty and I were a little in advance, when we
came to a large village of white ants, such as I have before
described. We were examining them, when I saw a troop of
gazelles come bounding across the prairie towards us. The
wind blew from them to us, and as we were behind the hill,
they did not observe us. Our larder at the time was ill-
supplied, and so I was anxious to kill one. I rested my gun
on one of the turrets of the hill. I was not much of a shot,

but I was improving. The herd came by within thirty yards
of us. Just then the leader caught sight of the rest of the
party, who were coming up. I saw that I must now fire, or
lose my chance. I took aim at the nearest—a doe, with her
young one by her side. The mother escaped, but the little
creature fell to the ground. In spite of my hunger I felt
almost sorry for what I had done, when, running forward, the
dying animal turned up its large languishing eyes towards me
as it stretched out its limbs quite dead. I am afraid it was
but a clumsy shot at best, as I ought to have killed the larger
animal. Natty and I, placing it on my pole between our
shoulders, bore it in triumph to our friends, who received us

BUFFALO OF TROPICAL AFRICA.

with shouts of satisfaction. Stanley also shot a beautiful little
squirrel and a number of birds—indeed, a good sportsman in
health, with a supply of ammunition, need never, in that part
of Africa, be without abundance of animal food ; but some of
the natives, who have no firearms and are very improvident,
often suffer from famine even in that land of abundance.
The buffalo of Tropical Africa—Bos brachicheros—is about
the size of an English ox. His hair is thin and red, and he
Pias sharp and long hoofs, his ears being fringed with soft silky
hair. His chief ornaments are his horns, which gracefully
bend backwards. In shape he is somewhat between a cow and
an antelope. A herd feeding at a distance had very much the
appearance of English cattle grazing in a meadow.. They
differ greatly from the Cape buffalo, to be met with further
south.
Evening was approaching, when the head man of our bearers
spoke to Senhor Silva, who instantly called a halt. The
black's quick ears had detected sounds in the distance. " IIe
thinks there are elephants out there," said Senhor Silva, point-
ing ahead. We were then in a thinly-wooded country, and a
charge from those monsters would have been dangerous. We
saw, however, a clump of trees on one side, behind which
Senhor Silva advised that we should take post till we had
ascertained the state of the case. The blacks were eager for
us to attack them, hoping to enjoy a feast off the huge bodies
of any we might kill. As it might expose the young ladies to
danger should we do so, even Stanley resolved to let them pass
by unmolested. I have not yet mentioned the leader or head
man of the bearers. His name, he told Senhor Silva, was
Chickango; but Jack and Timbo called him the Chicken.
He was an enormous fellow, and ugly even for an African; but
there was a good-humoured, contented expression in his counte-
nance, which won our confidence. His costume was a striped

shirt, and a pair of almost legless trousers; while on the top of his
high head he wore a little battered straw hat, such as seamen
manufacture for themselves on board ship-indeed, his whole
costume had evidently been that of a seaman, exchanged, pro-
bably, for some articles which he had to dispose of. Chick-
ango, signing to us to remain behind the clump of trees,
advanced towards the spot where he expected to find the ele-
phants. Suddenly he threw up his arms, and began shouting
at the top of his voice. His cries were answered by similar
shouts from a distance; and presently, beckoning to us to come
on, he hurried towards the spot whence they proceeded. Pass-
ing through a belt of wood, we came in sight of an encamp-
ment of blacks seated round their fires. There were upwards
of one hundred human beings—men, women, and children. A
few of the men were dressed in cast-off European garments,
with rings round their arms and legs, their woolly heads being
mostly uncovered. Chickango advancing, explained, we con-
cluded, who we were; and we received a hearty welcome from
the party. The chief, an old man, sat in their centre, attended
by his wives. He was distinguished from his companions by
an old battered cocked hat, ornamented with beads. He wore,
besides, a checked shirt and a regular Scotch kilt, which had
somehow or other found its way into his territory. Senhor
Silva then explained to us, through Chickango, that he and his
party had come from a considerable distance up the country,
where they had gone to collect caoutchouc, or india-rubber, the
packages of which lay piled up near the centre of the camp.
They had collected it some distance up the country, where the
vines which produce it grow in considerable quantities. In
South America it is obtained from a tree; but in Africa from
a creeper of great length, with very few leaves growing on it,
and those only at its extremity. They are broad, dark green,
and lance shaped. The larger vines are often five inches in

INDIA-RUBBER.

diaineter at the base, with a rough brown bark. The mode of
obtaining it is to make an incision in the bark, but not in the
wood, and through it the milky sap exudes. A small peg is
then fixed in each hole to prevent its closing, and a cup or
calabash secured underneath. When this is full, a number of
them are carried to the camp, where the substance is spread in
thin coatings upon moulds of clay, and dried layer after layer
over a fire. When perfectly dry, the clay mould is broken
and the clay extracted from the interior. The caoutchouc,
though originally white, becomes black from the smoke to
which it is exposed while drying. It is in this state brought
down to the coast and sold to the traders.
" Oh yes," said David. "This is the material with
which Mr. Mackintosh makes his waterproof coats. · He
found that it could be re-dissolved in petroleum ; and by
covering two pieces of woollen or cotton stuff with the
liquid, and uniting them by a strong pressure, he formed a
material through which no water can penetrate. Some time
afterwards, Messrs. Handcock and Broding discovered that, by
the addition of a small quantity of sulphur to the caoutchouc,
it acquired the property of retaining the same consistency in
every temperature without losing its elasticity. A further
discovery was made by Mr. Goodyear, who, by adding about
twenty per cent. of sulphur, converted it into so hard a sub-
stance that all sorts of articles can be manufactured from it
for which tortoise-shell had hitherto been chiefly used —
indeed, it is difficult to say what cannot be made out of it."
Besides india-rubber, the blacks had several huge lumps of
ebony and a small number of elephants' tusks, which they had

were carrying down to the coast to sell for the original owners

Nearly all the negro tribes on this part of the coast have the
spirit of trade strongly implanted in them; and I cannot help
thinking that it is so for the purpose of ultimately bringing
about their civilization, which the nefarious slave-trade has so
long retarded. That trade is one of the sins which lies at Eng-
land's door, and she should endeavour to make amends for the
crime, by using every means in her power for the spread of
Christianity and civilization among the long benighted Africans.
We observed that the men, women, and children were very
busy in the camp— the women cooking and making arrange-
ments for the night, while the children were collecting fire-
wood from the neighbouring thickets. Poor little creatures, I •
was afraid that some of them might be carried off by panthers
or other beasts of prey who might be prowling about in the
neighbourhood ; but their parents seemed to have no such
fear. We were anxious to obtain some more bearers to carry
Kate and Bella, as also to assist us in conveying our goods up
the mountain. Chickango undertook to niake the arrange-
ments, and after a good deal of talking with the chief and then
with the people, he pointed out four young men who ex-
pressed themselves ready to accompany us. These arrange-
ments being made, we encamped on a somewhat higher spot a
short distance from our friends, and soon had huts built such
as I have before described. Though we heard the cries of wild
beasts in the forest, none ventured near us, as we kept up blazing
fires all night.
Next morning, even before our party were stirring, the old
chief and his followers were on foot, preparing to continue
their march towards the sea-coast. The men, however, sat

still, with their bows in their hands, talking to each other,
while the women were employed in packing up their goods in
baskets, which they suspended at their backs, with their
children in many instances on the top of them. All the elder
children also had burdens, but the men walked along with a
haughty air, carrying nothing but their arms in their hands.
Saluting us with loud cries, they proceeded towards the
west.
We meantime had been employed in packing up, but in-
stead of making Kate and Bella carry burdens, we prepared
a litter to carry them. Passing through a dense forest, we
saw before us the mountain range we hoped soon to gain.
Near the banks of the stream we passed a grove of curious
trees with short stems, on either side of which projected huge
long leaves with feather-like branches on the top. Amid them
was an immense number of clusters of nuts, each larger than
a pigeon's egg. Chickango ordered one of the men to climb
up and bring down a cluster when he saw us looking at them.
On pressing the nuts even with our fingers, a quantity of oil
exuded ; and Senhor Silva told us that the tree was the Cocos
butyracea, the oil extracted from which is exported in large
quantities from the neighbouring rivers, chiefly to Liverpool.
We calculated that the tree had fully eight hundred nuts on
it; and as each contains a considerable quantity of oil, it may
be supposed how large an amount a single tree produces. I
had seen something of the trade on my former visit to the
coast, when I was at the Bonny river. We took chiefly
English manufactures to exchange for the oil, and a few bales
of glass beads from Germany. On entering the river we
covered in the deck with a mat roofing, to protect us from
the sun and the tropical showers; but before we could begin
trading we had to pay a heavy duty to the old king of
the territory, of muskets, powder, tobacoo, calicoes, woollen

caps, and, what he valued still more, several dozens of rum.
The dealers then made their appearance, and received advances
of goods to purchase oil in the interior, for the Bonny itself
does not produce the oil. Our next business was to erect a
cask-house on shore, in which to prepare the puncheons for
the reception of the oil. This was brought down in small
quantities by the traders; and it took us nearly four months
to obtain about eight hundred puncheons, which our vessel
carried. The palm-oil or pulla, when brought to us, was of
a rich orange colour, and of the consistency of honey. To my
surprise, the morning after the first quantity arrived I found
a basin full of it on the breakfast-table, and learned that it was
the custom to eat it instead of butter; and very delicious it
was. By the time it reaches England, it has, however, obtained
a disagreeable taste, totally different from what it possesses
when fresh. The palm-oil is about the most valuable produc-
tion of this part of Africa; and the natives are beginning to
discover that its collection is far more profitable to them than
the slave-trade.
To return to my narrative: we encamped at a short distance
from the thick wood, oy the side of the stream I spoke of,
hoping early next morning to begin our ascent of the moun-
tains. We might have proceeded further, but the spot was so
tempting, that, although we had a couple of hours of daylight,
we agreed to stop where we were. The blacks soon had the
huts erected and fires lighted—an operation they would not
have undertaken had their wives been present to do it for
them. As we were all very hungry, we immediately com-
menced our evening meal, some birds we had shot not taking
long to cook ; while we had a good supply of biscuits, which
we had brought, with tea as our beverage.
"This is just such a pic-nic as we had in our last holidays,"
said Bella, looking round with a smiling countenance. " You

A TERRIFIC ROAR.
remember, Leo, it was by the side of a stream; and you went
and caught some fish, and we had them cooked before the
fire."
"Oh yes; and I will try and get some fish now," said
Leo. "Natty, you will come and fish with me as soon as
supper is over."
To this, of course, Natty agreed; and Jack produced a ball
of twine, while I fortunately had some fish-hooks in my pocket,
which I brought from the wreck. While we were laughing
and talking, suddenly a loud roar reached our ears, which
made Kate start and little Bella turn pale, while a loud hol-
low sound, as if a drum had been beaten, followed the roar.
Leo declared it was more like distant thunder. Our blacks
started to their feet, many of them with looks of terror, utter-
ing the word-Ngula. Stanley seized his gun. "That must
be a gorilla !" he exclaimed, examining the lock.
"I hope so," cried David. "It would be worth coming
here to see the monster."
"No doubt about its being a gorilla," said Senhor Silva,
" but you must be cautious how you approach him. Chickango
says he will go with you. IIe is a good hunter; and, I judge
by his looks, a brave fellow."
The ugly black nodded his head, and pointing to the forest,
advanced towards it. David and I also took our guns.
"Now be steady," said Stanley. "I will fire first, and if
I fail to kill him, David, do you fire; and, Senhor Silva, tell
our black friend that he must make the third shot; and Andrew,
you must act as a reserve in case of accidents,—but I hope not
to miss him."
Stanley and David kept together, while the black and I
advanced a little on one side. Turning my head for an instant,
I saw Leo and Natty following us. I signed to them to go
back, but they seemed resolved to take a share in the expected

fight. Each was armed with a long pike, which I knew would
have been of about as much use as a tooth-pick should they
be attacked by the creature. We made our way between large
boulders to the edge of the forest, which seemed almost too
thick to be penetrated. I had never felt so excited. My
sensations were something like those, I fancy, of a soldier going
into his first battle; but from what I had heard of the gorilla,
I knew him to be almost as formidable an antagonist as the
best armed man. For some time as we advanced into the
forest there was a perfect silence, yet we were certain that the
monster could not be far off. The trees grew closer and closer
together; and as the edge of the forest was turned towards
the east, we soon found ourselves shrouded in a thick gloom.
Still, so eager were we to meet the beast, that, instead of halt-
ing, as might have been wiser, we continued to push onwards.
Suddenly a terrific roar was heard proceeding from a spot not
many paces ahead. Had it not been uttered, we might have
gone close up to the creature without perceiving him. Just
then we saw the branches waving to and fro, and a huge mon-
ster moving on all fours appeared amidst them. Suddenly he
rose up on his hind legs, holding on to a bough with one hand,
and then striking his breast, from which a loud hollow sound
came forth. He uttered another terrific roar, and grinned
fiercely at us. "Oh, what a terrible giant !" I heard Leo
exclaim behind me. I dared not turn my head or speak to
urge the boys to run back. My attention was rivetted on the
huge gorilla, for I now saw before me that monster of the
African woods. Again he uttered a fearful roar, and beating
his breast and gnashing his teeth, he began to move towards
us. He was not many paces from Stanley, who was a little
in advance. "Steady, friends!" cried our leader. I held my
breath with anxiety; for should my cousin's gun miss fire, it
seemed impossible for him to escape being seized by the

tremendous creature. Then I saw his rifle raised to his
shoulder. There was a flash, which lighted up the monster's
face and the surrounding branches, and then with a terrific
roar I saw it spring
forward. Just as I
dreaded that Stanley
was about to be seized
by its sharp claws it
stopped, and, with a
groan almost human,
fell forwards on its
face, crashing amidst
the bushes, and rolled
over on the ground.
Even then I expected
to see it rise again
and attack us, but the
bullet had gone through
its huge chest; and
though it made several
convulsive struggles, by
the time we reached it
it lay perfectly quiet.
Chickango struck it
with his spear, but it did not move, and then he plunged it
into its breast.
" Have you really killed him ?" cried Natty and Leo, run-
ning up to us. "We would have fought him, that we would !"
exclaimed Leo, jumping on the gorilla's body.
Chickango at the same time seized one of its huge paws, and
pulled and shook it violently, and then set up a triumphant
shout as a compliment to Stanley on his victory.
"I wish we could carry him to the camp," said Leo. "It

would show Kate and Bella that they need no longer be afraid
of the monster."
"I expect a sight of it would not much tend to allay their
fears," said David, " for it would rather show them what sort
of fierce beasts we may expect to find in our neighbourhood."
"What! do you mean to say there are any more of them ?"
exclaimed Natty. "When Senhor Silva was talking about
him the other day, he called him the king of the forest ; and
so I fancied, of course, that he had no rivals."
" Where he exists we shall probably find others," said David;
"though their habitation does not reach further south than
we now are: indeed, I did not expect to meet them in this
latitude. They chiefly inhabit the country about the Gaboon
and other rivers to the north of us."
We found, on measuring the gorilla, that it was within a '
few inches of six feet in height, while the muscular develop-
ment of its arms and breast showed that it could have seized
the whole of us in its claws, and torn us to pieces without
difficulty; but the art of man and the death-dealing rifle were
more than a match for it. Still, as it lay extended on the
ground, I could not help feeling as if we had killed some
human being—a wild man of the woods, who might, under
proper treatment, have been tamed and civilized. David
laughed when I made some remark to that effect.
"I suspect, if we were to catch a baby gorilla, and feed it
on milk, and bring it up in a nursery, it would prove almost
as savage and fierce as this creature," he answered. "He can
feed himself and fight in defence of his liberty, but he could
never make a coat to cover his back, or light a fire to warm
himself, though he might have seen it done a hundred times.
There is no real relationship between a man and an ape, how-
ever much similarity there may be between the outer form and
the skeleton. In man there is the mind, which, even in the

most debased and savage, is capable of improvement, and the
soul, which nothing can destroy. In the ape there is instinct,
and a certain power of imitation which looks like mind, but
which, even in the tamest, goes no further. The most en-
lightened mode of instruction and the utmost patience will
never teach an ape to read or talk; while we know that human
beings who have been born deaf and blind and dumb have, by
a wonderful process, been instructed in many of the glorious
truths which can give joy and satisfaction to the soul of man."
As it was already late, and it would delay us greatly should
we attempt to carry it to the camp, we agreed to leave the
gorilla where it lay and return for it the next morning.
We saw Chickango cautiously looking behind him as we turned
our backs on the forest; and he gave us to understand by his
gestures that he was afraid a lion or leopard, or some other
wild beast, might be following us.
My cousins came out to meet us on our return. The roars
of the gorilla had aroused unusual fears in their hearts, and
our absence had been so prolonged that they had become
anxious for our safety. We kept a strict watch all night; for
although we did not again hear the gorilla-indeed, had there
been one in the neighbourhood, he would by that time have
gone to rest—the sounds of other wild animals frequently
reached our ears.
We were up early next morning-the instant there was
light-for Kate had made us promise to show her the gorilla.
"I may never have an opportunity of seeing another," she
said. "I should like to be able to say when we get to the
Cape that I have actually beheld one in his native wilds."
As neither Jack nor Timbo exhibited such curiosity, we left
them in charge of the camp with the black men, to pack up,
while we proceeded towards the forest. We advanced
cautiously, Stanley and I going ahead, with David and Senhor

WHAT THE ANTS HAD DONE.

Silva on either side of the young ladies, and the boys bringing
up the rear, Chickango acting as scout, a little in advance on
one side of us. Every now and then we halted, whenever we
observed the branches disturbed: Now a huge ape of the
ordinary species might be seen grinning down upon us, and
then scampering off among the boughs; or a troop of monkeys
would come chattering above our heads, not so easily put to
flight. Birds of gay plumage flitted before us from bough to
bough; and a huge snake, which had been coiled round a
branch, giving a hiss at us, went off among the underwood
into the depths of the forest.
"And now, girls, be prepared for a sight of Leo's giant of
the woods," said Stanley, turning round when we approached
the spot where he had killed the gorilla. "But, hillo! the
ground looks alive."
The trunk of a tree lay near. By climbing on it we got a
view of the spot where the gorilla had fallen ; but, as we
looked towards it, scarcely a particle of the monster could be
seen. The skin was there and the huge bones and monstrous
skull, but nearly all the flesh had been eaten away by myriads
of ants, which swarmed about it. So engaged were they in
their work of destruction, that they did not attack us.
"Why, they must be drivers," said David, "the bashikouay,
as the natives call them. They have gained their English
name by driving every other species of the animal creation out
of their way."
They were not much larger than the common English ant,
of a dark brown colour. David, jumping down, caught one,
and showed us that he had a sharp head, terminating in a
pair of horizontal nippers—very like those of the warrior ants.
In taking one up another had caught hold of his little finger,
and gave it a nip which drew blood. Senhor Silva told us
that they usually traverse the country by day and night, in

trains nearly half a mile long, though only a few inches wide,
and, as it passes under the grass, presents the appearance of a
huge snake. They also, like the warrior ants, have soldiers
who march by the side of the regular column, and the instant
any danger appears hurry forward, when the column is either
halted or turned backward. Should the difficulty be removed,
it again advances. One of their most curions proceedings is
the formation by the soldiers of a perfect arch, into which
thousands of them weave their bodies, expanding across the
whole width of a path where danger is apprehended. Under
the arch the females and the labourers who bear the larvæ
then pass in comparative safety. It is formed in the following
manner. One ant stands upright, and then another climbs up
and interlocks its feet with the fore-feet of the first, and then
another climbs up, somewhat in the fashion of acrobats.
Another couple form the base of the arch on the opposite side,
and then others, stretching themselves longways, form what
may be called transverse beams, to keep the two sides connected.
When thus formed, the creatures hold together so tenaciously,
that the whole could be lifted off the ground without breaking.
If attacked, they spread themselves on the ground over a space
of thirty or more feet, across which neither man nor beast can
pass with impunity. It is difficult to force a horse through
them; and a dog will never venture, unless the space is suffi-
ciently narrow to enable him to cross by a bound. He knows
well that, should he fall, they would set upon him; and, before
many hours were over, in spite of his strength, entirely con-
sume him. They have been known to attack horses and cattle
shut up in a confined space, and to reduce them to skeletons
in less than a couple of days. They sometimes enter a
dwelling-house through a small hole, and literally take pos-
session, proceeding across the floor, over the walls and ceilings.
"When I resided in the Brazils." said Senhor Silva, as we

stood surveying the ants at work, "I was one morning seated
at breakfast with my wife and little boy, when I heard outside
the house a great commotion, and in rushed a black servant
carrying the cage of our favourite parrot in one hand and
grasping a number of pet fowls in the other; while our negro
girl, hurrying in from another direction, and catching up the
lapdog, cried out, "Seel they come—they come! Fly, senhor.
Fly, my dear mistress-fly, or you will all be eaten up."
Looking down to the ground, towards which she was directing
her alarmed gaze, I saw that it was covered by countless
numbers of white auts, which came swarming in through a
small hole in the wall. I can only liken the appearance of
the insects to a stream of water suddenly bursting into the
house, so rapidly did they make their way through the open-
ing. It was too late to think of stopping it, for the room
was in a few seconds full of them. My wife, taking the advice
of the girl, seized our boy by the hand and fled into the garden.
I followed quickly, for already I felt the ants biting at my
feet. Not for some hours were we able to return, when we
found that our invaders had devoured every particle of food
in the house. They did us, however, an essential service, by
destroying all the mice and cockroaches, as well as other insects
which they encountered, so that on that account we were much
obliged to them; but there are many instances on record of
their destroying human beings unable to move on account of
sickness, and with no one to assist them. Formerly, it is
said that criminals secured by shackles were laid in their
way; happily, however, this terrible custom no longer
exists, even among the most savage tribes. They, in most
cases, as in ours, effectnally rid a house of mice, and take
but few minutes to devour one, leaving only its bones and
hair."
We were glad to leave the wonderful insects to their repast

on the dead gorilla, and, returning to our camp, found our
bearers ready for starting.
We toiled on all day, ascending the sides of the mountain
range. Now we had to plunge into a valley thickly covered
with trees, and then to ascend the opposite side, now to pro-
ceed along the edge of lofty precipices. Sometimes the ascent
was so steep that we were obliged to use our hands as well as
our long poles to make our way up it. I was thankful that
bearers had been provided for the young ladies; for although
they had spirit enough to attempt whatever we did, yet they
must inevitably have been much fatigued had they been com-
pelled to walk. Leo and Natty, however, trudged on bravely
in our midst; and often indeed, when ascending steep places,
took the lead. Chickango, who knew the way, having often
before traversed it, was of great use. He also kept a watchful
eye on either side of the path, especially when we were cross-
ing valleys, lest a leopard or lion might spring out on us, or
any huge serpent might lie across our path. At length we
reached a lofty plateau, or table-land, which Chickango in-
formed Senhor Silva extended a long way to the south. Over
this, therefore, we resolved to travel, till we could find a suit-
able spot in which to fix our abode. We purposed remain-
ing there till we could send a messenger towards the Cape
Colony, hoping that he might fall in with either traders or
explorers or missionaries, several of whom were settled in
Damara or Namaqua land. The further we travelled south,
the cooler and more healthy we should find the climate. We
had no wish, either, to remain longer than necessary in the
gorilla region.

CHAPTER VI.
THE CRYSTAL MOUNTAINS. NEW vorhi
KEVERAL days had passed away. Our progress had,
of necessity, been slow; but it was a satisfaction to
feel that we were going towards the south, and
getting nearer to where we might hope to meet with
assistance. We had all kept our health, and even
my young cousins seemed in no way to have suffered ; indeed,
they looked stronger and better than they were when they
landed. Our bearers, however, had for some time shown a
disinclination to proceed. They told Senhor Silva that they
had come further than they had bargained for, and evidently
began to doubt our intentions. They knew very well that
their countrymen were carried off in great numbers by the
whites; and stories had been told them about the cruelties
practised by those white men, and that they even collect
people merely to slaughter and eat them. Although they did
not perhaps suspect us of such intentions, yet altogether, in
spite of the bribes we had to offer them, they thought it wiser
to return to their own people. Senhor Silva promised them
that as soon as we could find a spot on which to settle, if they
did not wish to remain with us, they should be paid and
allowed to depart.
Chickango and Timbo had by this time become great

friends. They were able to converse freely together; and
Timbo told me that he was doing his utmost to instruct his
countryman.
"Timbo tell de Chicken all about England and Cape Town,
and de oder countries of de world, and de big ships, and de
rich white men; and, more dan dat, I tell him dat he got
soul, and dat white man and black man hab de same God;
and if he stay wid us, we treat him like one broder. You see,
I no t'ink he go away now."
Not without the greatest difficulty, however, could Chick-
ango persuade his countrymen to proceed further with us.
The hills over which we were travelling were covered thickly
with wood, so that often we could see but a short distance
either on one side or the other. Now and then we came to
openings, whence we looked down on the wide-spreading
country on either side, partly hilly or undulating, and then
stretching away in an even plain, intersected by rivers, till
lost to sight. Stanley and Senhor Silva, with their guns, were
ranging the country on either side.
"Listen !" cried David, who was walking by my side.
"What noise is that?".
I listened.
"It sounds like the roar of breakers on a rocky shore," I
observed.
" No," he said ; "it must be a waterfall."
Hurrying on, we saw before us a wide lake-like expanse on
one side, and on the other a cloud of spray floating in the air.
As we drew nearer, a broad stream appeared, rushing over a
ledge of rocks and falling into a deep chasm below, after which
it ran towards the south and east.
"This would be a grand place to settle on," said David.
" Where there is water in this region we are sure to find
abundance of game; and it will assist us in defending our.

SETTLING THE MATTER.

selves against any attacks of the natives, should they prove
hostile."
I agreed with David, and we anxiously looked out for the
appearance of Stanley and Senhor Silva, to learn whether they
were of the same opinion. When Kate and Bella overtook us,
they were delighted with the scene, and agreed that it was
just the place where they should like to settle.
In a short time Stanley arrived. He was as well pleased
as we were with the appearance of the country around. Senhor
Silva had no objection to fixing our abode there, though he
would have preferred moving on, in the hope before long of
reaching Portuguese territory. Chickango, however, assured
us that the country to the south was more difficult to pass
over than that we had traversed, and that without men to
carry our provisions and goods we could not perform the
journey. The matter was settled by our bearers refusing to
proceed further. Senhor Silva asked Chickango whether he
intended to return with his people or to remain with us. He
hesitated; then he seized Senhor Silva's hands, and gave rapid
utterance to an harangue.
"He say we good people, he stop. He my broder now.
Hurrah !" exclaimed Timbo.
Although Chickango had resolved to remain with us, he
could only induce his countrymen to delay their departure for
a few days, in order to assist us in putting up our huts. They
at once set to work to construct our usual shelter for the
night, which would serve until we could erect a more per-
manent abode. We fixed upon a spot considerably raised
above the head waters of the stream, which would defend us
on one side from wild beasts, while the ground sloping down-
wards on the other would enable us to fortify it against either.

THE FASHION OF OUR HUTS.
on level ground, no ordinary means are capable of keeping
them out. I should observe that there are no tigers in Africa;
their absence, however, as Leo remarked, being more agreeable
than their company. Stanley and Senhor Silva had been very
successful in their hunt, and had brought back a good supply
of birds and young deer, besides three or four smaller animals.
By Chickango's advice, we built our huts in the fashion of
his people—that is to say, facing each other, so as to form a
street, with their backs to the outside of our little fortress. As
the river side was altogether enclosed, one strong door at the
other end was sufficient for all the houses. For the sake of
air, however, we built our huts separate from each other, and we
thus had windows on all sides. The poles were of bamboo,
and the walls strong pieces of bark, secured by ropes com-
posed of creepers. The framework roofing was also formed of
bamboos, with thick palm-leaves at the top, kept down by
ropes. At the inner end was a shed for cooking; and our
street was sufficiently wide to enable us to light a fire at night
in the centre, to prevent the unwelcome intrusion of wild beasts.
Our habitation, though not very imposing, was sufficiently
strong to keep out the wet and rain, and, at the same time,
was tolerably cool.
The two young ladies had one house to themselves ; Stan-
ley, David, and Senhor Silva another; the boys and I a third ;
Timbo and Chickango had one to themselves; and Jack was
left alone in his glory, he taking a small one at the entrance,
and having charge of the gate.
"You may depend upon me," he said. "I will always
sleep with one eye open; and if any strange black fellows
come near us, or any savage beasts, I will be up and have a
crack at them before they know where they are."
The bearers, having performed their contract very much to
our satisfaction, received from Senhor Silva a piece of calico,

a knife, and some tobacco, as their payment, with a few beads
for their wives, either present or prospective, with which they
seemed highly pleased. When they were about to take their
departure, Chickango addressed them. What he said we did
not understand, but the result was that they agreed to stop
two or three days longer and assist us in hunting, whereby
they themselves were to benefit by a share of the spoil. They
remained at night in the huts they had previously occupied,
while we took possession of our new abode. Besides our
sleeping houses, there was a large one intended for what Leo
called our banqueting-hall. In the centre we constructed a
long table, at which we could all sit, with two chairs at the
end for the ladies, Stanley, as our chief, having his seat be-
tween them, somewhat in the fashion of ancient days, Jack
and the two blacks taking their places at the further one.
Our bed - places were formed of bamboos raised from the
ground. Senhor Silva politely devoted some of his calico
to making curtains for those of the young ladies. He had
also brought some mosquito-curtains, which he presented to
them; for we found that even in that higher region we were
not free from those pests of a hot climate.
As I gazed round our new location, I could not help wish-
ing that it was the permanent abode of civilized men. Far
as the eye could reach, forest and prairie stretched away into
the interior, capable of supporting a dense population; and
from the health we had hitherto enjoyed, I saw no reason why
even whites should not inhabit it; or, at all events, a civilized
black community might there, I hoped, be some day estab-
lished.
As soon as our black friends had agreed to remain, they set
off, headed by Chickango, for the purpose of exploring the
banks of the stream, to ascertain in what direction we should
commence our hunt the following day. They had not been

AN HIPPOPOTAMUS HUNT.
long absent, when Chickango came hurrying back in a state
of excitement, and called to Senhor Silva.
" They have discovered an hippopotamus higher up the
stream, and beg that we will go out at once and assist in
killing it."
"What ! can they wish to eat one of those ugly brutes ?"
said Leo. "If they are like those we saw the other day, it
will be a hard matter to kill them."
"Nothing comes amiss to them," said Senhor Silva ; " and
we must not disappoint them."
Senhor Silva, with Stanley and Chickango, accordingly
started off, the two boys and I accompanying them to see ahe
sport. Chickango led us some way up the stream, where, on a
rock among the trees which lined the island in the centre, we
saw a huge monster. He turned his eyes towards us; but
from the indifference with which he regarded our approach, it
was evident that he was unaccustomed to the sight of man.
Chickango shouted out.
"What does he say?" asked Stanley.
"It is an hippopotamus. You must fire, and hit him under
the ear, and you are sure to kill him," said Senhor Silva.
"The blacks want the creature for food, and you must not
disappoint them."
The water by the side of the banks above the fall was shal-
low, flowing amongst numerous rocks. Stanley carried a long
pistol in his belt.
"Here, take my gun," he said. "I can hit the creature
with this; and if I fall, it will not be of so much consequence."
Springing forward, he levelled his pistol, and the huge
beast rolled over into the water and was carried down the
stream. The report, however, brought out several others from
among the trees on the river's bank. They came swimming
down towards the fall. I was surprised they did not make

towards us, and could not help feeling anxious for Stanley's
safety. He stood his ground, however. Two or three had
passed before he had again loaded. He then took aim at a
third. He missed! The whole herd now made for the falls.
The body of the first rolled over and over, but the others
plunged downwards in a way which showed that they were
well accustomed to the feat; and we saw them swimming
down the centre to the lower part of the stream. As the last
was passing, Stanley took steady aim, and by the way the
creature moved, it was evident that it was severely wounded.
The blacks now shouted out again, and led the way down
to the lower part of the waterfall. We all followed. How
they proposed getting the bodies of the hippopotami out of
the river I could not tell, and fully expected that they would
soon be lost to sight. There was, however, an eddy, which
probably the blacks had observed, and into this both the huge
animals were drawn. Still they were at a considerable dis-
tance from the land. The blacks, as soon as they reached the
banks, began cutting away at a grove of reeds, a species of
palmyra. As soon as they were cut, a layer was thrown on
the surface of the water. Another layer was placed cross-
ways on this ; and so on, till the raft was of sufficient thick-
ness to bear the party. No binding was required, as the reeds
were thus sufficiently united for the purpose. With some long
poles and some ratan vines cut from the forest, three hunters
embarked. Throwing their ropes round the head of the first
animal they got up to, they soon towed it ashore, where their
companions secured it, while they shoved off for the other.
The second was scarcely dead, though unable to defend
itself. They secured it to the raft, when it gave a convulsive
struggle, and then opened its enormous jaws, which were
certainly big enough to swallow one of the men at a mouthful.
It was its last effort, however, for it merely grasped the edge

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS DESCRIBED.
of the ra?t, and the blacks, shoving on, soon brought it to
land.
I had now, for the first time, an opportunity of examining
an hippopotamus thoroughly. It is a most singular looking
animal, which may be described as intermediate between an
overgrown hog and a high-fed bull, without horns and with
cropped ears. It has an enormous head. Each of its jaws
is armed with two formidable tusks, and those in the lower,
which are the largest, are nearly two feet in length. The
nostrils, ears, and huge eyes are placed on nearly the same
plane, thus allowing the animal to make use of its three senses
and of respiration, at the same time exposing but a very small
part of its body. It is but little inferior in size to the elephant,
though its legs are very much shorter ; indeed, the belly in
the full-grown one almost touches the ground. The hoofs
are divided into four parts, unconnected by membranes. By
this means it is able to spread out its clumsy-looking toes,
and to walk at a quick pace even through mud or in very deep
water. The skin is from one to two inches thick, and com-
pletely bullet-proof, except behind the ear and near the eye,
where it is thinner; and it has a few hairs only on the muzzle,
the edge of the ears, and tail. When out of the water it is of
a purple-brown hue. In the young animal it is somewhat of
a clay yellow, and under the belly of almost a roseate hue;
but seen in a clear pool it is a sort of dark blue, or light
Indian-ink hue. As we looked at its head we agreed that few
animals have more hideous or terrific countenances.
"Why, he would swallow Natty and me up at a mouthful,"
said Leo, as he tried to lift up the jaws of one of the huge
animals.
"Take care ! he will bite !" cried out Natty; and Leo,
letting his stick drop, sprang back with an expression of
horror in his countenance which made us all laugh.

THE LAST OF THE BEARERS.
137
We left the blacks cutting up their prizes, for which, through
Chickango, they expressed themselves duly grateful to Stanley.
We found that the young ladies, aided by Timbo, had pre-
pared a sumptuous repast of wild-fowl and venison, to which
we now added some hippopotamus steaks. The meat was
somewhat coarse-grained, but tasted not unlike beef. Our
black friends consumed it eagerly. During supper we dis-
cussed our plans for the future. Chickango assured Senhor
Silva that he hoped to obtain a messenger to proceed to the
south, although he himself would not venture to go alone.
He took his meals with us; indeed he was, in many respects,
a civilized black. He knew perfectly well how to behave at
table; and used his knife and one of the wooden forks Jack
and Timbo had manufactured with perfect ease.
At length our black friends, loaded with as much hippo-,
potamus-meat as they could carry, in addition to the various
articles they had received as payment, took their departure.
We should have been better pleased had they continued with
us, as we might then have proceeded further south without
the assistance of strangers.
I have hitherto said very little about Natty Page. He had
greatly recovered his spirits after the loss of his father, and
now showed that there was a great deal in him. He and Leo
and little Bella were the life of our party. They, happily,
were not troubled with thoughts of the difficulties and dangers
before us, and enjoyed the present to the utmost.
"Do you not think, Andrew," said Natty to me, "that if
we were to build a canoe we could explore the river and make
our way to the south far more easily than by land? Meantime,
it would assist us in our hunting expeditions; and we should
be able to go fishing or shooting birds, although I should not
much like to meet with any of those fierce monsters the
captain killed the other day."


## p. 138 (#142) ############################################

138
AN EXCELLENT IDEA.
" An excellent idea, Natty," I answered. "I will propose
it to Captain Hyslop, and I am sure he will agree with you."
Stanley was well pleased with the suggestion, and it was at
once agreed that we should carry it into execution. -
"I, however, never built a canoe, and should scarcely know
how to set about it, although I understand the management of
one thoroughly," said Stanley. "I must trust, therefore, to
others."
"No fear, captain," observed Timbo. "Jack, Chickango,
and I soon do de work. First t'ing find big tree; and Senhor
Silva got axes, so we soon cut it down."
Before the day was over we found a large tree, not more
than three hundred yards from the bank of the river, which
was likely to answer our purpose. The trunk was perfectly
straight, the wood soft, and about twelve feet in circumfer-
ence. The axes our Portuguese friend had among his stores
were, however, rather small for the purpose; but yet, if care-
fully used, we hoped, with perseverance, to have the tree felled
in the course of a day. Jack Handspike undertook to act as
chief architect, although Chickango and Timbo, I suspect,
knew more about the actual work than he did.
"Now, boys," he sung out, " the first thing we have got to
do is to place the craft in the right position for launching, so
just see that the tree falls towards the river."
Senhor Silva interpreted Jack's remark to Chickango. He
nodded, and forthwith cut from the surrounding trees a
number of vines, as creepers of all sorts are called. These,
with my aid and that of the two boys, he formed into a strong
rope. He then mounted the tree by throwing a band round
it and his waist, till he reached the branches, carrying the end
of the rope with him. This he secured to the top. Descend-
ing, he made signs to us to carry it to a distance towards the
river, where he secured the opposite end to another tree.

BUILDING A CANOE.
139
Jack and Timbo, who were expert axe-men, then began
cutting away near the ground. First they made a deep notch
on the river side, scoring the tree all round. David and I
stood by ready to take their places, while Stanley and Senhor
Silva went in search of game.
"But what are we to do?" exclaimed Leo. "We do not
want to be idle!"
"No, young masters, nor need you," said Jack. "We
shall want spars and oars, so do you go and look out for some
small trees fit to make them out of, and cut them down."
"That will be capital," cried Natty. "We will soon have
a mast and yard ready for you, and as many paddles as we
can pull."
The young ladies, meantime, remained in the house, that
Kate might teach Bella, and, when the lessons were over, get
dinner ready for us. We worked away with a will, the sound
of the axes never ceasing, for as soon as Jack and Timbo were
tired, David and I stepped into their places.
. "See, we shall soon have the trunk through!" cried Jack.
"Run and help Chickango, and haul away as hard as you can.
We will have the tree down in a jiffy in that clear space."
We gave a loud cheer as we saw the tall tree bending to-
wards us, and hauling with all our might as we ran from it,
down it came with a crash. Then, as if it had been some
huge creature with long feelers ready to seize hold of us, we
rushed at the branches with our axes, and began hacking away
at them. We had now to cut off a piece of the trunk of
sufficient length for the canoe. Jack wanted to make it thirty
feet long; but Timbo advised that it should not be more than
twenty feet, that it might be the more easily managed in the
stream. As we had no saw, this had to be done with our
axes, and, of course, occupied more than half as much time as
getting down the trunk. The boughs, also, had to be cut up

.
and cleared away, that we might have an open road to the
river. By the time this was done night had come on, while
hunger made us all ready to return to the house.
The boys were very proud of the tree they had cut down
for a mast. They had barked it completely, and shaped it
partially, and now came towards us bearing it on their
shoulders in triumph.
"Do you not think we might saw the thick end off ?" cried
Leo, after he had gone a little way with us. "It is wonderfully
heavy, I can assure you, and I do not think so long a mast
can be required."
"Better cut it in half at once and make two masts," said
Natty. "It is somewhat heavy to carry up to the top of the
hill."
"Come, young masters, I see what it is you want," said
Jack. "You have cut down the spar, and done it well, and
you think that stronger men ought to carry it. Timbo and I
will relieve you of it, and you may run on ahead and say we
are coming."
However, the boys, after all, were not very willing to give
up the spar of which they were so proud, and carried it on a
little way further in spite of their friends' offers. At length
Jack quietly put his shoulder under one end, and Timbo took
the other, and fairly lifted it off their backs. It was high
time, for their knees were beginning to shake, and their faces
looked very red with their exertions. The mast was indeed a
great deal too long for the canoe, and required more than a
third cut off.
We found that the young ladies had, as usual, niade ample
preparation for our supper, and Kate had found time to give
Bella her usual lessons. Her instruction was imparted -
certainly under difficulties. Her only books were a Bible, a
small History of England, a Johnson's Dictionary, and a work

HOW WE FORMED THE CANOE.
141
on natural history. The latter was especially useful to all of
us, as it gave a very fair account of many of the animals we
were likely to meet with. Senhor Silva had laid in a good
stock of paper, pens, and ink. Kate herself was so well
acquainted with geography, that she was able to draw maps,
and teach her sister without difficulty. History, too, she
seemed to have at her fingers' ends, so that Bella not only
learned about England, but most other countries in the
world.
Next day we all went back to our work. We began first
to shape the outside of the canoe-a task we performed with
our axes, and at this four could work at once. By Jack's
advice we planed off the upper side of the tree, so that the
plan of the canoe could be drawn off on it by exact measure-
ments. We first drew a straight line down the centre, and
from this measured off the two sides with the greatest care.
In the same way the stem and stern were measured with a
plum-line. We then turned the log over, and having levelled
that side, marked off the keel, thus having it truly in the
centre. Natty and Leo had remained to assist in turning over
the log.
"Why, that is exactly how I should cut out a model-boat!"
exclaimed Leo. "If we had a saw we could shape the bows
and stern much more easily, just as I always used to do."
"But you see, young gentleman, we must make use of
what tools we have," observed Jack. "By sticking at it, I
dare say we shall not be as long cutting out this here canoe as
you would have been making a little model."
"Let me see," said Leo. "No; I remember it took me
a good month before I got it ready for painting, and even
then, I own, from some unaccountable cause, it was somewhat
lopsided."
"Maybe you did not use the plum-line, Master Leo,"

142
LEO'S WILD MAN.
observed Jack. "You sce there is nothing like that for
getting things perpendicular, though I cannot say exactly the
reason why."
"There I have you, Jack, then," said Leo. "It is on ac-
count of the centre of gravitation, and a weight let down on
the earth always falls perpendicularly to the plane of the
earth."
"That may be philosophy, as you call it, Master Leo, but I
cannot say as how I am much wiser than I was; only you
will see we will get our canoe to sit fairly on the water-
neither heeling over to one side nor t'other."
Having got all our measurements correct, we once more put
the canoe on an even keel, and then commenced chopping
away round the intended gunwale, so as to have the upper
works done first. By Jack's advice she was sharp at both
ends, like a whale-boat, that we might the better back out of
danger if necessary.
" Come, you are getting on so fast with the canoe, that we
shall not have the spars ready if we do not set to work," said
Natty. "Come along, Leo;" and the boys ran off with their
axes on their shoulders in high glee.
They had not been gone long when we heard their voices
crying out, " Come, come !-quick, quick!" Stanley, David,
and I hurried on with our guns, which we kept ready for use,
and soon reached the boys. They were too excited at first to
speak. "A wild man!" cried Leo. "A fierce-looking
fellow! I thought he was going to run after us, but he did
not, and I do not know if he is still there."
"But was he a wild man ?" said Natty. " He was walk-
ing along on all fours, and then he went up a tree. If he had
been a man I do not think he would have done that."
"Probably he was a big ape," said David; "another
gorilla."


## p. 143 (#147) ############################################

HOUSE-BUILDING APES.
143
" No, no; not a gorilla," answered Natty ; " but I think he
was an ape. He was not so big as the fearful one the captain
killed and the ants ate; but he is a big fellow, notwithstanding."
This account of course excited our curiosity, and we all
hurried on, hoping to find the creature which the boys had
seen. They led us some way into the forest.
"We shall frighten him if we make a noise," whispered
Natty.
"But I say he is a wild man, and I do not think he will
be frightened," said Leo. "Only take care; if he has com-
panions they may rush out and surprise us."
"Whether man or beast, we will be cautious," said Stanley,
advancing in woodland fashion, concealing himself as much as
possible behind the trunks and undergrowth.
The boys kept close to his side. Presently they stopped,
and pointed to a tree standing by itself in a little open glade.
The lowest branch was about twenty feet from the ground,
and on looking up we saw spread above it a curious roof of
leaves like an umbrella, while seated on a branch with one
arm round the tree was a huge ape. His feet were resting
on the stump of a lower branch, while his head was so com-
pletely covered by the roof of his nest that it almost looked
like a Chinaman's huge hat. Presently we heard him give
a peculiar sound, something like "hew "_"hew," which was
answered from a little distance, and looking round, we dis-
covered another roof with an ape seated under it. We guessed
that it was the female, by her having a funny-looking young
ape clinging to her, which she held, as a nurse does a baby, in
one arm. We had advanced so cautiously that neither of the
animals saw us. They were smaller than the gorilla; the hair
seemed blacker and longer, and more glossy.
"Do not kill the creatures," said David. "They will do
us no harm, and we do not want them for food."


## p. 144 (#148) ############################################

144
CAPTURING A YOUNG NSHIEGO.
This remark was made just in time to save the life of the
old ape, at whom Stanley was aiming.
" You are right," he answered. "I should like to know
more about them, however."
" Perhaps Chickango or Timbo can tell us," answered
David.
As it was not far off, the boys agreed to go and get them,
while we watched the spot. Before long the two blacks came
creeping up. Chickango watched them for a little time.
Then he spoke to Timbo, who whispered to us :
" He say dat is Nshiego Mbouve. He got bald head, wide
mouth, round chin, and-see! beard like one old man! He
not nearly so strong as gorilla. Dey stay dere; no fear, not
run away now."
With this information we returned to the canoe. Timbo
advised the boys to keep at a distance from the animals; for
should they discover that they were watched, they might come
down and attack them. Being somewhat tired with our work,
and having made considerable progress, we retired earlier than
usual to the Castle ; for such was the name we had given our
abode. Chickango and Timbo, however, remained behind,
keeping their guns with them, and saying that they would
give a few more touches to the canoe.
We had scarcely reached the house when we heard a distant
shot. Leo and Natty, who had just given an account of the
animal they had seen to the young ladies, and were still some-
what excited, ran out to ascertain who had fired. We heard
them shouting out-
"There they are ! and they're bringing a little chap along
with them !"
"It is a young ape," cried Natty.
"No; I tell you it is a small savage-a boy," exclaimed
Leo. "See! why, he is walking along !"


## p. 145 (#149) ############################################

A CHUM FOR LEO AND NATTY.
145
This announcement, as may be supposed, made us all rush
to the door. Sure enough, the two blacks were seen dragging
along a young ape with a handkerchief tied over its head; and
even then it was turning first on one side and then on the
other, endeavouring to bite its captors.
"I am afraid they must have killed the old one," said
David, " or they would not have caught that young creature.
That must be the little ape we saw with its mother. No, we
did not tell them to let the animals alone ; and they do not
understand the humane feelings which, at all events, ought to
influence us. They probably were surprised we did not kill
the creatures at once."
The blacks now came up with their prize.
" We killed de big mother," said Timbo. " Chickango
say he go back and fetch her when we make fast de little one,
which we bring as playmate for Missy Kate and Bella."
"I doubt if the young ladies will be pleased with their
intended companion," observed David.
"Oh, but he will do as a chum for us !" cried Leo. "He
is a brave little chap; I like the spirit he shows, doing his
best to bite you."
The young nshiego was at once secured in Chickango's hut,
for he undertook to take charge of the creature and tame it.
David, hearing that the mother was shot, was eager to go and
examine her. We accordingly all set off with some poles on
which to convey the body. We found on measuring it that it
was about four feet high. The skin was black, and many
parts of the body were covered with thin blackish hair. It
was a far less powerful animal than the gorilla, though its
arms were rather longer in proportion to its size. One of its
characteristics was its bald head. Its mouth was wider, and
the nose less prominent than that of the gorilla. We found
nothing but leaves in its inside, which were apparently the

food on which it lives. Our young doctor was anxious to
secure its skin ; and the blacks wished to have its flesh for
eating, but to this even Jack demurred.
"No, no !" exclaimed Jack. "I would as lief almost eat
one of your people."
This made Timbo very indignant.
"Dis beast no man," he exclaimed ; "no mind, no soul.
Why not eat him? Chickango say he bery good food."
It was finally agreed that Chickango should cook it out-
side the Castle, if he wished it, and that he and Timbo should
be welcome to feast off it. Senhor Silva and David's curio-
sity prompted them to taste some of the animal, which they
declared to be very delicate, and not unlike venison. They,
however, were very unwilling that Kate and Bella should hear
of it.
"You know we eat small monkeys without scruple, and I
cannot therefore see why we should not eat the flesh of a big
one; in reality, I suspect it is the best of the two," observed
the young doctor.
Our amusement for some time every evening was endeavour-
ing to civilize our young prisoner, the little nshiego. Leo at
once called him Chico, because Chickango had caught him,
and chico in Spanish means " little."
The mother's skin had been drying on some trees outside the
Castle. No sooner was it brought in than the creature recog-
nized it, and, running towards it, placed its bands on the head,
and finding that it did not move, broke out into a plaintive
cry which sounded like " Ooye ! ooye! ooye!" and then it
looked up in our faces as if seeking for commiseration. At
length it ran up to the doctor, and appeared to appeal to him
to restore its mother. Jack, who stood by, watched it with
an eye of pity. The little creature seemed to understand his
feelings; and at length the sailor took it in his arms and

147
caressed it, while Timbo carried off the skin and hid it in his
hut. Chico after this always seemed to consider Jack his
particular friend. In a few days it became perfectly tame,
and showed no inclination to run away. I shall have more to
say about Chico by-and-by.
The canoe was progressing. The boys had cut their spars
in a very creditable way, and now coinmenced chopping out
boards of sufficient width for the paddles. They had, how-
ever, ample time for exploring the neighbourhood. The
morning after the capture of Chico they had gone out at an
early hour, when, just as we were beginning breakfast, we
heard their shouts proceeding from the higher ground up the
stream. We ran out, thinking something was the matter.
"We have seen two huge baboons," exclaimed Leo. " If
we had had a gun, we should have killed one of them, at all
events."
David and I accompanied the boys along the banks of the
river for some distance, when they said we must be near the
spot; and directly afterwards we saw two creatures, one seated
on a fallen trunk on the top of the cliff, gazing out over the
stream. I examined them with my glass, which I then handed
to David.
"Those are baboons," he said. "Their faces more resemble
those of dogs than of monkeys ; and hideous-looking monsters
they are. It was fortunate you boys did not encounter them.
You must take care and not go unarmed so far from our
Castle."
" I should say they were nearly as large as gorillas."
"Now the sun is shining on them, I can see their huge
black faces. That big fellow on the trunk has a hide of reddish
brown colour, though his head is shaded with light red, and
his limbs are of a fawn colour. He is, I suspect, the Cyno-
cephalus anerbis. See! he is sitting down, scowling round

AN ADVANCE AND A RETREAT.
him maliciously, as if in search of an enemy, or meditating on
his own bad deeds. They always move over the ground on
all fours, and often descend in numbers on a plantation, and
carry off all the fruits they can lay hands on. We must take
care to keep them at a distance, for from what I have heard
they are as daring as the gorilla, and, though not so powerful,
more mischievous."
"Let us see if we cannot frighten them," said Leo; and
before we could stop him, he rushed out, clapping his hands
and shrieking loudly.
The baboons gazed at us with looks of astonishment, when
several others, scrambling out from the neighbouring rocks,
assembled in a body. They seemed to be consulting together
whether they should advance, when Leo and Natty again
shouted. This seemed to decide them ; and they began,
instead of running away, to approach us in a menacing atti-
tude. I now saw it was time to fire. I took aim, and hit the
leader. He stopped for an instant, and, giving forth a loud
cry between a bark and a roar, turned round, and with his
companions made off into the rugged country up the river. I
must say I was very glad thus to be rid of them ; for although
I had often seen baboons in captivity, when I thought them
disgusting-looking creatures, in their wild state as they had
just exhibited themselves they looked ferocious and terrible in
the extreme.
David told us they often go hunting in packs like wolves,
and on those occasions do not hesitate to attack the largest
wild animals. Sometimes they will assault even elephants,
while they without hesitation encounter the leopard and

variety of their colour. Often their cheeks are striped with
violet, scarlet, blue, and purple, which looks not unlike arti-
ficial tattooing; the nose is blood-red; the loins, which are
almost bare, are of a violet-blue colour, gradually verging into
a bright blood-red; the tail is short, and carried erect. Though
very fierce in their wild state, they are more easily tamed than
the other baboons. I had seen one in a London menagerie,
who went by the name of Jelly, and who really knew how to
behave himself, as he could sit upon a chair, and drink out of
a pewter can, and smoke a pipe as if he enjoyed it.
Every day we met with various small monkeys in whole
troops, skipping about the trees, and looking down upon us
wherever we went. Kate was much alarmed when she heard
of the boys' encounter with the baboons, and entreated them
in future not to go from the Castle without a third person
well armed.
"But," said Leo, "give me a gun or Stanley's pistols, and
I will fight as well as anybody."
" And I will back him up," said Natty.
"Yes; but Leo might miss the wild beast, and you might
hit Leo, and so I am afraid you would have a very unsatis-
factory account to give of yourself when you got home," said
Stanley
" By which observation, Captain Hyslop, I conclude you
are descended from an Irishman," observed Senhor Silva ;
"for if Natty was to kill Leo, and a wild beast was to carry
off Natty, I do not see how they could come and give an ac-
count of themselves."
" Had poor Terence O'Brien uttered the expression, I should
not have been surprised," said Kate, laughing at her brother.
"But I hope such a dreadful event will not occur, and that
L'eo and Natty will be content not to make use of firearms till
they are a little more accustomed to them."

CANOE NEARLY FINISHED.
" There I have you, sister," said Stanley. "How are they
to be accustomed to them unless they use them? Well, as we
are brother and sister, it is not surprising that you should
make such a remark; and I believe our dear mother comes
from Ireland, which I suppose will fully account for the same.
However, in my opinion, the sooner the boys learn to use fire-
arms, under the circumstances in which we are placed, the
better. It is very important that boys should learn to swim,
ride, and row, if they are to go out into the world. I must
give them regular shooting lessons. They will then be able
to use their guns to advantage when called upon to do so."
As soon as breakfast was over we hurried down to the canoe.
The outside was now completed, and there was ample work
for all hands in cutting out the inside. We commenced with
axes, clearing away as much of the wood as we could. When
this was done, we lighted a fire. We had some pieces of bar-
iron : these were made red hot, and we were thus able to
smooth away the parts the axe could not so well reach.

CHAPTER VII.
WE MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF OUR NEIGHBOURS.

CE were working away at the canoe : the boys keep-
ing the fire up; the rest of us heating the irons
and burning out the inside ; Jack amusing him-
self and us by singing a sea-song to the tune of
"Come, cheer up, my lads ;" while Chickango
was indulging himself in shouting a native ditty
of which we could neither make out the words nor very clearly
the tune,—it had reference, I fancy, to our canoe-building, to
which he was wishing all manner of success. Suddenly a loud,
trumpeting sound saluted our ears; and looking round to
. ascertain whence it came, we saw far away in the forest a huge
elephant, which we naturally concluded had been attracted by
our voices. He stood whisking his ears and holding his trunk
out in a somewhat threatening manner. Our guns stood
against the trees at some little distance. Chickango gave a
warning shout.
" Hide behind the trees, or climb up the nearest you can
reach," said Senhor Silva.
Stanley seemed in no way disposed to follow this advice,
but rushed to his gun.
" Come, boys! come with me," cried Jack, "and we will be
up a tree."

ATTACKED BY AN ELEPHANT.
Timbo followed Jack and the two boys. Jack sprang up to
a low bough of a tree, and then, stooping down, with Timbo's
aid helped up the boys. David had some time before this
gone back to the Castle to remain with his sisters. Senhor
Silva also seized his gun, and ran off to a distance. Chickango
rushed behind a stout tree; whilst I, seizing my weapon, stood
by Stanley's side. Just then I recollected that it was only
loaded with small shot, which, of course, would not have been
of the slightest avail against the monstrous animal. Again the
elephant sent forth a loud trumpeting, and rushed towards us.
Stanley took aim and fired, but whether the animal was struck
or not we could not tell : at all events, it came rushing on
furiously towards us.
"Fly behind a tree !" cried my cousin, suiting the action to
the word; but the elephant had his eye fixed on me, and
scarcely had I reached the trunk of the one I had selected when
he was close to me on the other side. Confused by the fearful
noise he made, I knew not which way to turn. He seemed in
no way disposed to quit me. He kept dodging round and
round the tree. "Run to the next tree !" I heard Stanley cry
out. "You may get up it and escape him !" Glancing over
my shoulder, I saw that the boughs were low down, and being
a good climber, I had fair hopes of success. It seemed my
only prospect of escaping a fearful death. I watched my op-
portunity, and when the elephant was on the other side of the
big tree, I ran to the next, and springing to a bough, caught
it, and soon swung myself up to the next. He caught sight of
me, however, shrieking and trumpeting with rage. Even now
I did not feel that I was out of his reach. I had just time to
scramble up to the boughs above my head, when he was close
under the tree. As I did so my cap fell off. I knew that the
animal could reach to a great height with his trunk, and did
not feel secure till I had clambered up to one still higher. I

was then able to look down on my assailant, when I saw that

A PRISONER IN THE TREE.
reached it. He stood gazing up at me with a look of anger;
and knowing his immense strength, I feared that he might
begin to attack the tree, and perhaps pull it down, and thus
get hold of me. I could only hope that my cousin would in
the meantime be able to reload and kill the creature.
I looked round, but could not see him. Presently I ob-
served two young elephants coming out of the bush, when the
old one, giving a glance up at me to see that I was safe, ran
towards them and began fondling them with his trunk; the
infant monsters (for they were as big as cart horses) returning
his caresses with their own proboscises. What had become of
my friends I could not tell. Every instant I expected to hear
the sound of Stanley's rifle, but it was silent. I now began to
fear that some accident had happened to him, for I was very
sure that he would not have deserted me. Jack and the boys
were, I hoped, safe; and I knew that the blacks could very
well take care of themselves. At all events, I thought, Senhor
Silva will return—though, to be sure, he is no sportsman, and
may not wish to encounter the elephant. By degrees the
elephant's anger seemed to abate, and he stood whisking his
tail and flapping his ears, playing with his young charges.
Still I knew very well that should I venture down, his anger
would revive, and he would rush at me as before. I deter-
mined, therefore, to wait patiently till my friends could come
to my rescue.
As I was looking round, trying to discover where Jack and
the boys had got to, I saw the head of a negro moving among
the brushwood. I thought it must be that of Chickango; but
presently I caught sight of another and then another creeping
along like serpents, now moving slowly, now more rapidly. I
concluded that their leader had his eye on the elephant, as
whenever he stopped they stopped, so that they could scarcely
be distinguished on the ground. Each man carried a large

spear in his hand. They increased in numbers, approaching
from all quarters. It was evident that they had tracked the
elephant, and at length closed in on him. They were fierce-
looking warriors, and I could only hope that they might prove
friendly, as from their numbers they would have been awkward
people to deal with as enemies. I expected every moment that
the elephant would discover them, for I thought, by the way
he stopped and looked about, that he was aware that danger
was near. The hunters, however, remained perfectly still, and
I could scarcely have believed that some fifty or more human
beings were close to me, ready in an instant to spring up into
active exertion. I anxiously watched their proceedings, keep-
ing my eye on the man I supposed to be their leader. Once
more I saw him stealthily moving on; then suddenly spring-
ing up from behind a tree, he darted his spear with tremendous
force right into the elephant's neck, and before the creature
could look round, had again disappeared behind the tree. The
young elephants had caught sight of their assailants, but in-
stead of flying, rushed up again to their guardian, one of them
intertwining its trunk round his neck. And now from every
side the hunters started up. Spear after spear was darted into
the elephant's back, till it literally bristled with shafts.
Whenever the creature turned round, he was met by new
assailants, while the young ones were meantime untouched.
The hunters probably knew that they would fall easy victims
when their guardian was killed. The poor creature turned
round and round, apparently to defend its young charges from
the spears of its assailants. Its life blood was now flowing
fast. When the blacks observed this, they continued to plunge
more and more weapons into his body. The young ones
turned round, and, I thought, cast reproachful, if not angry,
glances at the assailants of their guardian. Fresh hunters kept
coming up, and discharging their weapons, again retreated

ASTONISHING THE NATIVES.
under shelter. At length the poor elephant could no longer
move. Its huge head and trunk fell slowly down, then sink-
ing on his knees, fell gradually over on one side. The poor
young elephants were quickly despatched; and the hunters
came rushing up, shouting and singing over their prizes. The
chief then stuck a club into the ground, with a hideous-looking
figure carved on the top of it. On this they all joined hands
and began dancing and shouting more furiously than before,
going round and round their prey. The chief and others then
brought pieces of the meat, which they placed before the idol.
This I now knew to be a fetich, as all idols as well as charms
are called throughout Negro-land. I was afraid every instant
that I should be seen. Hitherto there had been little risk of
that, as they were all so eagerly engaged in their assault on
the elephant. I supposed that my friends must have seen the
hunters; at all events their loud shouts would now make their
presence known.
Presently one of the hunters looking up caught sight of me
in the tree. I thought he would have fallen back with astonish-
ment. The spear he was holding in his hand dropped to the
ground, his hand sank by his side, and he kept gazing up, rolling
the large white balls of his eyes round and round as if he was
going off in a fit. His exclamation drew the attention of his
companions to me. Many of them seemed as much astonished,
exhibiting their surprise in various grotesque ways. What
they took me for I could not tell; probably some strange
animal or a spirit of the woods. The latter was, I believe, the
case. I made signs to them that I wished to be their friend,
putting my hand out as if to shake theirs, and then began
slowly to descend the tree. Still they did not seem to have
made up their minds whether they would wish for a nearer
acquaintance. I tried to explain to them, however, that I had
got up the tree to avoid the elephant, and as they had killed it,

for which I was much obliged to them, I could now come down
without fear. Whether they understood my signs I could not
tell, but by degrees I saw that their fears were somewhat
quelled. Stopping at each branch to make signs, I at length
reached the lowest, when once more stretching out my hand I
dropped to the ground, and, in as composed a way as I could,
walked into their midst. They possibly had never seen a
white man before, and looked at me with as much astonish-
ment as an European who had never heard of the existence of
negroes would have looked at them. They now crowded round
me, and began to examine my dress. Some put their hands
on my face and rubbed it, as if expecting the white colour to
come off. Others examined my hands, while one fierce-looking
fellow poked his fingers through my hair.
Familiarity, it is said, breeds contempt; and when I found
that they were making these advances, I feared that, instead of
looking upon me as some superior being as they at first did,
they might at length ill-treat me. One of them found my
cap, which the elephant had thrown to the ground. After ex-
amining it and putting it on my head, he instantly pulled it
off again and clapped it on his own woolly pate. The chief
hunter next seemed disposed to take possession of my jacket.
I knew it would not do to show any signs of fear, so rushing
at the man who had taken my cap, I seized it from his head
and held it tightly in one hand, while I resisted the efforts of
the chief to draw off my coat. Having satisfied their curiosity
for the present, they at length left me alone, and returned to
the carcases of the elephants.
Their first care was to cut off the tusks of the old elephant,
which were of great size. This done, they gave vent to their
exultation in loud shouts, and then set to work to cut up the
flesh. They seemed to prefer the young ones, the flesh of
which was divided among the whole party. They next assailed

THREATENING ASPECT OF AFFAIRS.
the larger beast, when each man was loaded with as much as
he could carry. This work occupied some time.
Considering that it would be wise to take my departure, I
was on the point of doing so, when several of the blacks seized
me by the arms, and making me understand that I was to
accompany them, pointed to a huge piece of elephant flesh,
which they signified it would be my duty to carry. This was
· more than I had bargained for, and I positively refused to go
with them. They now began to move off, and two or three
attempted to drag me along. I shouted at the top of my voice,
resisting with all my power, " Help!-help!-Jack !—Timbo!
-Chickango!" I had got some way, and was afraid I should
be carried off as a captive, when I heard a shout at a little dis-
tance, and presently saw Timbo and Chickango running
towards us. They were followed by Jack, Stanley, and David,
the two boys bringing up the rear. The hunters, when they
saw my friends advancing, faced about, looking at them with
glances of astonishment. I heard them all talking together,
seemingly asking each other who these strangers could be.
They had recovered their spears, which, still red with the blood
of the elephants, they held in their hands, ready to dart at
Timbo and Chickango. Seeing this, my friends halted, and
placing their muskets on the ground, held up their hands as a
sign of peace, addressing their countrymen, who quickly replied,
turning their glances every now and then at me. Again Timbo
spoke to them, and this time with greater effect than at first.
The expressions of anger and fear which I had observed in
their countenances gradually wore off, and they looked with a
more kindly expression towards me. Presently they turned
the points of their spears to the ground, when my two friends
advancing, took the chief by the hand, and immediately those
who held me brought me to the front. Chickango, who had
taken up the thread of the discourse, went on speaking very

PEACE ARRANGED.
163
vehemently, and advancing, led me out of the throng. Timbo
immediately seized my hand. "Go away-quick now, Massa
Andrew. Perhaps dey change deir mind. See! here come de
captain and Senhor Silva, and de t'ree young gentlemen.
Dese niggers t'ink you white spirit, and no dare hurt you."
By this time the rest of our party had come up, and great
was the surprise of the hunters when Senhor Silva addressed
them in a language they could understand. I do not know
exactly what account he gave of us, but the result was that we
were all in a short time shaking hands, and apparently the
best of friends. They even begged that we would accept of
some of the flesh of the elephants they had killed-to be sure
it was part of what they themselves could not carry off. Our
new friends now invited us to visit them at their village, which
was situated on the summit of a hill about four or five miles
off, but so surrounded by woods that we had not seen it.
From their wild looks and manners, we were not sorry when
at length they took their departure. Timbo called them
Bakelés, and gave no very flattering description of them. We
were thankful that they had not caught sight of our canoe.
They might prove friendly, but should they, as was possible,
attempt to molest us, it might be advisable to leave their
neighbourhood, when we should certainly have a better chance
of escaping by water than by land.
" Then we had better have another craft built without
delay," observed Jack, who heard Stanley make a remark to
this effect. "And now that we know how to set about it, we
should get another built much quicker than the last."
On reaching the Castle we found the young ladies greatly
alarmed at our absence. Senhor Silva, it appeared, had rushed
back and called out David, telling him to come without delay
to our assistance. Some of us were up trees, besieged by an
elephant, and he could not tell what had become of the cap-

A SECOND CANOE BEGUN.
tain and the rest of us. Stanley had, it appeared, lost his bag
of bullets, and had made off to where we were working at the
canoe to find them. This had prevented him from firing at
the elephant; and not being able to find his ammunition, he
also had gone back to the Castle, from which he found David
issuing with a rifle and some bullets. Soon afterwards they
were met by Timbo and Chickango, who also had observed
the approach of the hunters, and had advised them not to show
themselves till the elephant was killed and they were in good
humour after their victory. Jack and the boys had in the
meantime remained up the tree, and, like me, had been watch-
ing all that was taking place. When they saw that I was
made prisoner, they had slipped down, and, unperceived, had
hastened to the Castle for assistance. Kate, on hearing the
account given of the savages, strongly urged us to commence
our journey without delay to the south.
"But you see, miss," observed Jack, "it will take us some
time to build another boat, and it may be that we shall become
good friends with these people before then. Timbo says that
if we know how to manage them, we shall be able to get on
very well, and maybe we shall do them a good turn, and they
will help us."
Our first canoe was now completed, and we lost no time in
commencing a second.
"It would be as well, I think," said Senhor Silva, "after
we have cut down another tree, to take the bull by the horns,
and visit these people at once. If we show confidence in them
they are less likely to injure us, and, at all events, we can be
on our guard against any treachery they may meditate. I
know these native tribes well. If we show that we do not
fear them and are prepared to resist aggression, they will
seldom venture on an attack."
The knowledge that we had a number of natives in our

165
neighbourhood, who might possibly be evil-affected, greatly
changed the sense of security we had hitherto enjoyed.
Although, as far as we were aware, they had not found out
the Castle, they might do so at any moment, and come and
attack us. We agreed, therefore, never to leave it in future
without defenders. We accordingly formed ourselves into two
parties. While one went out hunting, or exploring, or work-
ing at the canoe, the other was to remain in the fortress for
its protection.
Stanley, who always considered it best to meet danger in
the face, or, as our Portuguese friend had said, " to take the
bull by the horns," was anxious forthwith to pay a visit to our
neighbours. He begged Senhor Silva to accompany him, and
chose myself and Chickango to be of the party; while David,
Timbo, and Jack, with the two boys, were left to protect the
young ladies. To increase the strength of our fort, we had
driven stout poles all round it, and formed what Jack called
ports along the walls, through which our muskets could be
fired.
"Do not be afraid, Stanley," said Leo, as we were preparing
to set off. "If the blacks come, we will render a good ac-
count of them. Natty and I can now fire a musket as well as
any of you, and we have been teaching Kate and Bella. We
will beat them off, depend on it."
"I do not think the blacks will come," said Natty; " but if
they do, I think we ought to fight. There is no doubt about
that."
Natty was always more quiet in his remarks than his friend,
but I felt sure there was quite as much mettle in him. With
our guns on our shoulders, our friends cheering us, we marched
down the hill towards the negro village. Senhor Silva had
brought a couple of swords, one of which he wore, and the
other Stanley had girded to his side, while Chickango and I

VISIT TO NATIVE VILLAGE.
carried spears. Stanley had in addition his pistols stuck in
his belt. Altogether we presented a tolerably warlike appear-
ance, sufficient, we hoped, to make the savages treat us with
respect. After proceeding for some distance we found a native
path, which, Chickango said, led to the village. He and I by
this time were able to converse pretty well, I having learned
some of his language, and he having picked up a good many
words of English. We did not always, to be sure, understand
what each other said, but we made out our meaning by signs
when words failed us. An open space at the foot of the hill,
where plantains were growing, showed us that we were near
the village, though it was so completely concealed by trees that
not till we were actually at the gates did we discover it. It
consisted of a long street of huts, the doors facing each other,
with the blank walls on the outside; very similar indeed to
those we had constructed, though ours was on a much smaller
scale. At each end were gates, which were now left .open.
Several men came rushing out, with their spears poised, as we
approached, but on Chickango addressing them, they lowered
their weapons, and gave us a friendly greeting. Their skins
were somewhat lighter than the coast natives. They were
a tolerably good-looking race for Africans. Their only dress
was a piece of matting worn round the loins, and their orna-
ments, necklaces formed of the teeth of wild animals, and rings
round their arms and legs. The women whom we saw had a
number of these rings, while their hair was dressed in various
ways with no little care. Nearly all the people had, slung
over their shoulders, a grass-cloth bag or purse, very neatly
made, in which they carried various articles. The chief had
neat grass-cloth mats spread for us, and taking his seat on one,
he begged us to sit down on the others. Senhor Silva then
presented him with some tobacco, greatly to his delight, and
he instantly produced some well-carved pipes, when, fire being

brought, he commenced smoking with evident satisfaction. It
is curious that savages in both the eastern and western hemi-
spheres should so delight in the much-abused weed. As
we sat smoking the calumet of peace - for such we hoped it
would prove—the chief informed us that he had been residing
at that spot about a couple of years, but added : "I fear we
shall soon have to move towards the coast, for already we hear
that the fierce Pangwes are advancing in this direction; and
unless you white men will help us, we cannot hope to oppose
them." He described the Pangwes as a terrible people, and
great warriors. "It is said that they eat up all the enemies they
kill," he added, shuddering as he spoke. "Such may be our
fate; for as they come not only in hundreds but in thousands,
we cannot hope to withstand them."
Senhor Silva replied, that although we, as visitors to their
country, could not interfere in their quarrels, yet we should be
glad to negotiate with their enemies should they make their
appearance.
The chief laughed at the notion. "You might as well
attempt to turn the torrent of yonder river," he answered, "as
to try and induce the savage Pangwes to turn aside from any
undertaking on which they have resolved. There is only one
thing they understand, and that is the argument which your
muskets can hold. If you wish to aid us, you must come with
them and plenty of ammunition, and you may then make the
Pangwes turn aside to some other district."
I need not further describe our interview, but it ended in a
most satisfactory manner, the Bakelés promising to be our
friends, and to help us should we require their aid. Having
concluded our visit, we took our leave, and commenced our
return homewards. As we made our way through the forest
we saw vast numbers of apes playing about the trees, and kept
a bright look-out on either side lest we should come suddenly

AN APE WITH A WHITE NOSE.
upon a lion or leopard—an animal still more to be dreaded, on
account of the distance it can spring. We trusted to the
guidance of Chickango, for alone I doubt whether we should
have been able to find our way. As we were moving along,
suddenly, from among the leaves of a palm, I caught sight of
an odd-looking face peering out at us, and apparently examin-
ing us with much curiosity. The nose was white, and a thick
fringe of white hair surrounded the cheeks. The face was
black, and the body was of a dark colour, stunted hair cover-
ing the top of the head. I could not help bursting out into
a fit of laughter at the odd look of the creature, for it reminded
me of an old woman. It was unlike any ape I had before
seen. Hearing the noise, it turned up its eyes with a look of
astonishment, and then springing to the nearest branch, ran
off, twirling its long tail, into the depths of the forest. As we
agreed not to kill any animal uselessly, we let it go without
firing a shot; for we were too far off from home to carry it
with us. It would have been useless to collect objects of natural
history, except very small ones, as we could not have conveyed
them with us on the long journey we expected soon to make.
Stanley was not much of a talker, while Senhor Silva was
occupied with his own thoughts; and as Chickango and I had,
as I observed, some difficulty in understanding one another,
we often walked on in silence. For this reason we frequently
came suddenly upon animals which would have taken to flight
had they heard our voices. We were slowly making our way
through the forest, keeping our guns ready to fire at a moment's
notice, when, in the thick shade of some closely growing trees,
we caught sight of another huge ape, with a young one by its
side. At the first glance I fancied it was a gorilla, but the
second showed me that it was a differently formed animal,
and not nearly so large as that monster of the woods. The
mother and infant were gambolling together; the young one

tumbling head over heels, then leaping on its mother's
shoulders, then rolling about the ground, while she turned it
over and over, apparently to the little creature's great de-
light. We all stopped, and concealing ourselves behind some
thick brushwood, watched the creatures.

MOTHER AND CHILD.
"There you see a very curious animal," said Senhor Silva
to me. "That is what you call in Europe a chimpanzee."
The old animal had an intensely black face, while that of
its young one was yellow. It was between four and five feet
in height. Suddenly it stood up on its legs and walked a few
paces, stooping somewhat like an old man. The position it
assumed enabled it to look at us, when, with a sudden cry, it
seized its young one in its arms, and sprang up the nearest
tree, exhibiting a wonderful agility. I should have had no
heart to shoot the creature, and I was glad to see Stanley,
though he instinctively lifted his piece to his shoulder, drop
it again.
"No," he said ; " we must let the mother and child live.
David must go without the specimen. We could not carry
even the skin home, and one young monkey as a pet is enough.
So Master Chico shall have no rival."
We had not gone far when we met with two paths leading
through the thickest part of the forest, both of which we con-
cluded would conduct us homeward.
" If you and Chickango will take one, Senhor Silva and I
will take the other," said Stanley. "We shall have better
prospect of sport, and two guns are sufficient to contend with
either lions or panthers."
We accordingly separated, I taking the path to the right.
When passing through an African forest, it is necessary for
a man to keep his eyes about him in every direction. The
path I was following led to an open space, which had been
used as a plantation by the natives, I guessed, by finding a few
plantains growing on it. Passing across it, we discovered
another path, which led further into the forest. "Dis no man
path," observed Chickango. "Elephant make it." I had no
doubt he was right from the appearance of the opening, the
boughs on either side being broken down, and the ground

being trampled by the feet of large animals. Though I might
have been somewhat proud of "bagging" an elephant, as Stan-
ley would have called it, I had no great wish to encounter one.
Still, as from the direction I judged the path to take, by
observing the way the sun's rays penetrated the thick foliage,
I thought it would lead us homeward, I did not like to turn
back. We therefore proceeded along it. Elephants are toler-
able road-makers, as wherever they can get through an army
may follow.
We went on for about an hour, till we were in a denser
forest than I had yet seen. Creepers innumerable hung down
from the boughs, twisting round them, and forming a complete
network in all directions; while huge fern-leaved plants covered
the ground, waving gracefully above our heads. We were in a
complete labyrinth of shrubs, plants, and creepers, out of which
alone I could certainly never have extricated myself. "No
fear, me find a way," said Chickango, " while sun up," and he
pointed to a small opening above our heads, through which the
sky could be seen. We went on a little way; but it appeared
to me that we were getting more and more involved in the
mazes of the forest. I looked at Chickango. He had always
been faithful. I could not suppose that he now intended
treachery; and yet could he have had any private communica-
tion with the natives we had been visiting, and agreed to de-
liver the white men dead or alive into their hands? I was
following close behind him, for often there was not room for
us to walk two abreast, I should say to creep rather, in and
among the underwood. Suddenly he turned round and touched
me on the arm, making a significant gesture to be silent. Then
he crept slowly on, crouching down close to the ground. I
followed his example as well as I could, though it was difficult to
get on in that attitude. Presently he stopped, as did I, behind
the crooked trunk of a half-dead tree, and listening, I heard a

loud flapping noise as if some machinery were at work. Then
rising a little from my cover, I observed a high brown back,
looking like some vast mound among the foliage. It soon began
to move, and the head and ears of an enormous elephant came
into view. It appeared to me that the creature's eye was
turned towards us. If so, I could not but expect that he would
quickly come to ascertain who were the pigmy intruders into
his domain. Chickango kept crouching down watching the
creature. I fancied I heard a noise on my left side, and
glancing in that direction, I saw another huge head with a trunk
lifted above it. Had I been an experienced hunter, I might
have known how to act. I was afraid of speaking and asking
Chickango what he advised, lest the elephant might hear us.
Even now I could not but suppose that we were perceived.
Presently Chickango sprang to his feet and took aim at the crea-
ture's head. I expected to see it roll over, but some white
splinters which flew from an intervening branch told me that
the bullet had been turned aside, though I fancied even then it
must have struck the animal. Instantly its trunk was lifted up,
and, with a tremendous trumpeting which made the forest ring,
and a loud tramping of his heavy feet, he dashed towards us.
I felt that our lives depended upon the accuracy of my aim. It
was my first shot at an elephant, and let any one fancy how the
mighty animal must appear in a rage, and it may be supposed
that my aim was not likely to be very steady. I fired when
he was about a dozen paces off. A practised sportsman
might have waited longer. If my bullet took effect it did
not stop his charge, for on he came directly at us. Chick-
ango sprang on one side. I attempted to follow his example
by springing on the other. As I did so my gun caught in a
creeper, which suddenly whisked it from my hand. I dared not
stop to recover it. The creature's huge tusks were aimed at
me, I thought, and I expected the next instant to be pierced

through or crushed to death, or to find myself tossed high in
air by his trunk; but, blind with rage, and somewhat puzzled
by two enemies, he ran his trunk against the stump of the
tree with such force as to pierce the rotten wood through and
through. Over it came with a crash ; but so firmly fixed,
that for a moment he could not shake it off, while the dust
from the rotten wood fell into his eyes. His companion,
meantime, was trumpeting away furiously, and advancing
towards us, but Chickango and I were concealed from him by
the thick wood. Other trumpetings were heard at the same
time, which showed us that he had other companions besides the
one we had seen. I had not forgotten the way I had escaped
the previous day, and glancing round, I saw a thick-stemmed
tree directly behind me. I darted round it; while Chickango
concealed himself behind another. Our assailant, meantime,
disconcerted by the piece of the tree still clinging to his tusks,
went crashing on through the underwood till he had got to a
considerable distance from us. His nearest companion, fortu-
nately a female, followed him. "Load, massa, load !" cried
Chickango to me. Alas! I dared not move to recover my
gun, and felt that.my only chance of safety till I could do so
and reload was to keep behind the tree. The male elephant,
having cleared his tusks of the rotten wood, lifted up his trunk,
and began trumpeting away as a signal of defiance, which was
echoed by his other companions in the neighbourhood. Chick-
ango advanced towards him cautiously as before. Once more
he lifted his weapon and fired; but, to my horror, I saw the
creature again dash forward. The black, though a bad shot,
was active of foot, and sprang behind a tree. The other ele-
phant now came rushing forward ; while at the same moment
I heard another trumpeting sound close behind me, and saw, to
my dismay, the vast heads of numerous male elephants, their
huge tusks and trunks towering above the underwood. The

various movements I had made brought me back to the neigh-
bourhood of the spot where the elephant had made his first charge,
when I caught sight of my gun at a little distance. I dashed
forward and seized it. The attempt was dangerous, for the
elephants were coming towards me. In doing so I lost sight
of Chickango; but I was sure from his previous conduct that he
would not desert me. I again retreated towards the nearest
large trunk I could see, though all the intervening space, it
must be understood, was filled with fallen trees, and creepers,
and saplings, intertwined as I have before described. To stay
there, however, I saw would be more dangerous than to take
to flight, as with so many assailants, sagacious and cunning in
the extreme, I should at once have been surrounded ; and as
to climbing a tree, as I had before done, that was impossible,
as no branches were within reach. I had no time either to
reload, my piece. I therefore ran, or rather I scrambled,
among the boughs as fast as I could get along. Probably it
was fortunate my gun was not loaded, as I could scarcely have
prevented the lock catching in the creepers through which I
made my way. For some seconds I thought the creatures
were at fault, for I saw them standing still, looking about for
me. It was sharp work. I did not profess to be an elephant
hunter, but I could not help feeling that I was, at all events,
now being hunted by the elephants. Still I persevered, but I
dreaded every moment to find myself caught by a creeper, or
my head in a noose, and then to see the monsters rush to-
wards me.
The big elephant and his companion whom I had at first
met with now again espied me, and, trumpeting and shrieking,
came dashing through the woods towards me, tearing down
the branches, and trampling the young saplings under foot.
Once I stopped and began to load my gun, but again the
elephants advanced, and I feared that I should not have time

to do so before they were upon me. I continued to retreat in
the same uncomfortable way as before, scrambling over the
fallen trunks, and expecting to see every moment a huge boa,
or some venomous snake, dart out from among them. I was
thus scrambling on, endeavouring to increase my speed, when
one of the dangers I dreaded occurred. I slipped, and my foot
catching in a creeper, held me firmly, while I fell forward
amid the tangled mass of creepers, out of which I could by no
efforts release myself. I struggled in vain. The trumpetings
and cries of the elephants sounded loudly in my ears. Just as
I had given myself up for lost, a shot whistled over my head.
The nearest animal staggered forward till he was within half-
a-dozen paces of me. Another and another shot followed.
One of them appeared to have been equally successful with the
first, for another elephant, turning round as if to move off,
sank hopelessly on the ground. Loud shouts followed, and
presently I saw my cousin and Senhor Silva forcing their way
through the forest, while Chickango darted out from behind a
tree where he had taken post, and fired, just at the moment
to save my life. The other elephants, frightened by the sound,
lifted up their trunks and rushed back into the forest, the
crashing sound of falling boughs and the loud tramp of their
feet showing the direction they had taken.
Two male elephants with fine tusks, and a cow, were the
result of our adventure. The tusks were too valuable to be
left, so we immediately set to work to cut them from the heads
of the animals.
"Pity Bakelés no know of dis," said Chickango. "Dey
come and have great feast, and t'ank us."
Stanley and our Portuguese friend told me that they had
been directed towards the spot on hearing our first shot, and
that then the trumpeting of the elephants had reached their
ears. This had made them hurry forward to our assistance.

CARRY HOME THE TUSKS.
I was thankful that they had arrived thus opportunely, or I
believe that my adventures in Africa would have been termi-
nated. The weight of the tusks was considerable. We slung
them, however, on two poles, and carried them between us,
though darkness had set in before we reached the Castle, and
we felt not a little anxious lest some lurking wild beast might
spring out on us - an event very likely to happen in an
African forest at night. We, however, reached home in safety,
and gave an account of our adventures. Our visit to the
Bakelés' village excited great interest; but when I came to
describe our adventure with the elephants, I saw Kate and
Bella's colour go.
"Oh, Andrew !" exclaimed Kate, "how dreadful it would
have been had the elephants reached you! How providential
it was that Stanley and Senhor Silva arrived in time to save
your life!"
David and his sister both expressed a wish to visit the
Bakelés.
"I am not quite certain that that would be wise," observed
Stanley. "At present they look upon us as a party of warriors
who may be gone to-morrow; but if they see young people,
they will think we have come to settle, and may perhaps be
disposed to try and get rid of us."
Kate was very glad to hear that we had let the chim-
panzee go.
"I wish, though, that you had brought the young one home;
we could very well have taken care of it, and Chico would
like to have a playmate," exclaimed Bella.
"Possibly Chico and Chim might have quarrelled instead
of played together," observed Senhor Silva ; " and I suspect
you will find Chico sufficient to look after."
Senhor Silva, though accustomed to the climate, was not so
strong as most of us, and the morning after our long expedi-

tion he was unable to rise from his couch. David said he had
a bad attack of fever; and as the day wore on, he became
delirious, and caused us great anxiety. He had endeared him-
self to us by his kind and unpresuming manners; besides which
we knew that he would be very useful in enabling us to travel
through the country-indeed, without his aid the difficulties
of accomplishing the journey would be very great. Anxious as
we were, we could not all of us remain at home. David there-
fore stayed behind with the two girls to attend on our sick
friend, and Stanley begged me to accompany him on a shooting
expedition with Chickango, while Jack, Timbo, and the two
boys continued working on the second canoe. We were anxious
to shoot some pigeons and small game for our larder ; though
I suspect Stanley would have been better pleased to come
across some of the larger animals of the forest. We had bagged
a good many birds, when a beautiful little gazelle came bound-
ing across our path. It put me in mind of an Italian grey-
hound, only it had a longer neck and was somewhat larger.
I was quite sorry when Chickango, firing, knocked it over.
It was, however, a welcome addition to our game bag. He
called it Ncheri. It was the most elegant little creature I
met with in Africa among the numberless beautiful animals
which abound in the regions we passed through.
We were at the time proceeding along the foot of a hill.
Scarcely had he fired, when a loud trumpeting was heard, and
directly afterwards we saw a negro rushing through the under-
wood, followed by a huge elephant. "Up! up the hill !"
cried Chickango, suiting the action to the word. I followed,
for as we were wishing to kill birds alone, my gun was loaded
only with small shot. The elephant made towards us. The
negro stranger came bounding on. Chickango and I had got
some way up the hill, but Stanley, who stood his ground, was
engaged in ramming home a bullet. The elephant had all the

time been keeping one eye on the black and one on us. When
I thought he was on the point of seizing my cousin, he sud-
denly turned on his first assailant. The black darted to a
tree, when the elephant, seizing him with his trunk, threw
him with tremendous force to the ground. This enabled
Stanley to spring up after us; and the hill being very steep,
with rolling stones, we hoped that we were there safe from the
attacks of the now infuriated beast. It cast a glance at the
unfortunate black, who was endeavouring to crawl away along
the ground. Again the elephant was about to seize him with
his trunk, and in an instant would have crushed him to death,
when Stanley, raising his gun, fired, and struck the creature
in the most vulnerable part—behind the ear. The ball must
have entered the brain, for, sinking down instantly, it rolled
over, and, we thought, must have killed the black by its weight.
We hurried down, hoping that there might yet be time to
save the poor fellow's life, regardless at the moment of our
victory, which, with hunters in general, would have been a
cause of triumph. As we got round, we found that the black
had narrowly escaped being crushed to death; indeed, as it
was, his legs appeared to lie almost under the monster's back.
We drew him out, however, and to our satisfaction found
that he was still breathing. Chickango said that he belonged
to the Bakelés, and was probably a chief hunter among them.
As, however, we were much nearer our own abode than their
village, Stanley and I agreed to carry him with us, somewhat,
I fancied, to Chickango's astonishment. "Oh! he black
fellow, he die; what use carry ?" he remarked. Of course
we kept to our own opinion, hoping that with David's skill
the poor man might recover. He was unable to speak, and
was indeed apparently unconscious.
" Had my rifle been loaded with ball, I should have saved
that poor fellow the last fearful crush; and in future we must

not go without one or two of our fowling-pieces loaded with
ball," observed Stanley, ramming down a bullet into his rifle.
Chickango and I did the same. We then constructed a
rough litter, on which we placed the injured negro. We bore
him along, my cousin and Chickango carrying the head and I
the feet part of the litter. We found the weight considerable,
especially over the rough ground we had to traverse, but the
life of a fellow-creature depended upon our perseverance.
Chickango carefully noted the spot where the elephant lay,
that we might return as soon as possible for some of the meat
and the tusks, which were very large. We reached the spot
where our friends were cutting out the canoe just as they were
about to leave it, and we were thankful to have their assistance
in carrying the stranger. Kate got a great fright seeing us
coming, thinking that one of our party had been killed. David
instantly applied himself to examining the hurts of the negro.
He found that his left arm had been broken, and the ribs on
the same side severely crushed. "The injuries might be
serious for a European," he observed ; " but the blood of an
African, unheated by the climate, escapes inflammation, and I
have hopes that he may recover." Senhor Silva had recovered
his senses, though still very weak, and when I went to see
him, he expressed his gratitude for the attention with which
David and the young ladies had treated him. Chickango was
very eager to set out immediately, in order to bring in the
elephant's tusks and some meat, but Stanley considered that it
was too late in the day, and put off the expedition till the
following morning.
We were somewhat later in starting than we had intended-
Jack and Timbo accompanying Stanley, Chickango, and I.
We carried baskets and ropes, to bring with us the ivory and
a supply of meat. On reaching the spot, however, where the
huge monster lay, we found that others had been before us.

SMALL MONKEYS AND MONKEY-BIRDS.
The tusks were gone, and a portion of the flesh. Innumerable
birds of prey, also, were tearing away at it, or seated on the
surrounding trees devouring the pieces they had carried off,
while several hyenas, already gorged, crept sulkily away,
doubting whether they should attack us or not. The spectacle
was almost ghastly, and it showed bow soon a mountain of
flesh might disappear in that region. Chickango was greatly
disappointed, as not a particle of flesh which he could touch
remained, while, of course, we regretted the loss of the valuable
tusks. On our way back, we caught sight of a number of
beautiful little monkeys skipping about in the trees. Chick-
ango called them oshingui. They were the smallest I ever
saw. Below the trees where they had their abode ran a small
stream ; and Chickango told me they were very fond of water,
and were never found at a distance from it. On the same trees,
and playing with them, were numerous birds, called monkey-
birds from their apparent attachment to those creatures. We
saw another very beautiful little bird, with an extremely long
flowing tail of pure milk-white. It had a crest on its head of
a greenish black, and its breast was of the same colour, while
lower down the feathers were of an ashy brown. Snow-white
feathers on the back rose up, like those of the birds of para-
dise, to which it had a strong resemblance. Soon after this
I saw some creatures on the ground, and catching hold of one
of them, I found that it was an enormous ant of a greenish
white colour, with a head of a reddish black. The fangs were
80 powerful that when I put my fingers to them, they literally
tore a piece of flesh out.
"Why, these creatures would eat us all up, if we were to
encounter them as we did those the other day," I remarked.
"No fear, massa," answered Timbo. "Dey no come in
same way. Dey no go into house, no climb tree, and only
just a few hundred or t'ousand march together."

ENORMOUS ANTS.

It was satisfactory to hear this, for really I felt that should
an army invade us, we might have more reason to dread them
than the blacks themselves. I was not sorry to miss the
elephant flesh, for I had not forgotten the tough morsels we
had placed between our teeth when presented to us by the
friendly blacks soon after we landed.

CHAPTER VIII.
OUR ADVENTURES ON THE RIVER.
T U R first canoe had been ready to launch for some days,
and we were eager to try it. We had, however, to
cut a road through the brushwood down to the
rivers bank before we could do so. This task ac-
complished, placing it on rollers, the boys assisting,
we easily dragged it down to the water.
" There, Master Leo, I told you she would not be lopsided,"
exclaimed Jack. "Not she; see ! she sits on the water like a
duck; and them paddles will send her pretty briskly through
it, depend on that."
We all jumped in, and eagerly paddled about, well pleased
with the success of our undertaking. Though capacious, how-
ever, it was evident that she would not carry the whole of our
party and luggage, and I was glad therefore that our second
canoe was nearly completed.
"We will have races !" cried Leo ; "Natty shall steer one,
and I the other. Won't it be fun!"
The boys, taking the paddles, showed by the way they
handled them that they would soon be able to manage her.
They wished, indeed, to start at once down the river, but as it
was already getting late, we were compelled to return to the
shore. We found a secure place where we could conceal the

canoe under some bushes, and having done so, returned home-
wards. Senhor Silva was somewhat better, and the strange
negro had sufficiently recovered to speak. He told Chickango
that he belonged, as we supposed, to the village we had visited,
that his name was Igubo, and that he had the reputation of
being one of the best hunters of the tribe. "And so I am,"
he added; " but had it not been for my white friend there, I
should have been slain at last by my huge enemy, of whose
brothers I have killed so many." Though he could have had
but a glance at Stanley he recognized him at once, and begged
Chickango to thank him for saving his life.
The next day the boys were very eager to go out in the
canoe. "No, no, young gentlemen, time enough by-and-by,"
said Jack. "You come and help Timbo and I to finish off the
other, and we will get on with it while the Captain and Mr.
Crawford take a cruise."
"But, I say, we have not settled what they are to be called,"
exclaimed Leo, as we walked along.
"I have been thinking about that," said Natty. "What
do you say to calling one the Panther, and the other the Leo-
pard? They are proper names for this part of the world."
" And so would be the Crocodile and Hippopotamus," said
Leo; "and as they are water animals, those names would be
more suitable."
"But they are not pretty names," argued Natty. "Would
not the Giraffe and Gazelle be better?"
"We ought to have got Kate and Bella down to name
them," exclaimed Leo.
"Come, what do you say, Mr. Crawford ?" said Natty.
"Do not you consider the Giraffe and Gazelle are two pretty
names ?"
" They are prettier than the others," I replied, " though
they are not quite so appropriate perhaps ; but as all sorts of

names are given to vessels, I do not know why our canoes
should not have the prettiest names we can find."
At last Leo came round to Natty's opinion, and it was agreed
that our two canoes should be called after the names he pro-
posed, the first launched being called the Giraffe. The boys,
I saw, were very anxious to accompany us, but still they
went away with a good grace with Jack and Timbo. We
hoped to obtain a good supply of wild fowl, and perhaps to
shoot some larger game from the banks. Though I had my
gun with me, I assisted Chickango in paddling the canoe,
while Stanley sat with his gun ready to shoot whatever might
appear. We had knocked over a good many wild fowl, which
made us wish that we had a dog with us to bring them out,
as we had a good deal of trouble in rowing after them. At
length Stanley shot a beautiful flamingo, which went away
paddling down the stream at a great rate. We pursued. We
were not far from the banks, when suddenly I felt so tre-
mendous a shock, that I thought we must have run on a rock,
and immediately afterwards a huge head appeared above the
water and dashed towards us. The hippopotamus, for such it
was, and a very large one, seized the boat by the gunwale, and
threatened to overturn her. At the same moment several
other monsters rose with their snouts above the water. I felt
that we should have a poor chance of escaping if the canoe was
upset, for I thought that the monsters would immediately make
at us and tear us to pieces, or swallow us whole, for their
mouths seemed large enough to take any one of us down at a
gulp. I seized my gun, as did my cousin, who sprang to his
feet, and levelled his piece at the monster's head. "Fire !
massa, firel or he upset boat and kill all we," cried Chickango,
leaping up to the bow of the boat, and holding up his hands
with a look of horror. I heard the wood crunching under the
creature's teeth. Stanley, who never lost his presence of

193
mind, balancing himself in the bow of the boat, took aim, and
at the moment I expected to find the boat dragged under, and
probably we ourselves attacked by the other monsters, he fired.
The bullet struck the creature in its most vital part, near the
ear, and penetrated the brain. It opened its huge jaws and
sank back into the water, beneath which it disappeared, while
its companions, alarmed by the report, swam off, leaving us
unmolested. •
There we were, floating calmly on the stream, and I could
scarcely believe that an instant before we were engaged in a
fearful encounter. The canoe, however, gave evidence of the
power of the creature's teeth, for part of the gunwale, though
it was of considerable thickness, was literally crunched up.
Several holes were made in the bottom, through which the
water was running. We soon had out our knives and set to
work to plug the latter, which we quickly did, before much
water had rushed in, and that was soon bailed out with our
hats. Our canoe had received too much damage to allow us
to continue our voyage, and we therefore paddled back, hoping
that we might never again be engaged in a similar adventure.
"You see, young gentlemen, it's just as well you did not
go in the canoe," observed Jack, when he saw what had
happened. "Why, that creature would have bitten you in
two if he had caught you in his jaws just as easily as you
would crack a nut. It will take us a pretty time to repair
this damage. However, it is as well matters are no worse.
Take my advice, in future we will go cruising in company, and
if a beast like that munches up one canoe, we shall at all
events have the other to get home in."
As most of the next day was spent in repairing the canoe,
we did not go off in her. The young ladies I found had be-
come very anxious for a change. Bella complained much of
not being allowed to run about outside the Castle by herself.

LEO'S PROPOSED EXPEDITION.
" Could not you find me some pretty animal to ride upon ?"
she said. "I have seen many passing along in the distance,
and if you could catch a couple you could soon tame them, and
then Kate and I could ride about with you wherever you go."
"What were the animals like?" asked Stanley.
"Something like horses, or perhaps large donkeys, but they
galloped along so fast that I could not very well distinguish
them," she answered.
"They must have been zebras or quaggas," said David;
" though, if Bella has seen them, I do not know how we could
have missed them."
"Because we have been up on the height and can look over
the country, while you have been either busy inside or down
in the valley," answered Bella. "Is not that a good reason?"
"I am afraid, however, that even if we were to catch a
quagga for you, we should have a hard task to tame it," said
David; " but we will try what we can do; perhaps, however,
we shall find some other animal which will answer the pur-
pose. What do you think of an ox? They are used more to
the south, and make very good steeds, though a little difficult
to guide perhaps."
"I will tell you what !" exclaimed Leo. "If the rest will
not go to the south, what do you say to starting off with
Natty and I, and we will have an independent expedition,
and take Chico with us. Natty and I will paddle and you shall
steer, and Chico can sit in the bows and keep a look-out ahead.
What do you say to that, old fellow ?"
The ape had at that moment entered the room, and walked
up to Leo, whom he looked upon as his especial playmate,
though he seemed to consider Jack his chief protector.
I was glad to find that Senhor Silva was improving. Our
negro guest was also much better, and seemed anxious to
return to his people. His wives and children would be look-

ing for him, and he thought he could very well make his way
through the forest to his home. David, however, persuaded
him to stay a few days longer, till his arm and ribs were pro-
perly set.
Two weeks passed away without any unusual occurrence.
The other canoe was now finished and ready for launching,
but the heat of the weather prevented us from willingly
making any exertion, and had it not been for the necessity of
procuring food, on many days we should not have left the
house. We discovered at a little distance the remains of a
deserted village, and outside it grew a number of plantains, as
well as pumpkins, and other fruit, which, although not so good
as those carefully cultivated, were very valuable. We also
found many wild fruits growing in the forest; pine-apples,
especially, were very fine, and there were nuts of various sorts.
Chickango discovered a quantity of ground or pea-nuts, which,
though bitter, and somewhat unpalatable, were very nutritious,
and he and Timbo ate them readily.
At length our guest was well enough to take his departure.
His two countrymen accompanied him for some distance, and
Senhor Silva had generously given him several articles which
he valued highly—a few yards of cotton, a knife, and some
tobacco were among them. He begged Timbo and Chickango
to express his gratitude, and I really believe, from the expres-
sion of his countenance, that he felt it.
Two days after this, early in the morning, we were surprised
to see him approaching the Castle. I went out to meet him.
He took my hands, and looked into my face with an imploring
glance, which showed that he was much distressed, and then
accompanied me into the Castle. The moment he saw David
he ran up to him, and then pointed in the direction of his own
home. Then he ran to Leo and Natty, and stroked their
heads, as if he was weeping over them. Timbo, who had

been in the cook-house, now came out, and having exchanged a
few words, Timbo said, "Igubo got home, found children
bery ill ; want doctor come cure them."
This was plain enough. "Tell him I will go gladly," said
David; " but either you or Chickango must accompany me to
interpret." .
"I will bear you company also," I said. "I feel sure we
can trust to him, but his people may not be so well disposed,
and if we all three go armed we may make them respect us."
Directly breakfast was over we set out, greatly to Igubo's
satisfaction. He hurried along, leading us through elephant
tracks, till we reached a path formed by the natives which led
to the village. Igubo conducted us immediately to his house,
round which a number of people were collected, and inside was
a man with his face painted and his hair dressed out with
Etrange ornaments, performing all sorts of antics.
"Dat de fetich man," said Timbo. "He do no good. He
t'ink he enchant de sick children. He one 'postor."
"Little doubt about that," I observed; "but we must take
care not to offend him. But you tell them that white man's
doctor has come, and that if he will go and carry on his incan-
tations outside we will go inside and try ours, and there can
be no doubt that the two working together will produce more
effect than one alone."
"You no t'ink dat, Massa Andrew," said Timbo, looking up
in my face. "No, I only tell dem he go out, we go in.
White man know how to cure children better dan de black."
We found two fine boys about twelve and fourteen years
old, both in a raging fever. David, I should have said, had
come provided with a few medicines, which he thought most
likely to be of use, and he now sent all the people out of the
house except the mother of the boys and our friend. "Tell
him," he said to Timbo, " that he must get me some pure

water." This was easily procured from a stream which came
rushing down the side of the mountain at no great distance.
David gave each of the boys a cooling draught, and made their
parents understand that they were to take no food except such
as he ordered. He watched by the children till they at length
fell into a profound sleep, charging Igubo not to allow any-
body to enter the house. David then proposed that we
should take a turn through the village, of which we had not
seen much on our previous visit. I need not again describe
the village. We had not got far when we met several slaves
bringing us a number of fowls, some bunches of plantains, and
baskets of cassava. These they placed at our feet with a
message from the chief to say that we were welcome, for he
had heard of our brave deeds. We of course received them,
and they were carried to a sort of verandah in front of Igubo's
house, while through Timbo we returned our thanks to the
chief. He himself soon afterwards made his appearance, fol-
lowed by several attendants. Unless by his anklets and necklace,
and the rich tattooing on his breast, he was not to be distin-
guished from the rest of the people. His only clothing was a
piece of fine matting, woru round the waist in the form of a kilt.
David was unwilling to leave the boys, and we therefore con-
sented to remain till the following day. They were then
somewhat better, but when we proposed going their father
entreated that we would remain. David explained that he was
wanted at home, that one of our party was sick, and that if
Igubo would follow his directions the boys would probably
recover.
" Dat's de bery t'ing dey will not do," said Timbo. "He say,
if you go, de boys go too. We make carriage and take dem."
" The best thing, probably, that can be done," said David;
and we accordingly agreed to let the boys be brought with us.
The litters were soon constructed, and were by David's

advice covered over thickly with branches of trees, so as com-
pletely to shade them from the heat of the sun. Eight stout
fellows undertook to carry them, and all things being ready,
we bade farewell to the chief, who, however, seemed rather
angry at our departure.
"He no good man," said Timbo, as we came away. "Better
go dan stay. I find out he take elephant's tusks and de meat
de oder day, but he no tell us, lest we ask to have dem again."
• We considered it wise not to say anything about the ele-
phant's tusks, and, glad to get out of the village, we proceeded
homewards.
"Whom have you brought?" exclaimed Leo, when he saw
us arrive.
When we told him, he and Natty expressed themselves well
pleased at having some companions. "We will look after
them," said Leo.
"And I will teach them to read," exclaimed Natty. "I
hope they will not want to be going away, though. We must
nurse them in the meantime, and try and get them well."
"Poor little fellows," said the ever kind Kate, when she
saw them. "We will do all' we can for them, though they
look very ill."
The eyes and cheeks of the young negroes were sadly sunk,
for fever makes the same ravages in their frames as it does in
those of white people. The father, though he saw his boys in
safe keeping, still seemed unwilling to leave them. He had
done what was quite contrary to the customs of his people,
and he told Timbo he was afraid, if he was long absent,
that the rest of his family might be ill-treated. He accord-
ingly, after looking affectionately at them, and expressing his
thanks to us all, but to David especially, took his departure.
I should have said that we brought away the presents made to
us, which proved a welcome addition to our bill of fare.

CHAPTER IX.
A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.
" THEN are we to see the Giraffe and Gazelle launched,
VAVKand to have our promised excursion on the river?"
et LK asked Kate, the evening after Igubo had left us.
"Oh do, Stanley !" cried Bella. "It is cruel
to keep us so long shut up like captive princesses
in your Castle, and as the natives are friendly and
you can avoid the hippopotami, there can be no danger."
" The Gazelle is not yet launched," answered Stanley ;
* but as soon as she is in the water you can come and see
her."
"Oh, but we should like to see her at once, and help you to
launch her," said Kate. "If you will start to-morrow morn-
ing as soon as it is daylight and the air is still cool, we will
accompany you."
The young ladies gained their object, and we were all on
foot even before the sun had risen, ready to set out. They
would not wait for breakfast, but insisted on carrying pro-
visions and a kettle to boil our tea. David wished to remain
to look after his patients, and Senhor Silva was not yet suffi-
ciently strong to bear us company. A
"Remember we are to paddle your canoe, girls," cried Leo;
"and Andrew will steer for us; and if Timbo will come with a

EXPEDITION ON THE RIVER.
musket or spear, to do battle with any hippopotami or other
river monsters, we will allow him to go also."
As we had the rollers with which we had launched the other
canoe, and the road had already been cut, the labour of drag-
ging the Gazelle to the water was much less than it had been
in the former case. We all cheered as she was launched into
the water.
"May you bound over the waters of the river as your name-
sake does over the prairie," exclaimed Bella ; "and carry us
safely to the south, there to end your existence in a respected
old age!"
"Bravo, Bella !" cried Leo, clapping his hands. "You
have uttered my speech to perfection, and now you shall have
the pleasure of the first paddle our new craft has made. Come,
Andrew, come, Timbo, we will lose no time; we can get back
for breakfast."
The Gazelle floated even more gracefully than her sister
canoe. The boys jumped in with their paddles, and Timbo
and I holding her to the bank while the ladies stepped in, we
followed them, the black taking his place in the bow with an-
other paddle, and I sitting in the stern and steering with a
fourth. Chickango and Jack were in the other canoe, and
were soon after us.
"Come, let us have a race; we will beat you !" cried Leo,
flourishing his paddle; and Natty seconded him, though he saw
very well that Timbo and I were really doing most of the work.
We pulled rapidly down the stream, startling numerous
birds, some with beautiful plumage, greatly to the delight of
Bella. We had not gone far, when a huge head appeared near
the bank.
"Oh, what a monster !" exclaimed Bella, shrieking with
alarm. "That must be one of those dreadful river-horses
which so nearly ate you all up the other day."


## p. 201 (#205) ############################################

BELLA'S COURAGE.
201
"Oh no ; he only nearly bit the boat in two," said Natty;
"and we will not let him come near you now."
"We will keep out of his way, at all events," I observed,
turning the canoe round.
Stanley just then fired at a water fowl, and immediately
several dark heads rose above the water to see what was the
matter, and a huge monster, not hitherto perceived, came roll-
ing off the bank; but he, as well as his companions, quickly
disappeared beneath the surface. Remembering what had be-
fore occurred, I could not help dreading that one of them
might rise up and strike the bottom of our canoe.
"Don't you think we had better go on shore?" said Bella,
looking back on the spot where the river-horses had appeared.
"Kate, you will want to be there some time before Stanley, to
get the breakfast ready."
Little Bella's courage had evidently oozed away. However,
as I knew it was possible that one of the hippopotami might
strike us, we paddled up the stream as fast as we could go.
Soon afterwards I caught sight of another creature resting on
à sandbank, with a hideous long snout and a scaly tail and
short thick legs. It was a monstrous crocodile.
"Oh do, Andrew, make haste and get on shore !" exclaimed
Bella. "What a horrible creature! I did not expect to meet
with such monsters."
I tried to comfort her by assuring her that the crocodile
would not attack us, and would more likely swim away than
follow us. On landing, we hauled up the canoe, and then
commenced collecting sticks for a fire. Kate's kettle was soon
hissing merrily, suspended by a high tripod over the fire, and
by the time the provisions were spread, Stanley and his com-
panions had arrived. While we were so engaged, we saw,
approaching among the trees, a black man, with a shield on
one arm and a spear held in the other hand. His arms and

A PANGWE WARRIOR.
part of his body were tattooed in curious lines. Round his
neck he wore a necklace of alligator's teeth, while his hair was
so dressed as to form a long tail behind, and his beard was
twisted into two curious horns, which stuck out from his chin.
Round his loins was the skin of a wild beast, and at his side
a broad short sword in a sheath; a sort of cross-bow hung at
his back, with a quiver full of small arrows. Altogether,
with the shield and spear I have mentioned, he looked a
formidable warrior to those who were not possessed of fire-
arms. The shield, though capable of turning the darts and
spears of his equally savage foes, would have availed him little
against a modern rifle ball.
Bella eyed the warrior with a glance of terror.
"Do not be afraid," said Natty, placing himself before her.
"Leo and I will fight for you."
"Yes, even though there were an hundred such fellows,"
said Leo. "He looks very different from our friend Igubo. I
wonder what he has come for."
Chickango advancing, a conversation ensued which lasted
some minutes. The countenance of the warrior fell. We
saw him glancing now over one shoulder, now over the other.
Then suddenly he turned, and without uttering another word,
ran off as fast as his legs could carry him through the forest.
Chickango, who had his rifle in his hand, raised it. Stanley
shouted to him not to fire, and while he hesitated, the stranger
had darted behind the trees. The black returned, uttering
words which, though incomprehensible to us, showed that he
was very angry. At length, when somewhat calmed, Timbo,
who had been unable himself to understand what was said,
learned from him that the stranger was one of a band of
Pangwes who were advancing towards the territory of the
Bakelés. He had come, apparently unaware that there were
inhabitants so near. He had first begun to threaten us with

A RESOLVE TO PROCEED SOUTHWARD.
203
the vengeance of his people should we oppose their progress;
but on Chickango telling him that a large number of Bakelés
were in the neighbourhood, and that, should his people venture
to come that way, they would speedily be driven back and de-
stroyed, he had become alarmed, and so, in spite of his boasting,
afraid of being captured, had taken to flight. Still the account
which Chickango gave of these Pangwes made us very anxious.
The people of his tribe, he said, had for long been at war with
them, and had frequently been defeated. They had come from
a long way off in the interior, and year after year had been
advancing towards the coast. They were not only fierce and
cruel warriors, but cannibals, and capable of committing every
atrocity.
"What do you think about it all?" said Stanley to Timbo,
who had been interpreting Chickango's account.
" Dog dat bark not always bite, massa," answered the black.
"Me t'ink dat dey see our rifles and run away."
"I am of Timbo's opinion," I could not help observing.
" However, we must send and let our friends at the village
know of the approach of their enemies; but unless we are
attacked, we must on every account avoid fighting. The
sooner we can embark and proceed on our voyage the better."
"I believe you are right, Andrew," observed Stanley; " b?t
still I do not like the thought of running away; besides, we
cannot leave those two black boys to the mercy of the savages,
though if we carry them with us, their father will not know
what has become of them."
"I tell you what I do, massa," answered Timbo; "I go and
tell Igubo that he come and fetch dem, and den we send out
scout to know what de Pangwes are doing."
Our farther boating for the day was, of course, put an end to;
and having concealed the canoes in the thick brushwood which
grew down to the river's bank, we proceeded homewards, with

PACKING UP.
the exception of Timbo, who hastened off to the Bakelés' vil-
lage.
Senhor Silva looked very grave when he heard what had
occurred. "Those Pangwes are fierce fellows," he said, " from
what I know of them; and though they may not venture to
come within range of our firearms, yet they may surround us
and starve us out. We shall act wisely if we at once prepare
for our voyage, and commence it as soon as Timbo returns."
"But about these two boys, what shall we do with them?"
asked David.
"I am afraid their fate must be a sad one," was the answer,
" whether their father comes for them or not. If he takes
them away, they will probably fall into the hands of their
enemies; or if they are left here, they are too likely to perish
from hunger."
"Oh, then let us take them with us," said Kate, and little
Bella echoed her words. "Surely the canoes are large enough
to carry them, and it would be terrible to leave them to die."
"They shall have part of my share of food," said Bella.
"And mine and mine," added Leo and Natty.
"I would rather leave Chico behind," said Leo," though I
am afraid those dreadful savages would eat him."
"Oh, we must carry him too," said Natty; "for I am sure
when we stop at night he will be able to forage for himself; he
will find out roots and fruit when very often we are not able
to discover them."
We did not spend much more time in talking. It was ar-
ranged that we should start immediately on the return of Timbo.
We therefore at once set to work to pack up our goods and to
collect all the provisions we had in store to carry with us. As
we could not tell into what regions the river might carry us,
it was important to kill some game and to collect as many
plantains as we could carry off from the deserted village.


## p. 205 (#209) ############################################

COLLECTING SUPPLIES.
205
Chickango and the two boys undertook to set off for the latter
object, while Stanley and I went out with our guns into the
woods. We were unusually successful, and in an hour had
bagged as many pigeons and other birds as we could carry.
We found, as we neared the Castle, Natty and Leo staggering
on under a load of plantains.
"We shall have no fear of starving now, at all events ! "
cried Leo, "for Chickango has got as many more. As we
came along, however, he started off to the top of the hill, where
we understood him to say he could get a sight of the Bakelés'
village, and I suppose that he will be soon with us."
We were disappointed on our arrival at finding that Timbo
had not returned.
"I am afraid that some accident has happened to the poor
fellow," said Stanley ; "or he may have been incautious, and
fallen into the hands of the savages."
David and Jack had been so well employed, that, with the
assistance of the young ladies, everything was prepared for a
start.
"I wish that we could be off," said David ; "but we must
not leave our faithful Timbo behind."
"Well, if you will all go down to the boats, I will remain
here and bring him up as soon as he comes," said Natty.
"We shall thus gain time."
"No, no; I cannot let you do that," I said. "I will re-
main, and you must go."
Natty, however, positively refused, and Stanley had to
exert his authority, as our leader, to make him accompany
them. Very unwillingly, he at length consented to do so, pro-
vided I promised, should Timbo not appear in the course of
an hour, to follow them. The matter was arranged, and our
party were taking up the loads they proposed to carry, when
Chickango made his appearance among us. His countenance

expressed alarm, and he was too much agitated to explain him-
self. At length Senhor Silva understood him to say that, on
looking towards the Bakelés' village, he had seen smoke ascend-
ing—that it grew thicker and thicker, and then flames burst
forth, and he was convinced the whole village was on fire.
"Depend upon it, the Pangwes have done this," he observed;
"and, flushed with their victory, they will very soon march to
attack us. We must either prepare ourselves to stand a siege,
or lose no time in escaping."
"Then let us at once commence our march," said the
captain; "but, Andrew, I do not like that you should run the
risk of falling into the hands of these savages, which you will
do if you remain behind."
"I know my way down to the river so well," I answered,
"that I can easily join you should I see them approaching,
and I will, meantime, keep a look-out from the height above
the fort. Depend upon it, they have too much respect for our
firearms to venture an attack, unless with their whole body.
At all events, some time must elapse before they can be here.
My only anxiety is about Timbo, should he have fallen into
their hands."
"You will promise, Andrew, not to remain more than an
hour?" said Kate, as she and Bella, each carrying a load pro-
2?titi2utintingetin2nemere?am2/2/2/2/2/222/2/2/2/2/2/ò/â/2 /22
'be very anxious till you join us."
I watched the party as they descended the hill. I did not
think the young ladies had much cause to regret leaving the
place; but still they turned a glance behind them, as if they
were quitting it with sorrow. Though difficulties and dangers
might be before them, still I hoped that they were on their
way to a more civilized and healthy climate. In the hurry of
departure Chico had been forgotten, for he was quietly snooz-
ing in his usual corner of Jack's hut. Leo and Natty had

207
already left the fort, when they discovered that he was not
with them. "Chico, Chico!" they both cried out, and hear-
ing his name called, he ran out, and sprang up upon Jack's
shoulder, who had already got as much as he could well carry.
Nothing, however, would shake Master Chico off. I could
not help thinking even at that moment of Sinbad the Sailor,
and the Old Man of the Sea. "Well, I suppose if you
will not walk, I must carry you," .exclaimed Jack; and away
he went after the rest, Chico glancing about him with a look
of surprise at the sudden exodus of his friends.
As soon as they were gone, I closed the gates and climbed
out of a window in the back of the fort. This I did, that
should the Pangwes arrive, they might not discover the flight
of our party, and might spend some time in making prepara-
tions for the attack. I then ascended the hill, with my tele-
scope, which I had retained, but could see no one moving in any
of the open places I could command. In the distance, how-
ever, I observed dense clouds of smoke and bright flames
ascending above the forest, which I was sure must proceed
from the village we had visited. What was the fate of the
unfortunate inhabitants ? I knew too well the way that negro
warriors are accustomed to treat those they conquer, and I
could not help picturing to myself the horrid spectacle of
women and children murdered, and those who had escaped
slaughter carried off to be sold as slaves to the cruel dealers
in human flesh, and, more than that, in the hearts and souls
of their fellow-creatures. I looked at my watch. I calculated
how long it would take my friends to reach the canoes. I
was thankful when I felt sure they must have had time to get
on board, and thus to be in comparative safety. Time went
slowly on. I kept looking at my watch, but still Timbo did
not appear. The hour had nearly passed.
At length, with great regret, I descended the rock, and

SAVAGES AT HAND.
took my way towards the river. I had just passed the
Castle, when I caught sight of two figures moving towards
me among the trees below. They might be scouts of
the enemy. I hesitated what to do. Concealing myself be-
hind some brushwood, I lifted my glass to examine them.
Great was my satisfaction when I saw that one of them was
Timbo; the other was a negro whom he was assisting along,
and who appeared to be wounded. I hurried down to meet
them. Timbo, when he saw me, made a sign to me not to
shout, pointing behind him to make me understand that he
was pursued. As I approached, I saw the negro was Igubo.
He recognized me, and it seemed to revive his strength.
Without stopping to inquire what had occurred, I took his
arm, and assisted Timbo in hurrying him on towards the
river's bank. When he found this, he made a significant
gesture towards the Castle. "He ask for his sons," whispered
Timbo. "Tell him they are both safe, I hope, in the canoes."
A gleam of satisfaction passed over the countenance of the
wounded man, and he made fresh efforts to struggle on.
We had great reason to hurry, for ever and anon I could
hear the shouts of the savages in the woods behind us, though
still they appeared to be at some distance. Blood was flowing
from Igubo's side. I fortunately had a handkerchief, and in
spite of the necessity for haste, I insisted on stopping to bind
up the wound. I was afraid that otherwise he would bleed
to death. We gained by it, indeed, for he was afterwards
able to move more rapidly, and the flow of blood appeared
almost staunched. As we approached the river I caught sight
of two figures among the bushes and tall reeds which lined
the bank. Could our enemies have got ahead of us?
Presently we saw one of the figures dart out from their con-
cealment, and then, to my satisfaction, I recognized Leo. He
and Natty soon came running towards us. They had been on

FLIGHT DOWN THE RIVER.
209
the watch, it appeared, having grown anxious at my non-
appearance. The rest of the party were seated in the canoes.
We assisted the wounded man into the one in which David
was, with the two young ladies and Jack. A place had been
left for me there also. Igubo, not seeing his boys in it, uttered
an expression of disappointment. We lifted him up, however,
and showed that they were in the other canoe. When satis-
fied, he submitted to have his wounds more completely and
scientifically bound up than I had been able to do. Meantime
Jack had taken the steering-oar, while Timbo and I seized the
paddles. A few hurried words from Timbo explained to Stanley
what had happened, and without further delay we shoved off
from the bank, and began to make the best of our way down the
stream. Natty had come into my canoe, while Stanley called
Leo into his. Mine was the Gazelle. It was the best of the
two, the other having been injured by the hippopotamus.
Stanley had placed his sisters in it, trusting rather to Jack's
seamanship than to his own. His canoe being the lightest, he
took the lead, that he might give timely notice to us should
any sandbanks be encountered in our course, and, what were
perhaps more to be dreaded, any wild rapids, down which
it might be dangerous to proceed. Chico had seated himself
in the bow of the canoe, as if he had been placed there tú
keep a look-out. Natty bad taken a paddle, and Kate begged
that she might use another till her brother had finished attend-
ing to poor Igubo's wounds.
Not till we had got a little way down could I ask Timbo
what had occurred. "Oh, Massa Andrew," he answered, "me
no like talk about it. De Pangwes come, and stay hid in
de night close to de village, and just before de sun get up,

t'ree who came after him; and dough dey stuck de spear in
his side, he get away. As I got near de village I hear de
cries, and know too well what dey mean; so I hide, for I fear
if I run dey see me and follow; but when I found Igubo drop
down just near where I was, I rushed out and lift him up
and bring him along; and de Pangwes just den no see us,
because some young men who had got swords and bows and
arrows 'tack dem, and fight bravely; but dey all killed, and
den de Pangwes set fire to de village, and you know de rest."
Timbo had scarcely finished his account when he shouted
out, " See, see! Dere dey are! Dey come dis way!"
We had all been so busy in paddling the canoe and watch-
ing our leader that we had not looked either to the right
band or the left. Stanley, for the same reason, had not seen
what was taking place on shore. We now saw a large body
of black warriors shaking their spears, and beating them
against their shields, as they rushed on towards the bank of
the river. They had evidently the intention of stopping us.
"On, on!" cried Stanley. "Put your best strength into
your strokes ; the river is broader a little way down, and we
may escape their arrows and spears if they attack us."
"Don't you think, sir, we had better get a broadside ready
and give it them?" exclaimed Jack. "They are more
likely to treat us with respect if we show that we are well
armed."
"I would advise you not to fire unless hard pressed," said
Senhor Silva. "We will show our muskets, but they are
fierce warriors, and even should a few be killed, the rest would
not be daunted, and would probably pursue us till a more

THE PANGWES ON THE BANK.
211
narrow part of the river is reached, when they might over-
whelm us with their spears and poisoned arrows."
"Let me now take the paddle, Kate," said David, who had
placed Igubo at the bottom of the canoe, resting his head on
a bundle. "My arm is stronger than yours, my sister, and
in case the savages attack us, you and Bella must lie down at
the bottom of the canoe."
The canoes glided rapidly down the stream, making the
water hiss and bubble under their bows. Had we not had the
two helpless girls to protect, the adventure would have been an
exciting one, which few of us would have objected to go through.
The Pangwes, shouting and shrieking, and shaking their spears
and shields, had now reached the banks of the river. It
seemed scarcely possible that we could escape them. Not,
however, till David had again and again pressed them, would
his sisters consent to place themselves in greater safety at the
bottom of the canoe. The crew of Stanley's canoe plied their
paddles vigorously, and kept just ahead of us. We needed no
exhortation from him to follow their example.
We had now got almost abreast of where the savages were
standing. Every instant I expected to see them draw their
bows, with those deadly poisoned shafts; or hurl their spears,
which I knew too well could reach to a great distance. I saw
Timbo eyeing them very calmly.
"If we were to fire a broadside into them now, it would
soon put them to fight," cried Jack.
We, however, kept on without apparently noticing them.
As we approached, they increased their shouts. Some of their
chiefs seemed to be going among them, urging them to rush
into the stream. Happily the river was here much wider than
above us, and continued so for some distance down. A sand-
bank appeared in the middle. We trusted that a channel
might be found on the right side of it, away from where the

UNLOOKED FOR ASSISTANCE.
savages stood. We now saw several men with swords in their
hands, urged by their chiefs, rush into the stream.
"See, see !" cried Timbo; " what are those creatures on
the sandbank ?"
I looked ahead, and there observed eight or ten large alli-
gators and several small ones basking on the sandbank. Our
approach somewhat startled them; and off they slid into the
water, swimming towards the bank where the Pangwes were
collected. They apparently caught sight of them at the same
time. One of the leading swimmers at that instant threw up
his arms, and, uttering a shriek, was drawn down under the
water. The others, seeing the fate of their companion, turned
round, and, in spite of the shouts and exhortations of their
chiefs, swam back to the shore. The alligators pursued them,
and two others were carried down before they could reach the
banks. So eager were the monsters that we saw their snouts
rising above the water even at the very bank, when hundreds
of spears were darted at them. Aimed in a hurry, the missiles
probably glided off their scaly sides. We could not discover
whether any were killed.
Now the Pangwes, finding that their attempt to cut us off
had failed, began hurling their spears at us, and sending showers
of light arrows, many of which fell feorfully close to the canoe.
Some stuck in the sandbank, inside of which we were making
our way. It showed us the danger of having to pass our
enemies where the river became narrower. The only advan-
tage we should there possess would be the greater rapidity of
the current. We continued to ply our paddles with might
and main. Now we had passed the sandbank, and a wide
extent of water lay between us and the negro army. They,
however, appeared to have discovered that should we get far
ahead we might escape them altogether; and we saw a large
body moving away to the southward. We could not help

STILL ANOTHER DANGER.
213
fearing that there might be some bend in the river, or narrow
passage, where they might still hope to cut us off. Our utmost
efforts must be exerted, therefore, to gain the place before they
could reach it. There was still another danger. We might
ground on one of the sandbanks, or some point might project
from the western side and compel us to go round nearer to the
eastern bank. I, of course, kept these thoughts to myself, and
did my utmost to send the canoe along, and to keep up the
spirits of my companions.
"If we get within reach of them," sung out Stanley from
his canoe, as he saw them moving along the bank of the river,
" we must instantly take to our arms and give them a volley.
It will not do to let any of their arrows come near us."
"Ay, ay," I answered. "Our muskets are, I believe, all
loaded."
"All right, sir," said Jack. "I loaded them before I placed
them in the canoe, and I do not think those black fellows
will stand a taste of our bullets."
Poor little Bella looked very much frightened when she
heard us talk of firing.
" They will not fire unless there is absolute necessity for it,"
I heard Kate say to her. "You know, Bella, it will only be
done if we have to defend ourselves."
The current was so strong and our canoes moved so swiftly
that we were quickly leaving the main body of Pangwes. We
heard their shouts of rage and disappointment as they saw us
escaping them. Horrid as were those shrieks and cries, they of
course only made us paddle the harder ; but still I felt anxious
lest the smaller body I have spoken of might outstrip us.
"Suppose the Pangwes try to cut us off at another place,
could we not haul our canoes up and make our escape over-
land ?" exclaimed Natty, showing that he had understood the
reason of the movement we had observed.


## p. 214 (#218) ############################################

214
NATTY'S SUGGESTION.
" We might escape them, certainly, for the moment," I
answered; "but we could not proceed on our journey without
our canoes."
"But we might return and get them, or drag them over-
land," he observed.
"That would be a task, I fear, too great for our strength,"
I said. "But your suggestion, Natty, is worthy of considera-
tion, if we are hard pressed."
I told Stanley what Natty had said.
"I hope we shall not be obliged to do that," he answered.
"Paddle away, lads; we shall soon, I hope, see the last of
them."
On we went, the river now making its way through a thick
forest, the trees coming down to the very water's edge; now
again it opened, and low prairie land was seen on the eastern
side. The level appearance of the country made me fear that
the river might make some bend such as I supposed our enemies
were attempting to reach. The banks were, however, too high
to enable us to see to a distance. At any moment they might
appear on the shore. At length the banks became somewhat
lower, and, standing up, I caught sight of a body of men
hurrying across the prairie. They were, however, at a con-
siderable distance behind us; and now it evidently depended
on whether we should reach the supposed narrow place before
them or not. I had often read of heroines ; but as I looked
at the calm countenance of Kate, showing that she was re-
solved to go through all danger without flinching, I could
not help thinking that she deserved especially to be ranked
as one.
I could see as I gazed over the plain, besides the negro army,
numerous animals scampering across it, put to flight by their
appearance-herds of quaggas, zebras, buffaloes, and various
sorts of deer, the lofty heads of a troop of giraffes appearing

STILL PADDLING DOWN THE RIVER.
215
above them all. Innumerable birds flew amid the boughs of
the trees, and wild fowl rose from the sedgy shores, or gazed
at us from the mud-banks as we shot by. Here and there a
huge hippopotamus raised his head, and gazed with his fero-
cious eyes, wondering what new creatures had invaded his
territory; while scaly alligators lay basking in the sun, or
swam about seeking some creature to devour.
" If we get clear of the savages we shall have no fear of
starving," observed Natty, as he saw the herds of wild animals
I have described.
"You are right, Natty," said Jack; "and as to getting
clear of them, there is no doubt about that."
"I have been praying that we may escape them," said
Natty; "and that makes me think we shall."
"Right again, Massa Natty," observed Timbo. "It great
t'ing to know dat we have got One to take care of us when we
can no take care of ourselves. He hear de little boy prayer
just as much as de big man."
Had Timbo joined us at an earlier hour, we might have
escaped the dangers to which we were exposed; but still I was
thankful that we had got him with us. As I looked ahead I
saw that the river was making a bend towards the east. It
was what I had dreaded ; but the danger—if danger there
was—must be run. Again I asked Stanley whether he thought
it would be wise to haul up the canoes, and try to escape over-
land, should the river be too narrow to enable us to keep out of
the range of the poisoned arrows of our enemies.
"That must be our last resource," he answered. "We must
first try the effect of our firearms. Their blood be upon their
own heads, if we kill any. I have no wish to injure any of
them, even though they may be seeking our lives, if we can by
any possibility avoid it."
I felt much as Stanley did. To desert the canoes would be

RAPIDS AHEAD.
to expose the young ladies to fearful fatigue and danger, and
was to be avoided by every means.
We now entered into the reach I had expected to find. It
was, however, as broad as the part we had lately passed through.
We took the centre of the stream rather than cut off the angle,
lest our enemies might be concealed on the bank. And now,
going along it for some distance, we rounded another point
projecting from the west, and found ourselves in a still broader
part. It was somewhat shallow, we judged by the numerous
little islands and banks which rose above its surface.
" Hark !" said Natty, suddenly ; " don't you hear the roar
of water ?"
I listened, and felt convinced that some waterfall or rapid
was near us. I shouted to Stanley. We ceased paddling for
an instant.
"It may be a cataract," he answered ; "but I bave hopes
that it is simply the sound of rapids. If so, we may pass
through them."
"A dangerous experiment !" observed David.
"It depends upon their character," answered his brother,
from the other canoe.
"But, without a pilot, would it be possible ?"
"We must land and survey them first," shouted Stanley.
"We shall have no difficulty in doing that; and if we cannot
pass them, we must try and drag the canoes over the land.
That, at all events, can be done."
We found as we proceeded that the roar of waters increased ;
and there could be no doubt, from the way the river ran, that
a rapid was before us. We went on till the water was already
beginning to bubble and hiss. The bank on our right af-
forded tolerably easy landing ; so, running the canoes to it, we
secured them to some trees which grew close down to the water,
Stanley sprang out, and called to Timbo to accompany him.


## p. 217 (#221) ############################################

SHOOTING THE RAPIDS.
217
"We shall be able to judge whether we can safely pass
through them," he said. "I will be back quickly. Yes, we
will take our rifles; we may find them necessary."
He said this as Senhor Silva handed them out of the
canoe. They were soon out of sight among the thick under-
wood which grew near the banks. It is very different, I should
say, from the underwood in England; composed rather of huge
leaves, reeds of enormous height, and other plants of the Tropics.
The opposite side was also covered with wood, so that we
were unable to ascertain whether the Pangwes were in the
neighbourhood or not. We were, however, so much concealed
by the foliage among which our canoes were moored, that an
enemy might have passed on the opposite bank without per-
ceiving us. We waited anxiously for the return of Stanley
and Timbo. At length they appeared.
"We can do it," Stanley exclaimed. "The water is rapid
but clear, and we may easily steer our way clear of the huge
boulders through which it passes."
Once more we shoved off. Each man screwed up his nerves
for the trial; for no slight trial it would prove-of that I was
certain.
"Stanley is so cool and calm," observed Kate, "I have no
fear."
His canoe led. In a few minutes we were in the strength
of the current. On we glided, like arrows from a bow.
We had little else to do than to guide our canoes. Still we
kept paddling, so that we might the more easily, if it were
possible, turn aside from any danger ahead. Now a huge
boulder rose up on one side; now we darted through a passage
which only afforded room for the canoes to pass. Now the
water ran smoothly without a bubble ; now it hissed and
foamed as it passed over a shallower bed. There was an excite-
ment in the scene which made our spirits rise. I felt almost

THE SAVAGES ON RAFTS.
inclined to shout at times as we dashed on. Yet an instant's
carelessness might have proved our destruction. We appeared
to be decending a steep hill of water at times; now wavelets
rose on either side, and threatened to leap into the boat.
Our eyes were fixed on our leader's canoe, and his on the
water ahead, through which he was to guide us. For one
moment I cast my eyes on the eastern shore, and was sorry
that I had done so, for there I saw a number of dark forms
collected just below the rapids. What they were about I had
not time to observe. I said nothing ; it would be time
enough when we had shot the rapids. On, on we went. We
were in a sea of foam, the water roaring, bubbling, and hissing.
I feared that Stanley's skill could scarcely carry the canoe
through ; but he had noted the point, and his experience told
him that there was sufficient depth. Now a wave washed
aboard on one side, now on the other, now came hissing over
our bows; but we dashed through them, and I saw before us
a calm and lake-like expanse. In another instant we were
free of the rapids, and floating calmly on the lower portion of
the river.
Once more I cast my eyes to the spot where I had seen the
blacks. They were our enemies; of that I had no doubt. I
pointed them out to Stanley.
"What can they be about ?" he asked.
Timbo looked at them. "Building rafts," he answered.
"Dey are showing off even now. Dey knew we must come
dis way, and hoped to cut us off. But hurrah! hurrah! we
got down sooner dan dey!"
Several rafts of reeds, such as I before described, were
shoved off from the bank. We did not stop to examine them;
but plying our paddles with might and main, we continued our
course towards the point where we believed the river made its
exit out of the lake.

CHAPTER X.
VOYAGE DOWN THE RIVER CONTINUED.
THE savages on the raft, which had already got some
way out into the lake, saluted us with showers of
arrows; but, happily, we were too far off for them
to reach us. Already our arms ached with our
y long paddle, but it was no time to rest. We knew
not whether, vindictive as they appeared, they would attempt
to pursue us, or whether others might not have gone further
down along the margin of the lake, with the hope of even yet
intercepting us at the narrow part which we saw. Evening
was approaching, and the difficulties of the navigation, should
the night prove dark, would be greater.
" I see some objects on the left bank," cried Natty.
"Never fear, we will slip by them," said Jack. "To my
eyes they have got four legs, and will not hurt us."
We speedily neared the point where the lake-like expanse nar-
rowed into the proportions of a river. The creatures seen by
Natty were now discovered to be a herd of zebras, which had
come down to the river's bank to drink. They gazed at us
as we passed with a look of astonishment; but, though they
kept moving here and there, as if asking each other what we
could be, they did not take to flight, but continued scampering
round and round as horses do in a field, stopping every now

STILL ON THE WATER.
and then to take another look at us. They quickly, however,
returned to the water, for they probably knew that unless they
made haste they would be interrupted by some of their re-
morseless, foes—lions, panthers, or hyenas—which might come
down to the same spot to quench their thirst before setting
forth on their nightly rambles in search of prey. They were
beautiful and graceful creatures, very unlike the poor patient
ass with which we are acquainted in England, and accustomed
to associate with everything that is stupid and obstinate. Yet
the zebra and the ass are nearly related ; indeed, the former
is classed by naturalists as an ass. I shall have more to
say about them by-and-by.
Evening was rapidly drawing to a close. Still, although
the alarm which the zebras had caused us when first indis-
tinctly seen had subsided, we thought it possible that some of
our savage foes might still be on the watch for us further down
the stream, or, should we land and rest, that they might over-
take us before we again got under weigh. "It's wisest, accord-
ing to my notions, to keep well ahead of an enemy if you have
to run from him, and as close as you can to his heels if you have
to chase him, till he hauls down his flag!" exclaimed Jack, vigor-
ously plying his paddle. "What do you say, Mr. Crawford ?"
I heartily agreed with him. The thought of what would
be the fate of my young relatives would have nerved my arm
for even greater exertions than we were called on to make.
We still, therefore, continued paddling, in spite of our fatigue,
with might and main, anxious to put as many leagues as pos-
sible between ourselves and our enemies before we stopped.
The sun set in a glorious glow of ruddy light on our right,
shedding a hue over the tops of some lofty hills which
appeared on the opposite bank. The stream increased in
rapidity ; but still, as far as we could see, was free from
danger. There was yet sufficient light from the sky, though

MOONLIGHT VOYAGE.
221
it could not be called twilight, to enable us to continue our
course.
"If the navigation is as open as at present, we will continue
on for another hour," shouted Stanley. "We shall then be
safe from the savages, and may have a quiet rest, I hope, after
our day's work."
"Ay, ay, sir," answered Jack from our canoe. "We have
not worn our arms off yet; though, if you don't mind stop-
ping, maybe the ladies would like a bit of pigeon and a bite
of plaintain."
"Oh, no, no," exclaimed Kate. "Do not stop for our
sakes, if you are not tired. We feel no hunger, and would
rather not delay a moment till you think it safe."
We accordingly paddled on. By degrees the glow faded
from the sky, and darkness settled down over the landscape.
Still Stanley continued leading. Presently I saw on our left
a silvery arch rising over the hills. It increased rapidly, and
soon the full moon rose in the sky, shedding its light over the
waters.
"We do not get sight of such a moon as that in old
England," cried out Leo from the other canoe. "It is often
there more like a patch of red putty stuck on to a wall; but
see! this looks like a mighty globe of pure fire floating in the
heavens," So indeed it did.
"Do not be disparaging our good old English moons,"
cried out Natty. "You forget the harvest moon; and, though
it is not quite like this, it is a very beautiful object to gaze at,
and useful to those who have to carry home the full-loaded
waggons of corn."
Our spirits were rising as we felt we were escaping from the
danger we had encountered. I hoped, too, our hearts were
grateful. The bright light of the moon now enabled us to
proceed with almost as much ease as during the day. As we

EXPLORING THE ISLAND.
sped on, however, we saw numerous animals on the banks
coming down to drink; but we passed them too rapidly to
ascertain what they were. I think we must have continueil
paddling on two hours longer, rather than one. Stanley
seemed unwilling, so long as we could move our arms, to stop;
indeed, the cool air of night renewed our strength; and, for
my part, I felt that I could have gone on till daylight, if
necessary, for the sake of securing the safety of the young girls
depending on us for protection.
At length the ground on our right rose considerably above
the plain. "I think I see an island ahead," cried Stanley. "If
so, it may suit us for a bivouac, and may be more secure than
the mainland." As we went on we found that he was right.
The island appeared to be about four or five hundred yards
in circumference, with numerous trees growing on it, which
would afford us the means of forming huts, and give us wood
for our fires besides. Fortunately, we had no need of pro-
visions, as we had an abundance in the canoes. We took the
passage on the west side, and, going to the further end of the
island, found a small bay, into which we steered the canoes.
"We must act the part of invaders and drive out any pre-
vious occupants," observed Stanley as he stepped on shore.
"Kate and Bella and the two boys, with the wounded black
and his sons, must remain in the canoes till we can find a safe
place for encamping. David will stay behind for your protec-
tion. Now, my friends, we will advance into the interior."
At the word we all stepped on shore. There was a small
extent of open ground extending a few yards from the water's
edge. This would, at all events, afford us space for our en-
campment. Had it been a dark night, we should have run a
considerable risk if any savage animals existed on the island; but
during moonlight neither lions nor panthers will assail a man,
unless hard pressed by hunger. We had our axes in our belts,

OUR ENCAMPMENT.
223
and were thus able to clear our way over the rocky ground among
the underwood and trees, mostly growing wide apart. As we
advanced, we shouted to each other, now one now another firing
his gun and stopping to reload. Suddenly a loud splash told
us that some animal had leaped into the water. Now another
was heard, and in a short time we reached the northern end of
the island, having completely passed over it. We were satis-
fied that whatever creatures had been there had taken their
departure, and we now returned to prepare for our encamp-
ment. In the meantime, we found that David and the boys
had been landing the provisions. We had all become pretty
expert in cutting down trees; and, as many of those in our
neighbourhood were small, we soon had a sufficient number to
make a small hut for Kate and Bella. This was erected with
a rapidity which would have astonished people at home. As
there was no fear of rain, we were not very particular as to the
roof; and the abundance of vines enabled us quickly to weave
a network round it, through which no panther, nor even a
lion, could force its way. Less substantial structures were
erected for the rest of the party. The boys were busy in
collecting dry wood for the fires; and in scarcely more than
half an hour we had formed a village which might have served
us for many weeks if necessary, provided the weather remained
dry. The two young blacks had, in the meantime, under the
superintendence of Kate, been preparing our supper. She
insisted that she was in no degree tired, and would not be
idle. Igubo sat up, with his back supported against a bale,
giving directions to his sons. A number of birds were forth-
with roasting before the fire, while an ample supply of plan-
tains were being baked on the ashes. Our cookery was of
necessity somewhat rough, but we were grateful to those who
prepared our food, and I could not help fancying it tasted
better done by their hands. A sufficient amount of wood had

OUR EVENING PRAYER.
been collected to keep up four good fires during the night.
One was placed on the river side, to scare any animals
which might approach from the water; one at either end of
the camp; and one on the forest side, though we hoped that
we had driven off all enemies from our island. As soon as
supper was over, Stanley recommended all hands to retire to rest.
"But, massa," said Timbo, "we escape great danger; sure
we t'ank Him who preserved us."
"Indeed we ought to do so," said Kate; "and we are
thankful to you, Timbo, for reminding us."
"I am sure my father would," I heard Natty say to Leo.
• Stanley took a pace or two up and down, and then turning
to Timbo, said, "You are right, old friend; but it would be
somewhat out of my way, I am sorry to say. David, I must
ask you to take the lead."
The young doctor, though full of talent, felt, I saw, a diffi-
dence under the circumstances; but, mustering courage, he
undertook to lead us in prayer; and with expressions which
came, I am sure, from his heart, he returned thanks to the
God of mercy for our preservation from the great dangers we
had passed, and implored protection for the future. I heard
Natty, who was kneeling near me, repeat his words with deep
earnestness; and I was sure also that Kate and little Bella
were pouring out their hearts in prayer. Though Timbo was
the only African who could join us, the others were, I believe,
greatly impressed with the scene, which, I had reason to know,
was never forgotten by them.
Chickango and I had been appointed to keep the first watch,
while Senhor Silva and Jack were to relieve us. In a short
time the rest of our party were fast asleep, with the exception
of David, who, as soon as his sisters had entered their hut, drove
some stakes round the entrance, so that even a snake could not
find its way in. . After pacing up and down for some time

A NIGHT SCENE.
227
with my gun in my hand, I told Chickango I would try and
make my way to the other side of the island, as a full moon
shining down among the trees enabled me to do without much
difficulty. Its beams shed a silvery light on the water, which
flowed calmly by. I soon reached a spot whence I could see
the opposite shore, across a channel which divided the island
from the mainland. As I stood there, I fancied I saw creatures
moving along the banks, then I discovered five or six elephants
approaching the water. They came to the edge, and, dipping
in their trunks, poured the cool liquid down their throats.
Presently a herd of giraffes came with a swinging trot across
the ground, their heads moving about from side to side as they
swung forward their long legs. They appeared, however,
rather cautious of approaching till their more powerful com-
panions had quenched their thirst. Just then, from a point
a little on one side, several smaller animals made their way
down to the bank; and, as they drew nearer; I discovered
them to be a male and female lion, with their whelps. They
stood watching the elephants, now and then uttering a low
angry sound, yet never breaking into a roar. I stood rivetted
to the spot, thankful that we had chosen the island for our
encampment; for had we been on the mainland, we must have
found our post untenable. They were, however, not the only
visitors to the water. A huge rhinoceros, which I recognized
by the horn on his nose, advanced with a heavy tread; and
several buffaloes, and other animals which I took to be wild
boars, joined the assemblage. The elephants, it appeared to
me, kept the other animals in awe, for all stood at a distance
from each other, slaking their thirst after the burning heat of
the day. Many, probably, had come from a distance to seek
for water. The giraffes were the only ones which continued in
motion, they evidently being unwilling to approach while their
savage enemies the lions were in the neighbourhood. For-

A NARROW ESCAPE.
tunately for them, I was not possessed with the instincts of a
hunter, or I should probably have shot one of the lions; the
female especially, as she kept looking at the elephant, with her
cubs by her side, offering me a mark which I could not well
have missed; but, in the first place, I should have disturbed
my friends, and then I thought to myself, "Why should I kill
one of these creatures, which are but following their natural
instincts ? and, as they are not likely to attack us, no good can
be attained."
At length I thought that Chickango would fancy some acci-
dent had happened, and might be induced to leave his post
to search for me. I therefore returned to the camp. I had
nearly reached it when I fancied I heard a sound behind me.
I turned round, an indefinite feeling of horror suddenly
seizing me. I called to Chickango : he sprang forward. At
that instant I saw a huge creature creeping along through
the underwood. Chickango was by my side. He raised his
gun, and gave a loud shout. The animal sprang up a tree.
He fired, and a large panther fell to the ground. The rest of
the party, starting from their beds, came hurrying up. The
creature was not quite dead, but a blow from the negro's axe
quickly finished it. My friends congratulated me on my
narrow escape; and indeed I was thankful that I had been
again preserved. The creature must have remained on the
island. Probably the moonlight prevented it springing on me
at once, as it might easily have done.
It was some time before quiet was restored to the camp.
David hurried back to assure his sisters that there was no
danger; for they had naturally been alarmed by the shot, and
the cries of the party as they sprang up from their sleep. The
adventure made us increase the number of our fires on that
side of the camp; while Stanley, declaring he had had sleep
enough, joined us on the watch. As may be supposed, I felt

OUR VOYAGE RESUMED.
229
no inclination to make another trip about the island by myself,
lest a companion of the animal we had killed might take a
fancy to spring upon me, I must confess I was very glail
when Timbo and Senhor Silva came to relieve me; but nothing
could induce Stanley again to lie down.
No sooner had I placed my head upon the bale of goods
which served me as a pillow, than I was fast asleep. I was
aroused by Natty's voice, -
"Ob see, Mr. Crawford !—it is worth looking at. The sun
has just risen."
I sprang to my feet, and found all the camp already up.
The sun at that instant was showing its upper.edge above the
mountains, looking like an arch of fire, tinting the distant
mountains with a soft tinge of the same"hue, and casting a
ruldy glow over the broad stream which flowed at our feet ;
while the whole sky was covered with a rich orange glow,
deepening towards the horizon into the brightest vermilion.
"We will lose no time in proceeding on our voyage," said
Stanley; " so the sooner we can get through our breakfast the
better."
As the fire was ready, the water was soon boiling, and we
contented ourselves with the cold meat and plantain which had
been cooked on the previous night. The canoes were imme-
diately reladen ; and quickly embarking, we once more com-
menced our voyage down the stream. As we opened the
wider part, we looked northward along the banks, but could
discover no signs of our enemies ; and we hoped, therefore,
that we had completely distanced them. The number of
animals which we saw on the banks showed us that we were
not likely to meet with many inhabitants. This was satisfac-
tory, as we could not tell how they might be disposed towards
us. Although the heat was great, our spirits felt lighter in
the belief that we should meet with no enemies : and we con-

OUR SEARCH FOR GAME AND FRUIT.
tinued paddling along, Chico standing as before in the bows of
the canoe; the boys, as usual, joking with each other; while
Jack every now and then burst into one of his sea-songs, an
entertainment with which he had not indulged us since we were
engaged in building the canoes. The Giraffe, as before, took
the lead. We paddled more leisurely than on the previous day,
as we should soon have worn ourselves out had we continued
the exertion we had then gone through. Thus, in spite of
the heat, we were able to continue on for some hours.
We landed at noon on the western bank, where a group of
trees afforded us shade, which we greatly needed ; indeed, the
heat of the sun had become so great that we could scarcely
have continued longer exposed to its rays. We as before beat
the bushes in the neighbourhood to ascertain that no animal
lurked among them, and then lighted a fire to cook our dinner.
As may be supposed, the birds that had been killed on the
previous morning were no longer fit for English palates ; but
our black friends, without ceremony, consumed them. We
had therefore to wait until we had killed some fresh game.
Stanley, Senhor Silva, Timbo, and I took up our guns to
proceed inland. The scenery on the banks was very beautiful,
the trees not growing in dense masses, but scattered in groups,
like those in a gentleman's park in England. Beautiful flowers
covered the open spaces. Among some of the groups of trees
we observed the orchilla weed hanging from the branches.
This is one of the exports of Africa, and is used as a dye stuff.
There was a beautiful little shrub which Chickango called the
mullalo. It bore a yellow fruit. He gathered several—which
he said were good to eat—and we found them full of seeds,
like a custard-apple, with a sweet taste. A larger tree was
covered with white blossoms, their fragrance reminding me of
the hawthorn at home; but the flowers of these were as large
as dog.roses and the fruit the size of big marbles. Chickango

A HERD OF GIRAFFES.

pointed to the flowers ; not so much to admire them, as
because numerous bees were sucking their sweets. " Dere !
dere !"—and he pointed out several hollows in the neighbour-
ing trees. "Me come back, and get for eat," he said. From
another shrub—which our companion called the mogametsa —
he picked a quantity of fruit, which had the appearance of a
bean with pulp round it.
"Why," cried Leo, as he tasted the mogametsa, "it is just
like sponge-cake-capital stuff! We must take a quantity to
the camp."
Another very nice fruit was the mawa, which grew abun-
dantly on low bushes. Indeed, we found a number of edible
bulbs and bushes. Among them I must not forget to mention
the mamosho and milo. The latter is a sort of medlar, which
all hands pronounced delicious. Indeed, there was no fear of
our starving in this region. There were great numbers of
birds also; but I will describe them by-and-by.
Troops of animals passed us, among which the giraffe was
conspicuous. We were just emerging from the wood, when
we saw a single giraffe following a large herd at a distance,
having from some cause been separated from his companions.
On he went, swinging his tall head from side to side to keep
time with the motion of his legs, which put me in mind of the
way spiders move. He was passing a clump of trees, when a
terrific roar reached our ears. The poor animal attempted to
increase his pace; but before he could do so, a huge lion sprang
from a thicket, and with one bound alighted on the giraffe's
back.
" It is too far off for a bullet to reach him," observed
Stanley, "or I would try to rescue the giraffe by killing the lion."
"It would be useless, for I suspect the giraffe's fate is
sealed," said Senhor Silva. "The grip with which the lion
seized his neck is sufficient to end his days. In spite of the

giraffe's strength, the king of the forest will soon have bim
down."
The giraffe continued his course, going away from us, so that

our chance of shooting the lion decreased. Still we pushed
on, hoping that the terrified animal might turn, and bring his
murderer closer to us. On he went, however, uttering cries of
terror, the rest of the herd scampering off at full speed, which
soon carried them away from their unfortunate companion.

TRIUMPH OF LEO AND NATTY.
233
The life-blood was flowing fast from the giraffe's neck; but he
struggled on in spite of the immense weight of the creature on
his back and the agony he must have been suffering. In vain
he reared up—in vain he struggled. Presently we saw him sink
to the ground, when the savage beast flew at his neck, and
soon finished his sufferings.
" Take care," said Senhor Silva ; "we must not approach
too near, for if we attempt to dispute his prey with the lion, it
will make him more savage than ever."
"Our guns will settle that question," answered Stanley, still
hurrying on.
I kept by his side, and the boys followed. Not till we were
within fifty paces did the lion perceive us. He was then stand-
ing over his prey, which he had already begun to rend. Raising
his head, with his claws on the carcase, he eyed us fiercely,
sending forth terrific growls of anger. Still he did not move ;
and Stanley had now an opportunity of taking steady aim.
Still we advanced nearer. The lion perceiving this, with a
roar which even now rings in my ears, gave a bound towards
us. I raised my rifle and fired ; but my arm must have
trembled, and I confess I felt little able to take steady aim :
the ball only grazed the lion's head. He was now within a
dozen paces of us. Leo and David were standing a little on
one side. Stanley raised his gun. He fired; but, to my
horror, no explosion followed.
" Now! now !" he cried out.
The boys saw what had happened, and both, levelling their
pieces, fired. The lion gave a bound in the air, and fell back-
ward.
"Hurrah ! hurrah !" shouted Leo and Natty ; " we have
killed the lion !"
"No; it was my shot did it," cried Leo.
"It was mine," exclaimed Natty ; " I am sure."

GIRAFFE MEAT.
"You both had the honour," exclaimed Stanley, as he knelt
over the monster's head. "Here are two shot holes, and either
would have killed him."
As may be supposed, the boys' triumph was very great.
Chickango, however, was better pleased with the giraffe.
"Here meat enough for one week," he exclaimed, as he
began to cut away into the giraffe's flesh.
As we had no prejudice in taking an animal killed imme-
diately before our eyes, though we might have objected to it
had we found it dead, we all assisted Chickango in cutting up
the animal, each of us taking as much as we could possibly
carry.
"You stay here," he said. "Take care no oder lion come.
I go call oders ;" and loading himself with twice as much as
we could have attempted to carry, he hurried back to the
camp.
The rest of the party soon arrived ; and we had now an
ample supply of food for several days, if it would keep so long.
Not delaying to kill any birds, as the rest of the party were
waiting for their dinner, we hurried back to the camp. We
found that Timbo had not been idle, and had caught several
fish, which were of good size, and pronounced wholesome.
We found Igubo's sons—the eldest of whom was called Mango
and the other Paulo-creeping along the banks at a little dis-
tance down the river.
"They are after something," observed Jack, "for they have
been making a couple of harpoons; and they seem to know
pretty well what they are about."
Presently we saw a creature which at a distance looked like
a young crocodile leap off the shore into the water. Mango's
harpoon was rapidly darted at it; and he was now seen haul-
ing up the creature, which was struggling to escape. He and
his brother soon despatched it with blows on the head, and,

235
leaving it on the bank, crept on a little further. Presently
another creature was harpooned in the same way by Paulo;
and they now came back looking highly pleased, and dragging
the reptiles after them. They were about three feet long,
with a high ridge running along their backs, and with hideous
heads.
"Bery good eat," exclaimed Chickango when he saw the
little monsters.
"What !" cried out Leo ; " you do not mean to say you
would eat those hideous creatures ? ".
" I suspect we shall have no objection to do so," said David.
" They are varanians, a species of water-lizard, very similar to
the iguanas of the New World, which are considered great
delicacies. Ugly as they look, they are perfectly harmless."
The fires were already lighted, and without loss of time
young Mango and Paulo set to work to skin their prizes.
Chickango stewed a portion of them in our big pan. The
flesh looked remarkably white and nice. First I took a piece;
David followed ; then Leo put in his wooden fork.
"Why, it is capital !" he exclaimed. "Kate, you must
have some. Bella, I am sure you will like it."
In fact, in a short time we were all partaking of the varanian
meat, which we preferred to that of the giraffe. We had a
dessert of great variety, if not to be compared to some of our
English fruits; but we were very thankful to get such nice
and wholesome food. The fruits, indeed, were particularly
cooling and pleasant to the palate. Chickango, who had dis-
appeared, soon came back with a quantity of honey, which he
had taken from the hollows in the trees we had seen on our
shooting expedition. It was, as may be supposed, a welcome
addition to our repast.
We were still seated at our meal, when a low rumbling
noise reached our ears. It continued for some time, and look-

A STORM.
ing out towards the east, whence it appeared to come, we saw
dark clouds collecting. Presently vivid flashes of lightning
darted forth, and reiterated roars came pealing through the
air. "We must get shelter up immediately," cried Senhor
Silva, " or the young ladies will be wet through; and our goods
may suffer too." The canoes had been well secured to trunks
of trees, though not unladen. We immediately got out the
axes, and commenced cutting down the smaller saplings and
straight branches of trees as rapidly as we could. These we
placed on the side of the bank, covering our rude hut over
with large leaves and heavy boughs on the top, which we
secured by ratans to prevent their being blown away. Every-
thing that could be injured by rain was immediately brought
up, leaving room for the young ladies and poor Igubo in the
centre.
"Oh, we can perch ourselves on the top of the baggage,"
cried Leo. "There will be room then for all hands inside."
While we were working away the clouds came rushing on
over the sky, the flashes of lightning becoming every instant
more vivid and frequent. I had hitherto seen nothing like it
on shore. The most vivid flashes of forked lightning darted
from the clouds, apparently playing round the summits of the
taller trees, and then descending, went zigzagging along over
the ground. Others were seen traversing the river in all direc-
tions. It was a grand but terrific scene. The blacks looked
alarmed, and poor Chico chattered as if he would shake his
teeth out, and clung to Jack's neck for protection. The
thunder roared and rattled louder and louder, till we could
scarcely hear each other speak ; while sometimes the whole
atmosphere seemed filled with flame. Presently huge drops be-
gan to fall. They came thicker and thicker, till they splashed
down upon the river, throwing up miniature waterspouts all
'uver it. The roar of the splashing and pattering was quito

A SWOLLEN RIVER.
237
deafening. The wind, too, howled through the trees, which
threatened to come down upon our heads, though we had
placed our hut as far from them as possible. In a few minutes
the water, which had been perfectly clear, became thick and
muddy, and branches of trees and logs of wood were seen
floating down the stream.
"We should be thankful that we are safe on land," said
David. "Will this last long, Senhor Silva ?"
"Sometimes such storms are over in half an hour," was the
answer; " but they may last for a couple of days. Should
this do so, we may congratulate ourselves on having the canoes
to escape in, for the river may speedily swell, and cover the
very spot where we are sitting."
This was not satisfactory news; at the same time, it was
better to know of the probability of such an occurrence, that
we might be prepared for it. The river was rising—that was
evident- and now flowed down in waves which would have
been almost sufficient to swamp our canoes ; while torrents of
water came rushing down the banks, and threatening every
instant to sweep away our hut. Happily we had formed it on
a little elevation on the bank, so that the stream turned on
either side, and the risk was therefore lessened. Fiercer and
fiercer raged the storm. The waters increased rapidly. It
seemed as if the very clouds were emptying themselves upon
the earth.
"I hope we are not going to have another deluge," ex-
claimed Leo.
"Of course not," answered Natty. "Don't you know that
one is never to occur again ? To be sure, this river may over-
flow its banks, but we have our canoes to get away in if it
does."
I was afraid little Bella would be alarmed, but she kept
gazing up at her sister, and seeing her countenance calm and

A HUGE SERPENT.
tranquil, sat contented by her side, without speaking, however.
In spite of the rain, I every now and then put my head out
to ascertain that the canoes were safe; for as the waters rushed
down, I was afraid lest the stumps to which they were fastened
might be carried away. So thick was the rain that we could
scarcely see across to the other side. Suddenly, as if by word
of command, it ceased; and though the thunder continued to
rattle towards the west, and flashes still issued from the clouds
in the east, all quickly became serene. The sun burst forth
again upon our heads, and the leaves of the trees and shrubs
glittered for a few minutes as if covered with diamonds, though
the sun rapidly dried up the moisture. The hut had become
very hot, and I was just going out of it, when I saw the head
of an animal crawling out from a neighbouring bush. At first
I thought it was some creature, till I saw a long body follow-
ing. It was a huge serpent. It came wriggling over the ground
directly towards the hut. "Ondara !" shouted Chickango;
"shoot ! shoot !" Stanley sprang down from his seat, and
aimed at the monster's head. I did the same. The creature,
after convulsively twisting and turning itself into huge coils,
lay still. We hurried down to examine it. On measuring it,
we found that it was upwards of fifteen feet in length. David
examined the head, and pronounced it to be venomous.
"Yes, indeed," said Senhor Silva. "It is the largest of
all venomous serpents, and if the stories told of it are true, so
virulent is the poison that it causes almost instantaneous death."
We had reason to be thankful that we had escaped the two
dangers. As we were anxious to proceed on our voyage, having
now an ample supply of provisions, we once more embarked.
I was afraid, from the thickness of the water, that we should
have difficulty in avoiding any banks in our course; but it very
soon cleared, and we proceeded as before.
As we were paddling along a sudden sickness seized me.


## p. 239 (#243) ############################################

AN ATTACK OF ILLNESS.
239
Whether it was from over-exerting myself, or from the heat of
the sun, I could not tell. Still I tried to go on. At length I
felt my paddle slip from my hand. Natty had just time to
catch it, and to save me from falling forward on my face. I
was placed in the bottom of the canoe, alongside poor Igubo,
and knew no more.
For days and days I lay in an unconscious state, utterly un-
able to move or speak or think.
Some time after this I had a dreamy consciousness of exist-
ence, but often for hours together I knew nothing of what was
occurring. I felt myself now and then lifted out of the canoe.
I knew that David was attending me, and at other times a
sweet face bending over me, and fair hands holding a fan and
driving away the flies. Once I heard Natty whispering, "Oh,
he will die! he will die !"
"I pray Heaven he may not," was the answer; "and David
thinks he will get through it. But he is very ill."
Then again I fell off into a dreamy state. Now and then
I knew I was on shore, and once more on the water. I was
conscious of the movement of the canoe, but what was happen-
ing round me I could not tell. I heard shots fired, and then
strange voices shouting and shrieking, but I could not utter a
word, nor could I understand what was said to me. After a
time the power of thought came back, and I knew when it was
day and when it was night, and I was able to discover that
many days and nights had passed away. Still I could not ask
questions. An awning had been placed over the stern of the
canoe, under which I lay. I remember seeing Igubo paddling
away, as strong as the rest of the party, and though there was
the mark of the wound in his side, it was perfectly healed.
This showed me that a considerable time must have elapsed
since I had been attacked. I discovered also that we were

MY RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS.
ascending a stream, but even then I could not speak. Shortly
after this I felt myself lifted up and placed on a sort of palan-
quin, and carried along over the ground. I knew that I was
remaining for some time, and that my little cousin Bella was
sitting by my side fanning my face, and now and then moisten-
ing my lips, or giving me a slight portion of food. After that,
I was once more li?ted into the canoe. The river must have
been far narrower than any we had passed through, for even
as I lay in the bottom of the canoe I could see the trees on
either side.
I had a relapse. I knew nothing more till one day I opened
my eyes, and saw my cousin Kate seated near me, and Bella
on a low stool at my side, with a book before her. Kate was
working away most assiduously, as was her wont. Not far off
in a corner sat Chico, as busily, though not so usefully, employed
in cracking nuts. We were in a large airy hut, formed, as far
as I could see, very much after the fashion of those we had
before constructed. I was so placed as to be in the shade, and
at the same time to obtain as much air as possible. I heard
the voices of Leo and Natty at a little distance. They were
engaged in some work, I concluded, and were laughing and
talking merrily. I tried to speak, and I must have uttered a
sound, for instantly Bella sprang up, and, casting her bright
eyes on me, ran to her sister. "Oh, he is awake, and looks as
if he knew me!" she exclaimed. Kate cautiously approached,
and I saw her looking down upon me with an eye of pity and
interest.
" Are you better, Andrew ?" she whispered.
"Yes, thank you," I could just utter in a low voice, "much
better." I wanted to say more, but could not.
" Leo! Leo !" she cried out, "call David ! he will be so
glad to hear that Andrew has returned to consciousness."
I could just catch sight of the boys running past the hut.'

ASSISTANCE SENT FOR.

"Where are we? what has happened ?" I asked.
"Oh, that would take too long to tell you," answered Kate.
"You have been very ill for several weeks, and we have all
been mercifully preserved from many dangers. You shall know
all about it by-and-by. We are safe now, I hope, and Stanley
has sent for assistance; but I must not talk more now."

CHAPTER XI.
OUR NEW HOME IN THE MOUNTAINS.
HANKS to David's skill, and the preservation of the
medicine-chest, under God's providence, I gradually
recovered my strength. Several days passed, how-
ever, after the one I have mentioned when I re-
turned to consciousness, before I could converse, or
David would allow me to listen to a narrative of the events
which had occurred since I was taken ill. My friends were
employed in building huts and a stockade on a high hill which
they had selected as a location to remain at till means of pro-
ceeding to the south could be procured. It was some hundred
miles to the north of Walfish Bay, the nearest point where
Europeans were located.
The first day I could sit up (I remember it well), Kate was
by my side. A fresh breeze blew in at the open door of our
hut, cooling my fevered brow. How beautiful all nature
looked. We could gaze over a wide expanse of country, with
blue hills on the left, and thick forests gradually breaking
into scattered clumps of trees, and an open prairie reaching to
the horizon towards the south. Below us I saw an extensive
lake with a river flowing into it.
"There," said Kate, "is the stream down which we came
to this spot. How thankful I was when we reached it, for

A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE.
243
David said he had no hope of your recovery till we could find
a resting-place, with pure air and a more bracing climate than
we were passing through. It was dreadful to have you ex-
posed so long to the damp night air, and the miasmas which
arose from the river; but we are in safety now, and I try to
forget all the dangers and anxiety we endured. It may be
many weeks or months before we can again set out; but by
that time, David says he hopes you will be thoroughly re-
stored to health, and we shall be able to journey on with light
hearts, and, I hope, find friends to welcome us at the end."
"Oh, yes, dear Andrew," exclaimed Bella. "You have no
idea how frightened we often were; for we thought if the
savages had stopped us or taken us away from you, that you
would certainly have died. Sometimes we thought you were
dead, you were so quiet and pale; but when you are well
again, we shall not mind anything."
" Hush, hush !" said Kate, "we must not talk to Andrew
of what has passed. All is well now. Stanley is delighted
with the place. There is an extraordinary abundance of game
of all sorts, as he calls the wild animals which rove over those
plains. Sometimes we can see from here herds of buffaloes,
and cameleopards, zebras, and all sorts of deer and quaggas;
and there are savage animals too_lions, rhinoceroses, and
leopards, and elephants; indeed, he will not allow the boys to
go far by themselves lest they should be attacked."
"No, indeed," said Bella; " for though Stanley does not
always tell us his adventures, I suspect he has some narrow
escapes. In the river and lake, too, there is an immense
number of hippopotami and crocodiles. The boys went down
to bathe soon after we arrived, and had a fright, which will
prevent them ever doing it again. They were both in the
water when a huge crocodile darted across towards them, and
they had just time to scramble out and run away, leaving
ved, and had

their clothes behind them, when Jack and Timbo, who were
fortunately near, rushed down and drove the creature off."
"It was indeed a mercy they were not seized," said Kate.
"But we must not talk more to you now, Andrew. Stanley
says he could not have wished to go to a finer spot, and it is
only necessary to be cautious to avoid danger from any of
them an, here netween the smal
"Ah, here come the boys, and they have got a beautiful
little animal between them. What can it be?" exclaimed
Bella. "See, it has got small horns, and looks a graceful
creature."
"It must be an antelope of some sort," said Kate; " but
they will tell us."
The boys, who were coming up the hill, soon reached the
hut. : "We have got a koodoo! It is for you, Bella," they
exclaimed in the same breath. "Chickango and Igubo caught
it this morning, and have given it to us; but we are to take
great care of it. See, it is already almost tame, but if we
were to let it go it would soon be off." Kate made a sign to
them. They both stopped and looked eagerly at me.
"O Andrew, how glad I am to see you sit up," cried
Natty, on discovering that I knew them. "We were very
unhappy about you; but now you will soon be yourself again,
and till you are well enough to go about, our koodoo will give
you plenty of employment, for Chickango says he requires
careful nursing, just like one baby. We are to feed him with
milk, and in a little time he will become as tame as Chico,
though he will not play so many funny tricks, perhaps."
The little koodoo, when brought up to Kate and Bella,
allowed itself to be stroked, and put out its tongue and licked
their hands, though I saw from its startled eye and the
tremor in its slender legs that it was as yet far from happy in
its captivity. In a short time David came in, and after he

had congratulated me on my improved looks, examined the
little animal.
"Yes, indeed, it is a pretty creature," he observed; " but
the full-grown one is still more beautiful. I saw several two
mornings ago, which had taken shelter during the night in a
thick wood which clothes the side of the hill at a short distance
from this, and as they did not perceive me, I was able to ob-
serve them at leisure. The female is without horns, but the
male has magnificent spiral ones upwards of three feet in
length, which rise erect from his exquisitely-formed head, and
give him an air of nobility and independence. The animal is
about four feet high at the shoulder, and the general colour is
a reddish gray, marked with white bars over the neck and croop.
When walking slowly its action is very graceful. While
watching the beautiful creatures I caught sight of a leopard
lurking in the neighbourhood. I fired just in time to save
the life of one towards which he was stealing. I missed the
leopard, for I was at a considerable distance; but the report
frightened the koodoos, and away they went, leaping over
bushes, stones, and all impediments at a rapid rate, while the
savage beast stole off, vowing vengeance, probably, against me
for having disappointed him of his morning meal. The koodoo
lives chiefly on buds and leaves and the young shoots of trees
and bushes, and it is said that he is capable of going a long
time without water. He is of a very timid disposition, but I
am told, however, that when hotly pressed or wounded, he will
sometimes face about and attack his pursuer. But we must
now see about getting food for our young captive. We were,
fortunately, on our way here, able to purchase half-a-dozen
goats from some natives who had brought them from the
south, and we must devote the milk of one of them to him."
" But how can you make him drink it ?" asked Bella.
" Just as we give it to babies," said David, laughing. "I

will make a sucking-bottle for him. It can very easily be
done. Seel that small gourd hanging up will answer the pur-
pose. I will fasten a piece of linen and a small quill in the
mouth, and we will try the little creature."
"I will go and milk the goat," cried Leo, rushing out.
" You come and help me, Natty, though."
Meantime David prepared the bottle, and in a few minutes
Leo returned with a calabash full of milk.
"It is lucky I went," said Natty, " for the goat had refused
to be milked at this hour, and had knocked Leo over."
"Yes, and she would have knocked you over, too, if I had
not held her legs," said Leo. "However, we managed it."
"Why, how did you do that?" asked David.
"Oh, we tied her hind-legs to a post on one side and her
fore-legs to another, and I held the head while Natty milked,"
said Leo
"Poor goat!" observed Kate. "I suspect she will not
allow you to play that trick again."
The bottle was filled, and no sooner was it put to the little
koodoo's lips than the creature began pulling away in a very
satisfactory manner, every now and then giving a butt at it as
it might have done when obtaining milk from its mother. It
satisfied us, however, that there would be but little difficulty
in bringing up the creature. Chico had eagerly watched the
operation from his corner in the hut, though he did not ap-
proach the new comer. As soon as the deer had done with
the bottle, David hung it up, when the monkey, fancying him-
self unobserved, instantly made for it, and, greatly to our
amusement, applied it to his own lips, and began sucking
away till he had drained it dry. He then quietly attempted
to hang it up again, though in this he failed, and the bottle fell
to the ground.
"We cannot afford to give you milk, Master Chico," said

David; " but I will soon cure you of that trick." Saying this,
he went to his medicine-chest, which stood near, and having
filled the bottle with water, put in a little powder, which he
shook up. He then returned the bottle to its usual place.
"Now, take care, Master Chico, what you are about," he
observed. "You are not to touch that bottle, recollect."
Chico looked at the bottle with longing eyes for an instant,
then turned away, as if it was a matter of perfect indifference
to him. In a short time he came down, and began to examine
the little stranger, who seemed, however, in no way pleased
with his presence.
"Oh, we will soon make you good friends," said Natty.
"I hope we shall have a happy family before long. Do you
know, Andrew, we have already got several creatures, and
have managed to tame many of them, so that they feed on the
hill-side in view of the hut, and come back at night regularly,
for fear of wild beasts."
"Nuw, boys," said David, " we have talked with Andrew
!ung enough, and I think we must leave him to Kate's care
again. Your chattering is too exciting, and he has not got
strong yet."
"Oh, but we will be very quiet, and merely listen to him,
if he is inclined to talk," said Leo.
"That is the very thing I do not wish him to do," observed
David.
"I feel quite strong," I said. "Pray do not send the boys
away unless they wish to go."
However, the doctor was inexorable. While we were speak-
ing, Chico had stolen back to his corner. Presently I saw
Leo eyeing him, and hiding his face for fear of laughing.
Chico by degrees made his way up to the bottle, and slily
unhooking it, put the spout to his lips and began tugging away
with might and main. Presently casting it from him, with a

loud chattering he rushed back to his corner spluttering and
spitting vehemently. Leo now gave way to his laughter, in
which all the party joined. Even Kate could not resist laugh.
ing, nor could I, though my merriment was somewhat faint, I
suspect. Chico looked indignantly at us, as if he did not at all
like being made fun of.
"I told you," said David, holding up his finger, " if you
would drink from that bottle you would repent it."
He now took the bottle, and offered the contents to Leo and
Natty, which they naturally refusing, he emptied it, and washed
it out thoroughly. "It is quite clean now for Master Koo-
doo," he observed.
"Now, boys, take off your new pet, and try how quickly,
by gentle treatment, you can tame it."
"I must ask Chickango and Igubo to get me one," ex-
claimed Bella. "I should like to have a beautiful creature
like that for a pet, and I am sure I could soon make it love
me."
"That must depend on whether one happens to jump into
a pit," said Leo. "That was the way this one was caught.
The mother managed to scramble out, but was shot while at-
tempting to help her young one."
"Yes, and it seemed very cruel to kill the creature at such
a moment. I should not like to have done it," observed Natty.
" That I am sure of," whispered Bella.."Natty would
never wish to hurt any creature."
The boys now led off the little koodoo. Stanley soon after-
wards arrived, followed by Jack, with some beautiful birds and
several rock rabbits which they had shot. They congratulated
me warmly on being so much better. I caught sight also of
Timbo, Igubo, and his two sons.
"What has become of Chickango?" I asked, afraid, from
not seeing him, that some accident had happened.

JACK AND TIMBO's CONGRATULATIONS.
249
"The faithful fellow has gone to Walfish Bay with Senhor
Silva," said Stanley. "We attempted in vain to find a native
who would carry our message, and at last our Portuguese
friend, though knowing the fearful risks he will run, under-
took the journey, when Chickango insisted on accompanying
him."
"Well, Mr. Crawford, I am main glad you are getting well
again," exclaimed Jack, when the rest of the party had re-
tired. "I would have given my right hand for your sake, and
often when I thought you were going to slip your cable, I was
ready to burst out a-crying; but, as Timbo says, God is very
merciful, and now I hope you will come round pretty quickly,
since you have weathered the worst point, where, so to speak,
there were most rocks and shallows, and are now in smooth
water."
I saw Timbo watching at a distance, and as soon as Jack had
gone, he too came up.
"Oh, Massa Crawford, it do my heart good to see your eye
bright again, and colour come back to de cheek. Me now no
fear. You soon all right. I pray God night and day dat you
get well, dat I do, and I go on praying still, for God hear de
prayer of de black fellow, just as he hear de white man. Oh,
Massa Crawford, it a great t'ing to be able to pray. If I no
do dat I t'ink my heart sink down to the bottom of de river
where de crocodiles crawl about; but when I pray it rise up
just like a bird wid de big wings, and fly up, up, up into de
blue sky."
I thanked Timbo warmly for his regard, but still more for
the prayers he had offered up; and I felt as sure as he did
that they had not been disregarded. My father's exhortation,
I am glad to say, often came back to my mind. It was very
delightful lying there in the shade, with the beautiful land-
scape and its countless numbers of inhabitants, and listening

EXCURSION ON THE LAKE.
to Kate reading the Bible, in which we often came to passages,
some peculiarly applicable to our position—so it appeared to
me-others describing the wonders of God's works which we
saw displayed before us, and his love and mercy to man.
In a few days I had so much recovered that my friends
insisted on carrying me down to take an excursion on the
lake. The day was cool, for a fresh breeze played over the
water. Leo and Natty begged to have the pleasure of pad-
dling me.
" And we will go too, shall we not?" cried Bella to her
sister. I was glad to find that Kate consented.
"And I must go to look after you," said David, "and Timbo
will stay at home to take care of the house."
"Very well, if I go as captain," said Jack; "but I cannot
let you go and run your noses into the mouth of a hippopota-
mus or alligator, either of which, I have a notion, you would
be likely to do."
Stanley and the two black boys had gone off in the Giraffe,
as he wished to shoot. I wished to walk down, but found, on
attempting it, that I could not; indeed, I had become so thin
that I was no great weight for my friends to carry. As soon as
we had taken our places in the canoe, we shoved off. I was able
to sit up and enjoy the scenery. To the west rose the lofty hills
on the side of which our village was placed, for so I think I
must call it, while on the left were woods with fine trees, and
here and there a break through which the broad prairie could
be seen extending as far as the eye could reach towards the
south. We got glimpses of numerous animals moving in
and about the woods, and some scampering over the plain.
It was already late in the day when we embarked. As the
weather was fine and the lake perfectly calm, we paddled
down the centre to enjoy the greater purity of the air, away
from the banks. The trip was so enjoyable that we were

NUMEROUS QUADRUPEDS AND BIRDS.
251
tempted to go further, perhaps, than was prudent. At length,
unwillingly, David begged Jack to turn the canoe's head home-
wards. As we were paddling along, we caught sight of
Stanley's canoe entering a creek out of the lake.
"Oh, see, see !" cried Bella, "what thousands of animals!
I never saw so many collected together."
Such indeed was the case. On the point nearest the lake
some twenty or more huge buffaloes were standing drinking at
the stream. Further on a whole herd of quaggas had come
down, while through the woods could be seen the graceful
horns of a troop of koodoos and other deer, though it was
difficult to distinguish them among the trees. But we were
more immediately interested with the numerous birds we were
passing. It would be difficult to describe them all; but
David, who was a good ornithologist, told us their names.
Amongst them was one which seemed to run about on the
surface employed in catching insects. It had long thin legs,
and extremely long toes, which enabled it to stand on the
floating lotus leaves and other aquatic plants invisible to our
eyes. A lotus leaf, not six inches in diameter, was sufficient
to support its spread-out toes, just as snow-shoes enable a
heavy man to get over the soft snow. It was the Parra
Africana. Then there were numbers of the pretty little
wader, which looked exactly as if it was standing on stilts,
from the length of its legs, while its bill appeared to be bent
upwards, instead of downwards, as Leo declared it ought to be.
David called it an avoset. "See," said David, " the use of its
bill !" It was wading in a shallow; and the form of its beak
enabled it to dig up insects out of the soft sand far more easily
than if it had been straight. We saw vast numbers of the
large black goose walking about slowly and feeding. It had a
strong black spur on the shoulder, with which it can defend its
young. David told us that it forms its nests in ant-hills, and,

of course, eats up the inhabitants. Among the several varieties
of geese was the Egyptian or Chenalopex Ægyptiaca. It flew
along over the surface, but appeared unable to rise. It would
have been impossible to count the ducks which sat on the
banks. Stanley fired among them, and almost filled his canoe
with a few shots, as he afterwards told us. He had killed in
one shot nearly twenty ducks and a couple of geese. But they
were only some of the smaller birds. Further up were
spoonbills with nearly white plumage ; a tribe of stately
flamingoes, such as I have before described; numbers of
the demoiselle — an extremely graceful and elegant-looking
bird—and a light blue crane, and another crane with light bloe
and white neck. We must have counted fifty or more speci-
mens of the Ibis religiosa, and vast flocks of the large white
pelican, which came following each other in a long-extended
line, rising and falling as they flew. David cried out that
they looked as if they were all fastened together like a thick
rope made to move like a serpent. There were also innumer-
able plovers, snipes, curlews, herons, and other smaller birds.
A number of those strange birds, the scissorbills, were flying
about near a sandbank on one side. They had snow-white
breasts, black coats, and red beaks. We observed the hollows
in which their nests were placed in the sandbanks, for they
made no attempt to conceal them. "What brave little chaps
they are !" exclaimed Leo. "See !" Some crows had ap-
proached as he spoke, when the scissorbills flew after them and
drove them off. As we drew near, however, the crows took to
flight, when the little scissorbills hung down one of their
wings, and limped off, pretending to be lame. This trick
did not, however, save the life of one of them, at which David
fired for the sake of examining it. On getting the bird into
the canoe, we found the lower mandible almost as thin as a
carving-knife. The bird places it on the surface of the water

BEE-EATERS AND THEIR NESTS.

as it skims along, and scoops up any minute insects which it
meets with in its course. Its wings being very long, and
kept above the level of its body, it can continue thus flying
on for a considerable time, till it has supplied itself with an
* ample meal.
"By feeding at night, it probably escapes being snapped up
by some hungry crocodile, which it would be if it fed thus
close to the water in the day-time," observed David. "The
scissorbill has great affection for its young, as indeed have
most water-birds."
On another bank we saw a number of pretty little bee-
eaters congregated together. The bank was perforated with
hundreds of holes conducting to their nests. As we passed
by they flew out in clouds, darting about our heads. Then
there were speckled kingfishers, and also beautiful little blue
and orange kingfishers, which we saw dash down like shots into
the water searching for their prey. There were sand-martins
something like those seen in England; and from the trees also,
as we passed under the banks, rose flocks of green pigeons. I
must, however, bring my account of the feathered tribes we
encountered in our trip to an end. Stanley's gun soon created
dismay and astonishment among them, and often the air, as
he fired, seemed literally filled with birds. The zebras and
quaggas started off and took shelter in the woods; but the
buffaloes more firmly stood their ground, eyeing us with aston-
ishment, and evidently not understanding the effect which a
bullet would produce should it hit one of them. Suddenly
too, from out of the water rose several huge heads of hippopo-
tami, which made Bella cry out with dismay, for though we
were by this time well accustomed to them, she had never got
over her alarm at seeing the monsters.
"Oh, let us paddle away from those dreadful creatures !"
she exclaimed. "I am sure they are going to swim after us.

256
A LION IN AMBUSH.
See, see! Oh, how horrible if they should seize Stanley's
boat! They are between him and us. He will never be able
to come back."
"Do not be afraid, Miss Bella," said Jack. "The captain
will give a good account of them. A bullet would soon send
any one of them to the bottom."
Jack, however, shouted out to Stanley, and pointed to the
hippopotami. He had by this time got his canoe so full of
birds that he could scarcely carry more, and he now came
paddling after us, utterly regardless of the monsters. As he
passed by, though they gazed at him with their savage eyes,
and mouths half open, they did not attempt to approach ; and
the blacks continued to shout and shriek to keep them at a
respectful distance. Stanley, having put specimens of the
birds he had shot into our canoe till we could scarcely receive
more, went back to knock over, as he said, a further supply,
while we paddled homewards. David had now plenty of
occupation in examining our prizes, while the boys paddled
slowly onwards, assisted by Jack, who not only paddled, but
steered also. We found Timbo waiting for us at the landing-
place with the litter to carry me. He had a gun over bis
shoulder, and appeared to be keeping a bright look-out on
every side, shouting every now and then at the top of his voice.
"What is it, Timbo ?" asked David.
"Me see big lion ! " he answered.'" He mean mischief.
Just now roar and roar again. He would like carry off Massa
Andrew, but we no let him."
"Oh, never fear," cried Jack. "We will keep the biggest
lion at bay if he should come near us, and will give him a
shot which will make him wish he had kept away."
" The lion is not likely to come near us when he sees so
many people," said David; "but we will be on our guard,
against his approach."

CHICO FRIGHTENED BY THE LION.
257
I was immediately lifted on to the palanquin, and Jack and
Timbo carried me up towards the house. All hands loaded
themselves at the same time with birds, and Kate and Bella
fastened as many at their backs as they could carry. Even
then they were obliged to leave many behind for a second trip.
David and Leo walked by the side of Bella, while Natty led
the way. We had got half-way up the hill, when, from a
thicket at some distance, a loud roar proceeded, and we saw
the head of an enormous lion appearing from among the
bushes.
"Roar away, old fellow," cried Jack. " It will be the
worse for you if you come here."
" Shall I fire ? I might kill him," said David.
"No, massa, no," answered Timbo. "If you hit him he
come on in great rage. He now only angry because he dare
not come near. Each time he roar we roar back, and dat keep
him away;" and Timbo setting the example, the whole party
set up a loud shout, with the exception of Kate. Little
Bella, howerer, made her shrill voice distinctly heard. For
my own part, I could not have attempted to shout. It showed
me how prostrate I had been, for even now I had difficulty in
slightly raising my voice.
Our shouting brought Chico to the door. As soon as he
saw us he came hopping down the hill; but the next time the
lion roared he gave a spring backwards, and turning round,
rushed back into the hut.
"We must go down and warn the captain," said Jack ;
" for if he does not know that the lion is in the neighbour-
hood, the beast may surprise him; and, at all events, he will
want assistance in bringing up the birds."
" We will go, then," said Leo and Natty; and they set off
together.
David, in the meantime, secured our cattle - pen, which

probably had attracted the lion to the spot. At each side of
the entrance a circular hut had been built, answering the pur-
pose of the gateway towers of a castle. Igubo and his two boys
occupied one of them, and Jack and Timbo the other. They
were built of reeds closely bound together, and the doors were
of the same material. These were strong enough to resist the
attack of any wild beast, and were always kept closely shut at
night. I felt somewhat tired after my day's excursion ; but
some supper my kind cousins soon prepared restored my
strength. They had got ready a more substantial meal for
Stanley and his attendants, who now arrived.
"What do you think, Mr. David ?" I heard Jack exclaim.
"If a big alligator has not got into the canoe and eaten up all
the birds while we were away! It is fortunate we brought up
as many as we did. However, the captain has got enough and
to spare."
"We will be even wid him," said Timbo. " Igubo say he
kill alligator. If he find him he get dem all back to-night."
" Tell him he had better not make the attempt," said Jack,
" or maybe the lion will pick him up on his way to the river.
We must give a good account of the brute to-morrow, or he
will be doing us mischief."
There was ample work that evening in plucking the birds and
in salting down the larger number. I should have mentioned
that a salt spring had been found on the side of the mountain;
without it, indeed, I doubt if we should have been able to
remain at the place, for we had already finished our supply of
that necessary article.
There was no necessity to warn the rest to secure their doors
at night. One man, it was agreed, should keep watch, as it
was very likely the lion would attempt to get into the cattle-
pen. As I lay asleep in my hut the roar of the lion entered
into my dreams. Sometimes I thought he was flying at Kate,

A NIGHT ATTACK.
259
and I was in vain endeavouring to defend her. Once he had
carried off Natty; and I saw Leo, bis namesake, seated on his
back and digging a spear into him. At last I started up, and
was sure the sounds I heard were real, and no mere fancies of
the brain. The whole of the inmates of our camp were on
foot, and I heard them calling to each other. Presently there
was a shot, followed by another tremendous roar.
" Can you see him ?" I heard Stanley cry out.
"No, sir ; he has made off," answered Jack.
"I thought I hit him," exclaimed Stanley.
" T'ink not," said Timbo. "He no like sound of gun."
A?ter a time they all went back to the huts. I think I
said I slept in David's, for he acted as my nurse throughout
my illness, and no one could have been more gentle and kind.
Next morning Stanley and the boys hurried out to see if there
were any marks of blood; but none were discovered, and it
was therefore plain that the lion could not have been hit.
My companions had not been idle, I found, for they had
cultivated a considerable piece of ground, and enclosed it, on
one side of the cattle-pen. People in England have little notion
how rapidly fruits come to perfection in the Tropics, where
the account of Jonah's gourd is completely realized. Thus,
in time, we had all sorts of vegetables, which contributed
greatly to keep my companions in health, and to restore my
strength. Stanley's gun also supplied us amply with animal
food of the greatest variety, so that we were never on short
allowance. Igubo and his sons were expert fishermen, and
caught as many fish as we required. There were often more
than we could eat fresh; the remainder were sun or smoke-
dried, and, hung up, kept for a considerable time. The
fishermen had to be careful not to fall into the jaws of croco-
diles, who were constantly on the watch ; and thus they often
had to beat a rapid retreat to escape from the monsters.

A PRESENT OF MANIOC.
Up to the time I am speaking of we had received. no visits
from the inhabitants, but Stanley, in his more extensive
shooting excursions, had fallen in with a few, though the
nearest village was about four miles off. It was situated in a
valley to the north of us. The people appeared peaceably dis-
posed. They seldom or never ventured far from their homes,
having the means of supporting life and abundance of game
round them. They also cultivated the soil sufficiently to ob-
tain enough vegetables for their wants. Stanley had won
their friendship by making them presents of birds and some

animals, and in return they begged him to accept a supply of
manioc, which Mango and Paulo brought to us. They look

HOW IT IS GROWN.
261
upon it as their staff of life, and as it is produced with very
little labour, it well suits their habits. Stanley described the
plantation which surrounded the village. The plants, he told
me, grow to the height of six feet, and the leaves are often
cooked as a vegetable; indeed, every part is useful. The roots
are about four inches in diameter and eighteen long. To
cultivate it the earth is formed into beds about three feet
broad and one in height, and into these pieces of the stalk are
placed about four feet apart. In about eight months, or some-
times rather more, the roots are fit to eat. There are two
sorts, I ought to say. One is sweet and wholesome, and fit to
eat when dried, and can at once be beaten into flour for making
bread or cakes; the other is bitter, and contains poison, but is
more quickly fit for food than the sweet sort. To get rid of
the poison it is placed for four days in water, when it becomes
partly decomposed. It is then taken out, stripped of the skin,
and exposed to the sun. When thus dried it is easily pounded
into a fiue white meal. It is then prepared for food as ordinary
porridge is made, by having boiling water poured upon it by
one person, while another stirs it round till it is thoroughly
mixed. Our black companions were very fond of it; but while
we could obtain more substantial food, few of our party would
condescend to eat it, except now and then as a change. The
poison is of so volatile a nature that it is quickly got rid of by
heat. Timbo made the meal into thin cakes, which, when
baked on an iron plate, were pronounced very good. David
told us that it was called cassava, as well as manioc, and that
its scientific name was Jatropha manihot. After a few trials
he contrived to manufacture a kind of starch, which I had often
seen in England under the name of tapioca. He was delighted
when he succeeded in producing it, and Kate at once made
some very nice puddings from it, by mixing it with honey
to give it flavour.

MODE OF PREPARING MANIOC.
We obtained also from the village some yam roots, which
had greatly the taste of potatoes, though of a closer texture.

NEGROES PREPARING THE MANIOC ROOT.
They also were placed in the sun to dry before being cooked,
and we found by putting them in dry sand that they would
keep well for a considerable time. The yam is the root of a
climbing plant which David called the Dioscoreo-sativa. It
had tender stems, eighteen to twenty feet in length, and sharp-
pointed leaves on long foot stalks. From the base of the roots
are spikes of small flowers. The roots are black and palmated,
and about a foot in breadth. Within they are white, but ex-
ternally of a very dark brown colour. Besides this another sort
was brought to us a little time afterwards, called the Dioscoreo-

alata, very much larger than the former. Some, indeed, were
fully three feet long, and weighed nearly thirty pounds.
"How it would delight an Irishman's heart to see a potato
as big as this root !" exclaimed Leo. "It would be a hard
matter, however, to find a pot big enough to boil it in, or to
steam it afterwards, to make it mealy."

CHAPTER XII.
INCIDENTS DURING OUR RESIDENCE ON THE MOUNTAIN,
VACHE boys were continually asking Timbo and Igubo
when they were going to catch them another pet.
They were with me one day when the two men
arrived loaded with the flesh of an animal which
Stanley had shot.
"What is that?" I asked.
" He bery good eat," was the answer; "like a little horse."
"But what is it called in England ?" I inquired.
" Him zebra," he answered ; "mark over back. We cooky
for supper."
"I wish Stanley had caught him alive," said Leo. "Now,
Timbo, cannot you manage to get a young one for us, or a
couple, and then we could break them in, and make them
carry us."
" Him no carry no one," answered Timbo. "He wild.
Kick off, even dough you stick on like Chico."
"But we could soon teach Chico to ride it. I suspect
that it would puzzle even a zebra to kick him off."
"We will try," said Timbo. "We go and make many pit-
falls; but take care, Massa Natty, you no tumble in when
tiger or leopard dere."
I found that the men had already dug some pit-falls, though

hitherto, excepting a koodoo, nothing had been caught in
them.
Next morning they set off to visit the pits, accompanied by
the boys. In rather more than an hour they came back, Leo
and Natty dragging a beautiful little animal between them,
while the two men brought the head and skin and a quantity
of meat of another. David, who was with me, ran out to
meet them.
"They have got a gemsbok !" he exclaimed; "one of the
most interesting of the antelope tribe. It is known also as the
oryx."
"How did you catch it?" he asked.
"We found it in the pit !" exclaimed the boys at once ;
" the mother and the young one. Poor little creature. The
mother fought so furiously that the men were obliged to kill
her, and not till then could we get the young one out. But
it will make a capital playmate for the koodoo."
"It is very hungry," said David. "We will try if it will
take some milk."
While Leo and Natty ran off to milk a goat, the men held
the little animal, which, though it trembled, made no attempt
to escape. David examined the head of the larger one. It
had beautiful horns, nearly three feet in length, slightly curving
backwards, and of a shiny black colour, and very slender. The
mane and tail were very like those of a horse, while the shape
of the head and the colour were those of an ass, the legs and
ftet, however, showing it to be an antelope. Both the horns
were so exactly equal that I could fancy a person taking a side
view of the animal might imagine them to be one and the same;
and David said that the gemsbok has often therefore been sup-
posed, by those who have seen it at a distance only, to be the
unicorn which the ancients believed to exist. The little calf was
of a reddish cream colour, and was so small that the horns had

scarcely yet appeared. Timbo told us that the gemsboks were
generally seen in small herds. Probably this one and its cali
had been separated from their companions, as no others had been

taken. It is one of the swiftest quadrupeds of Africa, indeed
its speed is almost equal to that of the horse. Herds of them
are generally found in districts devoid of water, as they can go
a long time without drinking, having receptacles in their
inside somewhat like those of a camel, though much smaller,
for retaining fluid.
As soon as the milk was brought David tried to feed the
little creature with a spoon instead of the bottle, and after a
few attempts it willingly swallowed the milk. He then
applied the bottle to its mouth, and as soon as it found out its
contents it sucked it eagerly; he had hopes, therefore, of
being able to bring it up. Kate and Bella, summoned by the
boys, now came in to inspect their new pet. It allowed Bella
to stroke it and pet it without evincing any fear, and when
she fastened a handkerchief round its neck it followed her
willingly.
" What a dear little creature!" she exclaimed. "We must
give it a name, though. I do not think gemsbok is pretty.
I like oryx better."
"I am afraid, however, when he gets his horns he will
prove rather a dangerous companion," observed David, looking
at the head of the larger animal which lay on the ground out-
side the hut. "It will fearlessly encounter the most savage
animals of the desert, and instances have occurred where it has
succeeded in killing even a lion or tiger which had incautiously
sprung on its dagger-like weapon of defence."
"Oh, it will be a long time before those grow!" said Leo.
"We can pad them, or cut off their tips, and then it can hurt
no one, even in play."
Stanley and the two black boys were out hunting, and in
the evening they appeared, the boys carrying slung on two
poles an animal which we saw at once was alive.
"Why, it is a little horse !" cried Leo, running down the hill.

A YOUNG ZEBRA CAPTURED.
" The zebra we have been so longing for!" exclaimed
Natty.
They soon arrived at the encampment, Stanley highly de-
lighted with his prize. It was curious that the two animals
they had been so long wishing for should have been taken on
the same day.
"He has given us a great deal of trouble," said Stanley, as
the little creature was brought up to be inspected by the girls
and I. "I doubt if we shall ever make him reconciled to
captivity. He struggled and kicked so much that we had
great difficulty in getting hold of him, and as to making him
come along with us, that was impossible. The harder we
pulled one way the more determined he was to go another,
and at length Mango suggested that we should sling him as
you see, and he could then no longer help himself. But it
was no easy matter to get him into the slings."
The little zebra was somewhat more clumsily shaped than
a pony's colt, and about the size of one three or four weeks
old. A pen had been built for the koodoo, and into this the
two animals were now introduced. Koodoo gazed at them
with looks of astonishment, but in a short time ran up to the
little oryx and seemed to welcome it.
"I do not know whether they understand each other's lan-
guage," said Bella, "but it strikes me koodoo is telling little
oryx that he is very well treated, and recommending him to
be reconciled to his fate."
The zebra, however, would not go near them, and when-
ever they approached ran off round and round the pen. In
a short time it became hungry, and David, accompanied by
Timbo, with a calabash of milk, went in to try and feed it,
Timbo had some difficulty in catching it, for whenever he drew
near it kicked out viciously, and then scampered off. It was,
however, at length caught, and though at first when David tried

to put the milk into its mouth it kept its teeth closed just as
as a child does when medicine is offered it, it at length allowed
some to be poured down its throat.
I was now sufficiently recovered to walk about the camp
with the aid of a stick. Sometimes Kate and Bella assisted
to support me, and when Leo and Natty were within they
were always ready to offer me their arms. We never ventured
to leave the camp without a guard; for since the first visit of
the lion I have described to our neighbourhood we had fre-
quently heard his roar, although he had not ventured to come
nearer. Our life, indeed, was not altogether free from anxiety,
for we could not hide from ourselves the danger which the
hunters especially ran from wild beasts, nor could we be certain
either that the natives in the neighbourhood might not some
day prove treacherous. Stanley, grown bold by immunity,
increased the length of his expeditions, and frequently did not
return till after nightfall. One day he went out accompanied
by Igubo and his two sons, leaving the rest of us to work in
the garden and to keep watch over the camp.
"How long shall you remain away?" asked Kate." It
makes us feel so anxious when you are absent."
"You can dispense with our protection for a couple of
nights, I hope, at all events," he answered. "We have no
enemies to fear; and, in truth, two nights spent in the wilds at
a time are sufficient to satisfy even my love of sport. If we
had waggons to carry our provisions, and horses to ride, the
case might be different; but even if we get the game we can-
not bring it back, so you may rely on our reappearance at the
time I propose."
I did not see them in the morning, as they went away before
I had risen. Stanley had been absent two days, when, as
the weather was cool, the boys begged me and their sisters to
come down and take a paddle on the lake. I was able, I

thought, to walk down and back again with their assistance,
and as David, thought I should benefit by the amusement, he
advised me to go, Timbo remaining, while Jack went as cap-
tain. Chico, as usual, accompanied us, and hopping into the
canoe, took his seat in the bows. As we paddled along we
had abundance of matter to interest us, in the numerous birds
which skimmed along the water or sat perched on the trees,

Bella pointed out some beautiful turtle doves, which were
sitting happily on their nests above the water gently uttering
their low coos to each other. Not far off we espied an ibis
perched on the stump of a tree, shattered probably by light-
ning.

THE ARMED PLOVER.
271
"I should like to bring her down for her impertinence,"
cried Leo. "Listen to her loud "Wa-wa-wa." She is
trying to drown the voices of your favourites, Bella."
Though we passed close by, the ibis seemed in no way dis-
posed to move, but continued shouting "Wa-wa-wa." How-
ever, she was not allowed to cry alone, for near her sat three
fish-hawks piping away in the same fashion. Leo was about
to stop and take a shot at one of them, but Kate intreated him
to let the bird alone, and we rowed on, leaving him and his
companions piping away to their hearts' content. Presently
we saw a moderately-sized bird, like a plover, darting here and
there, and uttering a peculiar sound. "Tinc—tinc—tinc,"
cried Leo; "what is that you say?" Presently a white-
necked raven, which was sitting on a stump some way down,
flew off, shrieking with fear, as the plover pursued it.
"Well, that is a coward," said Leo. "He is running away
from a bird half his size."
"Very wise," observed Jack. "Timbo, when he was out
with me the other day, told me they call him the 'hammering
iron,' on account of his "Tinc—tinc—tinc' cry. But it is
not his cry which makes the raven fly off. He has got a sharp
spur on his shoulder, just like that on the heel of a cock, and
he could dig it into the raven, and soon draw its life-blood."
On went the plover to a bank a little way ahead, where it
pitched on what we thought at that distance was a log of
wood. As we paddled up the seeming log turned into a huge
crocodile basking in the sun.
"Stop paddling," I cried to the boys. "Let us see what
the plover is about."
It ran along the back of the reptile, but stopped on the top
of its snout, and then with perfect fearlessness actually flew
down into its gaping mouth. I then recollected an account
I had read of a bird on the Nile of that description, which

not we could not tell, but presently the crocodile appeared to
rouse itself up and to crawl towards the water, into which he
plunged, diving down out of sight.
"There goes Master Tinc-tinc-tinc flying away. I sup-
pose he will go and warn his other friends," said Jack. ." That
is his business, so Timbo says; and when these birds are about
you can never get a shot at a crocodile."
As we continued paddling on we were convinced that they
had been warned of our approach, for they all betook them-

273
selves to the water long before we got near them. Proceeding,
we reached a part of the river where the banks were steep and
composed of sand. Presently we saw a creature crawling out
of the water, and making its way up the bank.
" What creature can that be?" asked Natty.
"A water-turtle!" I exclaimed; for I recognized it from
the descriptions I had seen of it.
Presently it came to a steep part of the bank, and as it was
climbing up it fell, and lay helpless on its back.
" We will make prize of him," cried Jack. "Paddle away,
boys."
We were soon up to the bank, when Jack sprang out of the
canoe, and before the turtle could recover itself he had seized
it in bis arms and placed it in the bottom of the canoe. There
the creature lay utterly helpless. While the canoe's bows were
on the shore, Chico, who had got tired of sitting so long in
one position, made a spring on to the land to pick some fruit
which grew on a low bush at no great distance. The boys
were so interested in watching the turtle that, without seeing
that Chico was absent, they shoved off, and had already got to
some little distance when they discovered that we had left one
of our company behind. Chico, having filled his paws with
fruit, ran down the bank.
Hillo, old fellow !" exclaimed Jack, " we will come in for
you."
The current, however, just then took the canoe's head, and
we drifted some way down before we could turn back. At
that instant we saw a ripple in the water, and presently the
huge head of a crocodile was projected above it. The monster
darted forward; and poor Chico, before he was aware of his
danger, was seized by its huge jaws. In vain we cried out and
shrieked at the top of our voices. The crocodile had got hold
of its prey. Chico struggled, but he was as helpless as a

mouse in the fangs of a cat. "Oh, save him, save him!"
shrieked out Bella; but it was too late. Though the boys
paddled with might and main, before they reached the shore
the crocodile sank beneath the surface, dragging the poor ape
with him. A little circle alone marked the spot where it had
gone down.
"There is one who will pay you off for that," cried Jack,
looking into the water as if in search of the crocodile. " When
Igubo hears of it he will be after you, depend on it."
We all felt sad at the loss of our pet, and much as we had
enjoyed the early part of the trip, it certainly spoiled the plea-
sure of the remainder.
"Pour Chico !" exclaimed Natty every now and then. "I
little thought you would come to so untimely an end."
Bella cried outright, and Kate could scarcely restrain her
feelings. We now proceeded back to the landing-place, and
Jack and the boys having drawn up the canoe to the spot
where she usually lay concealed, we commenced our return
home. My young cousins and Natty assisted me up the hill.
We had got to about half the distance, when a loud roar came
from the thicket I have before mentioned. "Roar away!"
cried Jack, " you will not frighten us." Bella, and even Kate,
could not, however, help trembling at the sound; indeed, there
is something peculiarly terrific in the cry of the lion in his
native wilds. I trusted that he would confine himself to
roaring, and not attempt to approach nearer. The boys and
Jack looked to their guns.
"We will be ready for him if he dares to show his face," cried
Jack. "Now, you young gentlemen fire first, if he looks as if he
was going to attack us. I will keep my fire in case you miss."
The lion, however, allowed us to gain our home, where we
found David and Timbo looking out for us, and ready to fire
at the beast should he approach.

A WATER-TURTLE COOKED.
"But where Chico ?" cried Timbo when he saw us. Jack
told him what had happened. "When I tell Igubo, he soon
punish crocodile," he said. "Igubo great crocodile hunter."
"But what have you there, Jack ?" asked David, as he saw
the turtle which Jack had brought up on his back. "Well,
you have indeed a prize, for the turtle will be a pleasant
addition to our bill of fare.
When the girls went to their hut, we examined the water-
turtle, which Timbo and Jack at once prepared for cooking.
Opening it, we found that it had upwards of thirty eggs in its
body. The shells were flexible, and the same size at both
ends, like those of the crocodile.
"Dis make one bery fine dish," said Timbo, "and de liber is
first-rate. We hab it ready for when de captain come back."
"We must leave the charge of cooking it to you," said
David, " for I doubt whether my sisters will understand the
art so well."
Part of the turtle was cooked, and supper made ready, but
still our friends did not appear. Night drew on, and we
became somewhat anxious. At last David advised his sisters
to take supper and to return to their hut, while we sat up
waiting for the party. Hour after hour passed by, and still
they did not appear. At last David insisted on the boys
and I going to bed, while he and Jack and Timbo kept watch.
Every now and then we could hear the roar of the lion in the
distance, replied to by their loud shouts to scare him away.
I could only hope that my cousins were asleep: as for myself,
I could not close my eyes. Not a breath of wind was stirring,
not a sound was heard except that ominous roar which
occasionally broke the silence of night. At length David
came in, pretty well tired out, and lay down, saying that Jack
had undertaken to keep the morning watch. I also, in spite
of my anxiety, at last fell asleep. I awoke suddenly with the

A NIGHT ALARM.
sound of the lion's roar in my ears. It seemed far louder and
nearer than before. Could it be fancy? The morning light
was streaming in through an opening over the door, which we
had left to admit air. Again I heard that fearful roar. I started
up, for it seemed to be in the very midst of our camp. I thought
of my young cousins and the boys, who were likely enough
to have gone out early. I sprang to the opening, and there I
saw, in the very midst of the cattle-yard, an enormous lion, his
head lifted up proudly, while his huge paws were placed on
one of the animals he had struck down. Never had I seen so
magnificent a creature—his vast mane covering his neck and
shoulders, while his tail waved to and fro as a signal of
defiance, looking up as if he saw an enemy approaching. The
other animals, terror-stricken, were trying to force their way
out of the yard. I could see no one. What had become of
Jack and Timbo I could not tell. They could not have
deserted their posts, for both had given too many proofs of
courage to make me suppose so. Calling to David, who was
yet sleeping soundly, I seized my gun; but when I returned,
the lion had gone, with the animal he had struck down.
David and I rushed out of the hut. At that moment there
were several shots. Looking out in the direction from which
the roars had previously come, I saw the lion bounding away
along the hill, still apparently unwounded.
"Has he gone? has he gone?" I heard Leo and Natty
shouting out. "Yes, yes! and he has carried off our little
gemsbok !"
"But where are Jack and Timbo?" I asked. "How was
it they let the creature come in ?"
" They heard some shots in the distance, and thinking that
they were fired as signals by Stanley and his party, they were
just setting off to meet them, and the lion must have taken
that opportunity of coming into our camp. They had not got

far, and must have caught sight of the lion as he was making
his escape. It is a mercy the girls are safe !"
As they were speaking, Jack and Timbo came back.
" Well, I never did think he was going to play us so scurvy
a trick," exclaimed Jack, "or we would not have left the
camp. But what do you fancy those shots can mean, Mr.
Crawford ?"
Both David and I agreed, however, that they were
probably fired by Stanley or his companions, either at some
animals, or as a signal to give us notice of their return; and
we therefore begged Jack and Timbo to proceed as they had
purposed, while we remained on the watch for the lion, should
he venture to come back. Kate and Bella now came out of
their hut, and great was their grief at hearing of the loss of
one of their pets—the most promising, indeed, of all, for in a
few days it had become so thoroughly tame, that it would
follow them about like a lamb. They, like us, had been kept
awake the greater part of the night, and, owing to this, had
not been aroused by the sound of the lion's voice ; indeed, the
events I have described occupied less time than I have taken
to write them. The boys now employed themselves in col-
lecting the trembling animals, who had not yet recovered from
the fright which the appearance of their dread enemy had
given them. The little koodoo and zebra had, however, been
safe in their pen, or they would probably have run off, and we
should have seen no more of them.
"I did not fancy that a lion could have leaped so high a
palisade," said David;" but I see we must take other measures
to secure our camp for the future. I believe that even a lion
cannot break through an enclosure of prickly pear, and I pro-
pose that as soon as Stanley comes back we all set to work to
surround our camp with a thick line of it; and if we fasten a
fringe of its sharp leaves to the top of our fence, we shall be

able to bid defiance to either lion or leopard. I doubt, indeed!
if elephants, or even human beings, would willingly assail such
a fortification as ours will then be."
I fully agreed with David, and we settled that we woule
immediately set to work and collect the cactus plants which
grew in abundance on the hill-side.
" They will be very hungry when they do come back," said
Kate," and therefore, Bella, you and I will prepare breakfast
for them forthwith."
David and I assisted them in getting the repast ready, an:!
our anxiety was shortly relieved by Leo running in exclaiming
that Stanley and all hands were coming up the hill. "They
have got no end of game," he added—"birds and beasts enough
to feed us all for a month to come, if we were in Siberia and
could freeze the meat and keep it till we want it, instead of
being in the middle of Africa. Unless we can salt it pretty
quickly, however, it will not be fit for much by to-morrow
morning."
Having thus delivered himself, he ran out again, and down
the hill. In a short time our friends arrived, pretty well tirel
out, however, for they had been to a long distance, and found it
impossible to reach home the night they had intended. They
had therefore encamped a few miles off, and started again at
dawn. The shots we had heard had, as we supposed, been
fired by them to give us notice of their approach. They had
pushed on without stopping for breakfast, and were duly
grateful to Kate and Bella for enabling them thus speedily to
satisfy their hunger.
Stanley said he had a long account to give us of their
adventures. They had fallen in with a native village, the
inhabitants of which appeared to be inclined to be friendly,
and had invited them to join in a grand hunting expedition,
"I will tell you all about it as soon as I have eaten something,"

said Stanley. "But what is this I hear of a visit from a lion?
Did the brute actually dare to leap into the midst of our camp
and carry off one of its inmates ? It shall not be the fault of

STANLEY'S ADVENTURES AMONG THE PEOPLE OF KABOMBA.

A

PE were, of course, eager to hear Stanley's adven-
tures.
"Finding the day tolerably cool, though I
doubt if our friends in England would have called
it so, we pushed on further south than we have ever
gone before," said Stanley. "The country, though
wooded in parts, was generally open, and we had little diffi-
culty in making our way across the prairie. I have never seen
- such large herds of buffaloes, zebras, gnus, rhinoceroses, and
giraffes. Had we been mounted, we should have had no diffi-
culty in coming up with them, but on foot it was a very dif-
ferent matter. Often, as we got up to them, almost within
range of our rifles, they were off again, leaving us standing
alone, without a hope of overtaking them. As the sun rose
higher and grew hotter, the buffaloes and rhinoceroses retired
to their coverts, as did many of the other animals, the zebras
and giraffes alone defying the sun's rays. I now hoped, by
keeping under shelter of the woods, we might the more easily
surprise some of the animals we were in search of. Before
proceeding further, however, I proposed that we should open
our wallets and dine; and having selected a shady spot under a
tree at a little distance from the forest, where there was less

283
probability of our being surprised by any prowling leopard or
hungry lion, we formed our noonday camp. We had not sat
long, when Mango came in and told us that he had seen the
head of a buffalo projecting from the forest at some little dis-
tance, and that he was sure there must be several there. I
had been so annoyed at not killing anything, that, without
finishing my dinner, I set off with Mango to try and reach the
spot unobserved by our expected prey. We at once got under
shelter of the wood, and worked our way along through the
borders of the forest, hoping to get up to the spot without dis-
turbing the herd. Mango at length made me understand by
signs that we had now reached the place where he had seen the
buffalo. I can tell you they are very different animals from those
we met with further to the north. These are pictures of
brute strength and ferocity, their horns, short and curling, but
pointed like daggers, meeting at the roots, where they form a
thick mass, serving as a helmet to the animal. I was afraid of
coming suddenly upon them, for I knew that if startled they
would be off before I could obtain a shot. Mango was positive
that we were near them. He suggested at last that we should
climb a tree, whence we might survey the neighbourhood.
Finding one, we mounted it, and when I had got a steady foot-
ing, I looked round me, hoping to discover the animals. Not
a living creature, however, stirred. At last my companion
pointed out some dark objects just seen indistinctly through
the thick foliage. They were the backs of the buffaloes, I had
little doubt. I fired, but nothing moved, and I could not help
supposing that I had mistaken some large stone for a living
creature. To settle the matter, I again loaded and fired. At
the report of the gun, half-a-dozen superb male buffaloes sprang
to their feet, and, tossing their heads, sniffed the air for a few
seconds, and darted off through the wood. My companion and
I immediately descended the tree, and I made chase in the hopes

of coming up with them by following their tracks. We pro-
ceeded for some little way along the borders of the forest, when
Mango stopping, pointed ahead, and I saw a vast herd of buf-
faloes—there might have been nearly three hundred of them
suddenly rushing out of the wood, overthrowing and stamping
down every object they met with in their headlong course. We
rushed back towards the wood, where alone we could hope for
safety. A portion of it projected some way at an angle from
that part whence the buffaloes had issued. They espied tis,
however, and came tearing on across the open. We dashed in
among the underwood, but before we had got far they were at
our heels. Two savage brutes led the way. The horns of
the first were almost into poor Mango. A tree with low
branches was near me. It would afford us the only prospect
of safety. Had I stopped for a moment to fire, it would have
been too late, and it might not have served to turn them in
their course. I sprang to the tree, helping up the boy, who
had barely time to get out of the way of the leader's horns,
when the herd rushed by us. I turned round and fired, bart.
having to cling to the tree, I had great difficulty in taking
aim. The effect of the report was to bring the whole herd to
a halt, and, facing round, they confronted us in one dark and
formidable phalanx, as if they had resolved to besiege us in
our tree. I remembered the way you, Andrew, had been
caught by the elephant, and I fancied that the buffaloes were
about to treat us in the same manner. One or two buffaloes
might have been disposed of, but we had not ammunition
sufficient to kill one half of our assailants, even should each
bullet lay one low. They kept looking at us with sapage
glances, as if determined to punish us for our audacity. They
looked, indeed, as if they could very easily have brought the
tree in which we were perched down to the ground; and se
they might, if they had known how to do it. I, however, re

solved to try the effect of a few shots. I fired one, and felt
sure I had hit the animal—a large bull—but he did not move.
Again and again I fired, but, strange as it may seem, neither
he nor any of the herd moved a foot, though they eyed me and
my companion all the time with an ominous look, as if resolv-
ing how they should treat us. Every moment I expected
them to charge. Suddenly, as I was about to fire for the
fourth or fifth time, the whole herd, wheeling about with a
curious shriek rather than a bellow, their heads lowered to the
ground, and their tails swishing to and fro vehemently over
their backs, off they set at a furious pace, which made the very
ground tremble under their feet. Mango and I were left to
follow them if we chose, or return to camp. We did the latter.
I must confess I felt somewhat ashamed of my want of success
when I resumed my seat by the fire. I consoled myself, how-
ever, with a couple of pigeons which Igubo had in the mean-
time roasted. Though we saw vast quantities of game of all
sorts, we were equally unsuccessful, and at length I proposed
to return, when Igubo pointed out some smoke rising over a
belt of forest which appeared before us. He said that he was
sure it arose from a native village, and as I was anxious to
make the acquaintance of our neighbours, I resolved to push
forward and visit them. I sent Igubo on ahead to win the con-
fidence of the people by showing them that he was unarmed.
He soon made a signal to us to come on, and I found him and
the chief man apparently on the most friendly terms. The
chief, a remarkably stout black, wore a scanty petticoat, with a
fillet of crocodile's teeth round his head, a similar ornament on
his neck, and bracelets on his arms. He was attended by a
drummer, who, as I approached, beat with might and main to
do me honour. His followers were armed with shields made
of reeds, very cleverly woven, sufficiently long to protect the
whole body and legs, and about three feet broad. At their

backs hung quivers of iron-headed arrows, and two short broad-
swords were slung to their sides. The chief invited us into
his hut. It was of good size, with a verandah in front. In a
short time his wife and her attendants brought a large mess of
manioc flour and some pieces of cooked meat, but what it was
I did not at first inquire. After eating some, Igubo told me
that it was zebra's flesh. In a hut opposite the chief's house,
I observed the figure of an animal. On examining it I found
that it was formed of grass, plastered over with soft clay.
The eyes consisted of two cowry shells; and a number of
bristles, which appeared to be taken from elephants'tails,
formed a sort of frill round the neck. It was more like a
crocodile than any other animal; but Igubo inquiring, was told
that it was a lion, though certainly it was very little like the
king of beasts. On further inquiries, I found that it was the
principal idol, or fetich, of the inhabitants, and that when the
chief or any of the people are ill, their fetich men, or priests,
assemble before it, and pray and beat drums, either to pro-
pitiate it or to arouse its attention, that it may drive away the
evil spirits which they believe are the cause of the malady."
"Poor people, dey know no better," observed Timbo; for,
with the privilege of an old servant, he did not scruple to join
in our conversation at all times. "I go and talk to dem and
tell dem better t'ings. I tell dem dat dere is one God who
lubs dem, and when dey are ill dat dey pray to him. Dat he
hear dem, when de fetich hab no ears to hear, and no way
to do dem good."
"Oh yes, Timbo," said Natty, "I should like to go with
you to those poor savages. It is sad to think that they should
be so ignorant. I am sure it is our duty to try to tell them
the truth."
"Yes, Massa Natty, we will go, please God," cried Timbo,
looking at Natty with a glance of approbation.

" Timbo and I must beg your pardon for interrupting you,
Captain Hyslop," said Natty. "Pray go on."
"Unfortunately, I could not understand their language suf-
ficiently well to enter into such matters," observed Stanley.
"I was going to say that their village was surrounded by
palisades, very similar to those we have seen. The people
were clothed in even more scanty garments than usual. On
finding that we came without any hostile intentions, and were
more likely to give than receive of them, they cordially wel-
comed us. They were in a state of commotion, nearly the
whole village being prepared to turn out on a grand hunt.
When they understood that we also were hunters, they invited
us to accompany them. They had been forming for some
time past a huge trap, called a hopo, about three or four miles
away, near a stream in the neighbourhood, at which large
numbers of game were accustomed to assemble. As the nar-
row end was toward the village, we were able to examine it on
our way. The hopo consists of two hedges formed of stakes
and boughs driven into the ground at a considerable distance
from each other, toward the end opening into the wild part of
the country where animals are likely to be found, and closing
in toward each other till they almost approach. They then
form a narrow passage, some sixty yards long, at the end of
which a pit is dug, eight or ten feet deep, and fifteen or more
in length and breadth. We found that trunks of trees were
laid across the two ends, to prevent the animals which leap in
from scrambling out again, which they would otherwise very
easily do. The pit itself was also surrounded by high palisades,
bound together by cross-pieces. Thus it formed a complete
trap, from which it seemed almost impossible that any animals
which have once entered could escape. The hole was likewise
covered over with a sort of matting of green rushes, which con-
cealed the pit below. As I and my dark-skinned companions

A HOPO DESCRIBED.
proceeded along the hedge, I thought we should never come to
the end of it. I calculated, indeed, that the hedges were upwards
of a mile long, and the same distance apart at their extremities.
The hunters now extended themselves, each man keeping
within sight of the other, forming a circle round the broad
entrance of the hopo of four or five miles in extent, thus sur-
rounding a large area. I could see within it immense numbers
of animals, giraffes, zebras, buffaloes, gnus, pallas, rhinoceroses,
hartbeests, and, indeed, all sorts of deer, large and small. At a
signal from their chief, which was passed along the line, they
began to close in, shouting and shrieking at the top of their
voices. On we went, the semicircle gradually decreasing, till
we were within speaking distance of each other; and every mile
we advanced the animals appeared to grow thicker and thicker,
and I could count a dozen or more creatures of different
species in sight at the same moment. Now a herd of a dozen
buffaloes, now tweniy zebras and as many cameleopards might
be seen scampering over the plain, followed by numerous stein-
boks or koodoos, graceful oryxes or hartbeests leaping and
bounding away before them. Now and then some of the
animals would turn round and charge their pursuers, who fled
on either side, darting their spears and often transfixing them.
The zebras were amongst the most difficult to drive in. They
seemed aware of their danger, and now one, open-mouthed,
would charge at a hunter, who had to defend himself with his
shield; and then a whole herd would break away, and, dashing
through the cordon, gallop back to their native wilds. Still
numbers were driven on. Buffaloes and giraffes were flying
together, all fancying that they were escaping a common dan-
ger, while rushing on to destruction. At last the hedges of
the hopo were reached, and on the outer side numerous hunters
were stationed, shouting, and shrieking, and shaking their
spears and shields, still further to increase the confusion of thé

A DISGUSTING SPECTACLE.
291,
terror-stricken animals. When any of them approached the
hedge, a well-aimed spear was planted in their sides, the cries of
the stricken animals increasing the terror of the rest. On
pressed the hunters, driving the game closer and closer together,
till, pressed up in one dense mass, even the most wary could
no longer attempt to turn and fly. Fearful was the din of
the shrieks and shouts which rent the welkin. The leading
animals dashed madly forward, thinking to escape from their
foes behind. The remainder followed, unable to see over the
heads of those in front, but hoping that they had found a way
to escape.
" By Igubo's advice, I had gone on the outside ; for, in truth,
the line of hunters which pressed on through the hopo was
exposed to no little danger from the maddened beasts, which
even now occasionally turning round, dashed through them,
and the greatest activity alone could have saved the men from
being trampled on by the terrified animals. Now a huge buf-
falo would leap into the pit through the slender covering of
rushes; now a tall giraffe would go toppling over; an active
koodoo or gemsbok would spring over their heads, to fall hope-
lessly into the same trap. In a short time the whole pit was
filled with a living, moving, struggling mass of animals, fearful
to look at. The savage hunters, wild with excitement, were
spearing with relentless eagerness the poor creatures, those
below being borne down by the weight of their hapless fellows
who brought up the rear. A beautiful koodoo was among the
latter. On it came, leaping away, having escaped the spears of
its enemies. It reached the fatal pit. I could not help feeling
an interest in the creature. Would it too be added to the
victims? It hesitated not a moment, but bounding over the
beams, seemed scarcely to touch the animals below, as with a
spring it cleared the opposite side. In vain the hunters darteil
their spears. Off it dashed like the wind, and the satisfaction

I felt at its escape made some amends to me for the misery and
suffering I had beheld. I literally turned sick with horror,
and hope I may never witness such a scene again. The
savages, however, seemed to consider it magnificent sport, and
stood over the pit plunging their spears into any animal which
appeared moving. So far I was thankful, as it put them out

293
of their misery. The hunters did not altogether escape. Some
got severe kicks; several had been knocked over and trampled
on, in spite of their activity. They had succeeded, however, in
driving upwards of forty animals into the pit; for, of course,
of those which had been first assembled, a large number had
escaped, while a good many had been speared to death before
reaching it, and others had escaped into the wilds with spears
in their sides, there in most instances to die miserably. Their
success put our new friends in excellent humour. They
shouted, and shrieked, and danced as they hauled up the
animals one by one out of the hopo, and eagerly commenced
cutting them up and dividing the flesh. All was meat for their
pots—the zebra and giraffe, as well as the buffalo and deer.
" It was nearly evening before the work was over. They
pressed us to remain to see another on the following day, but I
had had enough of it, and more than enough, indeed. I do
not know how the case would have been if I had been very
hungry and wanted food. Probably I might have experienced
some of the satisfaction which our savage friends did. Igubo
and his sons were highly delighted at the number of animals
caught, at the same time he acknowledged that the way among
his own people of catching game was far less cruel. Further
to the north, large nets are spread round the trunks of trees,
towards which the animals are driven, much in the manner I
have just described. The nets, however, only serve for smaller
animals, as large ones would break through them. People are
stationed behind the trees to spear any creature of larger size
which seems likely to break the nets.
"Our friends pressed on us some of the meat, which, as we
had a few articles to give in exchange, we accepted, and parted
very excellent friends.
" As I had no wish to spend a night in their huts, we pushed
on as far as we could homewards, and did not stop while a

MANGO IN A PIT.
ray of sunlight enabled us to see our way. We were pretty
well tired with our day's exertions, but it was necessary to
light fires, not only to cook our supper, but to guard ourselves
against visits from any of the lions or hyenas which might
be prowling about. We all therefore set to work to collect
wood as fast as we could. While thus employed, I heard
young Mango cry out; but on looking round in the direction
where I had last seen him, he was nowhere visible. A dread
seized me that a lion had carried him off; but again I heard
him cry out, and on hurrying forward I was very nearly going
head over heels into a deep pit, into which he had fallen. I
shouted out to Igubo, who came to my assistance; and with the
help of our belts we hauled him up. Mango's chief alarm had
arisen from the dread of finding some animal at the bottom. I
was very glad, when we drew him up, to discover that, except-
ing a few slight bruises, he was none the worse for his tumble.
" As may be supposed, we were cautious after this how we
moved about, for we well knew that where one pit-fall hal
been formed, probably many more existed in the neighbour-
hood. We were glad when at last we had collected a sufficient
supply of wood to last us through the night; and I almost
fell asleep while putting the meat and cassa va bread into my
mouth. We had placed our packs by our sides, using some
logs of timber for our pillows. Igubo had promised to keep the
first watch ; and so he did, I have no doubt, to the best of his
ability. When, however, I at length awoke, I saw the fire
very low, though there was just flame enough to cast its light
on a creature stealthily creeping up towards us. I expected
the next instant to be engaged in deadly combat with a pan-
ther or a lion. I sprang to my feet, seizing my rifle and
calling to my companions. The next moment I saw that the
creature was a jackal, and scarcely worthy of a shot. Still
undaunted, he was on the point of seizing one of the packs

nearest to him, when I hove a log of wood at his head. On
this he beat a retreat, uttering a mocking shout of laughter-
so it seemed to me—and quickly disappeared. The alarm he
had caused prevented us wishing again to go to sleep; and
well it was we did not, for directly afterwards the roar of
a lion broke the silence of night. Igubo threw more logs
on the fire, and as the flames burst up we saw two or three
huge monsters stalking round us, but afraid to approach.
Now they came near enough for the light of the fire to shine
on them ; but directly afterwards, even before I could get my
rifle ready to shoot, they had disappeared in the dark shades
of the surrounding trees or bushes.
" As soon as it was daylight, we once more commenced our
march. We had not gone far, when the two boys, who were
a little in advance, came rushing back with countenances of
dismay, to let us understand that they had suddenly come
upon some huge beast which was on the point of springing on
them. We advanced, in consequence, cautiously, expecting
every moment to meet the monster. In a short time we caught
sight of a gigantic tiger-wolf, or spotted hyena, sitting under
a bush, and growling fiercely at us. I raised my rifle to fire,
expecting the beast to spring ; but it sat without moving.
On getting nearer, what was my horror to see that his fore-
paws and the skin and flesh of the legs had been gnawed away!
Still he showed his savage nature by endeavouring to crawl
towards us. To put an end to his sufferings, I fired at his
head, when he sank to the ground; and Igubo, running up to
him, seized him by the tail, and struck him several times with
his knife, though it was not until after repeated blows that an
end was put to the creature's existence. How he had been thus
mangled, I could not at first understand, till Igubo asserted
that it had been done by a lion; that probably they had quar-
relled over their prey, and that then the lion had attacked him

and mangled him in the dreadful manner I have described.
IIad we not found him, he would certainly have died miser-
ably in the course of another day or two, and very likely have
fallen a victim to an army of soldier-ants.
"We met with several other adventures during the day, and
managed somehow or other to lose our way, or we should
have reached home before nightfall. Contrary to our inten-
tions, we had therefore to camp out for another night. We had
an ample supply of food, but no water could be found, and we
had little more than a couple of pints to divide among us,
which, though it might have been sufficient to supply an old
lady with a cup of tea, was but little to satisfy the thirsty
throats of travellers in this burning clime."
When Stanley heard of the attack made by the lion on our
camp, he declared that he must set out at once and put a stop
to his depredations. After a consultation, however, with
Igubo, he agreed to wait till the evening, when they supposed
the lion would go down to a spot near the river to drink.
It was a small creek, rather, where the banks were sufficiently
low and hard to allow the animals to reach the water without
difficulty, which they could not do at many places along the
borders of the lake on account of the wide fringe of reeds and
thick underwood which encircled it.
"Is the gemsbok the only animal we have lost ?"
"Oh no, indeed," cried Leo. "Poor Chico is gone!"
"What! did the lion carry him off ?" asked Stanley.
"Oh no. A horrid monster of a crocodile," answered
Leo. "I wish we could punish the brute."
Igubo seemed to understand what was said. "I do it," he
remarked.
"Yes," said Timbo; " he say he kill crocodile; no 'fraid of
Crocodile !"


## p. 297 (#301) ############################################

IGUBO'S ATTACK ON THE CROCODILE.
297
How he was going to manage it, however, he did not in-
form us.
As may be supposed, Stanley dropped to sleep over his
breakfast, and was glad directly afterwards to go to bed.
Igubo and his boys followed his example ; but after a few
hours' rest, they again appeared, as fresh as if they had not
been undergoing severe exertion for a couple of days under
an African sun.
"You come and see Igubo kill de crocodile," I heard Timbo
say to Leo and Natty.
Igubo had provided himself with a piece of one of the
animals which he had brought home, and which had become no
longer eatable. He had fastened it to the end of a long rope,
and his sons carried it down to the water. Timbo and Jack,
with the two boys, set off after them; and, taking my rifle, I
followed to see what would happen.
On reaching the river, Igubo threw in the meat as far as he
could, fastening the end of the rope to the trunk of a tree.
Then, on his making a sign to us to hide ourselves, we retired
behind some bushes. In a short time the rope was violently
tugged, and Igubo, throwing off his scanty garments, drew his
sharp knife from its sheath, and sprang into the water. I
could not refrain from crying out, and entreating him to come
back; but he paid no heed to me, and swam on. Presently
he disappeared, and I felt horror-struck at the thought that
a crocodile had seized him; but directly afterwards the snout
of the huge monster appeared above the water, Igubo rising at
the same time directly behind it. The creature, instead of
attempting to turn, made towards the bank, at a short dis-
tance off. Igubo followed; and I saw his hand raised, and his
dagger descended into the side of the creature. Still the
crocodile did not attempt to turn, but directly afterwards
reaching the bank, climbed up it. Igubo followed, and again

plunged his knife into the monster's side. Every instant I
expected to see him seized by its terrific jaws; but the creature
seemed terror-stricken, and made no attempt at defence. Again
and again the black plunged in his knife, while the crocodile
vainly endeavoured to escape. The next instant Igubo was
on its back, and the creature lay without moving. A few
minutes only had passed. It opened its vast jaws, each time
more languidly than before, till at length it sank down, and,
after a few struggles, was evidently dead. Igubo, springing
up, flourished his knife over his head in triumph. Jack, run-
ning to the canoe, began to launch it. We all jumped in, and
paddled off to the bank, Timbo bringing the rope with him.
We fastened it round the crocodile's neck, and towed the body
in triumph to the shore, up which we hauled it.
"Igubo say we find eggs not far off," said Timbo.
Mango and his brother, at a sign from their father, began at
once hunting about, and in a short time called us to them.
There was a large hole in the bank concealed by overhanging
bushes. It was full of eggs, about the size of those of a goose.
On counting them we found no less than sixty. The shell
was white and partially elastic, both ends being exactly the
same size. The nest was about four yards from the water.
A pathway led up to it; and Igubo told Timbo, that after the
crocodile has deposited her eggs, she covers them up with about
four feet of earth, and returns afterwards to clear it away, and
to assist the young out of the shells. After this, she leads
them to the water, where she leaves them to catch small fish
for themselves. At a little distance was another nest, from
which the inmates had just been set free; and on a sandbank
a little way down we caught sight of a number of the little
monsters crawling about. They appeared in no way afraid
of us as we approached, and Mango and his brother speared
• several. They were about ten inches long, with yellow eyes, the

pupil being merely a perpendicular slit. They were marked with
transverse stripes of pale green and brown, about half an inch in
width. Savage little monsters they were, too; for though their
teeth were but partly developed, they turned round and bit at
the weapon darted at them, uttering at the same time a sharp
yelp like that of a small puppy when it first tries to bark.
Igubo could not say whether the mother crocodile eats up her
young occasionally, though, from the savage character of the
creature, I should think it very likely that she does, if pressed
by hunger. As is well known, the Ichneumon has the repu-
tation on the banks of the Nile of killing young crocodiles ;
but Igubo did not know whether they ever do so in this part
of the world. He and his boys collected all the eggs they
could find, declaring that they were excellent for eating. They
however told us that they should only consume the yoke, as
the white of the egg does not coagulate. When it is known
what a vast number of eggs a crocodile lays, it may be sup-
posed that the simplest way of getting rid of the creatures is
to destroy them before they are hatched. It would seem
almost hopeless to attempt to exterminate them by killing
only the old ones. However, I fancy they have a good many
enemies, and that a large number of the young do not grow
up.
As we were walking along the bank, we saw, close to the
water, a young crocodile just making his way into it; and
Mango, leaping down, captured the little creature. Even then
it showed its disposition by attempting to bite his fingers.
On examining it, we found a portion of yoke, almost the size
of a hen's egg, fastened by a membrane to the abdomen ; and
when we afterwards carried it up to David, he told us that he
had no doubt it was left there as a supply of nourishment, to
enable the creature to support existence till it was strong
enough to catch fish for itself. Igubo declared that they : .

caught the fish by means of their broad scaly tails. The
eggs, I should say, had a strong internal membrane, and a
small quantity only of lime in their composition.
We had some difficulty in inducing our friends to believe
the account we gave them of Igubo's exploit. He however
undertook, if they were not satisfied, to kill a crocodile in the
same way another day.

Kate. "It is far too perilous; and though he may succeed
once or twice, some day another crocodile may come in support
of its companion and carry him off." .
Igubo only laughed when this was said to him. He had
killed crocodiles in that way since he was a boy, and there was
no reason why he should not do so as long as he was able to
swiin.
While speaking of crocodiles, I should observe that the
family of huge saurians, to which the monsters belong, is
divided into three genera : Alligator is peculiar to America ;
Crocodilus is common both to the Old and New World; while
a third, Gavialis, is found in the Ganges and other rivers on
the continent of India. They differ in appearance from each
other, but their habits in most respects are similar. The true
crocodile, however, frequents occasionally the mouths of large
rivers where the salt water enters, and it has been known to
swim between different islands at considerable distances from
each other. I believe that at the commencement of my
journal I have sometimes inadvertently written alligator in-
stead of crocodile, when speaking of the monsters we en-
countered so frequently.

CHAPTER XIV.
STANLEY GAINS CREDIT AMONG THE NATIVES AS A LION-KILLER.

MM AGAIN during the night the roar of the lion was
WA Y heard. It put Stanley in a perfect fever; but
David persuaded him not to go out and attempt to
shoot the creature, as he was completely knocked
en up by the exertion of the previous days. The rest
of us employed our time in collecting the prickly
pear for fortifying our post, as David had proposed. It was no
easy matter, however, to cut the plants down.
"If we were to throw a rope over them, and draw the leaves
on one side, we might do it," said Natty.
"A good suggestion," I observed.
We carried it out. While the grown-up members of the
party cut down the armed plants, the boys with ropes dragget
them in large bundles up to the camp, round which we began
to form with them a broad belt. It was hard work; but as there
were numerous plants growing about, we had not far to go.
We were encouraged to persevere by the assurance that our
fortress would thus be almost impregnable to the attacks of
wild animals. We yet further secured it by driving in stakes
pointed at both ends outside the belt, which thus answered the
purpose of a dry ditch, only it was more difficult even than a
ditch would have been for unprotected feet to cross over.

A LUMP OF FEATHERS.
305
At daylight next morning we continued our work, and had
made considerable progress before the heat of the sun com-
pelled us for agtime to knock off. We had three fires lighted
in the centre of our yard, and this probably prevented the
lion making another attack, which he might otherwise
have done. I was now so far recovered that I was able to
accompany David and the boys on short shooting excursions.
Although I never took pleasure in slaughtering animals for
mere sport, yet it was necessary to kill them for the sake of
supplying ourselves with food. The hills above the house
swarmed with rock-rabbits, with which we could at all times
plentifully supply our table. I had gone out the following
morning with the two boys, keeping, of course, a careful look.
out, lest a lion might still be in the neighbourhood, when Leo
cried out, pointing to a rock above us,-
" See, see! what a curious lump of feathers is up there!"
"What you suppose to be a lump of feathers bas, I suspect,
a head and wings and claws attached to them," said David.
"If I mistake not, that is a bacha, a sort of falcon. Pro-
bably he is on the look-out for rock-rabbits, and he is hiding
his head between his shoulders and crouching down that
they may not discover him, but his sharp eyes are watch-
ing every movement of his prey. Before long, if we re-
main quiet, we shall see him pounce down on one of them
should they venture out of their holes. The Dutch, I re-
member, call these rock-rabbits klipdachs. Poor creatures,
they have good reason to be on their guard against the bacha.
While he is there we are not likely to get a shot at one, for,
cunning as he is, depend upon it some of the older ones have
found out that he is in the neighbourhood."
We watched for some time. Now and then we saw a
klipdach pop out of its hole, but presently draw back again,
having caught sight of its powerful foe. Now another would

BACHA AND KLIPDACH.
come out, but hide away in its cave very quickly. Still the
bacha remained without moving. He knew that in time the
poor silly little klipdachs would grow careless, and, anxious
for a game at play, would get too far from their homes to skip
back before he could be down upon them. Presently what
David said took place. First one klipdach appeared, and then
another began running about or nibbling the grass close to the
rocks, but it was clear that they were watching the bacha all
the time. Still he did not move, and they began to run
further and further out into the open ground. Then two or
three came out together, and began leaping and frisking about.
Presently the hitherto immovable bacha leaped off the rock,
spreading wide its huge wings, and like a flash of lightning
from a thunder-cloud darted down on a klipdach on which it
had fixed its keen eye. In vain the unfortunate klipdach
attempted to leap away. The bacha had cunningly noted the
road it came. In an instant it was in its claws, the poor little
creature screaming with terror. So rapid was its flight, that
even if we had wished it we could not have killed the bird.
Off it went to the pinnacle of the rock from whence it had
descended, and there began tearing its proy, which, happily,
it soon must have put out of pain. Though we waited some
minutes, not another klipdach appeared, and we had to go on
some considerable way before we again caught sight of any
of the little creatures.
"Well," said David, "I do not know that it can matter
much to the poor klipdachs whether they are shot by us or
caught by the bacha, but at all events we will put them out of
their suffering as soon as possible. Yet I do not think we
ought to throw stones at him. He follows his nature, we
follow ours."
After shooting as many rabbits as we required (by-the-by,
their scientific name, David told me, is Hyrax capensis), we

made a circuit, and took our way home along the plain. Leo
ind Natty were a little in advance, when they came running
back saying they had seen a big snake, but before they could
shoot it it had got away. Whether venomous or not, of course
they could not tell, but Leo declared that, from its appearance,
he was nearly certain it was so. It was a somewhat sandy
open spot, though a few bushes were near, among which we
supposed the snake had hid itself. We of course advanced
carefully, when presently in the distance we saw running over
the ground a couple of curious-looking birds, with long legs
and a remarkable crest, which Leo declared looked like a
lawyer's wig. We bid ourselves behind a bush, and the birds,
not seeing us, came boldly on. On a nearer approach David
pointed out some feathers which seemed to stick out behind
the ear.
" They must be secretary birds," he whispered ; "known as
the Serpentarius cristatus. They are determined enemies of
serpents, and will attack the most venomous without fear.
The secretary bird is so called on account of that crest at the
back of his head, which looks something like a pen stuck be-
hind the ear. One might suppose, on account of his long legs,
that he should be classed among the cranes and storks, but his
curved beak and internal organization show that he belongs to
the falcon tribe. His feet are incapable of grasping, and thus
he runs along as we see over the sandy ground with a speed
which enables him to overtake the most active reptiles.
Presently we saw the birds dart off, and in another instant
a large snake rose up before them. One stood still, while the
other gave battle to the reptile. The serpent made every
attempt to get back to its home, but the bird each time sprang
before it with an active leap, and cut off its retreat. When-
ever the serpent turned, the bird again placed itself in its front.
At length the reptile, as if determined to try what courage

encountered it. For an instant the bird stopped, but it
was not for want of courage ; and spreading out its wings, it
covered itself with one of them, while with the other, which

was armed with horny protuberances like little clubs, it struck
the serpent a blow which knocked it over. Again and again
the serpent rose to receive the same treatment, till at length it
lay quiet on the grass. The bird instantly flew upon it, and
with one stroke of its powerful bill laid open its skull, and
then immediately pressing it to the ground with its feet, held
it fast. We were unable to see whether it swallowed the head
or not, for its companion catching sight of us, they ran off
with their prey to devour it at their leisure.
Curiously enough, we were to make the acquaintance of yet
another bird before we got home; for, proceeding onwards,
we caught sight of a zebra coming towards us. It advanced
but slowly, now stopping, now moving on a little way. When
it caught sight of us it turned round and attempted to go back.
We then saw that a shaft was sticking in its side, from which
the life-blood was flowing. It went on a little way, and then
down it sank on the ground. We had no doubt that it was
one of the creatures which had been speared at the hopo hunt
when Stanley was present, and having escaped, had wandered
thus far from its usual haunts. Scarcely had it disappeared,
when we saw coming from a distance a large flight of crows,
who with loud croakings descended to the ground. Presently
a number of kites and buzzards approached from far and near,
though an instant before not a bird was to be seen, and alighted
on the same spot. We hurried on, wishing to get a sight of
the spectacle ; but before we got up, David pointed out, high
above us in the air, a huge bird, which came wheeling round
in a spiral line, seemingly out of the sky, towards the same
spot.
"I know that fellow," he said ; "he is an oricus. He
builds his nest far up among the mountains, in the fissures of
rocks. He equals in size the famed condor of America, and if
we could kill one, we should find that across the wings when

zebra was seen by him probably long ago, and he knew well
that he must shortly become his prey."
While David was speaking, numerous other oricus de-
scended like the first. Their common name is the sociable
vulture— Vultur oricularis. By the time we got up to the
spot, the poor zebra was half torn to pieces by their powerful
claws. The oricus having satisfied their hunger, and carried
off what they required for their young, the buzzards ap-

MAN-EATING LIONS.

proached, followed in a short time by the crows, who quickly
denuded the bones of flesh.
On reaching home, we found that a stranger had arrived
from the nearest village to the north of us, which Stanley had
once visited. He came with a sad story. A young child had
strayed out from the village the previous morning, and had
been carried off by a lion, and the father and another man,
going in search of the animal, had not since returned ; but
evident signs had been discovered that they also had been
killed. A panic had seized the people, and they had sent to
ask our assistance to destroy their fierce assailant with our
guns. They knew well, from the way the lions attacked them,
that they were accustomed to human flesh, which, when once
a lion has tasted, it is said, he will always attempt again to
obtain. The poor people declared that there would be no
safety for them unless the lions were killed, for night after
night they would come, and no one would be able to go be-
yond their enclosures without the risk of being seized. The
difficulty was to find the lions, for they were as cunning as
ferocious, and the blacks declared that, by eating men's flesh,
they had obtained some of the sense of human beings.
"We will soon put that to the test," said Stanley, jumping
up. " Tell him, Igubo, if he will go with you and I, and
show us where we can fall in with the lion, we will soon give
an account of him."
The stranger expressed his gratitude, and Igubo at once con-
sented to accompany Stanley. I confess I felt somewhat unwill-
ing that he should go, for he would thus completely put him-
self in the power of the strangers, of whose honesty we had
had no proof. Igubo, however, fully believed them faithful, and
would, I was sure, not desert him. I proposed that we should
all go out in the day-time, and attempt to fall in with the lion
man-eaters; but the stranger black said that would be useless,

NIGHT EXPEDITION.
as they were sure to keep out of the way. He knew, however,
he told us, of a spot which they were likely to visit in the
early part of the night. It was a pool in a small stream which
ran into the river, where numerous wild animals came to drink.
"But, dear Stanley, what is the use of you exposing your-
self thus at night," said Kate. "The lions will surely visit
the village, and could you not shoot them when they come ?
At the spot the stranger speaks of, you will be surrounded
by ferocious creatures, and though you may kill one or two
of them, the others may set upon you, and your life may be
sacrificed."
Stanley laughed at the notion.
"In the first place, dear sister, the lions will not show them-
selves till some unfortunate person passes," he said. "Thus I
might have to wait day after day without killing one. Now,
our friend here declares that every night they go down to the
water, so that I am sure to meet them. Let us manage it, and
do not be afraid. We shall return in safety, and probably have
been of service to these poor people, by getting rid of their
savage enemies."
"Oh! let us accompany you," cried Leo and Natty. "We
will take care of Stanley," said Leo; "so do not be afraid,
Kate."
"Thank you; but the man-eaters might carry one of you
off," answered Stanley ; "so I must decline your company. I
would rather have my two black-skinned friends as companions,
for depend upon it they know more about the matter than any
one else."
"Massa," said Timbo," I ever go out shooting wid you. I
no take care of you ?"
" Yes, indeed you have," answered Stanley; "but I want
you now to stay at home and look after the camp. If there is
any risk, it is better that one should run it than both."

TIMBO'S SPRING-GUN.
313
This answer satisfied Timbo, and Stanley having partaken
of the supper which Kate and Bella insisted on preparing for
him, set off with Igubo and the stranger. They carried the
two best rifles, with a supply of powder and bullets. I found
that Jack and Timbo had been busily employed in manufactur-
ing a sort of infernal machine for the destruction of wild beasts.
They had selected a musket with a large bore, and they pro-
posed using this as a sort of spring-gun.. Jack told me that
while we had been away, a huge hyena had been seen in the
neighbourhood, and as they are cunning animals and not easily
overtaken, they thought it would be the best way of getting
rid of so dangerous a neighbour. There was still sufficient
light by the time they had finished preparing the gun to plant
it in the neighbourhood. The boys and I accompanied them
out. Timbo selected two trees, to which they lashed the gun
in an almost horizontal position, the muzzle only pointing
slightly upwards. A piece of wood about six inches long was
fastened to the gun stock so as to move easily backwards and
forwards. A piece of string connected the lower part of this
with the trigger. To the upper end a long piece of cord was
fastened, which was carried through one of the empty ram-rod
tubes, and then tied to a lump of flesh, fastened round the
muzzle of the gun. As can thus easily be understood, an
animal seizing the flesh pulls the lever which draws the
trigger, and at the same moment that it has the meat in its
mouth, the probabilities are that its brains will be blown out.
However, that it should not take the meat sideways, or come
behind it and thus escape, Timbo formed a fence round the
spot, leaving only a narrow opening just in front of the muzzle
of the gun.
."Now," said Timbo, "here are five bits of meat to tempt
de hyena to come up to de trap. You go dere, you go dere, you
go dere;" and we all, as he pointed out, went in different direc-

SEARCHING FOR STANLEY.
tions round the spot to some distance, and then dragged the
tainted meat up towards the trap. "Now, we go home; and
to-morrow morning we find hyena dead," he said.
It was indeed time, as darkness was coming on, and it was
just possible that the hyena might prefer one of us to the bait
which we had so kindly left for him. Scarcely, however, had
we reached home, when a loud report was heard.
"If dat hyena, I bery glad we did come away," said Timbo;
" but we not go now. Perhaps other hyenas dere. We kill
anoder to-morrow night."
It was quite dark when we got home. Our anxiety for the
return of Stanley prevented any of us from going to bed.
Three hours had passed away since nightfall, and still he did
not make his appearance. I saw that Kate was becoming very
anxious ; indeed, I could not help feeling so myself. At last
I proposed to Timbo that we should go out and try and find
him.
"Dat I will, Massa Andrew," he answered. " Dough he
not let me go wid him, he no say dat I not to come after-
wards."
With our rifles in our hands, and our long knives at our
belts, we sallied forth.
"Thank you, Andrew," said Kate, as I was going out. "I
cannot help fearing that some accident may have happened to
Stanley, and you will do your utmost to find him. I am sure
you will."
Timbo, who had several times accompanied his master to the
village I have spoken of, was tolerably certain of the direction
we should take. As we walked on, feeling our way in difficult
places with the long poles we carried in our hands, our ears
were assailed by the screeching of night-birds and the occa.
sional roars and mutterings of wild beasts. A feeling of awe
gradually crept over me, produced by the wild sounds and tho

A LION KILLED.

peculiar scenery through which we were passing. On one side
rose the hills, with dark rocks cropping out amidst the thick
foliage; while, on the other, the river flowed by with a mur-
muring sound, reflecting the bright stars from the dark sky
overhead. Far away to the right were sombre forests, with
openings here and there, across which phantom forms were seen
flitting to and fro, though so indistinct were they that we
could not tell what animals they might be.
"I t'ink we get near where de captain come to shoot," said
Timbo in a low voice. "We go slow now, and take care dat
no lion or 'noceros see us."
We moved on, but could hear no sounds. Presently we saw,
a little way below us, the stream of which we were in search.
" Can the captain have left it, and passed us on the way?"
I whispered to Timbo. We were now close down to the
stream. "What is that?" I asked, pointing to a huge mass
on the opposite side. "Surely there lies the body of an ele-
phant; and what are those creatures near us on the left ?"
"Dey leopards," whispered Timbo. "De captain hab been
here and killed dem, no doubt about dat."
Just as he was speaking, emerging from a clump of low
wood, there appeared directly before us a magnificent lion.
The creature stopped and lifted up his head, moving his tail
slowly to and fro, as if about to spring forward. Now he crept
on and on. Presently he uttered a loud roar. I stepped back,
instinctively bringing my rifle to my shoulder ; but at that
moment there was the flash of a gun, and a loud report came,
apparently out of the ground close in front of us, and the huge
lion sprang high up into the air. Scarcely, however, had the
report ceased echoing in our ears, than from another clump, a
little way on our right, I caught sight of an enormous rhino-
ceros, who seemed at that moment to have discovered that he
had an enemy close to him. I felt sure it was Stanley who had

fired. I shouted out to him. He answered me, " All right!"
not apparently perceiving the approach of a new assailant. On
dashed the huge rhinoceros, dipping his snout, as he descended
into the water, beneath the surface, his eyes alone remaining
above it. He was making directly for where I supposed Stan-
ley lay hid. There was no time for him to reload, and I felt
sure that the monster would gore him or trample over his
body. I had never prided myself on my shooting, but I felt
now or never was the time to take steady aim, or the life of
my cousin might be sacrificed, while Timbo and I, indeed, were
placed in no little danger. Aiming at the creature's head,
near its left eye, I fired. Instantly it rose up, attering a loud
bellow, but still came floundering on across the stream.
"Up, Stanley, up!" I shouted out. "Timbo, do you fire,
or the captain may be killed !" Timbo drew his trigger,
Again the creature was hit, but still his progress was not
stopped. Wading or swimming, it had just reached the bank,
close to where Stanley lay. Again I shrieked out to him
He was attempting to reload without getting up, for which,
indeed, he had not time. In another instant I expected to see
the sharp horn of the rhinoceros plunged into his side, when it
suddenly stopped and rolled over into the stream,
"A capital night's sport !" exclaimed Stanley, springing up,
his nerves in no way shaken by the fearful danger he had gone
through—for I fully believe that had he missed the lion, which
was on the point of springing on him, he must have been
killed; and had we not been near to defend him from the
rhinoceros, nothing could have saved him. Just as Stanley
had finished loading his gun, a loud roar echoed through the
woods, and we saw, coming out from behind the back of the
elephant, another large lion. We could almost distinguish the
grin on his features as he stood shaking his head, but yet not
daring to approach. The ferocious beast, which we concluded

from his size was one of the man-eaters, advanced boldly to-·
wards us. He seemed about to spring, and might have reached
us across the stream with a bound, when Stanley, raising his
rifle, fired, and the lion rolled over, shot through the heart.
Igubo and the other black, uttering shouts of triumph, came
running up. They had been concealed in a pit at a little dis-
tance, where it appeared that they also had shot a lion and a
leopard.
"Why you go so far off ?" said Timbo, when he saw them.
" Is dis de way to look after de captain ? Captain, you kill
Miss Kate and Miss Bella wid fright if you go away like
dis." Timbo had evidently scarcely recovered his alarm at
the risk his master had run.
"Well, well, Timbo," answered Stanley; "you see we have
done our duty and performed our promise. Three man-eaters
lie dead, and I hope we may bag the remainder before many
days are over."
The blacks were very anxious to get us all to go to their
village, that they might treat us with honour, and thank us
for the services we had rendered, and for the ample supply of
meat which our success had procured. Not being hard pressed
ourselves, we begged them to accept the whole of it, with the
exception of a small quantity of the rhinoceros meat, which
they undertook to bring up the following day. I urged Stan-
ley, however, to come back, to relieve Kate of her anxiety;
and telling our new friends that we would come and see them
another day, we returned homewards. Having reloaded our
guns, we took our way along the banks of the river. I was a
little in advance, when I put my foot upon what I thought was
the log of a tree, when what was my horror to see stretched
out before me the long head and scaly body of a huge croco-
dile! I stopped; for though the creature could not instantly
turn round, he might first knock me over with his powerful

tail, and then have time, before I could recover myself, to ware
ship, as Jack would have called it, and seize me in his fearful
jaws. The thought that he might do this flashed across me,
but I kept my presence of mind, and raising my rifle, levelled
it at his ear. I fired, and without a struggle the creature
turned on one side, and lay perfectly still. Timbo was in-
stantly up with me.
"Me kill him well, Massa Andrew!" he exclaimed. "You
no do dat, him gib ugly bite."
As we had no wish to have any crocodiles' meat (although
the natives have no objection to eat it), we hurried home-
wards.
"There they come !—there they come !" we heard Leo and
Natty shouting out; and they brought torches down the hill
to give us welcome. My kind cousin had not gone to bed, but
insisted upon sitting up to prepare a meal for us all, as she de-
clared (which was indeed the case) that we should be very
hungry. Not till then did Stanley give us an account of his
adventures.
"The first thing we did," he said, "was to dig some shallow
pits, with boughs over them, in which we could conceal our-
selves from the beasts which might approach the stream. We
saw by the spoors that numerous animals were accustomed to
come there. For some reason, however, none appeared at first,
except hyenas and jackals, which came round staring and
laughing at us in the most impudent manner. We threw
stones at them, but this only tended to increase their mockery.
At length I hurled a lump of wood at the head of one of them,
which, hitting him on the nose, made him cry out, and the
whole scampered off as fast as their legs could carry them.
They were, I hoped, the forerunners of more noble brutes.
I was not disappointed, for in a short time the ground shook
with the heavy tramp of elephants hurrying down to the

321
water. Nearer and nearer they came. At length I could see
heir dark phantom-like forms moving amid the trees. Next
their shapes were distinguishable, and then an enormous ele-
phant stood out in bold relief against the sky. Another and
another followed, till the bank of the river was lined with them.
They could easily have crossed the stream, had they been so
disposed, when few people would have given much for my life
or that of my companions. I felt a little nervous, I confess,
but soon recovered my presence of mind. I raised my gun to
take aim at their leader, who stood conspicuously forth from
among his fellows. Of course, Kate, you will say I was very
wrong to think of shooting him, but I could not help it. I
allowed them to go on drinking, which they did, dipping their
trunks into the water, and pouring it down their throats. I
hesitated even now, however, about firing, lest I might warn
the lions, whom I most particularly wished to destroy. Sud-
denly they all began to move off, and I was afraid that I should
miss the chance of hitting one. I therefore gave a low whistle,
which immediately attracted their attention. Once more turn-
ing round, they slightly raised their huge ears, and moved
their trunks in eccentric circles through the air, as if they
wished to ascertain the cause of the strange noise they had
heard. I could resist no longer, but pulling my trigger, the
loud thud of the bullet as it struck the animal's head showed
me I had hit him fairly. He turned round, and staggered back
a few paces. I was afraid that I might not have mortally
wounded him. I fired my other barrel behind his ear, and
without a struggle he sank down dead, the other elephants
going off into the forest at a great rate, uttering notes of terror.
I was about to rush forward across the stream to examine him,
when my companions urged me to remain quiet; and in a short
time I saw a leopard stealing over the ground. Then another
came. I shot one with one barrel, and one with the other;

A VISIT FROM SOME NATIVES.
but still the object of our hunt, if so it could be called, was
not accomplished. Some time passed away, when I saw a
creature moving towards me; and soon, as it came out of the
darkness of the forest, I distinguished a fine lion. I let it get
quite close before I fired. I drew my trigger. The brute turne?
round and bounded off, and I thought that it had escaped me,
though the loud and peculiar roar it uttered made me hope
that it was mortally wounded. Still Igubo urged me tu te-
main quiet, and after some time another lion came. It seemed
as if he was about to spring across the stream towards me. It
was the one I shot just as Andrew arrived. The rest he has
told you."
"Oh, brother, I wish you would not undertake such danger.
ous expeditions !" exclaimed Kate, when Stanley had finished.
"But surely, my dear sister, in this case I was fighting in a
good cause," said Stanley, laughing. "If we have rid the
country of these man-eaters, we shall have rendered an essential
service to our neighbours, and the blacks, I hope, will show
their gratitude."
We soon retired to rest, and slept more soundly than we had
done for many nights, though we kept a guard as usual, as our
fortification was not entirely completed. The next morning
we set to work to finish it, and by noon had entirely surrounded
it with an impenetrable hedge. It took us some time longer
to fasten the prickly branches to the top of our fence. While
we were at work, a party of blacks arrived from the village,
bringing with them a large quantity of elephant and rhinoceros
flesh. They came to thank our chief, they said, for the ser-
vice he had done them, though they feared that there were still
other lions in the neighbourhood. Stanley promised to do his
- best to look out for them, should any again appear.
The young koodoo was by this time completely tamed, and
even the little zebra had lost all fear, and would come up when

called by Kate or Bella to be fed, and allow itself to be stroked
and petted by them; but when any blacks came near it, it
would scamper off and kick out with its heels, or, if they pur-
sued it, would turn round and try to bite them.
"I am sure it would let me ride it," said Bella, "if we could
make a saddle to fit its back."
"I think I could do that for you, Miss Bella," said Jack;
"but it might be a hard job to put it on."
"If you will make the saddle and bridle, I will try to put
them on," repeated Bella.
We had no lack of skins, which I should have said Timbo
and Jack employed themselves in dressing. Out of these, the
former, who was very ingenious, in a short time contrived to
make a very respectable-looking side-saddle. We had some
iron wire, with which he formed a bit, as also a stirrup.
Bella was highly delighted when he produced it completed.
She, meantime, had allowed no one but herself to feed the little
creature, and every day when she did so she threw a piece of
hide over its back. In a little time she placed a still larger
hide on the animal, till it was thoroughly accustomed to the
weight, and seemed in no way to mind it. To introduce the
bit into its mouth was a more difficult task. However, it
allowed her one day to slip it in, after it had been eating; and
she kept it there for some time, leading it by the bridle about
the yard.
"Now bring me the saddle, Jack," she cried out. "I am
sure it will let me put it on its back."
Jack brought it, and the zebra stood perfectly still while he
tightened the girths. Next to Kate and Bella, Jack was
evidently the zebra's favourite, and it never seemed to object
to his playing with it.
"Now lift me up, Jack," said Bella ; " and I am sure it
will let you lead it about."

EQUESTRIAN EXERCISE.
In a short time the little creature seemed perfectly con-
tented with its new employment, and Bella was able to ride it
round and round the yard, without its showing any wish to
throw her off. The koodoo ran by her side, every now and
then looking round into the zebra's face, as much as to ask
how he liked it. She, however, did not try it too far; and
after riding about for half an hour or so, she jumped off its
back, and relieved it of its saddle, patting its head and talking
to it all the time. She then, leading it back to its pen, took
off its bridle and gave it some more food. The following
day she tried it in the same way; and though at first it
seemed rather disinclined to allow the bit to be put into its
mouth, after she had coaxed it, and talked to it for some
time, it allowed her to put it in; and Jack again bringing
out the saddle, it went through the duty of the previous
day.
"I think now," said Bella, " if we have to make a journey,
that I shall have a steed ready to carry me. I wish, Kate,
we could find an animal for you."
"No fear about dat, Miss Bella," said Timbo. "If we no
get horses we get oxen, and dey do better dan any other
animal in dis country."
Timbo had been making inquiries, it appeared, about the
natives further to the south, and had been told that at some
distance there were herds of oxen, which the people were
accustomed to ride. This gave us hopes that we might be
able to procure some, and that we might proceed on our jour-
ney without waiting for Senhor Silva and Chickango. As yet
no news had been received from them, though we were now in
daily expectation of the arrival of a messenger whom they had
promised if possible to send back to us, with an account of
their progress. Our days were beginning to grow somewhat
monotonous, from the fact that we had no great difficulty in

supplying ourselves with food, and were unwilling to go out
and kill creatures merely for the sake of amusement. Stanley
inade a second excursion to assist our friends in the northern
village, and succeeded in killing two more lions, which the
people declared were man-eaters.

CHAPTER XV.
ADVENTURES ON THE LAKE.
EO and Natty had been frequently begging me to
accompany them to visit our friends to the south.
We agreed that we should greatly shorten the land
journey by proceeding along the lake, and landing
at a spot on its borders nearest the village, which
we thought we could then reach in a few hours'
march. Stanley had no objection to our going, provided we
did not remain away more than three or four days. Mango
was to accompany us as interpreter. From the experience we
had had of the natives, we hoped that the garrison, though
thus decreased, was still sufficient for the protection of our
fortress, especially as the lions and leopards had for some time
kept at a distance, finding out, probably, that we possessed
ample means for their destruction. It is extraordinary what
instinct wild animals exhibit, and how soon they desert a
neighbourhood where they are frequently attacked. It is said
that even hippopotami and crocodiles become more wary after
being hunted; and though in the wilder districts they come out
fearlessly to feed or to bask on the sandbanks, when hunters
come to the neighbourhood they learn to conceal themselves in
their watery retreats, and will only show their nostrils and eyes
above the surface, keeping always in the most secluded parts.

OUR VOYAGE.
327
The boys were greatly pleased at being allowed to take the
proposed expedition. They made wallets to carry their food
at their backs, and the articles they proposed to present to the
natives, or to exchange for meat and other provisions should
we not be able to supply ourselves. The village we were to
visit, we learned from Igubo, was called Kabomba, and he
seemed to consider it a very important place. Po be sure, as
Leo observed, he had never been in London, or even at Cape
Town, so it was not surprising that he should look upon it
with respect.
Our preparations were soon completed. Igubo gave his
son charge to behave well, and to bring no discredit upon his
white friends. Kate urged us all to take care of ourselves,
and not to run into unnecessary danger. The whole party
accompanied us down to the canoe. We had chosen the
Gazelle, as the best of the two. As the wind was fair, we
hoisted our sail and steered merrily down the river towards
the lake. We had no difficulty, as we passed along, in sup-
plying ourselves with food. Wild ducks of all sorts abounded.
Among them were numbers of the Egyptian goose. We
saw several of them ahead, and made chase. Being heavy
of wing, we found they could not rise out of the water, and we
caught four or five with our hands as we passed by. A little
further on we neared a bank on which a large flock of ducks
were seated. Leo and I fired at the same time, and on land-
ing we picked up a dozen ducks and three geese which we had
knocked over. Among them was a large black goose, which
we saw in great numbers walking slowly about and picking up
their food. The specimen we killed had a small black spur on
its shoulder—as has the armed plover—and as strong as that
on the heel of a cock; but the birds, it is said, never use them
except in defence of their young. They are said always to
choose ant-hills for their nests. The ants cannot hurt the

eggs, and the material of which the hills are composed assists
probably in hatching the eggs, as the sand does those of the
ostrich.
I had hitherto held very little conversation with Mango.
He had, however, picked up enough English to make himself
understood, and during this trip I was able to ascertain some
of his peculiar notions.
We kept for some time along the north shore of the lake.
We were nearing a point when we saw a beautiful water-
antelope, known under the name of mochose. Before I could
stop him, Leo had lifted his rifle and fired. The poor animal
was hit, and, as is always the case, instead of flying along the
shore, leaped into the water and began to swim across the lake.
We immediately made chase, for though we had ducks enough
for food, venison was not to be despised. I saw Mango waving
his hands and muttering in a peculiar manner. The mochose
swam well, but we soon gained upon it; and I was anxious to
put it out of its sufferings, for a red mark which appeared in
its wake showed that it must have been badly wounded. Just
as we neared it, a long snout projected above the water. It
was that of a crocodile. The next instant the poor mochose
and the hideous monster sank together. Mango uttered an
expression of disappointment; and when I questioned him, he
said that he had been praying to his fetich, who was himself
a crocodile, that we might obtain the venison, but that the
fetich would not hear him.
" That is a curious sort of religion," observed Leo; " for to
my certain knowledge he and his father and brother supped off
the crocodile Igubo killed the other day, and still he worships
the beast."
I have not before mentioned it, but we had tasted the flesh
Leo spoke of. It had a strong musky odour, which did not
tempt us to try it again ; though I do not know what we should

have done had we been pressed by hunger. In a short time
we came to a wide bay, across which we stood. The wind
was fresh, and we flew rapidly over the water. The pure air
raised our spirits, and we anticipated an interesting visit to
our Kabomba friends. Mango pointed to a spot some way
ahead, where he thought we might land; but at the same time
said that if we continued further, we might possibly have a
still shorter land journey to the village.
"It would be a pity to leave the canoe, as long as we can
sail along so pleasantly," said Leo. "Do, Andrew, let us follow
his suggestion."
As I saw no objection to it, we stood on down the lake.
The breeze was increasing. I took two reefs in our sail, but
still it was as much as the canoe could bear. Suddenly a
strong blast came sweeping over the lake. I shouted to
Natty, who was at the halliards. Almost before the words
were out of my mouth, he had let them go. It was fortunate
that he did so, or the canoe must inevitably have been upset.
As it was, she heeled over so much that we took in a quan-
tity of water. We set to work to bail it out; but the wind
from that moment blew stronger and stronger, and in a few
minutes the whole lake, which had hitherto been so calm, was
covered with foaming seas. They increased every instant, and
I saw that it would be dangerous to expose our light canoe
broadside to them. Even as it was, they continued breaking
over the sides, and it required active bailing to free her from
water. Our only course, therefore, to escape being swamped,
was to keep her directly before the gale. This carried us
further and further down the lake, and drove us also off from
the north shore. I told Natty and Leo to get out the paddles,
while we set Mango to bail. We thus ran before the seas, and
kept the canoe tolerably free from water. Night was approach-
ing, and still there was no cessation of the gale. We could

HOPING FOR THE BEST.
only see the land dimly on our right side, while we flew on,
surrounded by the hissing and foaming waters. Much de-
pended, I knew, on my steering well. The slightest careless-
ness might have allowed the canoe to broach to, when she must
inevitably have been upset. Even had we clung to her, we
should have lost our provisions, and we might have been
picked up by some crocodile exploring the deeper water in
search of prey; for I could not tell whether the monsters did
not swim occasionally thus far from land. The boys plied
their paddles energetically, as if they fancied our safety de-
pended upon their exertions. Seeing this, I told them not to
exhaust their strength, as it was only necessary to keep the
paddles going sufficiently to assist me in steering the canoe.
I tried to pierce the gloom ahead, but nothing could be seen
but the troubled waters. It was different to any scene we had
yet witnessed, for hitherto the lake had been calm as glass,
unless when occasionally a ripple played over its surface.
"I say, Andrew, I wonder whether we are ever coming to an
end of this ?" exclaimed Leo. "If we go on at this rate, we
shall be hundreds of miles away from Kate and the rest, and
they will not know what has become of us."
"Not quite so far as that, I fancy," said Natty. "We
must pray to be preserved, and hope for the best. I do not
think we can do anything but that just now."
"Right, Natty," I said. "Do our best, and hope for the
best. That is a right principle, and people who act thus are
seldom led far wrong. Storms, in these latitudes, though they
are very violent, do not last for any length of time; and I
hope we may soon fall in with some island, under which we
may take shelter."
"Suppose, though, we run against it. What shall we do
then ?" asked Leo.
"We must jump out and haul the boat up," answered

Natty.'" The shore is not dangerous like that of the sea-coast,
and we shall have no great difficulty in saving ourselves, even
if we are driven on it."
"We need not talk of such a contingency," I remarked. "I
hope we may keep clear of all dangers till the gale drops, or
till daylight returns."
Though I said this, I could not help feeling very anxious,
particularly at the thought of being driven so far from home,
for I knew that Kate would become alarmed should we not
return at the time we proposed. Still we kept on; but often
as I bent my head forward, trying to make out any object
ahead, nothing could I see but the curling waves as before. I
had no idea that the lake was so long, and expected every
minute to find that we were approaching the end of it. Still
on and on we went. Hour after hour passed by, and I calcu-
lated that morning must be approaching. The gale still in-
creased, and as the light canoe flew over the foaming seas I
dreaded every instant that they would break on board. She
behaved beautifully, however, and though occasionally the top
of a wave tumbled over her, we took in no great amount of
water. At length, as I cast my eye towards the east, a faint
light appeared in the sky. I hailed it as the harbinger of
morning. At the same time the wind began to fall, and in a
few minutes had evidently greatly decreased. I began to hope
that our dangers were coming to an end, and that we should
only have the trouble of paddling back again without visiting
our Kabomba friends.
"I see the shore !" cried Leo, "on my right hand."
"And I see it on the left !" exclaimed Natty.
Just then Mango, who had been sitting quiet at the bottom
of the canoe, lifted up his head as if listening, and then pointed
to the south evidently in a state of alarm. He uttered a few
words, but what he meant to say I could not make out. There

A CATARACT AHEAD.
was still so much sea that I was afraid of hauling the boat up
to attempt to reach the north shore. I therefore stood on as
before, and in a short time found that we were entering either
a narrow part of the lake or the commencement of a river flow-
ing out of it, and I hoped every instant to reach some point
wbere we could safely land. We had stood on some little way
further, when I began to suspect, by the rapid way we passed
the land, that we must have a strong current with us as well as
the wind. Scarcely had I made this discovery when the loud
roar of waters reached my ears. It was the deep, solemn sound
which proceeds from a cataract. Now for the first time the
truth broke on me. We were in a rapid current, which was
hastily hurrying us on towards a waterfall. Not a moment
was to be lost. I told the boys to lower the sail and to en-
deavour to get the canoe's head round so as to pull in for the
shore; for as to making any way against the current and the
wind combined, that I knew was impossible. They did their
utmost, I helping them with my steering paddle, and Mango
working away with a spare one; but still so heavy were the
waves that they threatened every instant to capsize us, and I saw
that we were being carried down almost as rapidly as before. La
vain we paddled. We appeared to make no way. "Hope for the
best, hope for the best !" cried Natty, exerting himself to the
utmost. The perilous position in which we were placed pressed
heavily on my mind. The loud roar of the cataract sounded
louder and louder, and as daylight increased I made out in the
distance a cloud of spray rising in the air. Down it there
appeared every probability we should be carried, and what
hope was there then of our escaping with life? I looked
anxiously round on every side, and at length the increasing
light revealed a small island a little way further down the
stream. I trusted that by our exertions we might reach it.
We continued straining every nerve. Rapidly the canoe was

333
borne down sideways towards it. "A few strokes more and
we shall be there," I cried out. "Work away, boys, work
away." In spite of our exertions down glided the canoe, and
the end of the island was passed. Still, we might reach some
part of the side of the island. Had I been alone I might
almost have leaped on shore. The moment was a fearfully
anxious one. I could distinguish the southern end of the
island. If we failed to reach that we must be lost. Trees
overhung the banks. I gave a few more desperate strokes,
and drove the canoe forward till her bows just touched the
shore. "Leap out !" I cried. The canoe swung round.
Natty seized the branch of a tree which hung down close to
him, and swung himself up. I thought Leo and Mango had
done the same, for I saw Leo clinging to a branch of a tree,
and the black springing with the painter in his hand towards
the shore. I therefore, seizing my gun and ammunition,
leaped to the bank. What was my horror the next instant to
see Leo fall back into the boat, the branch he had caught hold
of breaking, and the black boy still holding on to the painter
floating after the canoe. Leo seemed scarcely conscious of his
own danger, but rushing to Mango, assisted to drag him in.
My impulse was to spring into the water and try to regain
the canoe, but just then Natty's voice reached me, crying, " Oh,
help me, Andrew! help me!" and I saw that, though clinging
to a branch, he could not manage, laden as he was, to climb
along it so as to gain the shore in safety. I hurried to assist
him, my heart sinking at the thought of what would become
of Leo and Mango. I clambered along the tree, and at length
got hold of Natty, but it required some caution to prevent us
both falling off into the water. I got him, however, safe on
shore, and then we hurried together to the south point,
anxiously looking for the canoe. Leo and his companion had
got out their paddles, and were working away in what ap-

334
WHAT OF OUR COMPANIONS ?
peared an utterly vain attempt to reach the north bank before
the canoe would be hurried down the cataract. Natty wrung
his hands in despair.
"Oh, how could it have happened ?" he exclaimed. "I
would have done anything rather than let Leo go. What is
to be done? what is to be done?"
I had no consolation to offer him. Still the increasing light
showed me that there were other islands intervening between
the falls and the one we were on. It was barely possible, how.
ever, that the canoe would drift against one of them. We
stood watching them with the deepest anxiety as the canoe was
carried further and further down the current. Already she ap-
peared to be in the rapids, from her quicker movement; and
gliding faster and faster away, she soon was almost out of sight.
It must be understood that there was a considerable distance
between us and the cloud of vapour which I supposed to mark
the situation of the fall. At length the canoe was hid from us
altogether by a tree-covered island; but whether Leo and
his companion had managed to reach it or not we were left
in fearful doubt. It was some time before I could rouse
myself. Poor Natty sat down on the ground with his head
resting on his hands, completely overcome.
"But perhaps, after all, they may not have been lost!" he
exclaimed, starting up, "and they may manage to tow the
canoe along the bank of the river and come back to us. What
do you think ?"
"I dare not offer an opinion," I answered. "It is possible,
just possible, and we must hope for the best."
Still we waited, looking in the direction we had last seen
the two boys, anxiously hoping that they might reappear ; but
in vain. At length I began to feel somewhat faint, and Natty
at last exclaimed, "Oh, I am so hungry!" It recalled us
to the necessity of trying to find something on which we could

NATTY'S DANGER.
335
support life. The island was so small, that had any birds
been on it they would have flown away when we landed. I
had, fortunately, a tinder-box in my pocket, so that we might
light a fire if we could find anything to cook. At length Natty
discovered a small fruit like a plum, growing on a tree covered
with dark green leaves. He called me to it, and on examin-
ing it it struck me that it must be the moyela, which David
had found near the banks of the river only a day or two before.
This would at all events assist to satisfy the pangs of hunger,
though it might not do to support us. I helped Natty up the
tree, and he threw down to me as many as we thought we
should require. We then sat down on the ground and dis-
cussed them, but the recollection of Leo made us too sad to
talk.
"I am very thirsty," said Natty, "and must get a draught
of water."
He went to the shore, and was stooping down to fill his hand
full, when at that instant I saw a ripple in the water rapidly
approaching. I had just time to spring up and pull him
violently back, when a huge snout projected above the surface.
The monster, startled by the fearful shriek Natty set up, and
the loud cries I uttered, did not venture to approach, and slunk
back again beneath the surface. I confess I was completely
unnerved, and stood trembling all over, while Natty would
have sunk to the ground had I not supported him. It was
some minutes before I recovered.
"I must not again run the risk of being caught like that.
I ought to have remembered the crocodiles," he said at last.
"But I say, Andrew, don't you think it very likely that the
creature may have its nest somewhere about the island ? I
will have a hunt."
Forthwith we began poking about in all directions with
pieces of bamboo-a small grove of which grew on the island.

336
A STORE OF CROCODILE EGGS.
"Here is a hole," cried Natty at length, "and full of eggs,
too. We will pay the crocodile off now for the fright be
gave us."
I confess at first I could scarcely bring myself to think of
eating crocodile's eggs. Natty had no such scruple. We
filled our hats, and brought them to the beach, where, clearing
away the grass to prevent an accident, we soon had a fire burni-
ing. As we had no pot to boil our eggs, we put them into the
fire to roast, stirring them round and round with a stick. In
spite of my repugnance, so excessive was my hunger that as
soon as we thought the eggs were done, and Natty had pulled
them out, I cracked one. The yolk alone had set, but that
looked tolerably tempting; and on putting it to my mouth I
could scarcely distinguish it, except by a peculiar flavour, from
the yolk of a bird's egg. A couple, however, satisfied me.
"They will last the longer for not being too nice," ob-
served Natty; "and we do not know how long we may have
to stay here."
"We must think of means of getting away," I said ; " for
it is not likely that any canoes will pass by, and it is very cer-
tain that we must not attempt to swim on shore, though, were
it only for the distance, I think I could do it, and carry you
on my back."
"No, no, indeed !" exclaimed Natty. "We have had ex-
perience already of what would be our fate if we ventured into
the water. But do you not think that the captain will come
to look for us in the Giraffe when we do not return? He will
never give us up without a search."
"But you forget," I said, "our friends do not expect us back
for two or three days, so that they will not think of setting
out till after that time, when they find we do not return."
"And what shall we do in the meantime?"
Although an idea had occurred to me by which we could

A LOFTY SLEEPING-PLACE.
337
reach the shore, yet it was so perilous that I thought as long
as we could find food on the island it might be prudent to
stay there without attempting it. The day passed slowly
away, and as evening approached I bethought me that we
should wish to sleep.
"But what if a crocodile comes and picks us off ?" said
Natty. "That will not be pleasant."
" Too true," I said. "Then we must try and form a house
in the trees."
There were not many on the island. We selected one with
wide-spreading branches, into which we could without difficulty
climb.
"But when we are there," said Natty, "how are we to
sleep? As we cannot cling on like birds or monkeys, we
should tumble off, for certain. I have it, though. Let us
build a platform of bamboo; you have your hatchet, and we
can soon form one large enough to hold us both.".
• The idea I thought excellent, and immediately set to work
to cut down a good supply of bamboos. As I cut them I
handed them up to Natty, who fastened the ends with flexible
creepers, of which there was an abundance around us. Before
it was dark we had formed a flooring about six feet long and
as many broad. We now climbed up, and sat ourselves down to
contemplate our performance.
"Suppose no canoe passes, how shall we ever be able to
get from this," said Natty. "We are not going to live here for
ever, I hope."
"I have thought of forming a reed raft, on which we can
ferry ourselves across the narrowest part of the stream towards
the north shore."
"But surely the current will carry us down ?" he observed
justly.
"I have thought of that; we must wait till a strong wind

blows up the river, and then I have hopes that it will keep
back the waters of the lake and probably greatly lessen the
current. If so, and we can manufacture a mat sail, I think we
shall be able to reach the nearest bank. It is dangerous, I
grant, but I see no other way."
" Nor do I, indeed," he said ; " but, by-the-by, I left our eggs
near the river, and probably the mother crocodile will come
to look for them and carry them off."
Without waiting for my reply he climbed down the tree,
and was soon back again with our provisions. "I think I saw a
snout just coming out of the water," he remarked ; " and a
minute later the creature would have got hold of them, I fancy.
I did not stop to look a second time, however, for I was afraid
that it would have caught me had I delayed."
"I am very glad you have brought the eggs, and still more
that you escaped the monster. It is evident that we must be
careful not to stand carelessly by the side of the bank, or go
into the water," I answered. We were silent for some time.
"I think we should have prayers," I heard Natty observe.
"Will you say them, Andrew ?"
"Gladly," I replied ; and to the best of my power I offered
up a prayer for protection before we lay down to sleep. I was
soon in the land of dreams, for I was thoroughly tired with the
exertion I had gone through during the previous day. I was
awaked by feeling Natty touch my arm.
"Look down there, Andrew," he whispered. "See! it is
just as well we are safe up in the tree !"
As I cast my eyes down on the ground below us, I saw three
huge crocodiles crawling slowly about ; and though they
generally take their food in the water, I had no doubt that
they would not have objected to seize us for their suppers had
they found us unprepared for resistance. It was rather difficult
to go to sleep again with the knowledge that such creatures

A MEANS OF ESCAPE.
339
were in our vicinity. However, after watching them for a time,
I felt my eyes closing, and shortly forgot all about them and
everything else present. When I awoke the sun was shining
through the branches of the trees. The crocodiles had dis-
appeared, the wind was light, the sky blue, and the smooth
water shone in the beams of the rising luminary of day.
Voices reached my ears. A faint hope rose in my heart that
they might proceed from Leo and Mango. I quickly de-
scended the tree, and made my way to the edge of the island
on the side whence they appeared to come. There I saw, at
some distance, a canoe with four blacks in her, engaged in
combat with a hippopotamus. One of them, standing up,
was abont to plunge his spear into the animal's neck. Several
more animals were standing on the nearest reed-covered bank,
while the heads of others protruded from among the reeds in
the distance. Here was a means of escape, if we could make
the blacks hear, and they were inclined to assist us. I called
to Natty, who, descending the tree, was soon by my side. We
shouted with might and main, but the blacks were so eagerly
engaged in attacking the hippopotamus that they did not
hear us. The monster, as he received the wound in his neck,
turned round and attempted to seize the canoe ; but the blacks,
plying the paddles quickly, got out of his way, holding him,
however, by a rope attached to the spear. Spear after spear
was darted into his neck; and in a short time the blacks, tak-
ing him in tow, dragged him on shore, where, in spite of his
struggles, they hauled him up, and several other people hurry-
ing down to the bank, soon despatched him with their clubs.
No sooner had they done so, than they set up loud shouts, and
began dancing away in frantic joy at their success. I thought
this was a favourable opportunity for again trying to attract
their attention. We shouted and shouted, but still they did
not hear us.

MAKING OVERTURES.
"I think, Andrew, you must fire your gun. They will hear
that, at all events," said Natty.
I was about to do as he suggested; but then the question
arose in my mind, whether we should be better off with the
savages than we were by ourselves. Still, should we lose this
opportunity of getting to the mainland, another might not
occur. At length I fired. The effect was curious. The
blacks ceased dancing, and looked about them with glances of
astonishment. Presently five of them leaped into the canoe,
and having pulled out from the shore, so as to allow the cur-
rent to carry them directly towards it, began cautiously pad-
dling down to the island. They, of course, knew its strength,
and the necessity for care. As they approached, Natty and I
each took a branch in our hands and waved it, hoping that
they would understand it as a signal of friendship. As they
drew near they stopped rowing, and gazed at us with looks of
curiosity. I again waved to them, and showing them my gun,
I placed it by my side, that they might understand I had no
intention of using it. Except the usual small waist-cloth, the
strangers had no clothing, though the man who sat in the stern
guiding the canoe had a few ornaments about his head and on
his neck, which showed that he was a chief. They began
jabbering away to us, but of course we could not understand
a word they said. I replied to them, therefore, by signs that
we wished to be ferried over to the opposite shore. Natty
fortunately recollected just then that he had a few beads, a
clasp-knife, and one or two articles which he had put into
his wallet just as we were coming away. He showed these
to signify that we would pay them for the service they might
render us. They seemed to understand our signs, and beckoned
to us to step into the canoe, carefully turning her round, so
that they might instantly paddle off again up the stream. We
stepping in, they shoved off, exerting themselves to the utmost

lo stem the current. We made, however, but little way. As
their backs were turned towards us, I could only judge of their
disposition by watching the countenance of their chief. It was
not particularly prepossessing, and the exertions he was making
added not a little to its natural ugliness. He seemed to be
regarding us with looks of intense curiosity, as if he had never
before seen white people. After paddling along for a con-
siderable time with the greatest exertion, they suddenly turned
the canoe round and paddled across the current towards the
shore. At length we got into a counter eddy, and now
without difficulty they made way; the people who had been
surrounding the hippopotamus running down along the bank
to look at us. We soon reached a place where we could land,
but for some minutes we were kept in the boat, while the
tribe collected on the high banks above us, grinning down and
gazing at us much as we should at a wild beast in its den in
the Zoological Gardens. They were, I think, the ugliest savages
we had yet met with. .
"Well, I do declare I think poor Chico was a beauty to
them," exclaimed Natty, as he looked up at them squatting in
all sorts of attitudes on the bank. The women (I must not
call them the fair sex) were even less attractive than their
lords and masters. Two or three of them had huge necklaces
langing down over their breasts and rings round their arms,
which in no way added to their beauty. Some of them carried
hildren slung to their backs by straps of buffalo hides, and
he little creatures, as they looked down upon us, grinned from
ar to ear, though, when their mothers approached nearer than
hey liked, they set up the most terrific cries, such as I should
ave thought no human beings could have uttered. At last
he canoe-men allowed us to land, when the female portion of
he spectators hurriedly retreated, as if we were some wild
reatures likely to do them harm. My first object was to in.

MAKING FRIENDS WITH THE NATIVES.
quire whether they could give us any information about Leo
and Mango; but they only shook their heads, and we could not
tell what that intended to signify. I explained to them, as
well as I could, that we had come in a canoe, which, with our
companions in it, had been drifted down towards the cataract.
Each time they only replied as before, with an ominous shake
of the head. Their countenances brightened a little as I dis-
tributed among them the articles which Natty had brought,
giving the chief a knife and a double allowance of beads.
Some who had been in the background, and had not received
any, now pressed forward, and looked very indignant when
we showed them that we had no more to give. I now made
signs to them that we wished to go down the banks to try and
ascertain what had become of the canoe; but they put them-
selves before us, and intimated that they did not wish us to
move to a distance. "But we must go, and we will go !"
cried Natty. "We must find out what has become of Leo, and
the whole tribe together shall not stop me!" It struck me,
however, that probably they wished to cut up the hippopotamus,
and distribute it among the people; and that perhaps after
this operation they might be willing to accompany us. With-
out hesitation, therefore, we walked along the bank towards
the spot where the creature had been drawn ashore. I con-
cluded that I was right, by seeing the chief and several men
instantly begin to attack the monster. In a short time they
had it skinned and cut up, each one taking a portion. The
chief took none himself, but several men, whom I supposed to
be slaves, were laden with larger portions than any of the rest,
which, I have no doubt, were his share. This done, I again
signified our wish to go down the banks to look for the canoe;
and at length, greatly to my satisfaction, the chief and six of
his companions began to move in that direction. Natty and I
hurried on as fast as we could walk, though, indeed, had we

OUR SEARCH FOR OUR COMPANIONS.

not restrained our eagerness, we should soon have got ahead
of our companions. The distance to the falls was far greater
than I had supposed, for after we had gone some way we could
still see the cloud of mist rising above them. When we got
abreast of the islands to the south of the one we had landed on,
we examined them narrowly; but no sign of the canoe could
we discover. It was difficult, however, at all times to see across
the river, on account of the thick wood which in many places
fringed the banks and overhung the water. "Oh, they cannot
be lost! they cannot be lost !" Natty exclaimed every now
and then. I could only reply, I hoped not; and still, as I saw
the rapid current rushing by, I dreaded to find my worst
apprehensions fulfilled.
At length we got near the edge of the cataract. A dark
ledge of rocks ran, it appeared, across the stream, some rising
high above the water, which flowed with terrific force between
them. There was, however, from the western shore on which
we stood a point which ran out for some distance, and within
this the water circled round, forming a back eddy. My only
hope was, from not having seen the canoe on any of the
islands, that she might have drifted into this eddy. We
searched the shore on every side, but nowhere was she to be
seen. That she could possibly have floated down the cataract
** without turning over, I feared was impossible. We, however,
continued our way, not without difficulty, till we reached the
* lower level, and looking back, saw the stream rushing over its
rocky bed, making a fall and leaping madly downwards to a
- depth of fifty or sixty feet, where it bubbled and foamed in a
vast caldron, which sent up unceasing clouds of spray high
into the air. Then after a time it began to flow more calmly,
is till it went gliding on as if fatigued by its hurried course.
We now more narrowly examined the banks, not with any
3* hope of finding our companions, but in the possibility that

THE CANOE FOUND.
the canoe might have been drifted on shore, and that we might
thus ascertain to a certainty their fate.
We went on till we reached another stream which ran into
the main river. Here our companions placed themselves
before us, and signified that we must go no further. I could
only conjecture that they looked upon it as the border of their
territory, and were afraid that should we pass it we should
attempt to make our escape. I saw them looking out eagerly
over the country beyond the stream, as if to ascertain whether
any enemies were in the neighbourhood. They then signed
to us that we must accompany them back again. As we
returned we still continued examining the banks, in case
we might have passed any spot where the canoe could be
drawn up. We had not gone far when Natty, who had run
through a narrow pathway leading down to the water, ex.
claimed, "Here, here! Andrew. I think I see the canoe a
little way up the bank! Come and look !" I hastened to
him. There, under some bushes at the end of a little point
some few hundred yards from us, I saw an object which looked
very like a canoe. Still, it might be that of some of the
natives. We marked it well, and then hastened up again
along the bank, examining the bushes that we might discover
if there was any path through them. We searched about,
however, for some time before we could find a pathway. At
length one appeared, and Natty darting down it, made his way
towards the water as fast as he could run. It was like the
former one, formed, I concluded, by elephants or rhinoceroses to
reach their evening drinking-place. There was the canoe.
The paddles, however, and everything in her, had been taken
away. My heart beat with satisfaction and gratitude. Leo
and Mango bad escaped destruction in the cataract ; but what,
then, bad become of them? We could discover no trace or
sign, nothing whatever to give us any clue to their fate.

CHAPTER XVI.
AMONG SAVAGES.
HAT can have become of them ?" exclaimed
Natty for the twentieth time as we stood ex-
amining the canoe. "But here come the blacks.
Perhaps they will find out."
The chief and several of his followers assembled
1 round the canoe, and began to talk eagerly to
each other. They arrived at length at some conclusion, but
what it was we could not divine. Then they examined the
ground round, and seemed to discover certain marks, as one
called the other to look at them. Then away they ran up
the path, and began beating about in the surrounding wood.
They came back shaking their heads, and when we by signs
asked them what had happened, they pointed to the south.
"Depend upon it, Andrew," exclaimed Natty, "Leo and
Mango have gone in that direction. Let us set off after
them."
"I will try and make the blacks understand that we intend
tu do so," I answered.
I succeeded in explaining my wishes; but the blacks only
shook their woolly pates, and made signs that if we did, we
should be knocked on the head, or that daggers would be
stuck into us.

348
ARE OUR FRIENDS PRISONERS ?
"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried Natty, "can that have
been the fate of Leo and Mango ?"
"I hope not," I said. "If anybody has carried them off,
they would not have done so for the sake of killing them.
What I suspect is, that the neighbouring tribe 18 at war with
our present friends, and that they happened to be making a
raid into the country, and falling in with Leo and Mango,
carried them off captives. It was evident from the signs
these people made to us that they did not wish us to cross the
stream, which they probably considered the boundary line
between their territory and that of the tribe with which they
are at war. I may be mistaken, but we must try and
return as soon as possible, and let Timbo and Igubo know
what has occurred. If we can ascertain from them to what
place Leo and Mango have been carried, we must lose no time
in endeavouring to release them."
"Oh yes," said Natty, "I am nearly sure they must bave
been carried away prisoners, or they would have come up the
river and endeavoured to release us, as I said they would do."
When, however, I explained to the chief that we wished to
return to the part of the country from whence we had come, I
found that he had no intention of letting us go. Still I
hoped, of course, that we might find the means of escaping.
At present, indeed, as we had no food, we were not un-
willing to accompany the chief to his village, to which by
signs he invited us. As we walked along I saw him eyeing
my gun. I showed it him, holding it, however, pretty tightly,
lest he should think fit to appropriate it. I saw by the
way he looked at the weapon, that he was unacquainted
with its use. First he examined the lock, and then put the
muzzle to his eye and looked down the barrel. I hoped that
before long, by means of my gun, I might be able to gain the
respect of the people. I determined, therefore, not to fire until

OUR ARRIVAL AT A VILLAGE.
349
a favourable opportunity should occur. I in the meantime
took great care that no one should wrest the weapon out of
my hands. The people as we went along gathered round us,
some coming up and touching our clothes, others putting their
hands on our faces, evidently unable to understand the light
colour of our skins. When the people began to press too
closely round, the chief ordered them angrily to keep at a
distance; and some still persevering, he swung his spear round
and round, hitting them, without much ceremony, either on
their shins or heads, when they quickly retreated to a more
respectful distance.
I was very glad when at length the village appeared in
sight. It was situated on the borders of a small gulf, I will
call it, or the mouth of a stream near the lake, surrounded by
a belt of elegant fan-palms and a number of gigantic wild
fruit trees. Beyond it the lake was seen extending far as the
eye could reach, though in some places the water was concealed
from sight by vast masses of reeds and rushes of every shade
and hue, several beautiful little islands being dotted over it,
adorned with the richest vegetation, its many beauties
heightened by the brilliant rays of a tropical sun, somewhat
softened by the silvery mist which rose from the lake. The
village was very similar in character to that which Stanley
had visited,—so I concluded from his description. A plentiful
repast was placed before us by the chief's wife and her attend-
ants soon after we arrived. The principal dish consisted of
hippopotamus flesh, but there were plantains and cassava
porridge, with an abundance of wild fruits, the best of which
was the moshoma, both fresh and dried. We had seen the
tree growing outside the village. It grows to a great height.
The trunk was beautifully straight, and the branches did not
begin to spread out till very nearly at the summit. The fruit
can thus only be gathered when it falls to the ground. It is

then collected and exposed to the sun for some time. After it
has been dried it is pounded in a mortar, when it is fit for use.
In that state it will keep for some time. It is generally mixel
with water, and made into a sort of jelly, which tastes and
looks not unlike honey. It is especially useful for giving a
flavour to the otherwise tasteless cassava porridge.
The chief seemed very well disposed towards us, and now, as
the day was drawing to a close, he pointed to some mats in a
corner of his hut, and signified that we might sleep there. Har-
ing been in exercise all the day, in spite of our anxiety we slept
very soundly. The village was astir at an early hour. Though
the appearance of the people was not attractive, they were
more civilized than I had expected, and in the neighbourhood
of the village we saw a wide extent of fairly cultivated ground.
A bowl of cassava porridge, sweetened with moshoma, was
placed before us for our morning meal, and Natty and I did
ample justice to it. We now thought that we might let the
chief know we were in a hurry to go away, but he shook his
head, saying that that could not be. What his object was in
keeping us we were unable to comprehend. It was very
evident that he had made up his mind we should stay with
him, for some time at least. The more we urged him to allow
us to take our departure, the more determined he seemed to
keep us. At last I thought it wise to give up the point for the
present. We were allowed, however, to walk about, but were
always accompanied by either the chief himself, or four or five
of his attendants armed with spears, or bows and arrows. Some
of the latter were blunt-headed, and others were barbed, and,
I suspected, poisoned. We found a party of them setting out
for the forest at a short distance, and wishing to see what they
were about, we accompanied them. We found them engaged
in making what we afterwards discovered to be bee-hives.
They first took off the bark of some small trees, fifteen or

BEE-HIVES.
351
eighteen inches in diameter and about five feet in width.
They managed this by making two incisions right round the
trunk five feet apart. A longitudinal slit from one to the
other enabled them to detach the bark from the trunk. The
bark immediately assumed the shape it had before, and where
the slit was made it was sewn together again with the fibre of a
tree called the motuia. It thus formed a wooden cylinder. A
top and bottom were next fixed in it, formed of grass rope, the
lower one having a hole in the centre for the ingress and egress
of the bees. When the hives, as I shall call them, were com-
pleted, they carried them off, and placed them high up in lofty
trees in different parts of the forest. The bees which were fly-
ing about seeking habitations soon discovered them, and even
while we were there some were already taken possession of.
A piece of cloth was tied round the trunk of each tree, which,
when I came to inquire about the matter, I learned was looked
upon as a charm, and was sufficient to prevent any thieves
robbing the hives. In the woods a number of beautiful yellow
birds were flying about, some of which I afterwards saw in
cages in the house of the chief and several of his people. The
cages were very neatly made, and had traps on the tops to
entice their still free companions. The chief called the birds
cabazo, and I found that they were a species of canary. They
fed them on a plant called the lotsa, of which they cultivate a
considerable quantity for food, and wild canaries come and
help themselves, much as sparrows do to the seeds which the
gardeners have sown at home. I saw also several tame pigeons.
Early in the morning numerous other little songsters were
chirruping merrily away, some singing quite as loudly as our
English thrushes; and one, the king-hunter, Halcyon senegal-
ensis, makes a clear whirring sound like that of a whistle with
a pea in it. As we were returning, suddenly we saw stream-
ing out of a hole innumerable flying creatures. They formed a

A SINGULAR BANQUET.
dense column. Out they came; there seemed to be no end of
them. No sooner did our companions catch sight of them than
they made chase. As the insects began to scatter, they ap-
peared like snow-flakes floating about in the air. They were,
I suspected, white ants. After flying a considerable distance
they alighted on the ground, when, as we watched them, they
bent up their tails, unhooked their wings, and began immedi-
ately digging away with wonderful rapidity into the earth.
They had good need of haste, for birds were seen assembling
from all quarters, numerous hawks being among them, who be-
gan snapping them up with the greatest avidity. The natives,
too, immediately set to work to collect them, giving them s
pinch and putting them into baskets which they carried at
their sides. They were quite as eager to obtain them as the
birds were. On picking some of them up I found that they
were fully half an inch long, as thick as a crow-quill, and very
fat. One I caught had its wings on, and fancying from the ease
with which its fellows got rid of these appendages themselves
that I could help it, I made the attempt, but the wings appeared
to me as if hooked into the body, and I tore away a piece of the
flesh at the same time. As long as an ant was to be found, the
natives continued picking them up; and I suspect, out of the
whole brood but a small number could have reached places of
safety beneath the earth.
Our companions hurried home with their prizes, when they
immediately lighted fires, and roasted the ants, much as they
might have done chestnuts. All hands gathered round and
ate them eagerly, evidently considering them among the
greatest of delicacies. When they saw us watching them,
they offered us some. "No, no," said Natty; "I do not know
what I may do, but I have not come to that yet." The chief,
who had the larger share brought to him, sat on the ground,
rolling his eyes round as he dropped insect after insect into his

STALKING WILD ANIMALS.
353
mouth, evidently enjoying the repast, and seemed to look with
an eye of pity on us when we declined partaking of it.
Soon after this we observed a number of the men dressing
themselves up in a curious manner. Some had covered their
heads with caps made of the skins of water-antelopes, with the
horns still attached, part of the skin hanging down over their
shoulders so as to conceal the upper part of their bodies.
Others had manufactured the heads and beaks and long necks
of white cranes into coverings for their heads. Carrying their
bows and arrows in their hands, and quivers and darts at their
backs, they set forth to the bank of the lake. We watched
them crawling along amid the reeds, their heads alone being
visible, and looking very like the animals they intended to re-
present. I could see in the distance on a sedgy bank several
dark objects, which I guessed were crocodiles. The hunters
approached them cautiously, now stopping, just as an antelope
or crane would do to feed, now advancing again, now stopping,
till they had got within bow-shot of the creatures. Then,
quickly raising their weapons, they let fly at the same moment.
The result at that distance I could not ascertain, but it ap-
peared to me that, although I saw some movement among the
objects, yet two or more remained on the bank. The hunters
rushed on, now careless of exhibiting themselves, and in a
short time returned with some of the flesh of the creatures they
had killed. They immediately set out again, and as I watched
to ascertain the direction they took, I saw in the far dis-
tance several buffaloes going down to drink at the lake. They
were not back till dark; but, from the quantity of buffalo flesh
they brought with them, I had no doubt they had killed
one or two of the animals. Their plump cheeks and bodies
showed that they had an abundance of food; and they were
liberal in bestowing on us as much as we could desire.
Our friends remained for a couple of days, enjoying, after the

354
OUT WITH THE NATIVES,
African fashion, the abundance of food they had collected.
Whenever we signified our wish to depart, the chief, as
before, strenuously opposed it. In vain I protested agains
being detained, and made signs that we were determined to
go, whether he wished it or not. This made him very angry,
and from his manner when he left us, we feared that,
should we really make the attempt, he would use force to pre-
vent us. We therefore, as other people have done, had to
yield to circumstances, and to make the best of our position.
At last we agreed that we would appear to be contented with
our lot, so as, if possible, to throw our captors off their guard.
They were the most active and persevering hunters of any
people we had yet met with. The morning after the last piece
of buffalo flesh had been eaten (it had been rather too high for
our stomachs), we found that they were preparing to set off on
a hunting expedition, and we were not sorry to find that they
expected us to accompany them. I carried my gun: I should
have said I never let it out of my hand by day, and always
placed it under my mat by night, that no one might take it
from me. The chief, I fancy, looked upon it as my fetich, and
certainly regarded it with considerable awe. Whether or not
he had discovered that it had made the noise he had heard, I
could not as yet ascertain. Among the hunters was a young
man, whom we found to be the chief's son. He was one of the
best-looking of the tribe, though that is not saying much for
him. He was, however, good-natured, and seemed inclined to
make friends of us. We therefore kept by his side. About
thirty hunters set out, headed by the young chief. They were
armed with long spears and bundles of javelins, on which they
appeared to depend for killing their prey, trusting to their
activity and the knowledge of the animals they might attack
to get out of their way. We passed through the wood we had
before visited, and continued across an open prairie till we

A PERILOUS SEAT.
355
arrived at a forest of considerable size, extending on either
hand as far as the eye could reach. The band at once entered
it, spreading themselves out so as to beat a large part of the
wood, but yet continuing within call, if not always within sight
of each other. Natty and I followed the young chief. After
proceeding some way one of the men came up, and presently
we saw that they were all closing in towards a point a little
way ahead. As we advanced I saw, just over the bushes, the
back of a large white rhinoceros. The monster had come there
probably to enjoy the shade of the wood. It seemed to be
alone. The men all approached cautiously, concealing them-
selves under the brushwood till they were close upon the
creature, then, starting up, they hurled their darts at it. The
rhinoceros started forward, pursued by the hunters, the young
chief taking the lead. Suddenly the creature seemed to
stagger forward. Its front feet had sunk into a hole or arti-
ficial pit, I could not ascertain which. As it did so, instead
of struggling, it remained perfectly quiet. At this juncture
the young chief, with his spear in his hand, leaped on the
animal's back, intending apparently to plunge the spear into
its head behind the ear. At that moment it suddenly reared
itself up, and before our friend could leap off again began tear-
ing away at a rapid rate through the forest. He clung to his
seat in a wonderful way. His spear, however, before he could
strike it into the animal's neck, was hurled by a bough from
his hand. The hunters pursued, shrieking loudly through
fear of the life of their young chief. I too dreaded lest he
should be thrown off, when the animal would too probably
turn round upon him, and, before assistance could arrive, might
transfix him with its terrible horn. I was also afraid to fire,
lest I might wound the young man. His companions followed,
shrieking and shouting as fast as they could. Natty and I fol-
lowed after, but could not make way through the thick and

tangled underwood so rapidly as the blacks. We were there-
fore left behind. Presently the rhinoceros turned, and came tear
ing towards us, forcing its way through the underwood. Still
the black kept his seat, when the rhinoceros, swerving on one
side, passed under the bough of a tree, and in the same manner
that he had lost his spear he himself was hurled to the ground.
He attempted to rise, but his ankle had apparently been

SAVING THE YOUNG CHIEF.

sprained, and before he had gone many paces down he fell.
The enraged creature seemed aware that it had got rid of its
rider. It stopped, and eyeing him with a savage glance,
rushed towards him with its horn pointed at his body. Now,
I felt, was the time for me to fire, or the young man would
certainly be killed. I had, providentially, a rest for my gun,
and pulling the trigger, my bullet hit the rhinoceros directly
behind the ear. The impetus it had gained sent it on
several paces. A loud shriek rent the air; but just before
it reached the young chief over it fell, and lay perfectly still.
We ran forward to help up our young friend. He glanced up
in my countenance with a look which showed that he was
grateful for the service I had rendered him. He then took
my hand and pressed it to his lips. In a few minutes the
rest of the hunters came up, when he addressed them, and,
I concluded, was telling them what I had done. I certainly
never fired a shot with so much satisfaction. The men came
round Natty and I, their whole demeanour completely changed,
evidently looking upon us as heroes worthy of renown, while
some begged to examine the wonderful weapon which had done
the deed.
As soon as the hunters had cut up the rhinoceros, we returned
in triumph to the village. The chief showed that he appre-
ciated the service I had rendered him in saving the life of his
son by warmly embracing us—a ceremony, by-the-by, with
which we would gladly have dispensed. We were now, instead
of being looked upon as prisoners at large, treated with every
consideration ; and when I signified that the only reward we
required was to be allowed to return to our homes, I under-
stood him to beg that we would remain one day longer, when
he would accompany us as far as he could venture to go.
I suspected that his tribe were at war with their neighbours,
as scouts were constantly coming and going, and that this was

the reason why he could not accompany us in our search for
Leo and Mango. We would gladly at once have set off to look
for them; but when we showed a wish to go to the south, he
made us understand that they were already carried a long way
off, and that, coming from his village, we should be looked
upon as enemies, and probably murdered. This we thought so
likely, that we agreed it would be prudent to return home
to obtain the assistance of our friends.
There was a grand feast at night on the flesh of the rhino-
ceros, and dancing and singing were kept up till a late hour-
an amusement we would willingly have avoided.
Natty and I talked over the possibility of returning in the
canoe, but there were no paddles; and we could scarcely have
propelled her, even had we made some. We begged the chief
to take care of her till our return, and this he promised, as far
as we could understand, faithfully to do.
Next morning we again expressed our anxiety to set off, but
the chief showed no inclination to let us go; and each time
that we pressed him, he signified that we must remain a little
longer. We were the less unwilling to do this, in the hope
that we might, in the meantime, gain some news of Leo and
Mango, and we once more urged the chief to try and discover
where they were. He let us understand that he wanted first
to have another hunt, and that I must bring my gun to assist
him. I, of course, expressed my readiness to comply with his
wishes, but resolved not to expend much of our powder, as we
should require it on our return home. We were allowed to
wander about the village wherever we liked, but we observed
that all the time we were carefully watched. The women and
children always started up with looks of astonishment when
we came near them, the young ones running away, frightened
at our white skins, just as European children would be alarmed
at the sudden appearance of a black man among them. On

MODE OF OBTAINING SALT.
359
the outskirts of the village, near the river, we came upon a
group of people employed in burning large quantities of a
coarse-looking rush and stalks of a plant which I had seen
growing in a marsh near at hand. I had, the day before, by
chance tasted the water in the marsh, and found it slightly
brackish. On examining the proceedings of the people, I found
that they were employed in manufacturing salt. Before them
were a number of funnel-shaped baskets formed of grass rope.
These were filled with the ashes, and water being poured into
them, percolated through the basket-work into calabashes
placed below to receive it. They were then put out in the
sun, and the water evaporating, left a small amount of salt in
each. Although there was not a sufficient quantity for salting
fish or meat, the supply was ample for ordinary use, and we
were glad to purchase some with a few beads which we had
remaining in our pockets. Amply supplied as we are in Eng-
land with that necessary article, we can scarcely appreciate its
value in a country where it is not to be obtained without great
difficulty. Natty and I agreed to husband our little stock
carefully, as for the last few days we had felt the want of it
when eating rhinoceros flesh. We had observed several ani-
mals coming down to this salt marsh to chew the coarse grass
or to lick up the salt collected on the reeds.
As we were walking along we heard the chief calling to us,
and found that he was prepared to set out on his proposed
expedition. We saw as we proceeded many large animals in
the distance, but they had evidently learned caution from the
attacks made on them by the natives, and would not approach
the village. As we appeared they took to flight, keeping al-
ways a long way out of range of our companions' arrows. Once
I got near a rhinoceros, but was unwilling to fire without feel-
ing tolerably sure of hitting the animal, as I had determined
not to throw away a shot if I could help it. At length we got

A HERD OF GIRAFFES.
into a region where we could obtain cover among low bushes,
and occasionally clumps of trees. The natives took advantage
of this, and hiding themselves under bushes, clumps of tall reeds
or grass, proceeded for some distance. Natty and I followed
their example. At last I saw, a little way from a grjre of
trees, a herd of cameleopards quietly feeding. The blacks lag
like logs of wood on the ground, every now and then creeping
slowly on when the heads of the animals were turned away
from them. Still they were too far off for me to make sure oi
a shot. I saw, a little way on, a solitary bush. I thought i
I could reach it I might be able to bring down one of the
nearest giraffes. The natives watched me eagerly as, trailing
my gun after me, I cautiously approached the bush. I wa
very anxious to kill an animal, in order still further to estab-
lish our credit, hoping thereby also more speedily to obtain
permission to depart. I could not help constantly think-
ing of the alarm our prolonged absence would cause our
friends.
As I crept on I saw the giraffes turning their heads, raised
high in air, now in one direction, now in the other, as if they
suspected danger. I should have said that they were near a
small grove of trees, from the branches of which some of the
herd were plucking the leaves. This grove had partly cor-
cealed our party, or we should not have approached so easily.
I had never prided myself on being a sportsman; but I had
steady nerves, and of late had given good practice to my eye:
and thoroughly knew the range of my rifle. The bush was
gained. A large bull cameleopard stood the nearest, every not
and then turning his head to pluck a bunch of leaves from a
branch which no other animal could have reached, but still
apparently on the watch for danger. I raised myself on me
knee, and lifting my rifle, took a steady aim at his breast.

minutes the wounded giraffe was surrounded by a band of

EFFECTS OF A GIRAFFE'S KICK.
dancing, shrieking, shouting blacks, delighted at the thought
of the meal he was about to afford them. Natty and I stood
at a little distance, when suddenly we saw the giraffe raise his
neck high above the heads of the shrieking band. Presently
out went his legs, and the chief and his followers were seen
scattered here and there on every side, some prostrate on the
ground, others scampering off to avoid the fury of the kicks of
the dying animal. I thought some of them must have been
killed. It was his last effort; however, and again sinking
down, he lay perfectly quiet. The blacks picked themselves
up, showing that at all events no mortal injury had been done,
and again assembled round the body of the animal, though
keeping at a more cautious distance till they had ascertained
that he was really dead. On finding this to be the case,
they sprang on the body, and began hacking away at it with
their knives, till, in a short time, it presented nothing but a
mass of mutilated flesh. The chief seemed highly delighted
at our success, and I took the opportunity of again urging him
to allow us to go, trying to make him understand that I would
return, if he wished it, with companions who were still better
able to kill game for him than I was.
As a large portion of the day had been expended, without
attempting to seek for more game the chief led us back to the
village.
" What do you think he will do ?" asked Natty as we walked
along. "If he will not let us go willingly, I propose that
we take French leave, as Leo would say, and I do not think
he will attempt to stop us by force."
At a little distance from the village there stood, under a
grove of trees, a hideous idol, at the top of a stout post. It
was elaborately carved, representing rather the face of an ape
than that of a man, and covered with red, yellow, and black
paint. The hunters placed some of the meat of the giraffe

before it, on a block of stone ; but only a small quantity, and
that of the least valuable parts. I guessed by this that they
had no great respect for their idol. " Poor people," said Natty,
" perhaps they guess that they can cheat even it, and that it
will not be able to distinguish between the best and worst
parts." Natty and I were also tempted to stop. He made
signs to the chief, touching his own ears, and then shaking his
head and pointing to the ears of the idol, to signify that it
could not hear. Then he pointed to its mouth, and in the
same way tried to explain that it could not eat the meat placed
before it. Then he touched its head, to show that it could
not understand. We fancied that the chief comprehended his
meaning, for he laughed, and cast a contemptuous look at the
ugly block. Although he did this, however, in our presence,
it is possible that he still had some superstitious fear of the
idol, or of the evil spirit it might have been intended to re-
present.
"The poor Africans have no knowledge of the powerful,
kind, and merciful God," observed Natty. "The beings to
whom they pay respect they believe to be malign spirits, who
will do them harm if they do not attempt to propitiate them
by gifts and observances."
I may observe here that we never paid the slightest respect
to the negro idols, and never were treated worse in consequence;
indeed, I believe that they would have despised us if we had
done so, for though they may fancy that their idols have some-
thing to do with them, they believe that they have no power
over the white men.
There was great rejoicing in the village on the arrival of the
flesh of the giraffe, the greater portion of which was consumed
long before the night was over. While seated with the chief,
I again asked him to let us go, and he seemed to intimate that
he would do so the following morning. While we were at

supper, Natty proposed that we should hide as much food as
would last us for the following day. "A good idea," I ob-
served. The pockets of our shooting-jackets were capacious.
Whenever the chief was looking another way, we contrived to
slip in large pieces of meat and cassava cake, besides pieces of
plantain. They made somewhat of a mess in our pockets, but
we could not be particular. As the chief consumed double as
much as we hid away, he was not surprised at the rapid dis-
appearance of the food, and had not observed our manœuvre.
Natty and I lay down to rest, hoping that before another
sunset we might be far on our way homewards.

OUR ESCAPE AND JOURNEY THROUGH THE WILDERNESS.
AWOKE just as day broke, and roused up Natty.
"Where are we?" he exclaimed. "Oh, I was
GDL dreaming, and so happy!"
W "We have realities before us," I remarked.
"Are you prepared for starting ?"
· Yes, yes," he whispered; " by all means. Probably the
people, after their debauch, will sleep soundly, and we may get
some way before we are overtaken."
We put on our jackets, which we had placed at our sides,
having slept covered up with mats provided for us. We then
cautiously pushed open the reed-formed door, and stood look-
ing out up and down the street of the village. The stars were
still twinkling overhead, though gradually growing dimmer as
the gray light of morning advanced. I carefully marked the
course we were to take, and observing all the doors closed, we
now sallied forth, and crept cautiously along towards the end
of the street which opened out in the direction of our home.
Every moment we expected to be pursued. If we were, we
agreed to put a bold face on the matter, and to claim the right
of departing. Fortunately the inhabitants, from having sat up
the greater part of the night eating, were sound asleep, and
we hoped that our flight would not be discovered till we were

CHEATING THE GUARD.
a considerable distance on the road. We stole on, treading as
lightly as possible in the centre of the street. We could hear
loud snores proceeding from some of the huts. The sound
gave us confidence. It also showed us how easily a native vil-
lage might be surprised by enemies. The careless, thoughtless
people seemed to have forgotten that they were at war with
their neighbours. We reached the end of the street. There
was a gateway, but the gate was closed. On examining it we
found that it might be easily opened; but I feared that while
we were doing so the proper guards might pounce out on us.
They too had left their posts, and we were reassured by hear-
ing loud snores coming forth from a hut close at hand. I did
not like to leave the gate open. Natty whispered to me that
he thought he could climb over it. There was no great diffi-
culty in doing that; the only fear was that on dropping on the
other side we might be heard. However, there was no time
to be lost. I helped Natty up, and he scrambled down with-
out making any noise on the opposite side. I followed, and
reached the top. I might without danger have dropped down,
but, for the reason I have mentioned, I thought it better to
lower myself gradually. My foot, however, slipped when hali-
way, and the wood-work creaked loudly, while the noise I
made in falling would, I feared, arouse the sleeping guard.
We stopped for a minute. Still the snoring sounds came loud
as before. There was no necessity for further delay. We
therefore, walking as noiselessly as we could, hurried on
towards the north-west. We followed a well-beaten path,
which I had before noted as leading in the direction we wished
to go. As soon as we had got far enough from the village to
make it unlikely that our footsteps would be heard, we began
running, I leading, and Natty following close at my heels. I
had been a good runner, but was out of practice. Natty, how-
ever, was very active, and easily kept up with me. We ran on

REST BY THE WAY.
367
for an hour or more without stopping, till we were bathed in
perspiration, and I felt that I could not go much further with-
out rest.
"Do stop," said Natty. "Even if the blacks discovered our
escape directly after we left the village, it must be some time
before they can overtake us."
"You are right," I answered; "a little rest will enable us
to go faster afterwards."
We sat down under a wide-spreading tree. The shade was
pleasant; for the sun, which had already shot up high into the
heavens, sent down his rays with great force. The air was full
of life. Insects were buzzing about, and gaily-decked parrots
flew from bough to bough, while the monkeys came out of their
leafy covers and looked down upon us with astonishment. We
took the opportunity of eating some of the food we had brought
in our pockets. It was not very nice, but it satisfied our hunger.
I was soon ready to proceed. Natty, however, urged me to
rest a little longer, thinking that I should be over-fatigued
by such unusual exercise.
"Come along," I said; "the further we are off, the less
likely our friends at the village will be to insist on our return-
ing with them."
We went on as before. Sometimes a snake glided across
our path, but quickly got out of our way, more frightened at
us than we were at seeing it. Now we heard a rustling in the
underwood, and a panther or hyena dashed away amid the
foliage without thinking of attacking us. We had gone on at
a slower pace than at first, when, by the appearance of the
sun in the sky, I saw that it must be noon. I now once more
called a halt, for I felt tired myself, and was afraid that Natty
must be equally so. We had for some time been crossing the
open prairie, steering, by the sun and the distant line of moun-
tain, as I hoped in the right direction. Before us lay a thick

wood. Natty proposed that we should take shelter within it,
as, even should the natives closely pursue us, we might there
have the prospect of remaining concealed while they passed by.
"I am afraid that you have scarcely yet recovered your
strength sufficiently to march on all day without rest," said
Natty; "and as I could not find my way without you, I hope,
for my sake as well as yours, that you will stop for an hour
or so here."
This argument prevailed with me; for I was so anxious to
reach home, and felt so strong, that I should have gone on till
night would prevent us from proceeding further. We accord.
ingly entered the wood, and after making our way a short dis-
tance into it, came to a small open spot, free of trees or thick
underwood.
"I propose that we build a hut of boughs here," said Natty.
"We can take our turns to go to sleep in it, and it will help
to guard us against the attacks of lions or other beasts."
With our axes we cut down a sufficient number of boughs
to form a shelter, and having planted them close together, a
hut was formed which would, I hoped, afford us ample pro-
tection. As the sun struck down into the woodland glade
with great force, we took our seats within the hut for the sake
of the shade, and discussed a further portion of our provisions.
I saw that Natty was very sleepy, though he was trying his
utmost to keep awake. I therefore told him to lie down, and
that I would watch. Finding a branch of a tree torn off, pere
haps by lightning, I chopped a piece of sufficient length to
serve as a pillow, and having examined it carefully to see that
no scorpion or other stinging insect lurked within, I placed
it under his head, and sat down at the entrance of our leafy
bower to keep watch, with my gun by my side, ready for action
at a moment's notice. I felt somewhat drowsy, but made
every effort to arouse myself, feeling the importance of keep-

MY VISITORS.

ing awake. Presently I heard a slight rustling, as if some
animal was moving among the bushes near me; but without
shifting my position I could see nothing. Then I heard a
sound as if creatures were nibbling grass or leaves. This
made me sure that no savage beast caused the sounds, and I
sat quiet, expecting soon to discover what creatures they
were. Presently two beautiful fawns came in sight. They
did not perceive me, but went on quietly grazing, unconscious
of the presence of one of their many enemies. At length they
came full before me. "Shall I fire?" I asked myself. "One
of them would afford us ample food till we could reach home."
I was afraid, however, that should I move to raise my rifle,
and get into a better position for taking aim, they would in-
stantly be off, and bound into the thicket before I could even
fire. While I was considering (though sportsmen may laugh
at me, I own I was unwilling to kill one of the beautiful
creatures), another, of a very different character, appeared on
the scene. Suddenly I caught sight of a pair of glaring eyes
amid the thick gloom of the thicket on my left. I saw a large
tiger-looking animal of a fawn colour, the back variegated with
round black spots. I guessed at once that the creature was a
cheetah, or hunting leopard, and thought it was lying in wait
for the deer till they should approach within distance of its
spring. I had no idea, however, that it could make so prodi-
gious a bound as it at that moment did; for scarcely had I seen
it, when it sprang out of its ambush, and alighted on the un-
fortunate buck, which it struck down with one tremendous
blow. Seizing my rifle, and throwing myself on my knee, I
took a steady aim, and the ball entered the cheetah's head.
It sprang up, dragging its prey with it, but instantly sank
down, and rolled over dead. Natty sprang to his feet at the
report. The cheetah had settled the question whether the
buck should die, for the poor creature was so mangled, though

AN UNEXPECTED SUPPLY OF VENISON.
not killed outright, that we saw it would be a mercy to put it
out of its sufferings. This we immediately did. Its more
fortunate companion had escaped into the open ground.
We lost no time in cutting up our prize, for the meat we
had brought with us was already scarcely fit to eat, and we
both confessed to feeling very hungry again.
"We may as well light a fire and cook it," I said. "We
must take care, however, not to set the wood in a blaze."
There was ample fuel about, and choosing a spot where the
grass was green, and did not readily burn, we piled up the
sticks we collected. I had a tinder-box and matches in my
wallet, and thus we soon had a good fire burning. Natty was
only afraid that it might betray our hiding-place, should our
pursuers draw near; but I thought it unlikely that they would
overtake us so soon; besides, it was important to secure the
abundant supply of food which had been so providentially
thrown in our way. In a short time we had some pieces of
venison roasting in woodland fashion on forked sticks before the
fire. While Natty attended to them I examined the cheetah.
It was the same animal which is tamed and then trained to
chase the antelope in India and Persia. The tip of the nose
was black, while I observed that a black stripe passed from the
inner angle of the eye to the angle of the mouth. I was struck
by its eyes, which were remarkably large, with circular pupils.
It had a long tail, curled up at its extremity, which was white.
On the shoulders the hair was longer than elsewhere, and
formed a sort of mane. It was a somewhat slender animal,
with longer legs in proportion to its body than either the lion
or tiger possesses.
Having selected the best parts of the venison, and wrapped
them up in leaves to carry with us, we recommenced our meal
on the portion we had cooked. The salt we had purchased :
few days before was now particularly acceptable, and we both

had meat, we hoped, sufficient to sustain us for many hours.
Now greatly refreshed, we prepared to proceed on our journey.
We first put out the fire, however, that there might be no risk
of setting the forest in a blaze.

"We must leave the cheetah and the rest of the deer to the
birds and beasts of prey which are sure to visit it before
long," I observed. "And now, Natty, let us be off."
Scarcely had I uttered the words when he touched my arm.
"Stay," he said; "I am sure I heard voices in the distance."
We listened. There could be no doubt of it. The sounds
drew nearer. The tones were very similar to those we had
heard during our stay at the village.
"They must be our late friends come to look after us," I
observed. "If we are discovered, we will put a good face on
the matter."

OUR FRIENDS ONCE MORE.
"Would it not be better to go and meet them at once, and
present them with the game we have killed ?" said Natty.
I agreed with him; and peering out from our shelter, I
recognized the chief and his son, with a band of followers.
Loading ourselves, therefore, with as much venison as we
could carry, we sallied boldly forth, and were soon face to face
with our late hosts. Their look of astonishment when they
saw us and the meat we carried was very great. By the ex-
pression of their countenances, however, we saw that they were
not offended. As far as we could understand, the chief only
reproached us for going away without bidding him farewell.
I felt myself somewhat embarrassed, for I could not help
seeing that he had intended to let us go as he promised. We
showed that we had enough meat for ourselves, and presented
him with the larger portion. Having done this, we led him
and his companions to the spot where the cheetah and the re-
mainder of the deer lay. His companions quickly cut up the
cheetah as we had done the deer, and divided the flesh among
them. We then pointed in the direction we wished to go, and
the chief taking my hand, and his son Natty's, we proceeded
onwards in the most friendly way. At length my conductor
came to a full stop, and, looking me in the face, seemed again
to be reproaching me for having left his village by stealth. I
tried, as before, to explain that we were in a hurry to reach
our friends; and as he had detained us longer than we wished,
we were afraid he might still keep us prisoners. Whether I
was right in my conjectures as to his meaning, I am not quite
certain. He, at all events, showed that he was friendly dis-
posed towards us.
He now signified that he could go no further, and, pointing
ahead, intimated that we should find enemies in our path if
we went direct. He then, pointing to the left, advised us, as
I understood him, to make a circuit so as to avoid the danger.


## p. 375 (#379) ############################################

OUR PARTING.:
375
Having satisfied himself that we clearly understood his advice,
he and his son warmly shook our hands, their followers imi-
tating their example. Such a shaking of hands I had never
before gone through. I observed as I turned away that there
was an expression of sorrow in their countenances, which arose
partly, perhaps, from parting with us, and partly from the
dangers which they apprehended we should have to encounter.
We now took our way to the south-west, skirting the edge
of the forest, which appeared to extend towards the lake.
We had not gone far, when, turning round, I saw the young
chief stopping and gazing at us. When he found that he was
observed, leaving his party, he darted after us, and once more
took our hands, pressing them warmly, intimating that if his
father would give him leave he would accompany us. His
father's voice, however, called him back, and, with a look of
regret, he again left us.
. "At all events," observed Natty, " we must acknowledge
that gratitude can exist in the breasts of these Africans."
"It does certainly in that of our friend," I said. "They
generally have a very different character bestowed on them."
As long as the blacks remained in sight, we could see the
young chief every now and then turning and casting lingering
glances towards us.
We now pushed on, hoping to find some secure place where
we might pass the night. We were fortunate in finding a tree
with wide-spreading branches, radiating so closely from a
common centre that they formed a wide and secure platform on
which we could rest without fear of falling off. We climbed
up as soon as we had supped, and passed the night in perfect
quiet.
I need not mention the incidents of the two following days.
We were cheered as we trudged on with the expectation of
soon rejoining our friends.


## p. 376 (#380) ############################################

376
BUILDING A HUT.
It struck me, on the third day of our journey, as we walked on,
that Natty was less inclined to speak than usual ; and looking
at his face, I saw that he was deadly pale. He did not com-
plain, however. I asked him if anything was the matter. He
said no; he only felt a little fatigued, and thought that he
should be revived by a night's rest. I proposed that we
should stop at once; but to this he would not consent, de-
claring that he was well able to get on as long as daylight
lasted.
The country though which we passed was similar to what I
have already described. We proceeded in as direct a line as
we could steer, keeping the distant hills on our right, instead
of going towards them.
I proposed the following day to begin circling round more
directly for them, as I hoped that we had now gone far enough
south to avoid the village against which the chief and his sou
had warned us. I should not have hesitated, however, to have
gone amongst the people, had I not feared that we might be
detained by them as we had been by their neighbours.
The forest as we advanced grew thinner, and we found the
trees at length standing so widely apart that we could see the
plain beyond them. As the wood might afford us more
shelter than the open plain, and the sun was already sinking
towards the blue hills in the distance, we agreed to halt. As
I saw that Natty was not able to exert himself, I bade him
sit down while I cut branches to form a hut, and collected
wood for a fire. As I could not tell what wild animals might
be roaming about around us, I determined to make our hut
sufficiently strong to resist an attack.
I selected a tree of a considerable diameter, which served
as a back to the hut. I stuck the uprights in the soft
ground among the roots. There were plenty of vines, with
which I bound the cross pieces to the trunk and to the up-

rights. The intervening spaces I filled up with light per-
pendicular poles. While I was gathering a further supply, I
found that Natty had interwoven them with branches and
vines, thus forming tolerably substantial walls. Some of the
boughs thrown over the top served for a roof, which, however,
would not have kept out a tropical shower ; but there was
no fear, we thought, of rain. Darkness was now coming
rapidly on, but I had not yet a sufficient supply of wood to
keep up our fire all the night; and I told Natty to make it
up and light it while I went to collect more broken branches,
of which there were numbers lying about, torn off probably
by a hurricane. While I was engaged, I saw the fire blaze
up, and hoped that Natty would have some venison roasted by
the time I had finished my work. Having brought a couple
of loads and placed them down by the side of the hut, I went
away for a third. I had got as many branches as I could
carry, and returned with them towards our encampment, ex-
pecting to hear Natty hail me as I drew near; but as I
approached the fire I could not distinguish him. I called, but
no answer came. My heart sank within me. I was afraid
that some accident had happened. Again and again I called.
Throwing down the branches, I hurried on towards the hut,
when what was my grief to see him extended on the ground
at the entrance, and some little way from the fire! I knelt
down by his side and put my hand to his heart. It beat,
though feebly. I examined him, but could find no wound.
He had swooned, apparently from exhaustion. Our water-
bottles were full, as we had replenished them at the last stream
we passed, knowing that we might afterwards have to go many
miles without finding more. His whole dress was so loose
that there was no necessity to undo any part of it; but I
sprinkled his face with water, and then poured a few drops
down his throat. Still he lay without moving.

NATTY'S INDISPOSITION.
"Natty, my dear Natty, what has happened to you ? Speak
to me! Speak !" I could not help exclaiming.
I had no stimulant, no medicine of any sort. I must trust,
I knew, alone to Nature, or rather, I should say, to the kind
Being who directs its laws. To Him I looked up and prayed
that my young friend might recover. Forgetting everything
but Natty, I continued kneeling, holding his head on my arm.
At length, by the light of the fire, as night came on, I saw
his eyes opening.
"Push on, Andrew," he whispered ; "we may still keep
ahead of them! I will run as fast as you do!"
I saw that his mind was wandering. Then he heaved a
deep sigh.
"Are you better, Natty ?" I asked.
"Oh yes. Where am I ?" he asked, staring about him.
I told him I thought he had fainted, and begged that he
would take some food and then lie down. He had already
torn off some of the leaves from the boughs, and had made a
sufficient bed for us; but, of course, we intended that only
one should sleep at a time.
At length, to my great joy, he was able to sit up by him.
self on the ground. Finding this, I went to the fire to get
the venison, which had been left roasting before it. As may
be supposed, it was somewhat burned, but I was able to cut
as many small slices from it as he could eat. After tasting a
piece, he said, "Do you take it, Andrew. I do not think I
want it." I pressed him, however; and in a little time he
was able to make a tolerable meal. I then placed him inside
the hut, telling him that I would sit up and keep watch till
it was his turn, of course intending to let him sleep on the
whole of the night, if he could do so.
I then made up the fire, finished the piece of burned venison,
and sat myself down in front of the hut. I looked in several

times, and was thankful at length to find that Natty was asleep.
I felt a strong inclination to sleep also, and had the greatest
difficulty in keeping myself awake. Whenever I felt myself
nodding, I got up and walked about; but I was tired, and
certainly required rest. At last I did what many a sentinel has
done under similar circumstances. Though believing I was
quite awake, I fell fast asleep. Even in my dreams I thought
I was getting up, walking about, and then sitting down again,
and then going to look in at Natty. Then I thought I made
up the fire. I was somewhat surprised that it did not blaze
as readily as before. By this time I way fast asleep. At
length I thought I went in to look at Natty again, when what
was my horror not to find him.
I awoke, to find myself leaning against the entrance at the
end of our hut. The fire was very low, a few glowing embers
alone remaining. The night was dark. As I looked round
me, trying to open my eyes wide, what was my dismay to
see numerous pairs of shining orbs gazing at me through
the gloom! That they were the eyes of wild beasts I was
convinced, though of what description I could not tell. The
usual night sounds of an African forest alone reached my ears.
The eyes seemed to be drawing nearer and nearer; and now sud-
denly a chorus of loud sharp barks and snarls burst forth, and
by the faint light cast by the fire I could see a number of
animals approaching the spot. I now guessed that they were
wild dogs, a species of hyena, which hunt in packs like wolves;
or perhaps true hyenas, and would prove, I dreaded, formidable
assailants. Through the gloom I saw just then another body,
which I guessed was a second pack arriving, thus causing the
angry remonstrances of the first. A pile of firewood lay
near me. I threw some of the sticks on my fire, hoping, if it
blazed up, they would not attempt to pass it. My gun I had
ready by my side ; but as I could only kill one at a time, I

was afraid, should I begin the assault, I should find it a hani
matter to drive them off. I did not like to wake Natty, in-
deed, in his weak state he would have been of little assistance,
The effect of throwing the sticks on the fire was, at first, to
dull it, and I was afraid I had put it out altogether. This
made the creatures draw still nearer. I rose to my feet and
stood at the door of the hut, resolving, should they come, to
defend my young companion to the last. If they seized me,
I knew that my fate and his would be sealed. The brutes
kept rushing backwards and forwards within a few yards of
the fire, growling and yelping furiously. I was surprised that
the noise did not awake Natty. His sleep, doubtless, was pró-
duced by utter exhaustion. I was afraid, however, that if I
fired, Natty would be startled. I therefore called out to him,
"Do not be alarmed when you hear the report of my rifle !
Natty! Natty! awake!" I called out several times. I began
to fear that he was senseless, or even that worse had happened.
"Natty! my dear Natty! what is the matter?" I again shouted
out.
The effect of my voice was what I had not expected, for my
savage assailants on hearing it began to retreat to a more respect-
ful distance. I thought that I might venture to enter the hut
to see what was the matter with Natty. The brutes, however,
directly I was silent, again came on. I was relieved too by
hearing Natty ask, "What is it all about, Andrew ? Hare
you found Leo and Mango? I have been dreaming about
them so much." Greatly relieved, I replied that some wild
animals were in the neighbourhood, and that I was going to fire
at them; and once more I turned my face towards our enemies.
The brutes were again drawing nearer. Advancing a pace
or two to the fire, I gave it a kick with my foot. This made
the flames leap up. By their light I saw that a fresh actor
had come upon the stage and attracted the attention of the

savage brutes. A huge serpent had crawled out from among
the bushes. It sprang upon one of the dogs, which immedi-
ately, writhing in agony, sank on the ground. Instead of
taking to flight, however, they rushed at the creature, one of
them seizing it by the back, but not before one or two others
were bitten. The rest then set on it, and tearing it to pieces,
quickly devoured the greater portion, leaving the head, on
account I concluded of the venom it contained. Not satisfied
with their victory over the snake, they once more advanced
towards me with hideous growls and yelps. Seeing that it
would be dangerous to allow them to approach nearer, I took
aim at a large animal, which appeared to be the leader of the
pack. I knocked him over, and he lay struggling on the ground
yelping loudly. His companions came round him, and gave
me time to reload. I did not wish to expend my ammunition
uselessly, so, stooping down, I seized a burning stick, giving
another poke to the fire as I did so, and then waved the brand
round and round, shouting loudly in a gruff voice, and ordering
the dogs to be off. Though they did not understand what I
said, the tone of my voice had the effect I desired; and,
greatly to my relief, barking and yelping, they scampered
away, I shouting after them. The animal I had shot kicked
his last as they disappeared in the gloom of the night, and I
hoped that I was rid of them.
· Having thrown some more sticks on the fire, I went back
to Natty. I felt his hand; it appeared very feverish, and I
was still more alarmed by hearing the incoherent expressions
he uttered. Weary as I was, I could not venture again to go
to sleep. I sat down, therefore, by the side of my poor young
companion, moistening his fevered lips every now and then
with water, and bathing his forehead. Still it was with the
greatest difficulty I could keep my eyes open. Sometimes I
got up and walked about in front of the hut, and threw a few

more sticks on the fire. I myself, it must be remembered, had
scarcely recovered from my illness. Having again made up
the fire, increasing it to nearly double the size, I once more
sat down by Natty's side. I talked aloud, and kept pinching
myself, in the hope that by so doing I might keep awake.
But exhausted nature at length had its way—my head dropped
on my bosom, and I was asleep, so soundly indeed, that I doubt
if the loudest noise would have aroused me.
In spite of my intentions, I must have had some hours'
sleep. I was awaked by a bright light striking my eyes, and
opening them, they were dazzled by the almost horizontal rays
of the rising sun coming across the plain. My ears were assailed
also by a loud barking and yelping, and I saw close to me the
pack of savage dogs which had paid me a visit the night before,
setting furiously on the body of their companion whom I had
shot. The light of the sun had awaked me in time, or they
might have made an attack on the hut before I was ready for
their reception. I let them devour their companion, which
they speedily did, leaving not a particle of skin or bone
behind them; one running off with one piece, and one with
another. The remainder, disappointed of their share of the
prey, then turned their savage eyes towards me. Once more
I shouted loudly, and taking off my jacket, waved it at them.
Again, to my satisfaction, off the creatures scampered; and
I hoped that I had seen the last of them. They had not
touched the bodies of their companions bitten by the serpent,
which had already become putrid. As I dragged the carcases
to a distance, I felt thankful that the dogs had visited us, as,
had they not come when they did, the snake might have found
its way to the hut, and bitten Natty or me. I could not tell
its species, but thought that it was probably the same which
had made its appearance on the island when we were escaping
from the Pangwes.

CHAPTER XVIII.
MY ADVENTURES WITH NATTY IN THE DESERT.
N re-entering the hut I found that Natty was still
h sleeping; but his slumbers were greatly troubled,
and he had evidently much fever on him. Oh, how
I wished that David had been with us; for, with all
Y my anxiety, I did not know how to treat him.
One thing was certain, he was utterly unable to travel.
I was unwilling even to go out of sight of the hut, lest some
wild beast might in the meantime come near it. I must do
so, however, before long, I saw; for our slender stock of water
was already almost exhausted, and cold water, I felt sure, was
absolutely necessary for him. In what direction I was most
likely to find it I could not tell. The last stream we crossed
was some distance back, and I might have to go a long way
across the plain before coming to another ; indeed, in no direc-
tion did the appearance of the country indicate a stream or
fountain. This thought caused me the greatest anxiety. I
would have endured any amount of thirst, I thought, rather
than not give Natty what he required. I remembered that
the orphan boy was committed to my charge by his father,
and as a father would treat his son, so was I bound to treat
him.
After sitting by his side for some time and eating a slender

NO SIGNS OF WATER.
breakfast, I took my gun and walked about the hut, now going
in one direction, now in the other, in the hope of finding
indications of water. Perhaps, I thought, I may kill a parrot
or pigeon, or some other bird, which may be more palatable
to him than stronger meat. I went further and further, but
still could find no signs of water. While I was at the furthest
point the dread seized me, that although the hut was in sight
some creature might have stolen in, and I hurried back, dread-
ing to find my fears realized. Not till I had entered the hut
and knelt down by his side was I satisfied that he was safe.
He was still sleeping, and I hoped he might thereby recover
his strength. After sitting for some time by his side, I again
got up and cut a number of boughs. These I stuck in round
the entrance, so that no creature could possibly get in. I now
ventured to go rather further from the hut, but could not
bring myself to lose sight of the tree under which it was
situated. I continued looking about for birds; for though I
saw some at a distance, I could not get near enough to be
certain of a shot; and as I said before, I could not venture to
throw any of my ammunition away. I was beginning to feel
very thirsty, and had recourse to chewing leaves, hoping that
it would relieve me. It had, however, but little effect. At
last, greatly out of spirits, I returned to the hut. Natty
awoke as I pulled aside the boughs. He scarcely seemed to
know me, however. I gave him a little water, and I thought,
after taking it, he looked rather better, so I gave him more.
I had been sitting by his side for some time, when I heard
him whisper_"You had better go on, Andrew; I will follow
by-and-by, but do not stop for me."
"That will never do," I answered, thankful to hear him
speak. "You will get well shortly, and then we will go on
together."
"I will try to go with you now," he said, trying to rise ;

ASLEEP ON MY WATCII.

but he sank back immediately, unable to lift himself from the
ground. He uttered a sigh on discovering his weakness.
I passed the remainder of the day as I had the commence-
ment. As I saw evening approaching I collected a large sup-
ply of broken branches to serve as firewood, and then made up
a semicircular heap, which I intended to keep blazing all the
night. I was sorry that I had not slept during the day, that
I might the more easily keep awake while on my watch. I
took some supper, though, in consequence of the thirst from
which I was suffering, I felt little disposed to eat; but still I
was unwilling to exhaust our water by drinking more than a
few drops. I knew that the next day I must inevitably go in
search of some. My young companion's life might depend
upon my finding it. To avoid the risk of being surprised
should I fall asleep, after I had lighted the fire and seen that
it blazed up thoroughly, I took my seat inside the hut, and
secured the boughs as before. In spite of my resolution to
keep awake, I had not been seated on the ground more than
an hour or so before I felt sleep stealing over me. At length
I tried to arouse myself. I was completely overpowered,
though I still retained a consciousness of where I was, and of
the necessity of being on my guard. Suddenly I awoke, feel-
ing an undefined dread. I could hear Natty breathing, but all
was dark inside the hut. On looking out I discovered that I
must have been asleep for some time, for the fire was entirely
extinguished. I sprang up, leaving my gun on the ground.
My first impulse was to re-light the fire. I hurriedly felt
about for the sticks, which I had placed on one side, and
carried them to the spot where the fire had been burning. I
placed them as before in a semicircle. Finding that I could
not strike the light in the open air, I retired into the hut to
do so. Whilst thus employed I fancied I heard some creature
moving over the ground. I got the match lighted, and then

ANOTHER UNWELCOME VISIT.
set fire to the bundle of twigs which I had collected. With
these in my hand, I went to the pile of wood. I tried to
light it. At last I set it on fire in one place. I was then
moving round to another, when I saw at about twenty paces of
a dark object creeping slowly towards me. On it came; and
while blowing away at the wood to cause it to ignite, I began
to distinguish the outlines of a huge lion. In a few seconds
the savage monster might be upon me. Already he was near
enough, I thought, to make his spring with fatal effect. I
knew that my chief safety would depend on the fire blazing up
quickly. Taking the torch, therefore, and mustering all the
nerve I possessed, I tried to light the pile at another spot be-
tween the two which were already beginning to burn, though
feebly. Now I bent down and blew, now looked up towards
the lion. To my horror, I saw him crouching down, and slowly
creeping towards me. I knew he was doing so preparatory to
making his tremendous spring. Just then a breeze fanned
my cheek. It came stronger and stronger, and up blazed
the fire. The lion stopped. Giving a stir to the fire as I
passed along it, I rushed back to my hut and seized my gun.
As the fire blazed up the monster gave a tremendous roar of
rage and disappointment, but still held his ground. The sound
awoke Natty, who asked, in a trembling voice, what was the
matter. "Remain quiet," I answered. "We have an unwel-
come visitor, but I hope to drive him away." Again the lion
roared and lashed his tail, but he could not bring himself to
dash through the fire, though he must have seen me moving
about on the other side of it. I stood up with my gun, which I
had loaded with a bullet, hoping to hit him should he make a
spring. Still he did not move; and remembering the effects
of my shouts the night before, I suddenly rushed towards the
fire, kicking it about, so as to make the flames rise up more
briskly than before, and at the same time shouting out at the

HOW I TREATED MY VISITOR.
389
top of my voice. The lion roared in return. The louder he
roared, the more wildly I shouted and shrieked; and then,
seizing a number of burning sticks, I sprang over the fire
towards him. The effect was satisfactory, for, turning round,
away he bounded into the darkness, whilst I shouted out,
" Victory! victory !" I had heard that if lions are thus
met by a bold front, they often prove cowardly; and I hoped,
therefore, that my visitor would not return. I now made
up the fire, and went back to Natty. I found him trembling
with alarm, but in other respects far more like himself than he
had been all the day. This raised my hopes of his recovery.
I gave him a little water and a few mouthfuls of cassava ; and
I was glad to find that in a short time he again dropped off to
sleep. As may be supposed, I had no inclination, after my
encounter with the lion, again to close my eyes. Should Natty
be better in the morning, I resolved to start off at an early
hour in search of water. I was therefore thankful when the
cheering light of day again returned. I gave Natty some more
food, and almost the last drops of water we possessed. I had
a small drinking-cup; into this I poured the remainder, and
told him to husband it carefully.
"I must go out, Natty, and try and find some more," I
said. "I will imprison you as securely as I can, and you must
try to wait patiently till I return. I will not be absent a
moment longer than I can help."
Natty looked anxiously up at me. "Is it absolutely neces-
sary ?" he asked.
"Yes, indeed," I said; "but I hope that before long I shall
find what we want, and in a day or two you will be able to
accompany me home."
"I will try to get well; but it is not my fault, Andrew. I
would walk if I could," he said, in a faint tone.
I was not content with merely closing the entrance, but

IN SEARCH OF WATER.
getting some strong vines, I intertwined them round the walls,
and then got some large boughs, and placed them over the
whole building. I trusted that thus no animal could possibly
enter. I knew that sufficient air would be obtained through
the roof. All that I could do was to pray, for his sake and
my own, that I might return in safety to him.
"Good-bye, Natty," I said, when I had finished the work.
"Keep up your spirits, my boy. I hope soon to be back; but
if I do not come as quickly as you expect, do not be alarmed.
I may have to go some way for water."
My wisest course perhaps was to have gone back to the last
stream we had passed; but then I could not have returned
the same night to our hut, and what would poor Natty have
done all that time without me? I therefore determined to
push on in an opposite direction, hoping that I might meet
with a fountain or rivulet. On and on I went. The sun, as
he rose in the sky, grew hotter and hotter. I had not a drop
of water to cool my dry tongue. I had never before really
known the feeling of want of water. I had been very thirsty;
but now the whole inside of my mouth and throat seemed to
consist of a dry horny substance, or as if I had swallowed some
of the contents of a dust-bin. Still on and on I went. I
hoped by continuing in a direct course that I should obtain
water more speedily.
A considerable portion of the day had passed away. The
sun had attained its greatest heat, when I thought I saw in
the distance a line of trees, which I felt sure indicated the
presence of water. I pushed on more eagerly, but as I ad-
vanced they changed their outline, and suddenly disappeared.
All I could see before me was a low line of grass and bushes,
which had evidently been magnified by a mirage into the pro-
portion of lofty trees. I went on, but continued to be deceived
time after time in the same way. In every direction the

mirage danced on the plain. I found that in reality the range
of my vision was restricted to a very moderate distance. Sud-
denly a herd of animals appeared, lifted completely up in the
air. They were deer of some species. I hoped by killing one
that I might somewhat quench my raging thirst with its blood,
but before I had got up to where I had seen them they had
scampered off. At length I saw what I felt sure was a pool
of water. Eagerly I hurried towards it. It was a long way
off, I thought; but I was willing to go any distance for the
wished-for fluid, hoping that my sufferings would find relief,
and that I might return before nightfall to my young com-
panion. I was confirmed in my opinion by catching sight of
several gnus going in the same direction. "They are going
there to drink," I thought; and I felt ready even to encounter
lions or any other savage beasts for the sake of the water. The
gnus did not perceive me, as they were to windward. There
was, however, so little wind that I had to wet my finger and
hold it up to discover the point from which it came. I hoped
that I should be able to get close up to the animals. Now
they stopped and fed, now they moved on again slowly.
Presently I saw them stop, when they began switching their
tails, and sniffing the air, and scraping the earth impatiently
with their hoofs. As I was concealed by the ground, which
here was sufficiently uneven for the purpose, I did not think
that they could have discovered me. Presently I was startled
by the fierce growl of some animal at no great distance. I
stopped ; and looking round, I saw to my horror a huge lion
and lioness at a short way off, just above me. It was evident
that they had been following the gnus, who had only at that
instant begun to suspect their presence. The lion must at the
same time have discovered me, and uttered the roar which I
had heard, while his companion was still creeping on after the
gnus. I stopped and knelt down, holding my rifle ready to

fire should the lion approach me. Still there was the liones,
and being sure that the report of my gun would attract hs
even should I kill the lion, I determined not to fire till it was
absolutely necessary. The growl which the lion utiered at
seeing me must have been heard by the gnus, which now set i
at a rapid pace to escape from their pursuers. The lioness
darted forward in pursuit, and the lion, uttering a few more
savage roars at me, turned round and followed her. I was free
from their company for the moment, but the knowledge that
they were in the neighbourhood added greatly to my anxiety.
I could not help fearing, too, that they or others might find
their way to poor Natty's hut during my absence. I had for
the moment forgotten my thirst, but now again the sufferings
I had been enduring returned, and I turned my eyes once more
towards the spot where I had seen the pond. Both the gnus
and the lions had disappeared. I went on, thinking that I
must soon reach the water. After hurrying on till I felt ready
to drop, I found myself standing on an extent of hard-baked
earth, while the glittering pool I had hoped to reach had dis-
appeared. I looked round. Similar pools appeared in various
places on the very ground I had come over. I knew therefore
that they were but deceptions caused by the mirage. What
had become of the lions I could not tell. I only hoped that
the gnus had led them a long chase, and that they were far
away from me.
Wearied out, I sat down under the shade of a rock, which
just sheltered my head and shoulders. My spirits were sinking.
I began to fear that I had death alone to expect as a termina-
tion to my sufferings. And poor Natty, he would die too;
for weak from fever, and unable to help himself, he must in-
evitably be starved. "I will go back and die with him," I
exclaimed. "While a particle of strength remains, I will push
on. I cannot let him suffer alone !" While these thoughts

WATER AT LAST.

were passing through my mind, I saw some birds flying through
the air, uttering as they went a soft melodious cry, which
sounded somewhat like " Pretty dear! pretty dear !" I
watched them anxiously. They were too far off for me to hit
them, but I judged from their flight that they were a species
of partridge which I had before seen. They came from the
south-east, directing their course towards the north-west.
Presently I observed, as I watched them anxiously, that they
neared the ground, and then seemed to me settling down at
no great distance off.
I remembered having heard that springs have been discovered
by travellers in the desert by watching the flight of birds, and
I hoped that these were on their way to some fountain. I
arose, and hurried on as fast as my weakness would allow in
the direction they had taken. Still I could not help dreading
that I might be again disappointed. I caught sight at length
of some rocks, on the other side of which they had disappeared.
The rocks rose high above the dry, hard ground. As yet there
was no indication of water. My heart sunk within me, but I
persevered. I had not strength to climb the rocks, which rose
high up before me, but I circled round them. I got to the
other side, when my eyes were gladdened by the sight of green
herbage and luxuriant shrubs, which I knew delight in water.
Hurrying on, I saw beneath the rocks a calm, clear crystal pool.
Oh, how delighted I felt! But on getting to the edge I found
that the water was too far below me to be easily reached. I
scrambled along the rocks, till at length I discovered a spot
which appeared not more than a foot or two above the water.
I reached it at length, and throwing myself on the ground, bent
over till I could dip my hands in the pure liquid. I eagerly
lapped it up. I felt that I could never drink enough. By
degrees my parched tongue and mouth began to feel cool, and
I rose like another person. After resting a few minutes, I

filled my water-bottle. Evening was approaching, but I could
not bear the thought of leaving Natty all the night without
attempting to return to him. Once more I drank my fill.
While drinking, I saw several other flights of birds arrive at
the water. A covey of them pitched thickly on a rock near
me. They would afford valuable nourishment to my young
friend. I withdrew the bullet from my rifle and loaded it
with small shot. It was an ungrateful act I was about to
perpetrate, I confess; I thought so even at the time. The
birds, too, seemed fearless of me. I raised my gun and fired.
Greatly to my delight, I saw three lying on the rock, and two
others fluttering near. I hurried forward to secure them.
Scarcely had I done so when, looking round, I saw a lion and
lioness-probably the same which had pursued the gnus-ap-
proaching the pool. Strange to say, I felt but little fear of
them. Still I thought it unwise to stand in their path should
they be on their way to drink, as I had no doubt they were.
I accordingly scrambled along the rock to a high point, whence
I could look down upon them as they passed. On seeing me
they stopped, and seemed to be consulting together whether
they should attack me. "I will be ready for you, old fellows,"
I said aloud, as I reloaded my rifle and carefully rammed down
the bullet. "If you do not interfere with me, I will let you
enjoy your draught unmolested; but if you attack me, look
out for the consequences—Ha! ha! ha!" My own voice
struck my ear as strangely loud and wild. The effect was to
make the lions decide on letting me alone; and while they
went on towards the water, I scrambled down from the rock,.
and began to make the best of my way towards where I had
left Natty.
I hurried on, though I scarcely expected to reach the hut
before dark. Still I hoped that even at night I might find
my way. I will not say that I was very sanguine about it, as

the mirage had deceived me, and often made objects appear
very different to what they really were. The sun in a short
time sunk behind me. Still, as long as I could move over
the ground, I determined to persevere. I was keeping,
I believed, in a direct line. At length the stars came out,
and the moon rose and shed her pale light over the scene.
I knew that lions and other wild beasts will seldom attack a
person while the moon is shining. This encouraged me to
proceed. The stars, whose brilliancy even the moon could
scarcely dim, assisted me in steering my course. I own, how-
ever, that now and then I cast an anxious look over my
shoulder, lest the lion and the lioness might be following me.
Where the ground was open I hoped that I might be able to
discover them, should they approach ; but in some places it
was rocky, scattered over with thick bushes, within which
beasts of prey might lurk. I was somewhat heavily laden,
with my water-bottle and birds. While suffering from thirst
I had no inclination to eat, but now I began to feel the pangs
of hunger, and my knees trembled from the exertion I had
been for so long making. I therefore sat down with my back
against a tree to rest, and to eat the few mouthfuls I had in
my pocket. I scarcely knew till then how tired I was. Anxious
- as I was to get on, I yet could not help indulging in a short
rest. "I shall be able to move the faster after it," I thought
to myself. Whilst thus sitting and meditating, what was my
dismay to see the two lions stalk slowly up to me, while be-
hind them appeared a vast troop of the savage dogs I had en-
countered on the previous night! I felt spell-bound—unable
to fly, or even to move. The lions whisked their tails and
ground their teeth as they uttered low savage growls, while
the dogs kept barking and yelping behind them. Nearer and
nearer they drew. In vain I tried to lift my rifle and have
one shot for my life. No; I could not even do that. There I

worse, or that some wild beasts had found out our hut, and
managed to penetrate into the interior. I was wrong to allow
these thoughts to enter my mind, I know, but under my cir-
cumstances it was but natural. At length I caught sight,
under a tree, of what in the moonlight looked like a mound.
It was our hut; but just then I observed several objects moving
about round it, and as I drew near a loud barking and yelping
saluted my ears. I rushed forward. "Those brutes of dogs
have found out Natty!" I exclaimed. Even then I thought
that I might be too late to save him. Shouting out in a
stern, strong voice, which I had found successful before, I
ordered them to depart, waving my gun with furious gestures
before me. The dogs saw me, and began to retreat; but
some of them, I thought, seemed to come out of the very hut
itself. " Natty! Natty!" I cried out, "are you safe? Tell
me! oh, tell me!"
I got no answer, but the barking and yelping might have
drowned Natty's yoice. I dashed frantically forward. I could
not fire without the risk of sending the ball through the hut.
I doubted, indeed, whether the sound of my rifle would have
much effect on them. The yelping, barking pack retired as I
advanced. "Natty, Natty, speak to me!" I again cried out.
My heart bounded with joy when a faint voice proceeded
from within. "O Andrew! have you really come? I was
afraid you must have been killed."
"I am all safe," I answered; "but I must drive these brutes
to a distance before I come to you."
There was a good supply of sticks. I hastily drew them
together, and lighting a match, quickly had a brisk fire burn-
ing. The light and my shouts finally drove off the pack, and
I now ventured to open the entrance to our hut. Natty was
sitting up. He pointed to his mouth. I hastily poured out
some of the water, and gave him an ample draught; and then

NATTY'S ANXIETY.
I sank down on the ground, overcome with fatigue and the
pain which my sprained ankle gave me. I recovered suffi-
ciently, however, to exchange a few sentences with him, when
he told me of the anxiety he had been suffering, and of the
dread he had had that the dogs would force their way into the
hut. I then briefly narrated my adventures. He seemed, I
thought, somewhat better. Having secured the entrance, I
lay down by his side, and, in spite of the pain I was suffering
from, was soon asleep.

MY ADVENTURES WITH NATTY CONTINUED.

WHOLE day had passed away. Although I hus-
banded our water with the greatest care, I could
not expect it to last beyond a second day. Still
my ankle gave me great pain, and I felt utterly
unable to walk. Natty, too, was far too weak to
proceed on our journey. The fever, however, had
subsided, and he required less water than at first. Still, it
was almost as necessary for him as food, and I did not like to
stint him. Though suffering from thirst myself, aggravated
by pain, I refrained from taking more than a few drops at
a time. I did everything I could think of to restore strength
to my limb.
"I am afraid there is only one thing, Andrew, will do it ;
and that is perfect rest," observed Natty at last.
I did not like to alarm him by telling him of my anxiety
about water ; but as I sat on the ground with my poor sick
friend by my side, darker forebodings than had ever yet
assailed me oppressed my mind. It might be many days
before Natty would be able to move, and if I could not go to
the fountain to procure water, we must both die of thirst.
Two more days passed away, and when I lay down to sleep,
scarcely a pint of water remained. I had remained perfectly

ANOTHER EXPEDITION FOR WATER.
quiet all day, hoping that the long rest would cure the sprain.
I had made the hut so secure, I did not think it necessary to
light a fire outside. On again rising, I put my foot to the
ground. Oh, how thankful I felt when I found that it gave
me but little pain, and that I could walk without difficulty!
I told Natty that I would go back at once for water, leaving
him our scanty stock, and the remainder of our birds after I
had satisfied my hunger. The flesh, however, though roasted
and dried, was scarcely eatable.
"Will you not let me go with you, Andrew ?" he said.
"I think I could walk as far, if I rested now and then."
He made the attempt, but sank back again on the ground.
I persuaded him to have patience, and to remain quiet; and
closing the hut even more carefully than before, with the thickest
sticks I could find, I set off on my expedition. Though at
first I walked with pain, I got on better than I expected. The
air was cool, for the sun was not yet above the horizon, and I
hoped to get to the fountain in time to kill some birds collectel
there for their morning draught. The way, I trusted, would
appear shorter than at night, and I believed that I well knew
the direction I should take. My feet were, however, very
weary, and the rocks were not yet in sight. I was weak from
want of food, and soon became as thirsty as on the previous occa-
sion. I was anxious, too, for I could not be quite certain that
I was on the right way. How I longed for a beaten track
which would lead me without fail to the fountain! It would
have made all the difference to me. I could have endured
double the fatigue had I been sure that I should arrive at the
spot at last. At length I caught sight of a flight of birds
winging their way over my head in the direction I was going.
This gave me more confidence, and I now pushed on with
greater energy. At length I saw the rocks before me, and
flights of birds rising in the air, and flying off in different

THE LIONS AGAIN!
403
directions. I was afraid that I should be too late to shoot
any; though I might obtain water, food would be wanting.
Just as I reached the rocks, I saw a covey apparently about to
take wing. I fired, and four lay on the rocks fluttering about.
I rushed forward to seize them, when, to my horror, I saw my
old enemies the lion and lioness just taking their departure from
the water! I had already got some way up the rock. It was
better to lose the birds than my life; so I stopped, faced my
fues, and began loading my rifle. The brutes looked at me
with astonishment, as much as to ask how I dared come into
their territory again. I replied by ramming down the bullet
" If you will go your way, I will let you alone," I shouted
out; "but if not, beware of this leaden pill!" The lion
seemed to understand me, and looked at the lioness; and
then, perhaps considering discretion the better part of valour,
began leisurely to walk away from the fountain. I shouted
after them, to show them that I was not alarmed; and,
greatly to my satisfaction, they at length disappeared in
the distance. I secured the birds, which were unable to
fly, and then eagerly hurried down to the water. I drank
my fill, and sitting down, bathed my burning feet. The
water seemed to give strength to my ankle. Having filled
my bottle and rested a while, I felt so much better that
I determined to take a swim, hoping thus entirely to recruit
my strength. Never have I so much enjoyed a bath. On
getting ont, however, I felt so hungry that I was compelled to
light a fire and cook one of the birds. I could not have pro-
ceeded on my journey without it, though anxious to get back
as soon as possible to Natty. Thus thoroughly recruited, I
again set off, looking about, as I went along, in the hope of
finding some other animal to shoot for food. Though I saw
many at a distance, I could not get sufficiently near one to
have a fair shot.

A SNAKE IN THE HUT.
It was late in the day before I got back, and when I shouted
to Natty, as I drew near the hut, he answered me in a stronger
voice than before. I soon had the bottle of water to his lips,
a fire alight, and a partridge cooking. Enough of the day
remained to allow me to search about for wild fruits and roots
which might assist our meal. I could now leave him without
fear; invariably, however, closing the hut when I went out.
I was successful in finding some fruits such as I have before
described, and returned well satisfied to the hut. Natty de-
clared that he felt able to sit outside by the fire to take his
supper. He crawled without my assistance to the entrance.
After he had taken his seat, as I happened to look inside, I
saw the leaves on which he had been lying moving slowly.
Presently the hideous, black, swollen-looking head of a snake
emerged from under the leaves, its bright eyes glaring at us.
In another instant I believed that it would spring at Natty or
me. Without speaking, greatly to his alarm, I threw him on
one side, and then, seizing a heavy stick which lay at hand,
I rushed at the creature and struck it a blow with all my force
on the head. It had the effect of knocking it over; and before
it could recover itself, I dealt it another blow on the tail.
Poor Natty, not seeing what I was doing, thought I had gone
mad, I believe. I repeated my blows, till I felt sure that the
creature was dead. I now dragged it out by the tail, prepared,
should it give signs of life, to renew my attack. As I brought
it into the light, I saw that it was a black variety of the puff
adder, which is among the most poisonous serpents of Africa.
It is said that if a person is bitten by it, death ensues within
an hour. To make sure, I threw the body into the fire. Not
till then did Natty sufficiently recover the effects of his fall and
alarm to see what had occurred, and to be aware of the fearful
danger in which we had both been placed; for had the creature
come out while we were sitting together in the hut, unable to

ANTIDOTES TO SNAKE BITES.

defend ourselves in so narrow a space, nothing could have pre-
vented one of us being bitten.
We sat for some time before we could begin our meal, and
we did not fail to return thanks for our merciful deliverance
from danger. We naturally talked about what we should have
done had either of us been bitten. It was a subject which I
had discussed with David on several occasions, for we had had a
great fear of the bites of serpents when we first arrived in the
country. However, we had hitherto met so few, that we had
lost all alarm about them.
" If you had been bitten, I should have tried to cut away
the flesh immediately round the wound, and sucked the blood,"
Natty said to me; and from the look of affection he gave me,
I was sure that he would without hesitation have made the
attempt.
"I should have first tied a ligature above the wounded part,
so as to prevent the venom spreading," I observed. "Had we
been with David, we might have found remedies in his medi-
cine-chest. It is said that eau de luce is often effectual. Five
drops are administered to the patient in a glass of water every
ten minutes till the poison is counteracted. It is also applied
externally. I have heard that Dutch farmers attempt to conn-
teract the effects of serpents' bites by making an incision in
the breast of a living fowl, and applying it to the bitten part.
If the poison is very deadly, the bird becomes drowsy, droops
its head, and dies. It is then replaced by a second, and so
on till the bird no longer shows signs of suffering, when the
patient is considered out of danger. A frog is sometimes ap-
plied in the same way; and turtle blood, prepared by drying,
when applied to the wound produced by a venomous serpent
or a poisoned arrow, is supposed to be efficacious. The
wounded person takes a couple of pinches of the dried blood
internally, and also applies some of it to the wound. It is

A WONDERFUL STONE.
said also that the Brahmins in India manufacture a stone which
has the virtue of counteracting the poison of serpents. They
alone possess the secret, which they will not divulge. The
stone is applied to the wound, to which it sticks closely with-
out any bandage, and drinks in the poison till it can receive
no more. It is then placed in milk, that it may purge itself
of the poison, and is again applied to the wound, till it has
drawn out the whole of the poison."
"Yes," observed Natty, "I remember hearing of those
stories ; but David said they were merely pieces of the bone of
some animal, made into an oval shape, and burned round the
edges. If they have any power in drawing out poison, it is in
consequence of being porous; and he said he believed any
substance made up of capillary tubes, such as common sponge,
would be equally efficacious. After all, I believe that my
remedy is the only one on which dependence can be placed,
except, perhaps, the immediate application of eau de luce, and
of course, when a person is bitten by a snake, in rare instances
only is he able to obtain any."
As may be supposed, we hunted about the hut thoroughly
before lying down, in case any other snakes might have crawled
in; and I stopped up every crevice by which I thought it pos-
sible the one I had killed could have entered.
Natty was so much better by the time our last supply of
water was nearly finished, that I no longer refused to let him
accompany me to the fountain, intending to proceed from
thence towards our ultimate destination. Clouds had gathered
in the sky, and the air was cooler than it had been for some
time, as we set out. I insisted on his frequently stopping, and
wished him to allow me to carry him at intervals ; but to this
he would not consent. We each of us had a long stick in our
hands to support our steps, and I assisted him on with my
arm. Our progress was, however, but slow; for in spite of

407
his efforts, I saw that he was still very weak. Thus it was
not until the sun was already sinking before us in the west
that we got within sight of the fountain. We had exhausted
our water, and I was anxious to get a further supply before the
night closed in. Again I begged Natty to let me take him on
my back, for I thought it would rest him, and enable us to get
on faster. At last he consented, and though he was but a
light weight for his age, reduced as he was by sickness, yet I
found, after proceeding a couple of hundred yards or so, that I
was myself beginning to get fatigued. Perhaps he discovered
this, by finding the slower pace at which I was going, and he
insisted on again getting down, declaring that he was much
rested by the ride. Giving him my arm, therefore, we again
pushed on. The dark rocks which surrounded the fountain
now rose up clearly before us. I looked round carefully, but
could see no trace of the lions. We reached the spot, and soon
I had the satisfaction of seeing Natty swallowing an ample
draught of water. I then took some myself, and filled our
bottle. I felt a longing to take another swim, but afraid that
the lions might come upon us while I was in the water,
I refrained. I was fortunate in killing five more birds, out
of a covey which rose just as we sat down by the water's
brink.
Having rested for some time by the side of the pond, we con-
tinued our journey. We saw herds of animals in the distance-
gemsboks, steinboks, gnus, and cameleopards—but they were
too far off to enable me to get a shot at any of them. We
stopped frequently, for Natty was unable to proceed without
doing so. Thus the day had come nearly to a close before we
had made much progress. I was looking out anxiously for
some spot where we might camp for the night, when I saw
on our right what appeared to be the fallen trunk of some
giant of a former forest, for no other trees were near it.


## p. 408 (#412) ############################################

408
A HERD OF BUFFALOES.
"I dare say we may there find shelter," I observed, pointing
it out to Natty.
" But see!" he said, " there are some animals moving about
round it."
As we got nearer, I saw several heads rising among the roots
and fallen branches. They appeared to me to be hyenas, or
hyena dogs, similar to the pack which had visited us. They,
however, with their ears pricked forward, were so eager in
watching some object on the opposite side of them that they
did not perceive us. We were thus able to move on without
being discovered. Presently we perceived what had occupied
their attention ; for the leaders of a herd of buffaloes appeared
in sight, going along a shallow valley on the other side of the
fallen tree. Even at that distance we could hear the hollow
sound of their feet as they dashed over the ground. On they
went with their heads lowered, and tails in the air, faster and
faster, a regular stampedo. What had caused their flight we
could not ascertain. Whether it was alarm at some danger
behind them, or whether they were driven by an impulse
which sometimes makes the bovine race dash headlong over
the ground without any apparent cause, we could not tell.
"One thing I am very thankful for," observed Natty,_"that
we are not in their way, or we should have but a poor chance
of escaping them. Perhaps the dogs expect one of them to
fall, and are looking out for a feast."
"At all events, we must take care not to allow ourselves to
be attacked instead of them," I observed. "I am far from
certain indeed that they are dogs. They appear to me larger,
and rather more like hyenas. I suspect that they are spotted
hyenas, which are among the fiercest of the race; and though I
believe they seldom attack a man on his guard, I do not know
what they might do if they found us asleep. They are said to
have an especial liking for human flesh, and I know that in

HYENAS AND THEIR HABITS.
411
some parts where they are numerous, they frequently carry off
the children from villages. I have heard it said that they
will even steal noiselessly into a hut at night, and drag a
sleeping child from under its mother's kaross or rug, so that
the first intimation she has of what has occurred is from the
cry of her infant as it is borne away in the jaws of the monster.
They will sometimes break into villages, leaping over high pal-
ings; and so great is their strength, that they will carry off
any animal they find loose. In one respect, however, they
are of use, as they act as scavengers, and clear the neigh-
bourhood of villages of the carrion which they find scattered
about. This makes it necessary to protect graves, by raising
over them piles of thorns, or of the prickly pear, as they will
otherwise scrape away the earth to reach the newly-interred
corpse."
"Horrid creatures !" said Natty, shuddering. "I do not
think I could go to sleep if I thought that any were likely to
pay us a visit."
"I do not know that they would be more formidable than
the dogs we have already encountered," I remarked. "Indeed,
I believe these dogs are their cousins, if not their brethren;
for though complete dogs, as to the character of their skulls
and teeth, they have, like the hyenas, only four toes on the
front feet. However, I hope we may be able to take precau-
tions which will guard us from any annoyance those brutes out
there are likely to offer, should they be hyenas or simply
hyena dogs, such as the visitors to our late camp. There is
a wood, I see, on the left; we must try and push through it,
and build our house on the other side."
On went the herd of buffaloes, and were soon lost to sight
across the plain. As we went on, I looked back every now
and then to see if the hyenas were following us; but though
I fancied that their heads were turned in our direction, they

SIGNS OF A STORM.
perhaps could not make out what we were, and at all events
remained in their fortress. I should have preferred, however,
being further off from them at night. While preparing our
camp, the sky gave indications, I feared, of a coming storm. I
therefore made the roof of our hut thicker than usual, in the
hope of keeping out the water should the rain come down. In
spite of my fears, neither did the storm break, nor did we
receive a visit during the night from our canine neighbours.
Natty was greatly fatigued by his long journey; and from the
way he talked in his sleep, I was afraid that the fever had
again returned on him. This made me resolve, should he not
be better in the morning, to remain there another day. My
worst apprehensions were fulfilled. But still it was satisfac-
tory to be near the water, so that I might obtain as much as
we required.
We remained two whole days. Though we several times
heard the roars of the lions, I did not see them. Each day I
made a trip to the pool, and took a refreshing bath, which
greatly restored my strength. Natty declared that he was now
ready to proceed. Having obtained in the evening some more
birds from my preserve, as I called it, we went on in the morn-
ing in the same direction as before. Natty, however, was
still very weak, and I saw that the next day we should make
but little progress. We were now again in a completely
open plain, the only trees being far away in the horizon,
though the mountains rose up in the north-west, towards
which we were proceeding. The signs of a storm again
appeared, and I was afraid that it would break upon us where
no shelter could be obtained. Push on therefore we must, as
long as Natty could continue moving. I gave him a lift every
now and then, very much against his will; indeed, it was only
by persuading him that we could thus get on faster, that he
would allow me to carry him. Soon the wind began to blow

in fitful gusts, and heavy drops of rain fell. I constantly
looked behind me, dreading every instant that the deluge would
burst upon us. "It will kill poor Natty, I fear," I could not
help saying to myself. Presently the rain began to descend
more heavily, and clouds collected, and flashes of lightning
darting from them went zigzagging over the ground. Just
then I caught sight in the distance of what looked like a low
clump of trees. I directed our course towards it, taking Natty
up and running along as fast as I could move. Although I
well knew that it is dangerous to take shelter in a thunderstorm
under a tree, I hoped to be able to obtain wood and leaves to
build a hut by which Natty, at all events, might be partly
sheltered. I saw, as I got nearer, that the grove consisted
chiefly of one enormous tree, from the branches of which
descended numerous slight stalks, apparently supporting them
as they spread ont on every side over the ground. I now recog-
nized a magnificent specimen of the baobab-tree, of immense
girth, and with numerous branches and almost countless off-
shoots. On one side was a Guinea-palm, its graceful fan-like
branches rising from a centre stalk-a mere liliputian plant it
looked in comparison to its lofty neighbour. On the other
side was an acacia, the size of an ordinary oak, though a little
way off I took it for a diminutive shrub. A very few other
trees only were scattered about. Getting still nearer, I ob-
served a hollow in the trunk of the baobab-tree-a wooden
cavern, capable of containing a dozen or more persons. Re-
membering to have heard that the baobab does not attract
lightning, I made my way towards it, resolving to take shelter
within. I hurried to the mouth, and looking in, was thankful
to find that it contained no inhabitants. Here, at all events,
we might rest secure from the storm.
Putting Natty down, I examined the interior to see that no
snakes lurked in the crevices of the wood. I could discover

none: so I cleared out a spot where Natty could rest more at
ease; and as the wood and leaves under the tree were still
dry, I collected a sufficient supply of both—one to form our

couch, and the other for our fire. The rain had begun to pour
down in torrents outside, but within the trunk we were com-
pletely sheltered. As there was ample room to light a fire

DESCRIPTION OF A BAOBAB-TREE.

inside, I soon had one, and some of our birds roasting before
it. Natty agreed that we were better lodged than we had
been since we left home. There we sat watching the storm,
which howled and raged outside. The rain came down lite-
rally in a deluge.
The tree in which we had taken shelter was evidently of
great age. I have since heard that some people suppose that
the patriarchs of these trees may have been alive before the
Flood. The natives cut off and pound the bark, from which
they thus obtain the fibres for making a strong and fine cord.
Although the bark of many of the trees near their villages is
completely torn off in a way that would destroy any other
tree, the baobab does not suffer, but throws out a new bark as
often as the old one is cut off. Trees are either exogenous —
that is to say, grow by means of successive layers on the out-
side; or they endogenous—which means that they are increased
by layers in the inside. Thus, in the latter, when the hollow
is full the growth is stopped, and the tree dies. The first
class suffers most severely by any injury affecting the bark ;
the second, by an injury in the inside. Now the baobab, from
possessing all these qualities, may have the bark torn off, and
may be completely hollow, and yet continue to flourish. The
cause of this is, that each of the lamina possesses a vitality of
its own, the sap rising through every part of it. I had seen
some trees, from which the natives had so often stripped the
bark that the lower part was two or three inches in diameter
less than the higher portion which they could not reach. The
wood was of a particularly spongy and soft nature; and I was
able to cut off enough with my knife to assist in keeping our
fire burning.
The storm still continued raging without, the wind howling
among the branches above our heads, although we sat secure
as in a mansion of granite. I was not free, however, from

A STORM.
anxiety; for it occurred to me that I might be mistaken as to
the tree we were in not attracting the lightning, and that the
account I had heard about it might be incorrect. I did not,
however, express my misgivings to Natty. He, poor lad,
looked very pale and ill, and I regretted having allowed him
to walk so far; indeed, I felt it would have been better to
have remained at our former abode a couple of days more, or
even longer, although it might have made one or more journeys
to the fountain necessary. I determined, therefore, to secure
the entrance, and make the inside of the tree as comfortable as
I could for him, and to remain there till he was better able to
proceed.
The rain continued to come down in torrents; the thunder
roared, and the lightning flashed vividly. I was afraid that
the fine weather was breaking up, and that the rainy season
was about to begin. This would make travelling more diffi-
cult than before, and give Natty less chance of recovery. I
made up my mind, however, to be resigned to whatever might
occur, and to do my best. Courageous as Natty generally
was, he at length became alarmed at the loud roaring of the
thunder, and the fearful crashing sound which ever and anon
reached our ears as the electric fluid, darting from the clouds,
came zigzagging through the air, and snake-like darted over
the ground, sometimes, it seemed, within a few yards of the
tree. I did my best to reassure him, and was thankful that
it was daylight, for the storm would have appeared even more
terrific at night.
Although there were no large inhabitants in our woody
cavern, I discovered several insects. The ground inside it
was covered with earth, and almost level. I observed a large
reddish spider running in and out with wonderful rapidity
among the uneven parts of the wood. Now it darted out on a
small insect, and quickly devoured it ; immediately setting

forth again in search of another, which it pounced upon in
the same energetic way. I had seldom seen so large and
hideous-looking a spider, and felt a horror lest it should come
near us. It moved so quickly that I in vain attempted to
reach it. Presently I saw it run along the ground, when it
entered a small hole which I had not before observed. Though
I had exactly marked the spot, I in vain searched for it.
After a time I saw the earth lifting, and out came the spider
again. I sprang down to the spot, and there I found a small
circular substance, of a pure, silky white, like paper, about the
size of a shilling. On touching it, I discovered that it was
a regular trap-door with a hinge, and, on turning it down, that
the outside was coated with earth, so exactly like that in which
the hole was made, that when shut it was impossible to dis-
cover it. I observed inside a substance which I took to be
eggs; and I had little doubt, therefore, that this was the nest of
the spider I had seen. I pointed it out to Natty, who was,
however, too weak to feel inclined to rise and examine it; and
when I again looked, I could nowhere discover the hole, and
the spider had disappeared. I could not help having an uncom-
fortable feeling that the creature might come out again and
attack us. But I may as well say here that it did not do so ;
and on making inquiries since, I found that though people are
often frightened at its appearance, it has never been known to
do any harm. There is another spider which builds a regular
nest with a lid, and attaches it to a wall or the branch of a
tree. Whether it is of the same species as the one I have de-
scribed or not, I am uncertain. There are spiders in Africa
which are said to inflict poisonous wounds. One is a very
large, black, hairy creature, fully an inch and a quarter long,
and three-quarters of an inch broad. It has a process at the end
of its front claws like that of a scorpion's tail, out of which
poison, when it is pressed, is seen to ooze. I have also

CHAPTER XX.
OUR RESIDENCE IN A BAOBAB-TREE.
V OHE bright rays of the sun, which streamed into the
hollow tree, had a good effect upon Natty; and
feeling that I could leave him, I proposed cutting
some stakes with which to secure ourselves during
| the night from the attacks which wandering beasts
of prey might be inclined to make on us. Taking my hatchet,
I accordingly went out and set to work. I easily cut a suf-
ficient number of stakes for the purpose from the branches
of the neighbouring trees. I should have been better off
with a good supply of nails; but as they were wanting,
I had to do without them. Pointing the stakes, I drove
them into the ground just inside the mouth of the hollow,
placing other pieces crossways, and jamming them as I best
could into the sides of the entrance. I left only a small hole,
through which I could just creep in and out. I made the
grating so high that I hoped no panther or lion could leap
over it. I had gone to the outer edge of the grove to get some
firewood, and was returning by a path through which I had
not yet passed, it being already dusk, when suddenly I found
my face covered with what I can only describe as a long veil ;
while just at my nose I saw a horrid monster, of a bright
yellow colour, with long legs and claws, struggling violently,

CAUGHT IN A SPIDER'S WEB.
and in its fright I thought it would scratch out my eyes. I
rushed forward, throwing down my load, and dashing into our
cavern, entreated Natty to relieve me from my fearful tor-
mentor. Even he, ill as he was, could scarcely help laughing
at my alarmed countenance. The spider—for such the crea-
ture was—was as much frightened as I was, and crawled away
in a great hurry before we could kill him, the instant Natty
had assisted me in tearing off part of its web. It took some
time to clear my face of the remainder, and several minutes
passed before I could entirely recover my equanimity. I had
seen such webs before, but had never run tilt against them.
This was suspended between two of the stalks of the baobab-
tree, in a perpendicular position, by lines the thickness of
coarse thread. The fibres of which it was composed radiated
from a central point, where the creature was lying in wait for
its prey, when it found the tip of my nose instead of an
unwary moth or butterfly. The web was about a yard in
diameter, so that it completely enveloped my face and head.
Though very disagreeable to me, the occurrence, I really
believe, did Natty good. It was pleasant to hear even a faint
shout of laughter from him.
The spider I have mentioned is a solitary individual : but I
have seen others which live in society; and industrious crea-
tures they are, too, for their webs frequently cover the entire
trunk of a tree, so as literally to conceal it from view. I
have seen a bush in the same way completely covered up, as if
a table-cloth had been thrown over it.
I was thankful we had so secure a house, for I saw that
Natty could not possibly proceed for some time. I therefore
made up my mind to remain where we were till he was better,
even though it might involve the delay of a whole week. My
chief anxiety arose from the small amount of ammunition I
now possessed. Should that fail me, I could not tell how I

421
might obtain food. Water I had in abundance ; that was one
comfort. The immediate neighbourhood of the baobab-tree
afforded neither roots nor fruits; so even as it was I must visit
the fountain, or go to a yet further distance, to obtain food.
Notwithstanding the interruption I have described, I had time
to collect some leaves for Natty's bed, and a supply of fire-
wood, in case I might find it necessary to light a fire.
Several times during the night the distant roars of lions and
other wild beasts reached my ears ; but as none were near, 'I
went to sleep without any unusual feeling of anxiety. In the
morning, however, I found the marks of a lion's feet in the
soil, made soft by the rain, just outside the tree. Probably he
had come up to our sleeping-place, but, finding the entrance
barred against him, had not attempted to make his way in. I
was thankful that I had guarded it securely.
I am obliged to make a long story short. Three days
passed by, during which there was a storm and a fall of rain.
I went to the fountain for water, and shot more birds, and
made expeditions in the neighbourhood of the grove; but Natty
continued so weak that I did not like to leave him for any
length of time by himself. I was one day attracted by a
mound a little way off, which I suspected to be an ant-hill.
On approaching it, I found that such was the case ; but it was
ornamented in such a way as I had never seen one of those
curious nests adorned before. It was covered with enormous
mushrooms. They were perfectly white, their tops nearly
eighteen inches in diameter. They looked very tempting; and
on examining them, I found that they were genuine mushrooms.
I ate a piece, which was very palatable, and I accordingly
slung several over my back to carry home : they would, I
hoped, prore useful to eat with our roasted partridges. Not
far off was another ant-hill, and on this were growing a
number of other mushrooms. Some were of a brilliant red,

ANTS, AND THEIR ERIAL ABODES.
and others of a dull light blue. I examined them ; but from
their consistency and general appearance, I was afraid of eat-
ing them lest they might prove poisonous, for such I knew is
the character ordinarily of coloured fungi. I carried a couple
home, however, to show to Natty; but he agreed with me that
it would be unwise to eat them.
Another day, when further from home than usual, I saw
before me a lagoon, in which water-plants were already rising
up. I was convinced, however, that it had only been filled by
the late rains. From its appearance, it was probably not more
than a few inches deep in any part. As I passed by I
observed some odd-looking black lumps on the top of some
tall stalks of grass, which rose above the level of the surround-
ing edges. I was tempted by curiosity to examine one of
them. It was about the size of my thumb; and as I held it
it broke, when what was my surprise to see emerge from it a
whole army of ants, which began to attack me furiously! I
brushed them quickly off, though their bite was not particu-
larly severe. On examining others of the black lumps, I
found them inhabited in the same way; and I now came to
the conclusion that the ants which had their usual abodes in
the dry season underground on the spot, taught by experience
that at a certain season it would be covered by water, built
these aerial abodes in order to secure for themselves a refuge
as soon as the waters should flood the ground around them.
Many of these houses were as large as I have described, but
others were considerably smaller, though all built of the same
material and in the same firm manner. Taking up one by the
stalk, I carried it home to show to Natty. He declared that
he thought some of our black friends would swallow them,
if baked, as a delicious mouthful. I carried it out again, and
stuck the stalk in the ground, when I saw the inhabitants
crawling down, evidently under the belief that the waters had

423
subsided, and that they might now descend into their subter-
ranean habitation.
I need scarcely say that I looked out anxiously all the day
in the hope that Stanley or some of our other friends might
pass in that direction on a hunting expedition. Natty asked
how it was they had not come to look for us. I accounted for
it from their naturally supposing that if we had not lost our
lives, we were detained somewhere on the lake, and that they
would therefore search for us there.
Natty grew no worse, but still he did not appear to gain
strength. Often he urged me to set off without him ; but to
this I would not consent. The journey might occupy me two
or even three days, and it would take as long a time to return
to him. "No," I replied ; " until you are well enough to
move, I will stay by you." I thought that if I could but
procure some variety of food, he might improve faster ; but I
had now only five or six charges of powder left, and I was
anxious to preserve these for any emergency. One of my fears
was, that from so frequently shooting the birds in the neigh-
bourhood of the pool, they might grow wary of me. However,
they did not appear to be more alarmed when I came near
them than at first. Sometimes I went in the evening, some-
times in the morning, and never failed to bring down three or
four birds. I think that I must have frightened away the
lions, for I never saw them again, though I heard their roars
• in the distance. I suspect that they waited to visit the pool
till they saw me take my departure.
I was one day about half a mile from the baobab-tree, when
I saw, perched on a bush near me, a little bird about the size
of a chaffinch, of a light gray colour. It seemed in no way
afraid of me, but continued chattering and twittering in a state
of great excitement. Then it got up and flew backwards and
forwards before me, apparently endeavouring to attract my

THE HONEY-BIRD.
attention. As I approached it flew on a little in front. I
followed it. On seeing this, it went on and on in a wavy
course, a few yards before me, alighting every now and then
on a bush, and looking back to see if I was still following, all
the time keeping up an incessant twitter. Though I had no
idea at the time of its object, I continued following it. At
length I saw a short distance ahead the huge trunk of a fallen
tree. The bird appeared still more excited; and when I hap-
pened to turn aside, apparently to take an opposite direction, it
came flying back, and twittering fouder than before, trying, I
was sure, to make me turn in the direction of the tree. I
accordingly did so, when, satisfied, the bird went on as before.
It now hovered for a moment over a part of the trunk at which
it pointed with its bill, and it then turned and pitched on
the top of a decayed branch which rose in the air out of the
trunk, and fluttered its wings and twittered still more violently
than ever. There it sat while I examined the trunk. I was
not long in discovering a hollow surrounded by wax, and the
idea at once occurred to me that this was a bees' nest, and that
the bird was the honey-bird of which I had heard. On a
further examination I was convinced that I was right. I there-
fore collected a number of dried leaves and twigs, in order to
light a fire, and with the smoke to drive the bees from their
habitation. I also manufactured some torches, which might
assist me in the operation, and would, I hoped, enable me
to defend myself should the bees take to flight and attack
me. As soon as I had got everything ready, I lighted a fire
under the nest, and taking a torch, waved it about in front of
it. No bees came out, and I began to fancy that the nest must
be empty. After a time, however, on looking in, I found that
the effect of the smoke had been to stupify the bees. I there-
fore, without fear, began to cut out the nest. It consisted
of cells of wax full of honey. The difficulty was to carry it.

WHAT IT DID FOR ME.

However, as the wax was tolerably hard, I tied it up in a large
handkerchief I fortunately had in my pocket, in which I hoped
at all events to be able to carry home a good quantity of honey

for poor Natty, trusting that it wonld be beneficial to his health.
While employed in putting it up, I observed the honey-bird
Auttering about in a state of great agitation close to me. "Oh,
I almost forgot you," I said, turning to the bird. "You
deserve some honey;" and accordingly, taking some from the
nest, I placed it on the trunk of the fallen tree. Instantly the
bird dashed down, and began eating it with evident delight.
As soon as he had finished the portion I had bestowed on him,
he rose and began fluttering about as before in front of me.
I whistled to him, to try and induce him to come with me, but
I have since heard that whistling encourages the bird, and
makes him more eager to go off in search of another nest.


## p. 426 (#430) ############################################

426
STILL MORE HONEY.
" As you will not come with me, I must go and see what you
want now," I said to the bird, following the way he led. In
vain I whistled. On he went in a wavy course, as before,
directly in front of me. I rather doubted, however, should he
lead me to another honeycomb, whether I could carry it. Still,
I did not like to miss the opportunity of obtaining what might
prove so valuable. I therefore went on in the direction the
honey-bird led. I could not help thinking of tales I had read
in my boyhood of kind fairies or good spirits leading travellers
who had lost their way to some enchanted castle, where a com-
fortable couch and an ample banquet was prepared for them.
Perhaps the honey-bird may have been the origin of such
tales. Sometimes, indeed, an evil fairy has appeared, and be-
guiled thoughtless travellers to their destruction. After the
conduct of my honey-bird I had no doubt about his good in-
tentions. I had gone on for twenty minutes or more, when the
bird pitched on the bough of another decayed tree still stand-
ing upright. Seeing me approach, it began fluttering about,
and pointing its beak towards a hole some way above my head.
"I should have thought you might have known I could not
reach that," I said, looking up at him. "However, I will do
my best to accomplish the feat." The quickest way, I thought,
would be to build a platform on which to stand whilst cut-
ting out the honey. I accordingly chopped down some stout
poles and drove them into the earth, securing cross-pieces with
vines to the trunk. I thus formed an erection similar to a
builder's scaffolding, and now climbing to the top, I made
another small platform directly under the entrance to the nest.
I then proceeded as before, by burning leaves and twigs, and
having thoroughly smoked the unfortunate bees, took posses-
sion of their habitation and store of food. With this further
supply I descended, and having given the honey-bird a share,
put the remainder into the handkerchief. I had to make it

427
more capacious, by fastening a number of vines round it, so as
to form a sort of basket. "Well, Master Honey-bird, if you
will lead me to another nest, I think I could manage to carry
it in this fashion," I said to my little conductor, who seemed
to understand me, and off he flew as merrily as before. This
time he did not appear quite so steady in his course. Sud-
denly he made his way towards a small wood which I saw in
the distance. I followed him, and every now and then he
stopped and looked back to see if I was coming. It was a
tiring walk, for the sun struck down with unusual heat after
the rain, and I began to think that I should have acted more
wisely had I returned at once with my sweet stores. Still, I
did not wish to disappoint the honey-bird, as I was in hopes
he would on another day be on the look-out for me, and help
me to get a further quantity when we might need it.
At last the wood was reached, when, making his way into
it, I saw him pitch on a bough as before; but the trees were
small, and I could see none round likely to contain a cavity in
which bees would have formed a nest. Still, I thought I would
examine the spot, supposing that perhaps some decayed trunk
of a fallen tree might lie beneath. I was advancing rapidly,
when, to my horror, I saw before me a pair of glaring eyes, and
there stood within the thicket an enormous lion with a huge
mane. The king of beasts had just aroused himself apparently
from his noonday rest, and was stretching himself, wondering
who the bold intruder could be who had ventured into his
domains. I gazed at the lion, and the lion gazed at me. I know
I did not like the appearance of the monstrous brute. My rifle
was loaded with ball, but still I dreaded lest, should I fire and
not kill him outright, he might yet attack me. I therefore,
keeping my face towards him, slowly retired, hoping earnestly
that he would go to sleep again, and allow me to retreat un-
molested. Still, from his attitude, I had some doubts whether

428
FACE TO FACE WITH A LION.
or not he was going to spring at me. I dared not take my eye
off him, for I knew that my best prospect of escaping was to
continue facing him boldly. I suspect that he had gone into
the wood to indulge in a nap, after having taken a full meal
off some unfortunate gnu or antelope. I was very thankful
when I at length managed to get to the edge of the wood
without stumbling. I continued to retreat backwards, how.
ever, after this, fearing lest the lion might pounce out upon
me. Every moment I expected to see his enormous head and
shaggy mane appear amid the bushes. It would have been a
very grand sight, but a very disagreeable one. As I retreated
through the wood the treacherous honey-bird flew out also,
twittering as before, just as if he had not played me a scurvy
trick. "What, do you not like the last honeycomb I showed
you?" he seemed to say. I began to think that he was an
evil spirit instead of a kind fairy; but yet, perhaps, after
all, he was as much astonished at finding a lion instead of a
honey-comb as I was. At all events, he appeared regardless
of the danger into which he had led me, and not aware that
I might have shot him dead in a moment. I could not at
the time account for the trick he had played me; but I
have since heard that such is not at all an uncommon occur-
rence, and that honey-birds frequently take the natives who
are in pursuit of honey in the same way up to some savage
monster.
Having got to a considerable distance from the wood, I ven-
tured to turn round and walk forwards, at the sanie time very
frequently casting anxious glances over my shoulder to ascer-
tain whether the lion was coming in pursuit of me. In vain
the honey-bird tried to draw me off on one side. I declined
after this accompanying my little friend any further.
I had taken the bearings of the baobab-tree grove, so that I
could easily find it. When at length I reached it Natty was

429
in a state of great agitation at my long absence, but was de-
lighted with the delicious honey I had brought him.
" Perhaps the honey-birds want to have the wild beasts
killed, and are not aware that when people are only in
search of honey they are not prepared to encounter a lion or
a rhinoceros," he remarked, when I described my adventure.
He might have been incredulous about my account, but I
showed him the honey-bird, which had perched on a branch
near us; and, as soon as I took out the honey, down it came
and ate some of it with the greatest confidence. I then felt
convinced, from his unsuspicious behaviour, that he had had
no intention of leading me into danger.
We immediately ate some of the honey spread on the mush-
rooms. I wished that I could find some means of stew-
ing those curious productions of nature, for they would be, I
was sure, a valuable addition to our fare. Poor Natty still
continued very weak. I did my best to forage for him, but,
in spite of my exertions, the only food I could procure was not
satisfactory for a sick person. As to leaving him, the more I
thought of it the more dangerous for him did it appear. Even
were there nothing to apprehend from the attacks of wild
beasts, he was too weak to obtain even water for himself, and
we had no means of preserving the food I obtained for any
length of time. I should not have cared so much for myself,
but I felt all the time how alarmed our friends would be on
our account, besides which I felt very anxious to go in search
of Leo and his companion. We had reason to be thankful
that we were in so sheltered a spot, as for several days in suc-
cession violent storms burst over us, heavy downfalls of rain
flooding the lower ground in our neighbourhood.
My honey-bird led me in the interval to more bees' nests,
and I got an ample supply of mushrooms; but they, as may
be supposed, were not sufficient to support life. The birds,

getting an abundance of water elsewhere, no longer visited the
pool, and I became greatly afraid of starving.
One day I had gone to the ant-hill in search of mushrooms,
when I saw a troop of gnus coming across the plain. As
they advanced towards me I remained stationary, hiding my.
self from them by the hill. I got my rifle ready to fire,
earnestly hoping that my aim would be steady. On came the
herd, frisking and prancing, till they got within thirty yards of
where I lay concealed. They scented danger, I fancied, for
they began to look about, and seemed ready to dart off in an
opposite direction. I selected the nearest, and fired. I could
scarcely say how delighted I was when over rolled the creature.
He got up, however, and even then would, I was afraid, escape
me. I dashed forward, and drawing my axe, struck him on one
of the hind legs. Down he fell, and in another instant I had
deprived him of life. I now understood the feelings of a
famished hunter. Without a moment's delay I began to cut
up the animal, and loaded myself with as much of the best
parts of the meat as I could carry. The remainder I left for
the birds and beasts of prey, and hurried back with my prize
to Natty. I selected as much as I thought we could consume
while it remained eatable. The rest I cut into thin strips,
and hung them up to the boughs outside our cavern. Natty
meantime made up a fire, with which we roasted a good
portion. I felt no longer surprised at the way I had seen
the blacks feed, so ravenous did the smell of the roasted meat
make me.
"Don't you think that if we were to smoke some flesh it
would keep longer ?" observed Natty.
I followed his suggestion, and from the way it dried I was
in hopes that the experiment would be successful. I was
about to return for the remainder of the meat, to dry it in
this way, when the rain came down.


## p. 431 (#435) ############################################

A CRY FOR HELP.
431
Notwithstanding the more substantial food Natty had now
got, he was still too weak to walk any distance. The flesh of
the gnu, with the honey and mushrooms, enabled us to subsist
in tolerable plenty for a week. The portions I had smoked
and dried, at the end of that time became almost uneatable,
and I saw that I must succeed in killing another animal, or
that we should starve. That night I was awaked from sleep
by hearing a low cry of distress. The dreadful thought
seized me that a hyena had come into our cavern and carried
off Natty. I anxiously put out my hands, and to my relief
found that he was on his bed, breathing quietly. Then I
thought that he must have cried out in his sleep. But again
that low wail of distress reached my ears. It is some human
being, I thought to myself, attacked by wild beasts, or fallen
into a lagoon; indeed, it sounded exactly like the cry of a
person in danger of drowning. Perhaps it may be one of our
friends come in search of us. Again it came through the night
air. I could bear it no longer, for I was certain that a
fellow-creature was in danger. I awoke Natty. "Do not be
alarmed," I said; "I hear some one calling for help. I must
go out and see what I can do, but I will be back presently.
Remain quiet till my return !" Seizing my rifle, and feeling
the lock to ascertain that it was all right, I hurried out in the
direction from whence the sounds came. Again that plaintive
cry reached my ear. I thought I heard the very words,
" Come, come! Help, help!" I dashed forward, for I knew
the ground thoroughly. It could not be a person drowning,
for there was no lagoon in that direction. As I advanced the
wails became lower and lower, and sobs alone reached me.
I was afraid that I was too late to render help. Presently,
bending down, to be more certain of the direction I should
take, I saw against the dark sky the outline of a lion. His
claws were on his prey, and his tail was moving round. "He

has killed the man, I fear," I thought. Still, regardless of the
danger I was running, and urged by an impulse I could not
resist, I rushed forward, ready to fire should the lion advance
towards me. I shouted at the top of my voice. I went ca
till I was within a dozen yards of the brute, and then once
more raised a loud and determined shout. As I did so be
turned his head, and then uttering a loud growl, slowly
stalked away, and disappeared behind some bushes at a little
distance. I hurried to the spot he had quitted, but instead
of a human being, I saw before me an animal stretched life-
less on the ground. On feeling the head, I discovered that
it had no horns, and then, taking one of the hoofs in my
hand, I found that it was either a zebra or quagga. To
leave it there would be to ensure its being carried off by its
destroyer. I therefore set to work as well as I could in
the dark, and cut off the flesh, looking up cautiously every
minute, as may be supposed, to ascertain whether the lion
was coming back to reclaim his prey. The necessity of ob-
taining food only could have induced me to run so terrible
a risk, for I could scarcely suppose that the monarch of the
woods would allow me thus before his face to carry off his
prize. He did not appear, however. I supposed that, never
having before encountered a human being, he was more alarmed
by my appearance than I had been by his. Perhaps he took
me for a gorilla, which the lion is said to hold in wholesome
fear.
I now hastened back to Natty. The lion must have
returned and carried off the portions I left him, for the next
morning not a particle of the zebra could I discover. Still, it
was not pleasant to know that he was in our neighbourhood.
I treated the flesh of the zebra as I had done that of the gau,
- although it was not quite so palatable.
The following day we were seated at our dinner, when, look

ing out, I saw a troop of zebras trotting by, stopping occasion-
aily to feed, and then again moving on. I remarked especially
a young zebra following them at a short distance. They

passed close to the thicket in which I had seen the lion
disappear. "If the old fellow is there," I observed to Natty,
"I should not be surprised were he to rush out and seize one
of them." Scarcely had I spoken when the whole herd began
frisking about, and scampering here and there. Just then I
heard a loud roar, and, as I had been surmising might possibly
occur, out dashed a gray old lion towards the little zebra. I
had instinctively seized my rifle. "You shall not kill that pretty
little beast if I can help it," I exclaimed. But the lion seemed

and fired come up

determined that he would do so in spite of me. In another
instant he was up to the zebra, and had struck him with one of
his paws, which threw it staggering some paces from me. He
was evidently, I saw, an old fellow, unable to leap as a young
lion does. I ran forward, and before he had again come up
with the little zebra, I had levelled my rifle and fired. The
ball hit him in the head, and over he rolled. Greatly to my
astonishment, the little zebra, instead of attempting to escape,
rose to his feet, and, looking at me for a moment, came trotting
towards me. "I am sure I know you," I exclaimed. "You
are Bella's little pet." The poor little creature was very much
hurt, but not, I hoped, maimed altogether. From the way be
came up to me, I had not the slightest doubt that my conjecture
was right; for when I held out my hand, he put his nose into
it, and seemed to recognize me as a friend. He looked very
thin, but as I examined him I was sure that he was an old
acquaintance. The lion, meantime, giving a few struggles, fell
over perfectly dead. Putting my handkerchief round the
zebra's neck, I led him up to our tree. Great was Natty's
delight at seeing him.
"O Andrew," he exclaimed, "now there is a way for
us to rejoin our friends. Though you cannot carry me so far,
Zebra, I am sure, can; and as soon as he is well, we will set out."
As there was ample room for the little animal inside our
cavern, I brought him in, and closed the entrance. Having
washed his side, I bound it up with a handkerchief, when the
bleeding stopped. The rain had brought up an abundance of
grass. I went out and cut some, which he readily ate out of
my hand. Having done this, I went back to examine the
lion. I found the mane thickly streaked with gray; and on
examining his huge mouth, I discovered that the teeth were
completely worn away, while his claws were broken and
blunted. This accounted for the escape of the little zebra.

I had heard that when lions in their old age can no longer

yards of the natives, attacking their goats, and sometimes,
indeed, try to carry off women and children. It was the
consciousness, probably, of his weakness which made the old
fellow so easily render up his prey to me on a former
occasion. In spite of his age and probable toughness, I was
tempted to see if I could get any steaks out of him, to form a
supply of food should our stock of meat not be sufficient to last
as till we could get home. I cut off a few pounds; but the
smell of the flesh at last made me desist, thinking that neither
Natty nor I would be able to eat it, either smoked or dried.
I had thrown it down, indeed, but still I thought it might be
wiser to secure some; so I took up what I had cut off, and
returned with it to the tree. Without telling Natty, I lighted
a fire, and cutting it into strips, hung it up to the branches,
so that it might be thickly enveloped in smoke. By giving
the little zebra plenty of grass, in three or four days he had
entirely recovered from his injury. Natty also said that he
felt better, and was sure he could undertake the journey
homeward.

CHAPTER XXI.
ANXIETY ABOUT OUR FRIENDS— A SEARCH FOR LEO.
SN a bright morning, as soon as we had breakfasted, I
mounted Natty on the zebra's back, and leading
A him with my handkerchief, set off in the direction
of our home. I had manufactured some baskets, in
which I stowed the honeycombs and the remaining
portion of our meat, with several large white mushrooms. I
hoped we might find provisions on our way; at the same time,
as I had only three or four charges of powder left, I did not
think it wise to abandon what we possessed. The little zebra
bore Natty very willingly, but, unaccustomed to the burden on
its back, could only proceed at a slower pace than I could have
walked. However, I was very thankful to have this means of
conveyance for my young friend. The sun came down with
great heat, and I began to fear he would suffer from it.
Accordingly I steered a course towards a clump of trees, where
he might rest under the shade. I placed him on the ground,
and told him to hold the zebra, which, I was afraid, night,
following the wild instincts of its nature, scamper off. I then
cut a stick and several boughs with large leaves, with which
I manufactured a parasol to shelter him as we walked
along. He was very grateful for the shade, and begged that
I would make it sufficiently large to shelter my head also.

AGAIN ENCAMPED.
437
This I accordingly did. I should have said that I had doubled
up my jacket and placed it on the zebra's back for a saddle.
I made also, out of some vines, a pair of stirrups, which enabled
Natty to ride more at ease.
Having taken some dinner, we again pushed on. I was
greatly disappointed when, as the evening began to close in,
I found that we were still at a considerable distance from the
hill which we were anxious to reach. Just as I had finished
our hut, it occurred to me that should we leave the zebra
tethered outside, it might very likely attract either lions or
hyenas, or other wild beasts of prey. I accordingly cut down
a large number of stakes, with which I formed an enclosure by
the side of the hut. I covered it also with a tolerably strong
roof, lest any animal might leap over the walls. The little
creature had, I suspect, learned so severe a lesson during his
wanderings with his kindred, that he seemed fully to under-
stand the necessity for these arrangements. At all events,
when I led him in he was perfectly quiet and contented,
especially when I gave him as much grass as he could require.
I also made up a large fire outside our hut, and although I
did not attempt to keep awake all the night, I was able to
rouse myself from time to time to throw on enough wood
to keep it alive. Although I heard the sounds of animals
in the distance, the fire prevented them from making an
attack on us.
The next morning we again started. Natty looked some-
what better; but when, in order to relieve the little zebra, he
got off and attempted to walk, he was unable to proceed many
paces, and made no objection when I again put him on the
animal's back.
There are several species in Africa allied to the zebra.
One is known as the daw, the legs of which are not striped
to the hoof as are those of the zebra. The mane is short and

bristly. There is another called the quagga, which differs but
little from it except in the marking. They all belong to the
genus Asinus ; indeed, in most respects they are more like asses
than horses, but very different from the enduring asses of old
England.
We fell in with a troop of quaggas of a pale yellow colour,

magnificent animals with regard to shape and action. It is
said that the true zebra cannot be tamed ; indeed, I have no
doubt that the ordinary method of taming horses would not
succeed with so spirited an animal. Our pet was tamed
entirely by gentleness and kindness, or it would have re-
mained as wild and savage as its fellows. I believe there

are no animals which cannot be made subject to man, provided
they are treated in the right way. I have often wished that
our horses and asses in England were treated more gently. I
am sure they would be more faithful and useful animals than
they often prove when subjected to a contrary system.
As we proceeded, we began to recognize more clearly the
outline of the hills on which we had so long lived. Still,
however, we were at a considerable distance, and I soon saw
that, at the slow rate we were proceeding, another day must
elapse before we could reach them. The arrangements of the
previous night were repeated with similar success. We now
hoped to reach our destination early in the afternoon. Once
more the lake appeared in sight, the stream running into it,
the woods on the other side, and the well-known hill, though we
were much too far off to distinguish our village. The little
zebra seemed to know it also, for he hastened his pace. We
were anticipating the delight our reappearance would give our
friends, though then the thought came across us of the disap-
pointment they would feel at not seeing Leo. "But perhaps,"
said Natty," they have gone in search of him, and discovered
him and brought him back, and we shall find him all well ; oh,
how joyful that will be !" As we reached the hill I could not
resist the temptation of firing off my rifle, to attract the atten-
tion of our friends, and give them notice of our coming. No
one, however, appeared; still I was sure they must have heard
the report. We wound our way up the hill, when we came to
a point where I expected to see the huts; but no trace of them
could I discover. The grass was green from the recent rains ;
the trees waved on the hill-side as before ; but the huts, the
habitations of our friends, where were they? I shouted out, but
no answer came. My heart sank within me. I could no ·
longer restrain my anxiety, and telling Natty to follow slowly,
I rushed up the hill. There, on the spot where the huts

410
WHERE ARE OUR FRIENDS ?
had stood, were heaps of charred timber. I felt faint and
sick! What had become of our friends! I scarcely dared to
search about, lest I might find some dreadful traces of their
death. Oh no, no! It is impossible! The dear, energetic,
gentle Kate—such could not have been her fate! And sweet
little Bella too! Still, I could not resist the temptation to
search about. There were no traces of human beings. I
saw, too, by the way the grass had sprung up, that some time
must have passed since the fire took place. I roused myself
as I saw Natty approaching. I was afraid of what the effect
might be on him, and hurried down the hill to prepare him
for the scene ; indeed, I thought it might be better to turn the
zebra's head, and let him proceed down the mountain again.
Still, I did not like to leave the spot without a further exa-
mination.
" I should like to look at it," said Natty, when I told him.
"I cannot believe that they are lost; and perhaps by an
examination we may discover something to guide us in our
future proceedings."
The little zebra did not object to come up the hill, but
when he reached the black spot where the house had stood, he
stopped, gazing at it, and I thought trembled.
"It seems to me," said Natty, after remaining silent for å
minute or two, "that the zebra must have made his escape
when the huts were on fire, and the other animals were
set free. "Oh! I do—I do hope that our friends escaped! I
will not believe that they did not !"
I would not let Natty quit the zebra, but allowed him to
sit down on a stone, holding the rein, while I examined the
ruins in the neighbourhood. Though I searched carefully in
every direction, not a trace of any sort could I discover.
Everything they had must have been destroyed or carried off
by them. I trusted that the latter was the case.

ON ?? KABOMBA.
441
"It is of no use, Natty," I said at last. "Here they are
not, and we must go in search of them."
"What do you think, Andrew ?" said Natty. "Perhaps
they have gone to Kabomba, where the people know the
captain and Timbo, and would, I am sure, receive them
kindly."
"I trust you are right, Natty," I said ; " and we will set
off there immediately."
Without loss of time we descended the hill. I had spent
so much time, however, in examining the ruins, that we could
get but a little distance before it grew dark. I made our
camp as usual, and had only finished a hut sufficient to hold
Natty before darkness overtook us. I made up a good fire,
also, and hoped by tethering the zebra close to the hut, that
no wild beast would injure him during the night. There
was little fear of my fire going out, for my anxiety concerning
our friends kept me awake. Over and over again I thought
of all sorts of accidents which might have happened. We had
but little food remaining, and all but my last charge of powder
was expended. Still, my anxiety about our friends prevented
me thinking of our own condition.
We travelled on all next day, and I began to fear that we must
have passed the village. Just, however, as the sun was about
to set, his rays lighted up the tops of some huts in the distance.
We made towards them, though still doubtful whether they
were those of Kabomba or not. Perhaps the inhabitants had
themselves attacked and destroyed our friends. I had often
heard of the treachery of the natives, and these might be as
bad as others.
"Still, we must hazard everything for the sake of ascertain-
ing the truth," I said to Natty:
"Oh yes, yes," he answered. "I do not fear them; and
after all, Andrew, they can but kill us; and if they have killed

442
A FRIENDLY RECEPTION.
our friends, were it not wrong, I should almost wish that they
would kill us."
As we got nearer to the side of the village I had no longer
any doubt that it was the one Stanley had visited. That we
might not take the inhabitants by surprise, as I drew near I
shouted out, and presently several people appeared at the chief
entrance. As soon as they saw us they came running forward.
Among them was an old man, whom, by his appearance, I took
to be the chief. He had no weapon, and as he drew near, his
countenance, which wore a friendly expression, reassured me.
I therefore hastened on, leading the zebra, to meet him. He
took my hands in his, and looking into my face, seemed to be
inquiring whence we came. Then he seized Natty's hands and
stroked his face, and exhibited every sign of regard. He cast,
however, an astonished gaze at the zebra, and was evidently
greatly surprised at seeing the docility of the animal.
"At all events, you see, they are friends," said Natty. "I
do hope they can give us some account of the rest."
We were quickly conducted inside the village. The chief
led us to his house. He then seemed to inquire what we
would do with the little zebra, and pointed to a small enclo-
sure on one side. I begged that it might be placed within it,
and signified that I should be glad if it could be supplied with
grass. Immediately several people set out with knives, I con-
cluded for the purpose of cutting the grass. My disappoint-
ment was great, however, at not seeing any of our friends, and
by all the signs I could think of I inquired of the chief what
had become of them. I could get no satisfactory reply
to my questions, and I could not help supposing that the
chief had some reason for not informing me. We were taken
at once into his house, and in a short time food was placed be-
fore us. How delicious the plantains and cassava tasted, and
some well-dressed venison. As soon as our hunger was satisfied

NEWS OF OUR FRIENDS.
443
I again began to inquire by signs about our friends. A
stranger coming in might have supposed that I was performing
some pantomimic play for his especial amusement. He,
however, scemed greatly puzzled, and I concluded of course
that I had not the right talent for my purpose. At length a
sign of intelligence came over his countenance, and he now in
return made a variety of gestures, which I must own were con-
siderably more clear than mine. He first pointed to the north,
and held op his fingers, counting the number of people of
whom our party consisted. He then got up and ran across
the room, and next opened his arms, and seemed to be receiving
some phantom guests. He then lay down on the ground and
pretended to be asleep, and got up seven times; by which I
understood that they had come and remained at the vil-
lage that number of days. He next pointed southward, and
seemed to be mourning, as if regretting that they had taken
their departure. I now told Natty I was sure our friends
had come to the village, and after stopping a few days had pro-
ceeded to the south. The chief seemed to understand that
Natty was ill, and he and his wives did their best to arrange
a comfortable bed for him withi mats placed over dried grass
strewed on the ground. I hoped that after a day's rest he
would be able again to set forward, as I wished to lose no
time in following our friends. I spoke of my intention to
Natty.
" Can you think of doing so without first trying to find
Leo?" he said. "Perhaps our new friends here will assist
us."
"If you were better able to undergo the fatigue I would," I
said ; " but I wish first to place you in safety."
"Oh, do not think of that," he answered, " leave me here.
The people seem so friendly, that I am sure they will take
care of me; and though I wish very much indeed to go with

444
AN IDOL DESTROYED.
you, I am sure I should only be an impediment to your pro-
gress."
I immediately set to work to try and make the chief under-
stand that two of our party were in captivity somewhere in
the east or south-east, and that I wished to go in search of
them. I was nearly sure that he understood me, and with
some hopes of setting off next day I lay down to get a sounder
sleep than I might possibly enjoy for many days to come.
The next morning, when I again entered on the subject, he
appeared to be unwilling to accede to my wishes. I was in-
deed not sorry to rest another day and night, hoping that in the
meantime something might occur to assist my project. I re-
membered the account Stanley had given of the idol like a
crocodile which he had seen. Curiosity prompted me to search
for it as I walked about the village. The chief divined my ob-
ject, and, taking my arm, led me into a hut, where on the
ground lay a number of fragments of plaster, wicker-work, and
hair. On these he stamped, and then turned away with a
contemptuous glance, touching his ears and eyes, and then
shaking his head, as much as to say that the idol could neither
hear nor see. From several other signs he made, I came to the
conclusion that Timbo had carried out his project, and at all
events succeeded in showing the blacks the falsity of their
wretched faith. I had hopes, too, that he had also planted
the germs of a purer one in their minds. It was on that
and other accounts very vexatious being so utterly unable
to exchange ideas with them. One thing wa scertain,—they
were disposed to treat Natty and I with the greatest kind-
ness. At last, by perseverance, I made the chief understand
what I wanted, and he signified his readiness to assist me. I
showed him also that I wished him to take care of Natty while
I was away. At this he seemed highly pleased, and brought
his son—a boy of about Natty's age—to show that he would

445
be his companion, and that he would take as good care of him
as he would of his own children. To show his still greater
readiness to assist me, he brought a number of articles which
had evidently been left by our friends, I could not make out
whether as gifts or not. He signified that we might ransom
Leo with them if he was detained as a prisoner. These, and
sufficient provisions to last me for several days, I placed on the
back of the zebra. The load, though not very heavy, was as
much as I thought it could carry. .
I was doubtful whether I should venture to go alone, or ob-
tain some attendants. If they proved faithful they would be
of great use, otherwise I would rather have trusted to my own
energy and watchfulness. The matter was settled by the chief
bringing up three young men, whom he signified were to accom-
pany me. They were armed with shields, bows and arrows, and
spears; but these might alarm their countrymen, and I knew I
must depend for success only on pacific measures. It cost me
a good deal to part with Natty. He looked so sorrowful when
I bid him good-bye.
"But you will bring back Leo; I know you will," he said.
"I cannot help thinking he is not very far off."
Just as I was parting the chief brought me a prize, which,
in my circumstances, was of the greatest value. It was a
powder-horn full of fine powder. I could not help fancying
it must have been left behind by accident. It was certainly,
however, not the one which Stanley had been in the habit
of using.
I think I have before said that the zebra would not allow
any of the blacks to come near him. I was therefore obliged
to lead him myself, they following at a little distance behind.
He then went on readily enough ; but the moment they came
near his heels, he flung out in a way which made them always
keep at a respectful distance.


## p. 446 (#450) ############################################

446
A VILLAGE REACITED.
I must give a very brief account of my journey. It re-
quired a good deal of calculation to direct my course. I had
first to consider the position of the village where Natty and
I had remained so long near the lake. It was some distance to
the south-east of this that I might hope to find Leo, and yet
at no very great distance, otherwise my former hosts would
not have refused to go beyond the stream, at which it will be
remembered we turned back. The journey might, I thought,
occupy me three or four days, if I could manage to steer a
direct course for it. The weather was now again fine, so we
camped out at night, lighting the usual watch-fires; and I lay
down on the ground with the zebra tethered near me. We
saw two or three villages in the distance; but I understood
from my companions that they were sure no white men were
there, or they would have heard of it. At length, at the end
of a four days' journey, a village appeared directly before us,
situated on some rising ground. It was in the direction
where, by my calculations, I thought it possible the one would
be found to which Leo had been carried. A number of goats
were feeding on the side of the hill, and below my eyes were
gladdened by the sight of some horned cattle, which, by their
movements, were evidently tame.
My companions now made signs to me that I might go
on alone, as they did not feel disposed to trust themselves
within the village until they had ascertained the disposition
of the inhabitants. Leading the zebra, I therefore walked on
till I came in sight of a gate at the end of the principal street, ii
I may so call it, it being always remembered that the houses
were only reed huts, and the gates were composed of rough
poles. As I neared it several people issued forth with javelins
in their hands, and, vociferating loudly, rushed towards me.
My gun was slung at my back, so I held up my hands to show
that I had no intention of attacking them. On this they

"GONE ! GONE !"
447 *
somewhat slackened their pace, though they still held their
weapons in a threatening manner. I knew that my best chance
of safety was to advance boldly without showing any sign
of fear. This had the desired effect, and they now came on in
a more friendly manner. They showed signs of astonishment at
seeing the zebra in my company, and, I observed, paid me
more respect from believing that I had the power of taming an
animal so generally untamable. We were still at some little
distance from the gates, when another person came out. Seeing
me, he rushed forward, and breaking through the people who
surrounded me, threw himself at my feet. Greatly to my
delight I recognized young Mango. Tears dropped from his
eyes as he took my hands.
"O massa, so glad! so glad !" he exclaimed, showing that
he had not forgotten his small knowledge of English.
"And Leo?" I asked, taking him by the hand; "where
is he?"
"Gone! gone!" he answered.
My heart sank as I heard this.
"What! dead?" I exclaimed, the thought of the grief his
death would cause his sisters and Natty, indeed all of us,
coming into my mind.
I was greatly relieved when Mango answered, -
"No, massa, not dead; but gone away," and he pointed
south.
"What! did any one come to take him away, or did he go
all alone?"
"Yes, massa, all alone," said Mango. "He run away.
Dey catchy me, and bring back."
This was indeed disappointing. Still, I hoped that he
might reach some place of safety, or that possibly I might
find him. On making further inquiries of Mango, I ascertained
that he had started only two days before. Then I thought,

448
A FAT CHIEF.
perhaps he has gone towards Kabomba ; I may actually have
passed him on the road.
The inhabitants now conducted me into the village, accom-
panied by Mango, and I was led before the chief. He was an
enormously fat man, and was seated on a pile of matting in
a sort of verandah in front of his abode, and supported by a
number of women, whom I took to be his wives. Determined
not to be treated as a prisoner, I went up at once and shook
him by the hand, and told Mango to explain that I had come
from a distance to look for a young countryman, and that my
people would be very angry if any injury had happened to
him. The chief was evidently not addicted to making long
speeches, indeed it was with difficulty he brought out his
words. Mango interpreted what he said. He declared that
he had no intention of injuring the white boy; that his people
had found him and his companion some time back, and that
he had since fed him and taken good care of him, and that of
his own accord he had run away.
"Yes," added Mango, "what he say true; but when we
want go away, he no let us, so Massa Leo run. He got rifle
and powder, too, and dis make old rogue here wish keepy."
I concluded from this that Leo's case had been very similar
to ours, and as my anxiety about him had somewhat decreased,
I began to fear that the fat chief would detain me in his place.
I therefore assumed a still more authoritative air, and declared
that though my people were very much obliged to the chief
for taking care of our friends, they would be very angry at
his having detained them longer than they wished.
"Tell him I insist upon their letting you go immediately,
and if they do so, I am prepared to make them a present; but
that if not, I shall fight my way out of the place on the back
of my wonderful steed there."-pointing to the zebra – "and
very likely return and burn their village to the ground."


## p. 449 (#453) ############################################

MY RECEPTION.
449
" Bery good," said Mango; and he began to interpret my
address, adding, I suspect, not a few threats and boastings of
his own.
The effect, at all events, was to make the old chief and his
attendants treat me with great civility. His wives hurried off
to prepare a banquet, and I was allowed to proceed through
the village with Mango as my guide. I led the zebra all the
time, for the little animal showed a great disinclination to
leave me, or to go nearer the blacks than he could help; indeed,
when any of them drew near, as was his usual custom, he struck
out with his heels right and left at them, or, if they appeared in
front, he ran forward and tried to bite them. He, however,
appeared to recognize Mango, and though he would not allow
him to touch his head, yet he showed no hostility when he
came near.
By the time the banquet—which consisted of a variety of
dishes of the meat of several wild animals—was over, it was
almost dark. I had no doubt my attendants would camp out
in the neighbourhood of the village, and I therefore told the
chief that I would take my departure, accompanied by Mango,
and camp with them, to be ready to start on the following
morning. I found, however, that he had no intention of
letting me go so easily, and insisted that I must pass the
night in his village. Seeing how matters stood, I said that
I had no objection to do this, but that I must have a
house to myself, where my zebra would obtain accommoda-
tion, as I could not be parted from the animal; and that I
wanted Mango also to attend on me. There is an old say-
ing, "There is nothing like asking for a thing one wants,"
and I found the advantage of so doing; for my request,
after the chief had consulted his wives, was granted. This
arrangement being made, I told Mango to inform the chief
that I required a supply of green grass for my animal. This

also was brought me before night. I asked Mango whether
he thought the chief intended to detain us. He did not think
so; but expressed himself ready to try and get out of the
village during the night, if I thought it advisable. I dis-
covered, on further questioning him, that he and Leo had
heard of the appearance of some white people at the distance
of three or four days' journey off, towards the south-west, and
though the account was not very exact, from that moment Leo
had determined to make his escape. He arranged that if they
could not get off together he should go first, and leave marks
to show his route. Mango was to follow, or should he be pre-
vented, Leo promised that he would return with his friends to
his rescue.
"But, massa," added Mango, "long way walky. Dey got
cows, big horns, for ridey. Me steal one for massa."
Perhaps I am making Mango speak even more clearly than
he really did; but he made me understand his meaning by
the help of words and signs.
"No," I replied. "I shall be very glad to buy one of their
animals, though they must suppose it is for you to ride, and
not for me, as they now believe that I could not possibly
require any other steed beside my zebra."
While I remained in the hut, I sent Mango to the chief
with an offer to buy an ox, provided he would bring several
to the village early in the morning for me to choose from.
Mango shortly returned to say that the chief agreed to my
proposal ; indeed, the old man was probably, as most Africans
are, perfectly ready to do a stroke of business, particularly as
Mango had told him that I was willing to pay a good price for
the animal.

CHAPTER XXII.
A SEARCH FOR LEO, AND AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.
NEED not enter into the particulars of my purchase.
The transaction was soon completed. I had brought
articles sufficient, I hoped, to ransom both Leo and
23 Mango. I told the chief that, although I did not
Be consider myself bound to pay him anything for
releasing Mango, yet I would make him a present in con-
sideration of the kind treatment which he and my young
countryman had experienced. All parties seemed well pleased,
especially when I offered a further sum for some provisions-
cassava, plantains, antelope flesh, and dried elephant meat--
which I intended for my attendants, whom I hoped to meet
in the valley below.
In case the fickle negroes should change their mind, I
hurried off as soon as I possibly could without exciting their
undue suspicions, and was glad to find that no one followed
us. We took our way down the hill to a spot where I left
my three attendants, but they were nowhere to be seen.
There was their camp-fire, but it had long gone out; and I
supposed that, having been alarmed, they had taken to flight.
I hoped to come up with them further on. Still, no traces
could I see of the deserters. As I had made up my mind to
search for Leo before returning to Kabomba, I gave up the pur-

suit, and turned on one side for the purpose of intersecting the
course I concluded, from Mango's account, that he had taken.
Leo had promised to make crosses on trees, and where no
trees existed to cut the same mark on the grass, or to arrange
stones in a like form, or to stick little crosses into the ground,
to show his course. "I always thought that Leo had his wits
about him, and this proves it!" I exclaimed, though Mango
probably did not understand me. We accordingly examined
the ground on either side as we went along. I could still see
in the far distance the outlines of the village, and, judging by
the sun, I calculated that it was about north-east of us, while
I hoped by travelling south-west to come up with my young
friend.
We had been searching for some time, and at Mango's
suggestion I had mounted the ox. I have not before de-
scribed the animal. It was clean-limbed, almost white, with
long pointed horns projecting horizontally from its head; a
thoroughly tame and tractable animal. It went on at a steady
pace, sufficient to keep Mango and the zebra at a trot. We
were searching carefully as we went for Leo's promised indi-
cation of his route, when Mango suddenly started off, and
running a few paces, lifted up a small cross, formed of two
pieces of wood, fastened together by the material of which the
natives make their mats. Mango's delight was excessive.
"See! see!" he exclaimed. "We now find—we now find
Massa Leo!" and running on ahead, he lifted up a second cross
made in the same way. The arms of both of them were
pointing in the direction which we supposed Leo had taken.
This fact also showed his forethought, for if a single cross
only had been left, we should have had to search about
perhaps for a long time before ascertaining his route. We
now went on with more confidence. From the start he had
had, I feared it would be some time before we could come up

with him. Still, as lie had his rifle and provisions to carry, I
knew that he could not proceed as fast as we were doing. We
travelled on till nightfall, when we tethered the animals with
some rope which Mango had brought, lighted our fires, and
made a slight shelter from the wind. As the weather was
clear, there was no necessity for building a substantial hut.
Having unloaded the zebra, I placed the packages under my
head as a pillow, keeping my rifle as usual by my side, and
told Mango that we would watch alternately during the night.
I gave him the first watch, with directions to call me after a
couple of hours, intending to allow him a longer rest than
I took myself. I was awoke by a loud roar sounding in my
ears. It was the well-known voice of a lion. I started up.
So did Mango, for he had been asleep. A few glowing embers
of the fire alone remained. I had seized my rifle instinctively,
and with it in my hand looked around on every side. The ox
stood near, though trembling violently; but the little zebra was
nowhere to be seen. I caught sight, however, of the massive
form of a lion bounding over the ground. The zebra, I hoped,
had escaped, though the lion might be pursuing it, and I re-
solved to try and save the life of our little pet. I fired, and be-
lieved that I had hit the savage brute, for it stopped and growled
more furiously than before. Meantime Mango was employed
in throwing sticks on the fire, blowing with might and main to
make them blaze up. The lion drew nearer. Again I fired,
but missed. There might be scarcely time to reload before
the lion would be upon me. I hurriedly began to do so.
I never more eagerly rammed down a charge. Still the lion
came on. Mango piled on more sticks, and blew and blew
harder than ever, as if his existence depended on it. So, per-
haps, it did, for bad the lion made a spring, and had I again
missed him, Mango's life must have been sacrificed. Just then
the fire blazed up. Fortunately the sticks were very dry. A

SIGNS OF LEO.
few bounds would have brought the savage brute up to us. I
shouted, and so did Mango, with might and main. I refrained,
however, from firing till the lion had approached nearer, for
should I not kill him outright, he might, in spite of the fire,
rush towards us. On he came roaring, but slowly, afraid of
the flames. Once more he stopped. He dared not face them.
Greatly to my relief, he then turned round and moved off, roar-
ing furiously. Fearing that he might still pursue the zebra,
which I hoped had escaped, and might, after making a circuit,
come back to us, I raised my rifle and fired again. I fancied
I could hear the thud of the bullet as it struck the lion behind
the shoulder. Fearful were the roars he uttered; but defeated,
he stalked off, evidently having had enough of the fight.
Mango, who had been thoroughly alarmed, seemed very peni-
tent for having gone to sleep. There was no necessity to
point out to him the danger we had been in in consequence.
He tried to say he would never do so again. At last 1
persuaded him to lie down and rest, while I sat up. I kept
looking round, in the hope of seeing the zebra trot up to
us, but when the morning came our little pet had not re-
turned.
I had begun to cook our breakfast even before daylight,
that we might lose no time in starting, so as to take advantage
of the cool air of the early day. We had not gone far when
we came to a small cross made of stones on the ground. It
revived my spirits, for it was the sign that Leo had passed
that way. Then again the fear came across me that the
lion which had scented us out might have attacked him.
During the day we passed several other crosses, some cut, as
he had promised, in the trees; but the greater number were
composed, as were the first we had seen, of sticks. It took a
shorter time to erect them than to cut the marks on the trees
or the grass, or even to make crosses of stones on the ground.

HIS KNAPSACK AND RIFLE FOUND.
455
Frequently during the day I turned back, in the hope of
seeing the zebra following us, but I was disappointed.
The next night passed away, and then another, and Mango
kept wide awake during his watch. Leo must have pushed on
well, for still the crosses appeared. We came on all the spots
where he had slept—his lean-to or hut, with the ashes of his
fire before it; and generally midway between them a black
patch alone, where he had stopped to cook his mid-day meal.
We found the feathers of several birds which he had shot. It was
evident, indeed, that he had exercised all the sagacity of an
experienced hunter--remarkable in one so young. I was very
thankful that I had an animal to ride, for the heat and the
constant exertion I was undergoing tried me greatly
On the third day we still found Leo's crosses, but several
were out of the straight line. The country had become open,
similar in character to that which I had passed over with
Natty. Hitherto we had found springs affording sufficient
water for ourselves and the ox. Now, however, we had to go
a long way without meeting with any, though we carried
enough in our bottle for ourselves, and a small quantity for
the patient ox. Travelling on, I saw something lying on the
ground a short distance off. I pointed it out to Mango, who
ran towards it, and returned with a knapsack. "Yes," he said
in a sorrowful tone, "dis Massa Leo's." I recognized it
indeed as the one Leo had with him. Fatigue alone could
have made him throw it aside; and perhaps, hoping soon to
reach the Europeans of whom he had heard, he would no
longer encumber himself with it. Securing it to the ox's
back, we went on still more eagerly, looking carefully about
on every side. I expected every moment to overtake Leo.
We went on for another mile or more, when to my dismay we
found his rifle on the ground. That he certainly would not
have thrown away unless greatly overcome by fatigue. Still,

CAN THIS BE LEO?
perhaps, he might have had no powder, and found it a useless
encumbrance. I, however, dreaded that, weak as he must have
been before he would quit his knapsack and rifle, he might
have fallen an easy victim to some beast of prey. Though we
looked anxiously about, we could see nothing of him. Pre-
sently Mango, who had gone ahead of me, began running
very fast. I pushed on to overtake him, when I saw, lying
on the ground, a human form, by the side of which Mango
had thrown himself. Could it be Leo? I urged the ox into
a gallop, and did not stop till I reached the spot. My worst
apprehensions were fulfilled. There lay Leo extended on the
grass.
" Is he dead ?" I exclaimed, in a faltering voice.
" Hope not, massa," answered Mango, looking up; "he 'till
breathes."
The words somewhat relieved my fears, and throwing myself
from the ox, I knelt down by his side. My first care was to
pour some water down his throat, then to bathe his temples ;
to treat him, indeed, as I had Natty under similar circum-
stances. I cannot express my thankfulness when I saw him at
length open his eyes. He gazed at me with a look of surprise,
but he was still too weak to speak. He pointed to his lips,
and I gave him more water. It was necessary to get him at once
into the shade, for, exposed to the hot sun, it was scarcely pos-
sible that he could regain his strength. Mango accordingly lifted
him up on the ox's back, and I supporting him in my arms,
he urged the animal on towards a wood we saw in the distance.
Leo was still too weak to speak, but he recognized me, and a
grateful look lighted up his eyes as he gazed at my face. As
I thought he might understand me, I briefly narrated some of
my adventures in search of him, of course not telling him my
anxiety about his sisters and brothers. How thankful I felt
that I had come in time to save him, for it was evident that

he would not have survived many hours lying out on the
exposed plain. I was now doubtful whether we should pro-
ceed on in the same course we had been steering, or turn away
to the west in search of Kabomba, where, I felt sure, he would
be well taken care of. I should have to go there at all events
for Natty, even if we could gain certain tidings that our friends
were further south. Presently Leo's lips moved, and I heard
him whispering, " On! on as before! You will find them,
I am sure ! " This decided me. Still, I resolved to rest at
the nearest wood we could reach. I was thankful when at
length we arrived at one -a little oasis in the desert. What
was still more satisfactory, within it appeared a small pool, a
bright stream rushing out of the bank on its side. We had
tethered the ox. While Mango sat by Leo's side bathing his
temples and wetting his lips, I was busily employed in collect-
ing wood for our hut. Suddenly the sound of animals rushing
across the plain reached my ears. I looked up, and saw a
troop of giraffes galloping at-full speed, and, closely following
them, two horsemen. On they dashed! Shouting at the top
of my voice, I called again and again. I rushed to the ox, in
the vain hope of overtaking them. Even at that distance I
fancied I recognized Stanley, though his companion's figure I did
not know. Just as I was about to mount, there came tearing
after them, as if in pursuit, a large herd of buffaloes, among
which appeared several huge rhinoceroses. It seemed as if
they were in pursuit of the horsemen. Another herd of
buffaloes came out of the wood opposite, and stopping, gazed
a few moments before joining the chase. The whole passed
by like creatures in a dream. I saw at once that it would be
impossible to catch up the horsemen ; besides which, I should
have run a great chance of being gored to death by the rhino-
ceroses or buffaloes. On they went, tearing across the plain.
Poor Leo lifted up his head.

A NIGHT MARCII.
Just then Mango called to me. "He say he sure dey're
friends," said Mango. "We go after dem."
"Not just yet," I answered ; " but it is a great satisfaction
to have seen them, for it shows that they must be encamped
not far off, though in which direction it is hard to say."
Had I been alone, I should certainly have followed; but it
would have killed Leo to move. I therefore remained en-
camped, hoping that he would soon be sufficiently recovered to
proceed. In a short time not an animal was to be seen. How:
ever, the incident greatly raised my spirits, especially as Leo
was evidently getting better. Mango and I therefore went
on building a hut, and collecting wood for a fire. We mean-
time propped up Leo with the baggage and some piles of wood.
While thus employed, I saw a couple of parrots on a bough
near, and fortunately killed them; and by the time our fire was
burned up, Mango had plucked them, and they were soon
roasting before it.
Night came on; but Leo was very restless, and declared
that he could not sleep. I did everything I could to soothe
him, but in vain. At length the moon rose and lighted up
the whole landscape. "Me t'ink good time go on," said
Mango. I thought so too; indeed, I had become very anxious
about Leo. The camp, I hoped, was at no great distance, and
I thought it would be better to obtain assistance for him,
rather than take a long rest and have to travel during the heat
of the day. Accordingly, rousing our patient ox, which had
lain down near the fire after cropping the abundant grass, I
mounted and lifted Leo up, holding him in my arms. Mango
carried my rifle, and led the animal, that I might be more at
liberty to support my young friend. On we went over the
plain. We had gone some distance, when I felt Leo resting
more heavily on my arm. I asked him what was the matter,
He did not answer. I feared that he had fainted. Telling

Mango to stop, we bathed his temples, and I poured a few
drops of water down his throat. I had no other remedy. It
slightly revived him, for he opened his eyes and spoke a few
words; but his condition made me more than ever anxious to
discover the camp, if such was indeed to be found. I had
already gone through a great deal of anxiety, but nothing to
equal what I suffered at present. It seemed so sad to think
that Leo might die when succour was so near at hand. Eager,
however, as I was to proceed, Leo's condition prevented me
from allowing the ox to go out of a steady walk. Still,
even thus, without any jolting, he got quickly over the ground.
On and on we went, looking about in every direction for the
light of a fire which might indicate the situation of the wished-
for camp. I say wished-for, for I was not certain that our

friends were actually in the neighbourhood. Perhaps the
horsemen I had seen had come from a considerable distance,
and were in light hunting order, with merely saddle-bags to
hold their provisions and ammunition. If so, they could
render us, even if we should fall in with them, but little as-
sistance. These thoughts passed through my mind as we
proceeded, while I formed a variety of plans, to be carried out
according to any emergency which might arise. As the moon
was bright, I had no fear of an attack from wild beasts.
We had gone on for about three hours, when Mango stopped.
" See, massa, see!" he exclaimed. I looked ahead, and ob-
served a ruddy glow in the sky. The ox at the same time
poked out his head, as if he also saw something that interested
liim. Presently the light increased, and I could distinctly
make out fires burning in the distance. "If those are camp-
fires, they must have been lighted by a somewhat large party,'
I observed. The further we advanced, the more distinct did
the fires become. We proceeded eagerly. At length, to my
surprise, the ox seemed unwilling to move on. In spite of
Mango's coaxing voice, it proceeded more and more slowly.
At length I could distinguish not only the fires, but objects
moving about; a waggon and numerous oxen tethered near, and
horses and men, gradually came in sight. Then the barking of
dogs reached our ears. This made me still more surprised at
the unwillingness of the ox to proceed. Then I distinguished
some water, on which the light of the fire was reflected. Be-
tween us and it, however, several dark objects appeared. In
vain Mango now tried to urge on the ox. He stopped alto-
gether. "Ah, massa, look dere!" he exclaimed in a terrified
tone. He had cause for alarm. The fires just then blazing
up more completely, exhibited the dark outlines of several
lions and other creatures, which I took to be hyenas, standing
on our side of the stream, watching the camp, while the dogs

we had heard ran backwards and forwards, barking at them
from the opposite side. My fear now was that the savage
brutes might turn and attack us. Even if they did not do so,
it might take us some time to find a ford and get round to the
camp, unless we could make the travellers hear us and come
to our assistance. Mango and I shouted again and again with
all our might. Though our friends might not have heard
our voices, the wild beasts did, for suddenly turning round, the
whole pack, with angry roars, came bounding towards us,

DOINGS AT THE CAMP.
Y ST was a nervous thing to stand in front of a dozen or
& more lions and hyenas bounding over the plain.
G TR I thought the ox would have bolted, in spite of
13 Mango's efforts to hold him. To fly would have
8 been more dangerous than standing still, so we re-
mained firm, and shouted our utmost. The moon, which
had before been behind a cloud, came out brightly, when
the savage creatures, awed, if not terrified, by our cries,
separated as they approached us, and bounded off on either
hand into the wilds. The ox, recovering from his alarm, no
longer refused to move on.
Reaching the banks of the stream, we again cried out, hop-
ing to attract the attention of the travellers.
"Who are you? What is it you want ?" shouted a voice
from the other side.
"Andrew Crawford and Leonard Hyslop with the black
Mango. We want to cross the river and join you," I shouted
in return.
"Welcome! welcome! Move to the right! There is an
easy passage. We will go that way and show you. Captain
Hyslop and several of his party are here."
The last words which reached my ears were the first certain

THE CAMP.
467
intimation I had that my cousin Stanley was in the camp near
us. I earnestly hoped that his sisters and David were there
also. As we rode along we heard a number of voices, and saw
men with torches moving rapidly along the side of the stream.
Presently we came to a somewhat wider part, where the banks
were very low, and where I should have expected to find a
ford. At the same time several people were seen with torches
crossing it. We went on to meet them, Mango leading the
ox, which advanced without hesitation. We were already in
the water when I heard Stanley's voice.
" Andrew, my dear fellow, is it you ? and have you really
brought poor Leo ?" he exclaimed. We had given you all up
for lost !"
"I have brought him," I said ; " but where is David ?"
"He is in the camp; but having turned in, I suppose was
not dressed in time to join us," he replied.
We had not time to exchange many words while crossing
the stream ; but as soon as we had got safe on dry ground I
gave him a brief account of our adventures, and expressed
my anxiety to have Leo placed under David's care without
delay. .
"And Kate and Bella !" I asked. "Are they with you, and
well?"
"Yes, I am thankful to say so," he answered," though they
have had to go through much hardship, no little danger, and
great fatigue; indeed, I do not know what would have oc-
curred had not our friend Silva, and a party he had collected,
arrived sooner than we expected. He had fallen in with a
trader making an exploring expedition further north than any
of his calling have hitherto reached, and, offering him a hand-
some remuneration, induced him to come on with his waggon
and several good horses, in the hope of meeting us. The
trader-Donald Fraser by name, a Scotchman-having got

into this unknown region, would not consent to proceed
further, and was on the point of turning south again, when
Silva induced him to remain another week, while Chickango
went on to try and get tidings of us. We had, meantime,
started south, and happily fell in with him, when reduced to
extremities, about two days' journey from the camp. I am
not surprised at our friend Donald's unwillingness to proceed,
for he had fallen in with some rough customers, who were
more likely to rob him of his goods than pay for them. How-
ever, by the exertion of the diplomatic talents of our friend
Silva, they got free, and now, I am thankful to say, we are all
well, and ready to march southward. Kate and Bella have
been dreadfully cut up about Leo's loss, and yours, too,
Andrew. But what has become of Natty? I hope the poor
boy is not dead ?"
I satisfied Stanley on that point.
"We must go back, then, for him at once," he remarked.
"Though the Kabomba people may treat him well, we must
not desert the poor lad."
By this time we had reached the camp. Although the rest
of the party had been asleep, they had been aroused, and now
appeared out of their respective huts to receive us. Kate and
Bella greeted me kindly, but were too much occupied with
poor Leo to exchange more than a few words. He was at once
carried into their hut, where David went to attend to him.
Senhor Silva, Jack, Timbo, and the other blacks, greeted me
warmly.
"So glad, Massa Andrew, you come back; so glad," ex-
claimed Timbo. "Me pray always for you. Neber t'ought
you lost. Knew you come back some day, dough me not
den know de way."
Though I felt somewhat fatigued, my friends insisted on
getting a substantial supper ready; and the relief . I felt from

MR. DONALD FRASER.
469
the idea that my cares had now come to an end, contributed
to give me a good appetite. I was introduced to Mr. Donald
Fraser, a tall, gaunt, red-haired Scotchman.
"I am very glad to welcome you, Mr. Andrew Crawford,"
he said, putting out his horny-palmed hand. "You come from
the North, I know, by your name, and you are none the less
welcome so far from the old country, out in these southern and
heathenish lands. Your stout arm and rifle will be a pleasant
addition, too, to our party; for they are rough fellows we are
travelling amongst, and I shouldn't be surprised if we had to
fight our way out from their midst."
"My father came from Scotland, and though I have never
been in it, I love the country for his sake," I answered.
"Though I hope we shall have no fighting, I am ready to
take my part if we have to defend ourselves."
" No doubt you would, Mr. Crawford," he said. "We are
men of peace, and should never wish to fight, unless in cases of
urgent necessity. I hope, now you are come, we shall begin
our journey southward forthwith."
"I am afraid not, Mr. Fraser," said Stanley. "My brother,
who has just arrived, will scarcely yet be able to move, and
we have a young friend, I find, lying ill at a village some days'
journey to the north of us; and until we get him we cannot
leave this spot."
This information did not seem very palatable to our friend
Donald ; but after taking a glass of real Glenlivet, a flask of
which stood in our midst, his countenance relaxed.
"Ay, to be sure. I had once a young brother of my own, a
delicate boy. I had few else to love in the world. He is
gone ; but I know how you feel about this little fellow; we
must not risk his life. And the other lad, the son of poor
Captain Page-I knew him—made a voyage aboard his ship
- and should like to do the boy a good turn for his sake. I

A RIDE ON HORSEBACK.
don't greatly esteem the gratitude of this world, and yet it's
pleasant to have the opportunity of repaying a debt for kind-
ness received."
I was glad to hear these remarks, and trusting that Natty
would find a friend in Mr. Fraser, I lay down to enjoy a
sounder rest than I had for very long obtained.
Leo was much better in the morning, and David told me
that though he was seriously ill, yet he trusted that he would
shortly regain sufficient strength to travel. I begged of Stanley
that he would allow me to accompany him to convey Natty to
the camp. To this he willingly agreed, and it was arranged
that Timbo was to take a third horse and act as interpreter,
and that we were to travel during the bright moonlight hours
of night.
I was anxious to set off immediately; but the horses were
so tired with their hunting expedition of the previous day,
that Stanley considered it was necessary to give them a
couple of days' rest before they would be fit to start.
"When did you ride last, Mr. Crawford ?" inquired Donald
Fraser of me the following morning. "Because it strikes me
that, unless you are a good horseman, you'll be little fit to take
the journey the captain proposes, at the rate he goes over the
ground."
I confessed that some years had passed since I had mounted
a horse, though in my father's prosperous days I had owned
one, and was then a fair rider.
"Well, then, we'll just take a canter across the plain this
afternoon. It will not tire the horses, and it will help to get
your muscles into play for the exertion you'll have to make by-
and-by," he said.
I was very glad to accept his offer. After dinner, with our
rifles at our backs—to be ready for any lion, panther, elephant,
or rhinoceros which might cross our path-we set out for an

AN UNEXPECTED CHASE.
471
hour's ride towards the south, Stanley cautioning us not to go
far and fatigue the horses.
"Never fear, captain," answered Mr. Fraser. "We'll just
go far enough to stretch our steeds' legs, and see how our
young friend here sticks to his saddle."
As we rode along my companion gave me many valuablo
hints with regard to the journey I was about to undertake.
"Keep your horse well in hand," he observed, "your eyes
about you, and your ears open; never press him unnecessarily;
and then, should you meet a lion or be attacked by savages,
you will be ready for action, and do what in my opinion is the
wisest thing under such circumstances-get out of their way."
We had not gone far when an exclamation of pleasure burst
from Donald, and I saw to the southward a vast herd of spring-
boks crossing from east to west. Numerous as were the wild
animals we had met with, I had never seen so many of one
species together. They formed an immense herd extending
for a full mile across our path, and, as far as we could judge,
of the same width. On they went, bounding and leaping.
"On! on!" cried my companion, forgetting all about our
tired steeds ; and putting spurs to the flanks of his, away he
galloped, calling on me to keep up with him. The wary animals
saw us coming, and, apprehending danger, immediately began
to scour over the plain, turning, however, to the south-west.
This placed us directly behind them. They would lead us a
long chase, of that there was no doubt; but Donald was too
eager to think of letting them escape. Mile after mile was
passed over. We were approaching the herd. They now,
however, began to scatter to the right and left, though still
keeping in considerable bodies. We followed the centre one.
At length we found ourselves in a rocky country, which com-
pelled us to turn aside. Twice Donald fired, and each time
brought down an animal. I also killed one; but could with

A DANGEROUS LEAP PREVENTED.
difficulty rein in my horse while I reloaded my rifle. Away
the springboks went, leaping over the rocks with wonderful
agility. We had been gradually ascending, when Donald dis-
appeared among the rocks and trees to the right, and shortly
afterwards I found myself going down the somewhat steep side
of a hill, with a number of springbuks directly ahead of me.
I again fired, but missed, when I stopped to reload; and just
then looking up, I saw a high precipice, towards which several
of the springboks were making. Rushing on, regardless of the
height of the cliff, they leaped over it. I thought they must
have broken their legs; but they alighted unhurt. Just then
I saw Donald coming on at full speed, directly after another
herd. They, too, made for the precipice. I shouted out to
him, fearing that he might not see it, and that he and his
horse would fall over and be killed. I shouted and waved
again and again. Just before he reached the edge he saw me,
and though he could not have heard what I said, he guessed
there was danger, and reined in his steed; not, however, till
they were both on the point of rushing over. Scrambling up
the hill, I rejoined him. He had killed four antelopes—a wel-
come supply for our camp. We might have slaughtered many
more, but those we had got we could not carry home. Cut-
ting up four animals, we loaded our horses with the meat, and
then drew the remaining two into a hollow of a rock, and filled
up the entrance with stones and sand, hoping to send for them
in the evening.
The springboks are so called from their wonderful agility.
They are found in all parts of Southern Africa, and are more
numerous than any other variety of the antelope. In form
they are very graceful— not unlike the lovely gazelle of the
north of Africa.
We had a somewhat fatiguing trudge towards the camp,
though we had less to complain of than our steeds. The sup-

473
ply of venison was very welcome, though I was afraid, in con-
sequence of our long chase, the intended journey might be
delayed another day. Donald complimented me on my
horsemanship; indeed, I had not been five minutes in the
saddle before I found myself perfectly at home. I was some-
what stiff, I must confess; but the horses were not much the
worse for their unexpected gallop. We therefore prepared to
set off the following afternoon.
No time was lost in sending for the rest of the venison,
which the hyenas would soon have found out had it been
allowed to remain during the night. Late in the evening
Chickango and one of the Hottentots, who had been sent to
bring it in, returned. As they were approaching the camp,
one of the oxen, which had been allowed to feed for a moment,
was seen suddenly to stop, and begin to roar with pain, its
countenance exhibiting the utmost helplessness. I, with
others, ran forward to see what was the matter, supposing that
it must have been bitten by some venomous insect or snake.
Donald soon followed, when, telling the men to hold the poor
ox's mouth, he took out of it a curious woody-looking sub-
stance, covered with sharp thorns.
" The poor creature has got this seed-vessel of the grapple
plant into his mouth," he said, exhibiting it. "I suspect
that any of you who had taken the same between your jaws
would have roared too, if not so loudly."
He told us that if an animal lies down upon these seed-
vessels, they stick to his skin, so that he cannot possibly get
rid of them. David, who examined it, said it came from the
plant Uncaria procumbens, or grapple plant.
I had gone out the next morning soon after sunrise to look
round the camp, when I saw several birds of a grayish colour,
about the size of a common thrush. Their notes, too, reminded
me, as they sang their morning song, of the mistletoe thrush.

RHINOCEROS-BIRDS.
Presently they flew off together, some way up the stream.
Turning round, I saw Chickango, Igubo, and several of Mr.
Fraser's blacks following, with guns in their hands, accom-
panied by a pack of dogs. I pointed out the birds to them.
" 'Noceros not far off," observed Chickango. Presently we
saw the birds pitch behind a neighbouring bush, and getting
on one side of it, what was my surprise to find that they were
standing on the back of a huge rhinoceros, sticking their bills
into his head, and even into his ears, and uttering a loud harsh
grating cry. The rhinoceros, we could see even at that dis-
tance, was a huge white monster, with a couple of horns, a
short one placed on the head behind the front, and pointed-
a formidable looking weapon. The object, probably, of these
rhinoceros-birds, as they may be called, in thus pitching on
his body, was to feed upon the ticks, and other parasitic
insects, which swarm upon those animals. They also attend
upon the hippopotamus, and, whether intentionally or not I
cannot say, often thus give him warning of danger. Presently
up rose the rhinoceros and looked about him. I, unfor-
tunately, not intending to go far from the camp, had left my
rifle behind. The dogs at that instant started off, rushing
with loud barks towards the monster. They had better hare
kept at a distance, for, lowering his head, he caught the first
which leaped towards him on his horn, and threw him back
dead among the reeds. Then turning round, he charged
directly towards us. The unarmed blacks immediately took
to the water. Unable to escape by flight, I thought that
my last moments had come; but, providentially, the dogs
attracting his attention, diverted it from me. Chickango,
rifle in hand, boldly ran up to face the monster, who at
that instant seemed to catch sight of the waggon and cattle
in the distance. He probably thought it an enemy worthy
of his courage, for, to my great horror and dismay, in spite

CHARGING THE WAGGON.

of our shouts and the barking of the dogs, he rushed off
towards it. I could only hope that our friends saw him com-
ing, though when I left the camp they were still asleep. I
thought he would have struck Chickango, who was directly in
his course; but the active black sprang out of his way, and
then turning round, fired at his head. Though I was sure the
bullet had struck, yet it did not stop his course. On he
dashed towards the waggon. I shouted and shouted to
Stanley, hoping that he might possibly hear my voice. In
vain. The brute went on, and seemed to be almost in the
midst of the camp. Aiming directly at the waggon, he struck
it, and, heavy as it was, so great was the impetus of his huge
body that he sent it on several feet. Fortunately he came
against it in the rear, otherwise it must inevitably have been
upset. Just then another shot was fired, and, greatly to my
relief, over rolled the huge creature. Never have I heard such
shouting, barking, and yelping of dogs, as immediately arose.
When I got to the camp I found our friends, as may be
supposed, in a state of 'no small alarm; but that quickly sub-
sided, and the blacks especially gave way to their delight at
the prospect of so bountiful a supply of meat as the creature's
carcass would afford them. We calculated that it was fully
equal to three good-sized oxen. It was an enormous crea-
ture. David likened it to an immense gray hog shorn of
its bristles. With the exception of a tuft at the extremity
of the ears and tail, it had no hair on its body. Its eyes
were absurdly small; indeed, at a little distance one could
scarcely see them. We agreed that, what with its giant
body, misshapen head, ungainly legs and feet, and absurdly
small eyes, it was, according to our notions, the very image
of ugliness. Next to the elephant, the white rhinoceros is the
largest animal in exir ence, and scarcely inferior to it in
strength, as this one had proved by the way in which it

.
pushed on the huge waggon. Notwithstanding its ungainly
appearance, it had shown us how active it could be, by the way
it had turned about when assailed by the dogs, and the rapid
charge it made towards the camp ; indeed, I believe even a
fast horse, with a rider on his back, could only keep pace with
it. Senhor Silva told us it cannot go long without water,
and it is, therefore, always found in the neighbourhood of some
pond or fountain, which it seeks at least once during the day,
both to quench its thirst and to wallow in the mud, in which
amusement it delights. Probably it is thus able to get rid of
the insects which cling to its hide. We measured the animal,
and found that it was nearly sixteen feet in length, from the
snout to the end of the tail, and twelve feet in circumference.
It is said to attain the age of one hundred years ; indeed,
judging from its horns, the old fellow. we killed must have
been nearly as old. The body was long and thick; the
belly hanging nearly to the ground, and of great size. Its
legs were short, round, and very strong; and its hoofs were
divided into three parts, each pointing forward. The head
was especially large, the ears long and erect, and its small
eyes deeply sunk. The horns of the rhinoceros are composed
of a mass of fine longitudinal threads, forming a hard solid
substance, not secured to the skull, but merely attached to the
skin. They rest, however, on a bony protuberance near the
nostrils. The white rhinoceros, of which I have been speak-
ing, has an extraordinary prolongation of the head, which we
found to be nearly one-third of the length of the whole body.
Its nose was square, and the after horn of considerable length.
The horn of the black rhinoceros is much shorter, and the
animal itself is smaller than the white species. There are,
however, four species of rhinoceros – two black, or of a dark
colour; and two of a whitish hue. The black is supposed to
be of a wilder and more morose disposition than the white. It

has a peculiar upper lip, which is capable of extension, and is
extremely pliable, so that it can move it from side to side, and
twist it round a stick. It in this way collects its food, and
carries it to its mouth, making use of it somewhat as an
elephant does his trunk. The black species are very fierce,
and probably, next to the buffalo, are the most dangerous
beasts in Southern Africa to encounter; for the lion gives
notice of his approach by his roar, and can easily be driven off,
while even the elephant is less pertinacious in assailing an
enemy.
Senhor Silva said he had heard of rhinoceroses with three
horns, but he had never seen them, and rather doubted their
existence. One species known as the cobaba has a front horn
frequently upwards of four feet in length, pointing slightly
forward from the snout, at an angle of 45°. It can easily be
conceived how fearful is a charge from an animal with such a
weapon, active and determined as it is. Although the rhino-
ceros sees but badly, it has a peculiarly acute sense of hearing
and smell. It winds an enemy at a great distance; but the
hunter may approach to leeward of it within a few paces, if he
walks with care, without being discovered, though at the same
. time any noise will instantly arouse it. Ugly as the rhino-
ceros is, the female is a very affectionate mother, and guards
her young with the tenderest care. The calf also clings to
its dam; and Senhor Silva told us that he had seen a calf
watching by the side of the carcass two days after the mother
had been killed. Until aroused, the rhinoceros looks the most
stupid and inoffensive of animals ; but woe betide the unwary
traveller who offends him! If on horseback, he will have
to scamper for his life; if on foot, his only chance of safety is
to climb a tree, or hide on the opposite side of the thick trunk
of one. A lion will never attack a rhinoceros, and slinks out
of his way if he meets one. Even the elephant avoids an

FIERCENESS OF RHINOCEROS.
encounter, if he can, with so formidable an opponent, who,
careless of the blows of his trunk or the thrusts of his tusks,
will charge him with his sharp horn, and pierce him to the
heart.
Senhor Silva told us that he once saw a battle between a
large male elephant and a rhinoceros, when, after an encounter
of some minutes, the elephant, who had at first shown great
courage and activity, turned tail and fled, the blood flow.
ing from the wounds he had received. He once also saw a
battle between four enormous rhinoceroses. Again and again
they charged each other, uttering the most horrible grunts,
and digging their horns into each other's sides. So fiercely
engaged were the monsters, that they did not observe the
approach of his hunters, who succeeded in killing two of them,
while the others escaped. Those killed were utterly unfit for
food, their flesh being quite rotten from the wounds they had
received on previous occasions.
The black rhinoceros feeds on a species of thorn known in
Cape Colony as wait-a-bit, which gives it a somewhat acrid and
bitter flavour. The white species, however, feeds chiefly on
grass. The flesh has in consequence a pleasant taste, and is
usually very fat. . A high polish can be given to the horns of
the rhinoceros, and they are valuable articles of commerce.
They fetch, indeed, half as much as common elephant ivory.
They are formed into drinking-cups, handles for swords, ram-
rods for rifles, and are used for many other purposes.
"When you speak of drinking-cups," said David to our Por-
tuguese friend, who had given us this account, "I have heard
that they are believed to possess the virtue of detecting poison.
It is said that if wine is poured into them it forthwith rises
and bubbles up as if it were boiling; and if poison is mixed
with it, immediately the cup splits. It is said, also, that if
poison by itself is poured into one of these cups, that the cup

will instantly fly to pieces. I confess, however, that I am in-
clined to doubt that such is the case."
"I also have no belief in the account," remarked Senhor
Silva.
The ordinary way of killing the rhinoceros is to stalk him
either when feeding or asleep. By approaching to leeward,
a good shot will kill him before he moves. Some hunters
prefer hiding themselves in huts or pits, as he comes to
drink in the stream at the morning or evening. Sometimes,
however, the animals are taken in pitfalls, such as are used to
capture elephants or other large game. Englishmen (for I
have not heard of any one else who has done so) occasionally
hunt the rhinoceros on horseback. Though their horses have
been able to keep up with the chase, the infuriated beasts
have been known to charge the hunter. In two instances I
heard of, the horses were completely run through by the crea-
ture's horns; and in two others, the unfortunate huntsmen
themselves were killed, being fearfully gored by the savage
brutes.
I was very anxious to set off to bring back Natty; and in the
afternoon Stanley pronounced the horses fit to proceed. Mr.
Donald Fraser proposed accompanying us; but when Stanley
&promised to try and induce some of the blacks to come south and
trade with him, he abandoned his intentions, hoping to do a
stroke of business in the meantime with any natives who might
come to the camp. Timbo therefore took the third horse, and
I mounted the one he would have ridden. They were all
three fine strong animals, fleet and active; and we hoped on
their backs to bid defiance to any human beings or wild beasts
we might encounter. Stanley did not fail to urge on those
who remained behind the importance of keeping bright fires
burning round the camp at night, and being ever on the watch,
lest the wild beasts we had encountered might be tempted

to swim across the stream and attack either them or the
oxen.
"Do you, my dear brother, be careful of yourself," said
Kate, as she wished us good-bye. "You seem to forget that
though you have attacked so many of them successfully, some
day they may turn round and treat you in the same way."

CHAPTER XXIV.
EXPEDITION TO RECOVER NATTY.
M O HOUGH, after the wild life I had been so long living,
I would gladly have remained behind in the society
of my young cousins, I was so anxious to learn how
Natty was going on that I felt very glad when I
found myself in the saddle, with saddle-bags well
stored with rhinoceros' meat and other eatables, and my rifle
by my side. We had tethers for our horses, hooks for cutting
grass for them, and axes for supplying ourselves with firewood
to keep up blazing fires at night.
As we rode along, Stanley gave me fuller details of the
attack which had been made on our village, and which had
resulted in the party being compelled to quit it and seek
safety at Kabomba. Soon after we had left our home on our
unfortunate expedition, Timbo had set off to Kabomba, in the
hope, as he said, of telling the natives about the Bible, showing
them how much superior is the white man's religion to their
foolish idolatry. They had listened more readily than he had
expected ; and his great wish now was to return there at some
future day with missionaries, who might teach them to read about
the matter themselves. He had just got back, when one morn-
ing Jack Handspike, who was on guard, observed a body of
blacks approaching. At first he thought that they were the

HOW THE FORT WAS BURNED.
villagers for whose benefit Stanley had killed the man-eating
lions. They, however, very soon exhibited their hostile inten-
tions, by letting fly a shower of arrows into the enclosure.
Happily no one was hit. Jack instantly roused the inmates,
and fired his rifle at their assailants, while Stanley and the
rest seized their arms and rushed out to defend the fortress.
Their assailants were, however, too well acquainted with its
construction, and were now seen rushing on, each man with a
torch in his hand. These they threw among the prickly-pear
hedge, which, dried by the hot sun, was as combustible as
tinder. In an instant the whole was in a blaze. Stanley had
collected his party, each one being loaded with as much property
as could be carried. Then, sallying forth, they fired a volley,
which drove the blacks to a distance. They were thus able
to secure several of their animals, and to save a few more of
their effects. They now retreated to some rising ground,
where they witnessed the utter destruction of our habitation.
The blacks had probably not expected so brave a defence.
They once more came on; but a volley killed three of their
number, and the rest, disappointed of their expected plunder,
took to flight. Timbo on this urged Stanley to set out with-
out delay for Kabomba. They were happily able to reach it,
though my young cousins had undergone great fatigue on the
journey. After a stay of a week at Kabomba, they had re-
ceived information that a party of white travellers had appeared
at some distance to the south. Scarcely expecting that Senhor
Silva could have returned so soon, they set off in the hope of
falling in with the strangers, accompanied by an escort of the
Kabomba people, who were anxious to show their gratitude
by guarding them on their way. They had fallen in, as I
have mentioned, with Chickango, and arrived safely at Donald
Fraser's camp. Timbo supposed that the attack had been
made by a tribe from the border of the lake, who had heard

FAN-PALMS AND THEIR FRUIT.
· 485
of the wealth possessed by the white men. It occurred to me
that they had possibly come from the very village which our
friends had advised us to avoid ; and such I found was the
case. Had we fallen into their hands, our fate would have
been sealed.
Soon after leaving the camp, we saw before us a grove of
tall palm-trees. At first they appeared to form a part of an
extensive wood. As we drew nearer, we discovered that the
trees grew at considerable distances from each other. They
were tall and extremely graceful, each branch having the ap-
pearance of a beautiful fan; and as the wind waved them to
and fro, the effect was peculiarly pleasing. They are known
as " fan-palms"—the most beautiful, perhaps, of their tribe.
We found fruit growing on them about the size of an apple, of
a deep brown colour. Timbo begged us to stop, and he would
try and get some. He accordingly climbed up one of the
trees, helping himself with a band round his waist, and soon
came down with a number of the fruit. They contained
kernels as hard as a stone, which put us in mind of vegetable
ivory. We found the fruit very palatable and refreshing.
. Most of the trees, however, were so tall, that it was evident
the fruit could not be obtained without difficulty. I should
have said we took a couple of dogs with us which had attached
themselves to Stanley. They might prove useful at night in
giving us warning of the approach of any wild beast; and we
were therefore glad of their company. The country was
tolerably open, but in some parts we had to pass through dense
forests. In most of these, however, we could generally find an
elephant path from one side to the other, always broad enough
to allow two horsemen to ride abreast. Frequently Stanley
rode ahead; while I rode alongside Timbo, who was more com-
municative than my cousin. He, I have already said, was a
man rather of action than words; and would, for an hour to-

gether, ride without speaking, unless something attracted his
attention. He had gone some way ahead, with the two dogs
at his side; we following at a little distance, though, of course,
always keeping him in sight. Timbo was recounting, with
considerable animation, some of the adventures of his youth,
when suddenly his narrative was interrupted by a loud trum-
peting sound, and we saw Stanley wheel round and gallop
towards us. At the same moment, a huge elephant, the largest
monster I ever saw, with trunk projected, vast ears spread out,
and tail erect, burst from the thicket, and in hot haste pursued
my cousin.
"Fly! fly!" shouted Stanley ; "gallop off for your lives !"
We required no second order to obey him. Stanley was look-
ing round at the monster; but, situated as he was in a pathway
between thick trees, among which he could not force a passage,
he was unable to fire. Flight was our only resource. We were
already deep in the forest, and I had remarked no other way
except the one by which we had come. Had we stopped and
attempted to fire, we might too likely have shot Stanley, who
was directly between us and the elephant. Had we missed
Stanley would certainly have been trampled upon ; and so
probably should we, as by the delay we should have impedeil
his progress, and prevented him from escaping. Very unwill-
ingly, therefore, we turned our horses' heads and galloped on,
hoping to keep ahead of him. His horse was, fortunately, the
fleetest and strongest animal of the three. It seemed also to
know its danger, and flew along over the ground at a rapid
rate; but still the cumbrous monster came as fast, trumpeting
and shrieking with rage. His huge feet almost touched the
horse's hinder hoofs, so it seemed; while his trunk, in the
glance I had got of him, appeared to be about to descend
upon Stanley's head. So dangerous was the position in
which he was placed, that I scarcely dared hope he would

escape. "On! on!" he shouted. "On! on!" we shrieked
in return, trying to urge forward our steeds at a little faster
rate. The dogs, aware of their danger, scam pered off,
with tongues hanging out, watching for an opening in the
thicket through which they might bolt. We had passed
over several fallen trees and other impediments in the path ;
and I dreaded lest, coming against such, our horses might
stumble. Now a trunk appeared before us. Our horses
leaped boldly over it. I hoped that Stanley's would follow,
and that it might offer some impediment to the elephant.
Glancing for a moment anxiously round over my shoulder, I
saw that the monster had also got over it without stopping.
Could we once gain the open country, I knew that we should
have a better prospect of escaping; because by separating the
elephant would hesitate which to pursue, and while he fol-
lowed one of us, the others would be able to fire at him. Still
we had a considerable distance to go, for I calculated that we
had penetrated a mile or more into the forest. It was indeed
a gallop for life, and the elephant seemed determined to wreak
his fury on us. What had offended him so much it was diffi-
cult to say—perhaps the sight of a horse, strange probably to
him.
I think I have mentioned that when a troop of elephants are
passing leisurely onwards, feeding as they go, their footfall is
unheard; but when angry, the case is very different. The
monster seemed to make the very ground quake beneath his
feet, as he came trumpeting on behind us, adding not a
little, I suspect, to the terror of our horses, which, with manes
and tails streaming out, like some demon-pursued steeds of
German legend, dashed through the wood. There was no need
of whip or spur to urge them on. How thankful I felt when
at length, under the tall arched trees, I caught sight of the
open plain! Still our steeds dashed on. I turned my head to

A PROVIDENTIAL ESCAPE.
learn how it fared with Stanley. He was sitting his horse as
composedly as ever, though the elephant was close behind him.
" Andrew, turn to the right !—Timbo, keep ahead!" he
shouted. We obeyed, and the elephant dashed out of the
cover. The huge animal was coming on at even greater speed
than at first, in no way out of breath with its long and tre-
mendous charge. Stanley wheeled his horse to the left, while
the elephant dashed forward, and seeing Timbo, pursued him.
This was exactly what Stanley wanted. Again wheeling his
horse, he followed, keeping on the quarter of the animal. I saw
he was getting his rifle ready to fire. I imitated his example.
The dogs, too, breaking from the cover, came in pursuit, and as-
sisted us. With difficulty could Stanley curb in his horse. The
elephant, hearing noises behind him, stopped. The instant he
did so, Stanley's rifle was at his shoulder. There was a report,
and the animal, a moment before so terror-inspiring by its
bulk and powers of destruction, sank upon the grass. Its trunk
fell, its mighty limbs stretched out, and before one of the yelp-
ing dogs could reach it, life was extinct.
Our escape had indeed been providential. It was some
minutes before Timbo could rein in his horse, and we had to
shout and shout to him to return. At length, however, he
arrived, and was as delighted as we were to see our enemy
overcome.
Timbo proposed that we should return to the camp and get
our friends to come and carry off the tusks and flesh; but as I
was anxious to get assistance for Natty as soon as possible, I
begged Stanley to proceed, hoping that we might find the
tusks on our way back.
"Dat bery unlikely," said Timbo; " but we cut dem out and
hide dem, and den if black fellows come to take de meat, dey no
find de tusks."
We accordingly set to work to cut out the tusks, which

A PLEASANT ADDITION.
491
Timbo then hid in the wood and covered them up with
branches. I asked Stanley whether we should proceed by the
pathway, or take the route outside the forest.
"There is but little fear of our encountering another fellow
like the one we have killed," he answered. "He was evidently
a solitary beast, by his savage disposition; and the chances are
we shall get through without further interruption. If not,
we can but have another gallop for it, Andrew.. I rather
enjoyed mine; though, to be sure, it was a neck or nothing
affair."
This was the chief difficulty we met on our journey. We
formed our camp at night, as we had proposed. With the aid
of the dogs and the watch-fires, we were uninterrupted, although
the roars of lions were heard in the distance, and we had visits
from jackals and hyena-dogs, who came prowling round, at-
tracted by the scent of our roasting meat; Stanley's unerring
rifle supplying us amply with game. We had a pleasant addi-
tion one day in a large bustard which he shot. Though very
abundant, the bird is shy, so that a good sportsman alone can
hope to kill it. It weighed about fifteen pounds. The flesh
was very tender and palatable, and we agreed that it was the
best flavoured of the game birds we had met with. After
each day's journey, Timbo generally went in search of small
game or birds' eggs, of which he brought us a plentiful supply;
so that we lived in abundance.
At length we recognized the reed-covered habitations of our
Kabomba friends, the whole population apparently turning out
to welcome us. The chief men, and those who had accom-
panied Stanley to the camp, hurried forward to grasp his hands,
while the rest stood at a distance, gazing at the strange animals
which our horses appeared to them ; indeed, those only who
had been to the camp had ever seen a horse before. Our first
inquiries were, of course, for Natty.

" Chief say better, but not like walk much.". answered
Timbo.
"Beg them to let me see him at once," I said, riding on.

THE BUSTARD.
It was difficult, however, to get through the dense mass who
came to shake our hands and embrace Timbo-a ceremony to
which they knew we objected. At length we reached the
chief's house, at the entrance of which Natty was standing.
Poor fellow ! he still looked very pale and thin, and I was
afraid from his appearance that his days were numbered.
"I shall get better now you have come for me," he said,
looking up in my face. "I have been so longing for your
return, and began to dread that some accident had happened.
Do not be anxious about me, Andrew. I know—I am sure I
shall get better."

A LITTER FOR NATTY.
493
I trusted so. "The food on which he has been living pro-
bably has not suited him," I thought; "and when he is placed
under David's care, he may begin to improve." This hope
prevented my spirits sinking, as they would otherwise have
done. We told the Kabomba people that we were anxious
to return immediately to our friends; and as I saw that it
would be dangerous for Natty to ride behind one of us, as we
had proposed, I begged the chief to allow some of his young
men to carry him. To this he agreed; and forthwith I set to
work, aided by Timbo, to form a litter. There were plenty of
bamboos in the neighbourhood, and with these we constructed a
light and very convenient conveyance, with a roof, back, and
sides. The greater part was formed of bamboo, and matting
served as a cover to keep off the sun's rays in the day-time, and
the damp at night. We then had to train some bearers ; for
the people were unaccustomed to bear loads in the way a litter
must be carried. Timbo employed his time, when not assist-
ing me, in addressing his countrymen. When I asked him if
he had succeeded in impressing on their minds any gospel
truths—"Yes," he said; "I sow leetle seed, but it grow up
and bear fruit some of dese days. No fear; dat seed I sow
nebber rot."
Among the inhabitants of the village I recognized my three
faithless attendants. The chief expressed himself very much
ashamed at their having deserted me. They excused them-
selves by saying that they thought I had been made prisoner,
and that they had run away to avoid sharing my fate. I re-
plied that I was very glad they had got home safely, and that
I harboured no ill-will towards them.
"I tell dem dat Christians ought to do good to deir enemies,
so dey understand why you no beg de chief to kill dem," ob-

OUR RETURN JOURNEY.
style of travelling was very different from what it had been
during my former adventures. We had bearers for Natty,
and also a party of armed men with shields and spears as a
body-guard, and others carrying provisions, while we ourselves
were mounted on strong steeds. For most of the time I rode
near Natty, anxious to keep up his spirits. Now and then
Timbo took my place. Stanley generally rode ahead; as,
however, we had to proceed slowly, he frequently started off
with the dogs to get some sport. He was, as usual, successful,
and kept our pots well supplied. I told him he must look
out, and not be caught by another rogue elephant.
"No fear of that," he answered. "I keep my eye about
me; and, in truth, I should rather enjoy being again chased. It
is but fair, considering how fond I am of hunting animals,
that I should occasionally be hunted in return."
We had accomplished four days of our journey, when, early
in the morning, Stanley was riding some distance ahead, and
Timbo and I were keeping at the side of Natty's litter. Natty
was, I hoped, decidedly better. He was able to walk about
every evening in the cool, and would sit at the camp-fire and
join in conversation as well as any of us. We were passing
along the edge of a wood, of which there were several scattered
about in sight, though the country was generally open. A
shorter way might have been found, perhaps, through the
wood; but our black friends declined entering it, declaring
that many lions lurked there, and urging us to be on the
watch for them.
"I only wish some of them would come out," observed
Stanley. "I should like to carry home the hide of one, for I
have lost all those I have killed."
Stanley, as I have said, was a little in advance, keeping
close to the wood, looking apparently into it in search of game,
for he was as good a shot on horseback as on foot. Presently

A PERILOUS MOMENT.
495
I saw his horse swerve on one side. With whip and spur he
brought the animal again up to the wood. Just then there was
a fearful roar. The horse again started on one side, the sudden-
ness of his movement almost unseating his rider, whose cap was
knocked off. The next moment a huge lion, breaking cover,
sprang out of the wood with a tremendous bound, and alighted
on the back of the horse, grasping Stanley with one of his
tremendous claws. Stanley, leaning over his horse's neck to
avoid him, in vain attempted with his rifle to beat off the
savage brute. To gallop to his rescue was the impulse of the
moment. In another instant my cousin might be killed; for
had he once been dragged from his horse, nothing could have
prevented the lion seizing him between his powerful jaws,
wide open at that moment to grasp him. The risk Stanley
had run in the adventure with the elephant seemed as nothing
compared to the awful danger in which he was now placed.
Our horses, though not unaccustomed to carry their riders in
chase of lions, trembled in every limb. The frightened blacks
were about to fly, leaving Natty on the ground. I shouted to
them to come back, when Timbo and I spurred on our horses
towards my cousin. He caught sight of us coming.
"Fire! fire!" he shouted. "Kill the brute! Never
mind though you hit me!"
I sprang from my horse, and just as I got my rifle to my
shoulder, Stanley, with the lion still clinging to him; dashed
by. It was not a moment to hesitate. If I failed to hit the
lion, my cousin must be killed. I fired, and he and the lion fell
from the back of the horse. My heart felt sick, for I thought
he had been killed. The horse, freed from the grasp of the
mighty brute, galloped off across the plain. My cousin lay on
the ground, and I saw that the lion's paw was still on him.
I instantly began to reload. Timbo in the meantime had
come up. What was my horror to see the lion, though

wounded, working his way on towards Stanley's body. I
was afraid if I now fired of hitting him. Without a moment's
delay Timbo bravely rushed forward, shouting loudly, when
the lion, raising himself on his fore-feet, and crouching down,
prepared to make his deadly spring. Timbo stood firm as a
rock. I fired. For an instant I saw the lion in the air; but
the next he rolled over, not two feet from the brave black. I
rashed up to Stanley. As I approached, he lifted himself on
his arm, greatly to my relief.
"He nearly did for me; but I believe I am less hurt than
I supposed !" he exclaimed.
However, even as he spoke, he sank back again. I knelt
down by his side. The lion's claws had inflicted a fearful
wound on his shoulder, and his hip also appeared to be greatly
torn. Timbo, having ascertained that the lion was dead, now
came up to assist me in supporting his master. Fortunately
we had brought some spirits. I shouted to the blacks to come
on with Natty and our goods, and as soon as possible poured
a good portion of spirits and water down Stanley's throat.
Natty had got out of his palanquin and came towards us.
Some of the blacks had, in the meantime, gone off to catch
the horses. Poor Natty's concern was very great at seeing
what had occurred.
"O Captain Hyslop, you must be put into my litter!" he
said; "I am sure I shall be able to ride, for I feel quite

strong now."
This indeed seemed the only way of conveying Stanley.
"But suppose I go on, and bring up Massa David," said
Timbo. "Dat is de best t'ing."
I agreed with him. Having washed Stanley's wounds, and
bound them up as well as I was able, with Timbo's assistance,
we placed him in the litter; while Natty mounted my horse,
I agreeing to walk by his side. The blacks having caught the

horses, Timbo set off, leading Stanley's steed, in order that
David might ride back on it to his brother's assistance. We
then proceeded at a somewhat slower pace than before, the
bearers finding a great difference between my strongly-built
cousin and poor young Natty. As may be supposed, we kept
a very strict watch at night, lest we might be visited by another
lion. Stanley did his utmost to keep up his spirits ; but from
the fearfal laceration he had suffered, his nervous system was
greatly shaken, and he often relapsed into a state almost of
unconsciousness. Natty, however, with the air and exercise,
recovered his strength, and every day looked better. I was
very thankful when, towards the end of the next day, I caught
sight of two objects moving over the plain towards us. Gra-
dually, as they approached, I made out two horsemen, and in
a little time David and Timbo galloped up to our camp.
Timbo's anxiety about his master had probably made him
describe the wound as worse than it was, and David was in a
state of great agitation when he arrived. He, however, after
examining his brother's hurts, expressed a hope that they
would soon get well, and complimented me greatly on the way
I had treated him. Still, I was very glad that David had
arrived; for, in consequence of the constant state of stupor
into which Stanley had fallen, I began to feel very anxious
about him.
We continued to travel on at a very slow pace, as Stanley
could not bear any shaking. Three days more therefore
passed away before we came in sight of the camp.
I had never before seen my cousin Kate so much out of
spirits, and it was not till two or three days after our arrival,
when Stanley was found to be progressing favourably, that
she was at all herself again. To me, however, she was always
kind and gentle.

CHAPTER XXV.
HUNTING ADVENTURES — JOURNEY ACROSS THE DESERT.
T N spite of Mr. Donald Fraser's expostulations, Senhor
Silva would not consent to break up the camp till
b y Stanley was in a fit state to travel. The honest
W trader, however, had no cause to complain, for he
pe was driving a brisk trade, not only with our friends
from Kabomba, but with the people of a number of neigh-
bouring villages. Some he visited in a light cart, which
accompanied the waggons, and a considerable number came to
us. We had not forgotten the elephant's tusks, which Timbo
had hid, and as soon as he believed his master was out of
danger, he set off with one of the horses to bring them into
camp. The elephant itself had long since disappeared, its
skeleton alone whitened the prairie; but the tusks were safe,
and were safely bestowed in the waggon, in part payment of
our debt.
One morning our oxen, which were feeding near, suddenly
started off in every direction, leaping, twisting, and turning
about, and cutting the most ridiculous capers. They looked as
if they had been seized with Saint-Vitus's-dance. On running
towards them I discovered that a large flock of birds were
clinging to their backs—three or four on each animal. Hav-
ing my gun in my hand, I shot one, when I found that it

was the same bird which I had seen on the back of the rhino-
ceros. Senhor Silva, who arrived laughing heartily at the
commotion among our animals, told me that the bird is called
the Buphaga Africana. Its object in thus taking possession
of the backs of the cattle is for the purpose of feeding on the
ticks with which they are covered. They have particularly
long claws and elastic tails, which enable them thus to cling to
the hide, and to search every part of the beast, in spite of its
efforts to get rid of them. When animals are accustomed to
these birds they appear rather grateful for the visitation ; but .
Mr. Fraser's oxen had apparently never experienced a similar
visitation, and were therefore considerably astonished at being
thus unceremoniously assailed. By degrees, however, when
they found that they could not throw them off, and that
nothing very terrible happened, the oxen remained quiet, and
were probably much more comfortable from being delivered
from their parasitic pests.
The necessity of supplying our camp with meat compelled
us frequently to go out shooting. We greatly missed, on
these occasions, Stanley's unerring rifle. Our party generally
consisted of Senhor Silva, Timbo, and myself; but sometimes
Mr. Fraser took Senhor Silva's place; and he was, I must say,
the best shot of the party. We had been unsuccessful, how-
ever, on several occasions, and though there was no famine in
the camp, we had very little meat fit to eat; while our black
attendants were beginning to grumble greatly at being placed
on short commons. This made us more than ever anxious to
get some game. We had scoured the country towards the
south for some distance, and falling in with no animals, we
were induced to proceed further off than usual. The country
over which we were passing was a fine undulating plain. Now
and then there were dips of sufficient depth to conceal us from
each other, for we rode apart in order to cover a wider extent

of ground. My companions were not in sight. I had reached
a slight elevation, when I saw in the distance a herd of large
animals. At first I took them for buffaloes; but their move-
ments soon convinced me that they were of the antelope species.
The wind fortunately came from them, and I determined, with-
out waiting for my friends, to endeavour to bring one of them
down. I galloped on, till, to my delight, I saw before me an
immense herd of the large eland, as they are called, or, more
properly speaking, "cana." In stature they are equal to a
good-sized horse. Their horns are long and spiral. The form
of the creatures before me was massive, their tails terminating
in tufts. I had never possessed much of the spirit of a hunter;
but the necessity of obtaining food made me as eager as any
professional hunter could be to bring down one of the fine
animals. I put spurs to my horse, and galloped on, getting
my rifle ready in the meantime to fire immediately I could
obtain a fair shot. The creatures for some time did not see
me, and not till I was close upon them did they take the
alarm. Near me was a fine large buck. I had seldom fired
from horseback ; but my animal was steady, and I determined
to make the attempt. I took aim, and, greatly to my satisfac-
tion, struck the creature near the shoulder, and over he went.
Seeing that he was utterly disabled, I disinounted from my
horse, and gave him a merciful thrust, which deprived him of
life. Immediately reloading, I again leaped on my horse's
back, and made chase after the herd, which had now got to
some distance. However, I found that I was coming up fast
with them, and in a short time another fat animal lay rolling
on the turf.
Wishing for the assistance of my companions in cutting up
my prize, I rode to the nearest height in the hope of seeing
them. I cast my eyes round in every direction. They were
nowhere visible. I began to fear that they had gone in a

DEFENDING MY PRIZE.

different direction. I shouted with all my might, thinking
that one or the other of them might be concealed in some
hollow, and that my voice might reach them. I could only
carry a part of the elands. After waiting awhile, I rode back
to where I had killed the last. Already several birds of prey
were hovering about. I scared them off, however, by my
shouts; and then passing the bridle of my horse round my
arm, I began in a very unscientific way to dismember the noble
beast I had killed. I did not like the employment; at the
same time, it was necessary to secure the meat. I had been
for some time thus employed, when I heard the sound of wings
close above me, and looking up, saw, with a feeling of no small
alarm, a flight of kites hovering near my head. My horse, too,
not liking their appearance, started back; and not without
reason, for they might quickly have torn out his eyes with
their powerful beaks and claws. I shouted, and waved and
clapped my hands. They retired to a short distance, but only
to come on again with renewed fierceness, seizing pieces of the
meat and flying off with them. I determined, however, not
to be defeated ; and standing by the body of the eland, struck
out right and left with my knife. Some literally fell back on
the ground, spreading out their wings and talons and opening
their beaks to defend themselves. My determined onslaught
on them, however, compelled the first batch to beat a retreat;
but another immediately took their place, pouncing down as
the others had done on the carcass. I knocked over two or
three, and the second party retreated, a third, strange to say,
immediately afterwards coming on to the attack; but they
had become so wary that I was unable to reach them. Still,
as they kept about me, I expected every moment that they
would assail my head, and I could not help feeling how fearful
would be my position if they did so. At last I determined to
try the effect of my rifle, which I had not loaded after my last

506
A GOOD RIDDANCE.
shot-a neglect which might have proved extremely disastrous
had any savage beast appeared. I loaded with shot. In con-
sequence of my shouts and cries, and repeated blows made at
the birds, they retired once more to a short distance. The next
time they approached I fired into their midst, and a couple
fell to the ground, and others were wounded. Still the army
kept their ground. Seeing the effects of the first shot, I
loaded again, and as they came hovering close to me, I fired
once more, with the same success. Greatly to my satisfaction,
on discovering that they could not obtain their feast without
greater loss than it was worth, the whole army flew off, not
appearing to stop while they remained in sight.
Thus being rid of my unwelcome visitors, I returned to my
occupation; remembering, however, first to reload my rifle
with ball, lest a hyena, panther, or lion might scent the dead
eland and come to banquet off it. I had some leathern straps
with me for the purpose of securing any animal I might kill,
and with these I fastened to my saddle as much meat as my
horse could carry. I was sorry to leave any part behind, know-
ing how much it was wanted in the camp. I now turned the
horse's head towards the camp, intending to pass by the eland
I had shot. As I approached, I saw some objects moving over
the ground towards it. At that distance I could not tell what
they were. They might be lions or panthers. If lions, I might
probably have to do battle for my prize. I could not help
thinking, too, of the way Stanley had been handled. It was not
impossible that they would attack me, and get me and my
horse, and the meat into the bargain. Knowing that on such
occasions boldness is always the best policy, I rode forward, and
in a short time distinguished three spotted hyenas stealing up
towards the body of the eland. I determined to prevent them
having their feast, or spoil it if I could not. So eager were
they to seize their prize that they did not notice me. As they

507
drew nearer they hastened their pace, and then made a dash at
the carcass. At that moment, putting spurs to my horse, I
dashed on towards them shouting and shrieking. They re-
ceived me with loud snarls, appearing in no way disposed to
take their departure. Not till I got close up to them did they
retreat, snarling and grinning horribly at me. The scent of
the meat had undoubtedly sharpened their appetites, and they
certainly looked capable of making a spring and trying to
carry away some of the joints. On this I charged them, and
they retreated still further off.
I saw that unless I could find my friends, we should have
no prospect of saving any of the meat. I therefore looked
round again, and thinking that the sound of my rifle might
attract them, I fired it at the nearest brute. Over the animal
fell, and his companions scampered off to avoid a similar fate.
As there was no object in delaying longer, I once more directed
my horse's head towards the camp. Not till I had got to
some distance did I catch sight of Donald Fraser and Timnbo.
They instantly galloped back, in the hope of being in time to
secure the venison, and I proceeded at a slow pace, which the
heavy weight my horse carried made necessary. I was still at
some little distance when they overtook me, saying they had
been too late. A number of birds and beasts of prey had set
on the carcass, and devoured the greater portion. However, the
supply I brought was doubly welcome. As it would only
afford enough food for a day's consumption, we agreed to
set out again immediately, in the hope of falling in with another
herd of elands. The importance of obtaining food was very
great. Mr. Fraser's attendants were already grumbling at
their short allowance, and he was afraid that they would desert
him, and leave us to make our way alone. He also was glad
of an excuse for moving southward. We had been out a con-
siderable part of the day without being able to get up to any

herd, though we saw one or two in the distance. I was talk-
ing to my companions, when, looking up, I saw before us
what seemed like a dark cloud moving through the air at no
great distance above the earth.
"What can that be?" I exclaimed, pointing it out to Mr.
Fraser.
"I will tell you presently," he said. "I fear it bodes us no
good !"
The cloud, as I may call it, now seemed to rise higher
in the air, in the same compact body as it at first appeared.
Then it suddenly sank and dispersed into smaller portions.
Now again it united, again to spread and to rise, very much
with the appearance of huge columns of sand whirled up by
the wind. On it came towards us.
"I will tell you what it is now," said Mr. Fraser. "That
is a flight of locusts. Woe betide the spot they select as a
resting-place ! "
As he spoke it appeared as if a heavy snow-storm had begun;
for the locusts, as they alighted on the ground, looked exactly
like huge snow-flakes. Several thousands might have fallen
round us; still the whole mass seemed in no way diminished,
and on they flew, the noise of their wings sounding like that
produced by a gale of wind whistling through the rigging of
a ship at anchor. On and on we rode, but still the mighty
mass of winged insects advanced. Far as the eye could reach,
they appeared hovering in the air. We pushed on for some
miles, hoping to get beyond them; but the same dark cloud
appeared before us. Not an animal was to be seen. We
turned to the left and galloped on, but still could not get clear
of the mighty column.
"There will be small chance of our meeting with any game
to-day, I suspect," observed Donald, pulling up and looking
round him. " It will fare hard, too, with our poor cattle, I am

Still, I urged that by pushing on we might fall in with a
herd of deer, one or more of which would pay us for our long
ride, and supply our larder with the much-needed flesh. We
rode forward, hoping yet to fall in with some game. Still we
were as unsuccessful as at first. We had gone some distance,
when we came upon masses of creatures of a reddish colour with
dark markings. In some places they covered the ground in
layers two or three inches thick. Mr. Fraser told me they
were the larvæ of the locusts, which the Dutch people at the
Cape call voet-gangers_literally, foot-goers. Some were seen

STRANGE FRUIT.
hopping among the grass, devouring it with extraordinary
rapidity.
"What do you think, Mr. Crawford, of the fruit on those
bushes ? " said Donald to me, pointing to some shrubs, from
which hung what I took to be clusters of magnificent fruit.
Riding forward, I plucked some. My astonishment was
great to find that they were merely the larvæ of the locusts
hanging to the boughs. So thickly did they cover the branches,
that they literally bowed them down to the ground. He told
me that these creatures are especially dreaded by the colonists,
as it is impossible to stop their progress, and they eat up every
green thing in their way. They cross rivers or pools; for
though the leaders are drowned, the others pass over the
bridge thus formed by their bodies. Even fires, which are
sometimes lighted in the hope of stopping their progress, are
put out by the countless masses which crawl over them.
It was dark before we reached the camp. We rode together,
keeping a sharp look-out, in case we might have been followed
by any prowling inhabitant of the wilds. As we drew near the
camp, a bright blaze appeared from one side to the other, and
I could not help being alarmed at the thought that the waggon
and tents, surrounded by dry grass, might have caught fire.
Mr. Fraser, however, quickly calmed my fears.
"Our people, I suspect, are having a feast," he observed.
" It is an ill wind that blows no one good; and if the locusts
have eaten up the cattle's fodder, our people are engaged in
eating up the locusts."
On entering the camp, we found all the blacks busily em-
ployed round the large fires which they had lighted. They
were scraping together vast quantities of locusts which, passing
through the flames, had scorched their wings, and fallen help-
lessly to the ground. Even Senhor Silva, and David, and
the boys, were engaged in the work. In a short time they

511
had collected enormous heaps of the insects, when the blacks
began to roast and eat them as if they were the most delicate
morsels. If they would support existence, there was no fear
of our starving. I was tempted to taste some, but cannot say
that I found them very palatable. As soon as the fires had
burned low, the blacks set to work to dry the locusts in the
hot ashes. Then obtaining some large flat stones from the
river, they ground a number between them into powder, which
they stowed away in all the receptacles capable of holding it.
Next morning, by daybreak, the neighbourhood of the camp
was beset by numberless birds, among which I distinguished
storks and kites, and soon perceived that they were employed
in gobbling up the locusts. The most numerous, however,
were small birds about the size of swallows. Mr. Fraser told
me this was a species of thrush which constantly follows the
locusts, and is said even to build its nest and rear its young in
their midst. He called it by its Dutch name—Springhaan
oogel. David said he knew it as the locust bird. We shot a
number; and though we were not tempted to feed on locusts,
we had no objection to breakfast off the result of our sport.
The fires had partly saved the camp itself; fortunately so, for
the locusts will not only eat grass, but every animal produce
which comes in their way. Leathern thongs, even boots, shoes,
and bags, have been destroyed by them. I saw a number also
feeding on their own companions, which we had trampled on
as we passed through them. No sooner had the warm rays of
the sun been cast across the plain, than, with a loud whirring
sound, the locusts rose in the air. Notwithstanding the number
which had been destroyed, the mass appeared in no way dimi-
nished in size. Onwards they flew to their unknown destination;
but what a scene of desolation met our eyes across the country
on which they had rested! For miles, as Donald had feared,
not a blade of grass was to be seen. As far as the eye could

reach, where the evening before the ground had been green and
smiling, it now looked brown and parched up, as if a fierce fire
had passed over it.
"If we cannot move from here, we must just make up our
minds to remain for ever," observed Donald, " for without
food—and not a particle of grass do I see in any direction-
the poor cattle will soon be starved to death. We must see
Senhor Silva and your cousin David, and hear what they say."
Soon afterwards we were joined by David, and in reply to
Mr. Fraser's remarks, he said he hoped that Stanley was suffi-
ciently recovered to bear the fatigue of travelling in the waggon.
I undertook to arrange a bed slung from the roof, by which
any jolting might be avoided. Calling Jack Handspike to my
assistance, we soon contrived a comfortable cot for my cousin.
Meantime every arrangement was made for starting. The
oxen were harnessed to the huge machine; Kate and Bella
took their seats by the side of their brother. The word was
given to move on. The Hottentot drivers smacked their huge
whips, and the lumbering waggon was put in motion. Natty
and Leo had greatly recovered; but that they might not be
fatigued, room was also made for them inside. Donald and
Senhor Silva mounted their horses, and David and I agreed to
take one between us. When he rode, I was to walk, or mount
an ox. The rest of the party proceeded on foot, or on the
oxen. Far as the eye could reach, nothing but brown earth
and leafless shrubs and trees could be seen; the ravaging hordes
of locusts bad cleared off every particle of verdure from the
ground. North and south, east and west, the country had
become a barren wilderness. The prospect for our poor oxen
was a melancholy one. We could only push on therefore as
fast as they could travel, in the hope of speedily getting beyond
the ravaged country. Our friend Donald looked very grave.
All day long we travelled on. The cattle began to show signs

513
of thirst. We ourselves were also suffering from want of water,
as we were afraid of exhausting the small supply we had brought
in our bottles. At length some rocks appeared ahead, near
which Donald told us was a pool. The cattle seemed to be
aware of it, and eagerly moved on; but as we got near, no bright
gleam, such as gladdens the sight of the thirsty traveller, played
on the spot. On arriving at it, a mass of locusts and their
larvæ were alone visible, completely filling the space where the
water should have been.
Our men immediately set to work, and literally dug them
out and threw them in masses on the shore. We ourselves
could not have drunk a drop. The pool seemed filled with a
thick, muddy, and putrid liquid. The cattle, however, when
let loose, rushed down to it and drank eagerly, though I was
afraid it would produce disease among them. Poor creatures !
if there was nourishment in it, it was the only food they got ;
for that night we had to camp without water for ourselves or
fodder for them.

CHAPTER XXVI.
CROSSING THE DESERT.
ANY days had passed by, during which the usual
JA incidents of African travel had occurred; but I
need not stop to describe them, except to say that
Mr. Fraser had been successful in killing several
elephants, which he did for the sake of their tusks,
Fast and also in purchasing a large quantity of ivory
from the natives who visited our camp to trade, or inhabited
the villages near which we passed. Thus he had no reason to
complain of the long journey he had made to rescue us, al-
though we were not the less inclined to be grateful to him.
The country ravaged by the locusts had been passed at last,
but not till our cattle were almost starved, and we and they
had suffered greatly from want of water. The dried and pounded
locusts had assisted to support our people, but we were now
greatly in want of provisions. Stanley had borne the journey
remarkably well, and was rapidly recovering from the hurts
inflicted upon him by the lion; while Leo and Natty were
completely themselves again. Stanley was very anxious once
more to mnount his horse and to assist in hunting, in order to
supply the camp with food; but of this David would not hear,
and declared that it would be equivalent to fratricide if he al-
lowed it. Donald, Timbo, and I, and sometimes Senhor Silva,

therefore scoured the country in every direction in search of
game. Donald and I were riding on ahead one day, when he
observed on a bush a fly somewhat smaller than the common
blue-bottle fly—so annoying to the butcher—but with rather
longer wings. Begging ine to hold his horse, he jumped off
and caught it. Instantly leaping into his saddle, he told me to
turn and ride for my life, with an expression of consternation
in his countenance which made me
fancy that he had suddenly gone out
of his mind. However, as we rode
on he explained that the fly which
he held in his fingers was the tsetse
fly (David called it the Glossina morsi-
tans), and that it was more danger-
ous to cattle and horses than all the lions and snakes in the
country. Fortunately our horses had not been bitten by it.
He told me that had such been the case their death would have
been certain. It attacks, however, only domesticated animals,
for wild beasts range over the country infested by it with im-
punity; while human beings are scarcely more annoyed by it
than they are by flea-bites. It is confined to certain localities,
and is never known to shift its haunts. He told me that it
was found generally in the bush or among reeds. Though the
insect is small, yet the poison it contains is of so virulent a
nature that its bite is as deadly to horses and oxen as that of
the most venomous serpent. Donald said he had ample reason
to be afraid of it, for on one occasion, not believing in its power
to injure him, he had attempted to pass through a district in-
fested by it, when he lost all his oxen and horses, and very
nearly his own life and that of his companions. They were in
a wild and uninhabited district, and were barely able to secure
provisions and water sufficient to support themselves, till they
could obtain assistance. He said that four or five flies were

sufficient to kill a full-grown ox. The animal, however, does
not die so rapidly as when bitten by a snake. Sometimes,
indeed, it exists for some weeks or months afterwards, gradually
losing its strength, and perishing ultimately of exhaustion.
Frequently, however, oxen die, especially should rain fall, soon
after they are bitten. In the case of one of his horses which
had been bitten, the head and body swelled, its eyes became
so swollen that it could not see, and it was painful to hear it
neighing for its companions, who stood close to it while feeding.
A remarkable feature with regard to the poison of the tsetse
is that calves, and other young sucking animals, are safe so long
as they suck; but it has been remarked that dogs though reared
on milk die if bitten, while a dog which was reared on the
meat of game accompanied his master when hunting in the
districts infested by the fly without suffering.
We had now entered a far more desolate-looking country
than any we had yet passed through. Vast sandy plains ex-
tended round us, broken here and there by clumps of low
bushes or coarse long grass, with occasional patches of more
nutritious verdure, from which our oxen plucked their scanty
meals. Still, occasionally, herds of deer passed us in the dis-
tance, but they were so wary that we could not approach them.
The open nature of the country made stalking in the ordinary
way impossible. Every night, however, Donald, accompanied
by Timbo, spent two or three hours, and sometimes longer, in
lying in ambush, hoping to get a shot at a passing animal, but
their success had hitherto not been sufficient to supply us with
as much meat as we required. Water too was very scarce.
We had been travelling slowly all day, when our cattle began
to move on with greater rapidity than before, evidently believ-
ing that water was near. Donald was riding ahead, looking
about him, when suddenly he and his horse disappeared. I
was at no great distance behind him, and before I could pull

up I was very nearly following. I found that he had slid
down into a large sand-well, some twenty feet in diameter at
the top, and upwards of twelve feet in depth. As soon as he
was extricated from the pit, the men were called with spades
to clear it out. However, after digging some time, no water
flowed into it, though the bottom became thoroughly moist.
We fortunately had some long reeds with us. These were
sunk into the sand, and immediately water began to rise. We
quickly got enough to quench the thirst of the people, but we
had to wait some time before a supply could be procured for the
cattle. As soon as water had been given to the horses, Timbo
set out in search of game. We were as unfortunate as we had
usually been of late. Perhaps this might have arisen from our
want of skill. Donald was an inferior hunter to Stanley, and had
he been well, we should have met with more success. Timbo
was riding near me, when I found him eagerly examining the
sand on one side. Without saying a word he jumped from his
horse, and began scraping away. Presently he produced a
huge egg, then another, and another.
"Dere!" he exclaimed; "we no want food now. See, here
are anoder dozen! Dey eggs of ostrich!"
I looked into the nest, and saw that the eggs were arranged
with their ends uppermost, to occupy, I concluded, as small a
space as possible.
"But, Timbo," I said, " do you think they are fresh, for
otherwise I fear they would be of little use?"
"Oh yes," he said ; "de hen ostrich only just laid dem.
See! see ! dere she is, too, watching us!"
At that moment a loud roar saluted my ears. Instantly
unslinging my rifle, I prepared to fire, believing that a lion
was about to attack us, so similar was the voice to that of the
king of beasts in a rage; but on looking round I could see no
lion, but instead I caught eight, in the distance, of a huge long-

A LONG CHASE.
necked bird, which I knew must be an ostrich, evidently ob-
serving with anxiety the visit we were paying to her nest.
She had gone away, Timbo said, to feed, or otherwise we
should probably have found her sitting, as the flamingoes do,
with her legs astraddle above it. The poor bird did not
attempt to fly, and accordingly gave us time to secure the eggs
in a way which we hoped would prevent their being broken.
Donald had by this time come up, and telling Timbo to take
charge of the eggs, started with me in chase of the ostrich.
As we approached the bird, under the idea perhaps of leading
us from her eggs, or alarmed, more probably, she set off at full
speed. It seemed hopeless, however, to me that we should
ever catch her. Away she flew, at first with small strides,
increasing every instant, and extending her wings like sails.
Her feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground, and yet we could
see huge stones thrown up behind her, flying into the air.
"On, lad! on!" shouted Donald. "We will weary her out
this hot day. She will slacken her pace soon, and we may
turn her maybe towards Timbo, if we do not run her down."
Instead of pursuing directly in the wake of the bird, he turned
on one side and I on the other; and at length she began, as
he had expected, to slacken her tremendous speed. We were
now moving up on parallel lines at some distance from her.
At length we got ahead, when the bird, wheeling round, started
back towards her nest. "Hurrah !" shouted Donald," she is
ours now!" Again we followed the mighty bird, never for a
moment allowing her to stop. It seemed a question whether
she or our horses would have to give in first. At length a
patch of the candelabra-shaped tree euphorbia appeared in
sight, and the hard-pressed ostrich darted towards it, endea-
vouring, it seemed, to force her way through. Pressing on, we
were soon close to her, when Donald, raising his rifle, fired,
and the bird fell over. I was galloping up, when he called to

HOW TO COOK OSTRICH EGGS.
519
me. "Stand back! You might as well get near a dying
lion! A kick from one of her feet would break your horse's
leg, and kill you, if you got within her reach." In a few
minutes the bird ceased to move, and jumping from our horses
we approached. The ostrich must have been nearly eight feet
in height, the feathers being of an ashy brown colour, slightly
fringed with white. And now, for the first time, I saw those
magnificent large plumes of beautiful white feathers which form
the wings and tail of the bird. These the trader immediately
began to pluck out with the greatest care, and having done so,
secured them to our backs, where they were likely to be free
from injury. He called me to assist him in hoisting the body
up on his horse. It must have weighed upwards of two hun-
dred pounds, no slight addition to the burden his tired steed
had to bear.
On reaching Timbo we found that he had discovered another
nest of eggs. With these I loaded myself, and well satisfied
with our prizes we returned to the camp. "No starve now,
Massa Andrew!" said Timbo, as he gave an affectionate glance
at the huge eggs. As we rode up David and the two boys
saluted us with shouts of laughter, at the extraordinary ap-
pearance we cut with the ostrich feathers sticking above our
shoulders. Donald, I found, claimed them as his own property,
and I did not wish to dispute the point, though I should have
liked to have presented one to Kate and Bella. I could only
hope to capture another-bird without assistance. As soon as
we had deposited our burdens, Timbo set to work to prepare
the eggs. His process was, a simple one. First, having made
a hole at the end of the egg, he introduced into it salt, pepper,
flour, and one or two other ingredients. He then shook the
egg thoroughly, so as to mix what he had put in, as well as
the white and yolk. He then placed the eggs he had thus
prepared in the hot ashes, where they were soon perfectly

HOW THE BUSHMEN STALK THE OSTRICH.
baked. Meantime the other blacks, having skinned the bird,
had cut it up, and began to roast it. We all quickly assembled
round our usual supper-table—a cloth spread under an awning
which projected a short distance from the waggon. The ostrich
egg-omelets were pronounced excellent. Although it is said
that the ostrich egg, prepared in the way I have described, is
equal to that of two dozen common fowl eggs, Mr. Donald
Fraser managed to eat a couple; while I found no difficulty in
swallowing the greater part of one of them. David, Kate, and
Bella, however, expressed themselves perfectly satisfied with a
single one divided among them.
As we were seated at our supper, various anecdotes were
told of the ostrich. Donald said he had seen the Bushmen
stalk them much in the same way that we had seen the blacks
further north stalk the buffalo. The Bushman stuffs the head
and neck of the ostrich, into which he introduces a stick,
forming a sort of mantle for his shoulders with the feathers,
so as greatly to resemble the bird. As his legs are black and
the ostrich's white, he paints his legs with white, and taking
his bow and arrow in his hand, sets off for the chase. It is
extraordinary how admirably he mimics the ostrich-now
stops, as if to feed, then turns his head as if keeping a
look-out for enemies. Now he walks along slowly, then trots,
just as the ostrich does, till he gets within bow-shot. With
seldom erring aim he then pulls his þow. Instead of following
the bird he has struck, however, when the others run away,
he runs also. Should any wary old bird suspect that all is
not right, and come towards him, he endeavours to escape ;
but if the bird approaches him, to avoid a stroke of its claws,
or a blow from its wing, he sometimes throws off his disguise,
which he leaves on the ground, and runs away to a distance
to be prepared to pull his bow. He generally uses poisoned
arrows, dipped in the milky juice of the tree euphorbia. A

THE YOUNG OF THE OSTRICH.

slight wound from his weapon quickly brings the ostrich to the
ground. Formerly, he told us, it was supposed that the
ostrich left its eggs to be hatched in the sand by the heat of
the sun, as cold-blooded reptiles are known to do, but this is
not the case. The hen-ostrich sits upon her eggs with great
care, and as soon as the young are hatched, provides them
with nourishment; and as broken eggs are generally found out-
side the nest, it is supposed that she keeps a certain number
unhatched, that she may feed the young birds on them. She
generally hatches about a dozen eggs; but the Hottentots play
her a trick to induce her to lay a larger number. As soon as
they find out a nest, they watch till the bird has left it to go
in search of food, and then scrape out with a long stick two
or three at a time. On returning and finding the number she
expected deficient, she lays enough to supply their place, and
thus goes on from day to day, till she has laid upwards of
forty in the season. Timbo asserted that not only does man
wage war against the ostrich, but that a white vulture is
particularly fond of her eggs. As his beak is not sufficiently
strong to break the shell, he seizes a large stone between his
talons, and soaring with it high into the air, gets over the
nest ; he then lets it drop upon the eggs, seldom failing to
break a sufficient number to afford himself a repast. The
young ostriches, when they emerge from the nest, are about the
size of pullets. They are quickly able to follow the mother,
who supplies them for a considerable time with food. Their
colour is a kind of pepper and salt, resembling the gravel and
sand of the plain over which they roam; so that it is with the
greatest difficulty they can be seen by the hunter, even when
close to them. They are clothed with a kind of prickly
stubble, which is neither down nor feathers, and which pro-
bably defends them from the coarse vegetation and gravel
which covers the region where they exist. The Romans

MATERNAL AFFECTION OF OSTRICH.
called the ostrich the Struthio camelus, in consequence of its
resemblance in many respects to the camel of the desert. The
ostrich, like the camel, is able, from the formation of its in-
terior, to exist for a long time without water, feeding on the
stunted and dried herbage of the desert. Its foot is formed
curiously, like that of the camel; and it has also excres-
cences on its breast, on which it leans whilst sleeping. To
complete the likeness, it has the same muscular neck, which
rises high above the plain, and enables it to perceive the
approach of an enemy, while its body is out of sight.
We had already witnessed the care which a hen-ostrich takes
of her nest, and Donald told us that one day he was riding
along, when he came near a bird evidently sitting. She re-
mained quiet till he advanced, when instantly she sprang up
and rushed towards him, hissing violently. When he turned
round, she retreated a dozen paces or so; but directly he rode
on she again rushed after him, endeavouring by her hisses to
frighten him off.
"Did you kill her, Mr. Fraser, after her exhibition of
maternal affection ?"
"I did," was the answer; "and got her feathers and her eggs,
and I and my people ate her up afterwards. Necessity has no
law, I know; and if a trader in these regions were to give
way to sentiment, he might have to go back with an empty
waggon."
The ostrich has, properly speaking, only the rudiments of
wings, which are utterly unable to lift it off the ground. It
is, however, those magnificent white plumes in the tail and
wings which assist it to run at the rapid rate I have described.
Both male and female possess these white plumes. The body
of the male differs from that of the female. It is of a deep
glossy black, among which a few whitish feathers are mingled,
but only visible when the plumage is ruffled.

AN OSTRICH AT THE CAMP.
523
While we were still talking about the ostrich, Leo started
up, exclaiming, " See! see! there is one just outside the camp.
Run for your gun, Andrew. You may get a shot at it."
There, sure enough, was an object moving slowly towards
us, apparently utterly fearless of the fire. Now it began to
run exactly as the ostrich does. Now it stopped and bent its
head as if to feed. Presently it stretched out its neck, and
a loud roar, which sounded very like that of a lion, burst from
its throat.
"Do not fire, Mr. Crawford," exclaimed Donald; "for if
you do, you will be apt to hit a friend;" and he and Stanley
burst into a loud laugh, echoed by Timbo and some of the
black boys near us, and directly afterwards the seeming ostrich
came trotting merrily into the camp. Some of Donald's
servants had been amusing themselves in forming such a dis-
guise as I have already described, with the hope of catching a
bird or more by means of it on the following day.
While the waggon proceeded onwards the next morning,
our friend Donald again set out, accompanied this time by
Chickango, to assist him in carrying home any game he might
procure. They were to proceed on a line parallel with the
caravan, while we ranged at a further distance. We went
some little way together. We were about to separate, when,
standing up, I caught sight of what I took to be the head of
an ostrich in the distance, and we rode towards it. We had
not got far when Donald exclaimed, "There is another! I
hope there may be a family of them !" Directly afterwards
we saw the female bird scampering away, and the male follow-
ing at some little distance.
"I see no young birds," I observed. "I think you must
have been mistaken."
"They are there, though, notwithstanding," observed my
companion. "I know it by the way they run. Depend upon

it, they would be going twice as fast as that if they were
alone."
Putting our horses to their utmost speed, we at length nearly
overtook the ostriches; and then I saw a number of little brown
duckling-looking birds following at the heels of the female
ostrich. Greatly to my surprise, the male ostrich at this
moment stopped short, and then wheeling round, darted off
on one side. As we were anxious to obtain the young as well
as the mother, we continued our pursuit of her. On this he
once more put on his utmost speed; but instead of going in a
straight line, kept wheeling round and round us, using every
effort to attract our attention. Instead of increasing, he

decreased his circles, till he got within twenty yards of me,
when, to my surprise, over he fell on the ground, and began
to struggle desperately, and I thought he would easily be our
prize. I therefore dashed forward; but quick as lightning he
was on his legs again, running off in an opposite direction to
that which the hen had taken. "You follow him, and I will
go after the other," exclaimed Donald, perhaps thinking, from
some remarks that I had made, that I should not have the
heart to knock over the mother and her young brood. I had
ridden some way in chase of the male ostrich, when a bird
appeared in the distance, towards which he immediately
directed his course, fancying, perhaps, that it was his own hen
and her young ones. He was a long way ahead of me, and I
had lost all hope of overtaking him, for my horse was already
beginning to pant with exertion, when the report of a rifle
came from the direction where I saw the other bird, and im-
mediately my chase rolled over on the sand, the stranger
rushing towards him, wbile three black heads appeared from
some low rocks a little way beyond. Poor fellow! He de-
served a better fate! The stranger bird turned out to be one of
Donald's Hottentots, who, with his companions, had been for-
tunately in the right direction to intercept him. I insisted on
appropriating the tail of the bird, asserting that the Hottentots
would not have killed him had I not chased him up to them.
My horse being by this time well tired, we set off to over:
take the waggon. Late in the day Donald arrived with the
hen-ostrich over his saddle, his back and head ornamented
with the feathers, and half a dozen young birds hanging from
the crupper.
"Well, he does cut a curious figure !" exclaimed Leo, who
saw Donald approaching. "If I had seen him for the first
time, I should have taken him to be a fledged centaur — a
mixture of mian, quadruped, and bird."

EGG WATER-BOTTLES.
Donald was inclined to claim the feathers I had appropri.
ated; but Senhor Silva coming to my support, it was agreed
that they were mine by right of conquest; and I had the
satisfaction of presenting them to my fair cousins—the first
trophies of the chase which I had deemed worthy of their
acceptance.
We obtained, during the following days, a further supply of
ostrich eggs, which, with the birds we had killed, gave us as
much food as we required. We found it, when moving for-
ward, very necessary to be careful not to deviate from the
right course. Frequently over the country where there were
no tracks, and often no landmarks, this was very difficult.
Often it was a long day's journey from one fountain or pool
to the next spot where water could be procured, and we knew
well that without the necessary supply we and our cattle
would suffer severely, even if we did not lose them altogether, in
which case we should be involved in their destruction. Though
I much enjoyed my gallops over the country, I was very thank-
ful when Stanley was once more able to mount his horse; and
I had, in consequence, generally to proceed on the back of one
of the riding oxen, with Natty or Leo behind me. We were
now able to carry far more water than usual. I should have
said that the ostrich eggs were never broken. Their contents
were extracted through a hole in one end, and were carefully
surrounded by a basket-work of reeds, thus forming complete,
and tolerably strong, bottles. At each fountain we came to
they were re-filled.
"We have a long day's journey before us," observed Mr.
Fraser one morning as we were inspanning, as the colonists
call yoking, the oxen to the waggon; "and I wish I was sure
that we should find water at the end of it. We have not
enough left for the oxen, as we must keep all we have for the
horses and ourselves."

DESERT TRAVELLING.
527
He looked graver than usual, and not without reason. The
heat was very great, and we had a wide extent of country be-
fore us, the soil consisting of light-coloured soft sand, which
appeared incapable of producing any green thing for the sup-
port of animals. Pass it, however, we must, as it extended
right across our path to the south, far away to the east, from
the very coast of the Atlantic. Notwithstanding this, our
party were in good spirits, from feeling that we were now
making steady progress towards home.
"We have encountered so many dangers, and escaped them,
that we should not mistrust the willingness of the kind hand
of Providence to protect us to the end of our journey," observed
Kate.
Her calm confidence gave us all courage, and we resolved
not to allow any anticipation of evil to oppress us. Kate had
never relaxed in her resolution to instruct Bella under all
difficulties, and the greater part of the day they sat in the
waggon with their books before them, or their work in their
hands, labouring away as diligently as they would have done
in their home in the colony. Leo and Natty were far more
idle, though they occasionally took their seats near the young
ladies, and either read to them, or listened to their reading.
The Bible was their chief book, and happily its stores are
inexhaustible. The other works they had read over and over
again, till they declared that they could no longer look at
them with patience. The heat was so great, that we were
compelled to camp during the middle of the day, finding that
we could make more progress by travelling early in the morn-
ing and again in the evening.
We had travelled on since daylight, when a group of trees,
which are found here and there even on the desert, gladdened
our eyes. We unyoked our weary oxen beneath them, and
sought such shelter as their branches would afford; but not a

A CHASE AFTER THE HARTBEESTS.
drop or sign of water was to be seen round them. It seemed
surprising how they could exist in that arid spot. Fires were
lighted to cook the remnant of our provisions, though they
also had fallen very short. We were seated at our meal, when
Stanley started up, exclaiming, "We must have some of those
fellows! Who will come with me?" He pointed eastward
-the quarter whence the wind blew—and there I saw, moving
slowly over the plain, and cropping the scanty herbage as they
went, a large herd of antelopes.
"I will," I said, "if I can have a horse."
"You shall have mine," said Senhor Silva.
"I must go with you!" exclaimed Donald Fraser, golping
down the largest part of the contents of an ostrich egg.
Donald having giving directions for the caravan to move on,
and appointed their halting -place, we mounted our horses,
intending to meet it there at night, and galloped off towards
the herd. I imitated my companions' attitude of leaning
down, so as to conceal my head as much as possible, that we
might get near without alarming the herd, keeping to leeward.
Some time passed before they were aware of our approach.
" They are hartbeests," said Donald, "and will give us
a good chase; but we may get within shot of them at last."
There was no shelter which would enable us to stalk them,
and we therefore had to trust to their not taking alarm at the
appearance of our horses. We rode on and on, and every
instant I expected to see them start off, and scamper away
fleet as the wind. They were noble-looking animals, with
large horns rising on a line with their foreheads, and then
bending curiously backwards. We rode on till we got within
a hundred yards of them, when a wary old buck caught sight
of us, and, suspicious of evil, gave the alarm to his com-
panions.
"On, boys, on!" cried Donald, who had been watching for

RUN TO DEATH.
529
their expected start to put his horse at full speed. On we
dashed, the hartbeests going away directly from the camp.
They kept close together, somewhat impeding each other.
They were now thoroughly alarmed, and away they went at a
speed which it at first appeared would make it utterly impos-
sible for us to come up with them. Not so, however, thought
Stanley and Donald Fraser. Our horses seemed to enter into
our wishes, and exerted themselves to the utmost. On kept
the herd, throwing the dust up behind them, which rose in the
air like clouds of smoke. After an hour's flight they began to
slacken their speed, while our horses, urged on by our spurs,
redoubled theirs. At last we got within a hundred yards
of the hard-pressed herd. Stanley quickly threw himself
from his horse, and firing, a fine buck flew up into the air ;
and the next moment, parting from the main body of the
herd, darted off to the right; while Donald, aiming at another
animal, brought it to the ground. I fired directly afterwards ;
but so excited had I become by the chase and ride, that I sus-
pect my bullet flew over the heads of the animals.
"Mount and ride after that fellow, Andrew !" exclaimed
Stanley, pointing to the hartbeest he had wounded.
I did as he directed me, while he and Donald Fraser, throw-
ing themselves on their horses, again made chase after the
herd. The wounded animal fled away by itself, and though
evidently, by the flow of blood from its side, severely hurt, it
yet continued springing forward at a rapid rate. Determined
not to let it go, I urged on my horse in pursuit. At length,
greatly to my satisfaction, for my horse was nearly done up,
over the hartbeest rolled ; and, springing from my saddle, I
put an end to its sufferings. When I looked round, neither
the herd nor my companions were to be seen. A long chase
in that hot sun had made me very thirsty, and not a drop of
water had I with me. I was hungry too, for I had only just

A GLITTERING POOL.
begun my breakfast; though, if content to eat raw meat, I had
the means of satisfying my appetite. The animal was so heavy
that I could not lift it on my borse ; and yet I did not like to
leave it to be devoured by hyenas and jackals, or other beasts
of prey, which it would, I knew, inevitably be very shortly,
should I go away. I therefore waited and waited, hoping to
see my companions return. I thought I remembered pretty
accurately the direction I had come; but the clump of trees was
but a small object to guide me over that extensive plain, on
which, too, I knew that similar clumps existed. At length,
not seeing my friends, I decided to load my horse with a por-
tion of the antelope, and to try and find my way back to the
camp. I had, as I mentioned, suffered greatly from thirst
before, but it did not equal the pain I was now enduring. Not
only did my mouth and throat feel dried up, but my whole
stomach ; and faint and hungry as I was, though I had an
abundance of food with me, and might have collected grass
and twigs enough to cook a portion, yet I could not swallow :
particle. I felt growing weaker and weaker, and my head became
so dizzy and my eyes so dim that I could not distinguish objects
clearly before me. I began to fear that I had received a sun-
stroke, for the heat was greater than any I had yet experienced.
I knew the fatal effects which might follow. Still, I managed
to stick to my horse and ride on.
I had gone a considerable distance, and was trying to discover
the wished-for clump of trees, when my eyes fell on a glitter-
ing pool of water, some way off to the left. I had not for-
gotten my experience when before wandering in search of
water; but I was convinced that I could not be mistaken. By
its side I saw several clumps of trees, and could even distin-
guish their reflection on the calm surface of the lake. The
spectacle revived my spirits, and I urged on my horse, hoping
soon to quench my thirst, and put an end to the suffering I

BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.

was enduring. He too seemed equally eager to reach the lake.
I was surprised that Donald had not known of it, as he cer-
tainly would have moved there instead of pushing on to the
well, where he had doubts of finding water. I confess that
had any one told me that what I saw before me was not water,
I should have trusted my own senses rather than his assertion,
and still gone on towards it. Bitter, therefore, was my dis-
appointment, when in a short time I found myself standing on
the margin of what I took to be a lake, but which was merely
a dry basin incrusted with saline particles, which gave it, with
the assistance of the existing mirage, thus exactly the appear-
ance of water. I turned away, suffering even more than before
from the fearful thirst which oppressed me. Still, I had been
aroused, and I hoped to be able to return to the camp before
being quite overcome. After going some distance, however,
niy spirits again sank, and I could scarcely sit my horse. In
another moment I believe I should have fallen, when I saw a
plant trailing along the ground, with large leaves, and among
them a large melon-like fruit. Yes, there before me was a
water-melon! I threw myself from my horse, and eagerly
taking out my knife, cut a huge slice. Oh! how deliciously
cool and refreshing it was! I let the juice trickle over my
throat and down my mouth. I felt that I could never eat
enough of it; it seemed to cool me even far more rapidly than
water would have done. I did not forget my poor steed. He
put down his head towards the fruit, part of which lay on the
ground; and he seemed to relish it quite as much as I did.
Having eaten my fill of the melon, I felt greatly relieved. My
horse, too, had leisure to devour as much as he would. After
riding on a little distance, I saw another fruit of the same ap-
pearance. I felt an inclination for a further supply; for when
once the throat has become so dry as mine was, the sensation
of thirst very quickly returns. I cut a slice, but the first mouth-

think I could have eaten it. My horse also, after licking it,
· refused to eat it. I tried another; that was equally bitter.
I cut a third and a fourth; they had the same unpleasant
taste. My horse also refused to touch them. I began to fancy
that I had discovered the only sweet one. Still I persevered,
and soon came upon another which was as delicious as the first.
Three or four others were of the same character. My harse
eagerly devoured them. Though loaded with meat, I could
not refrain from adding several water-melons to my burden;
and, thoroughly revived, set off in good spirits towards the
camp.

RODE on and on, but still saw no signs of the camp.
Had it not been for the water-melons, I must in-
R evitably have perished. Darkness came down over
RP the dreary waste, making it appear still more deso-
o late. I trusted that my steed would find his way
to the camp, for I could no longer direct him with any degree
of certainty. The stars shone brightly overhead; yet, as I
did not know the exact bearings of the camp, they would only
enable me to keep a direct line, and that might lead me far on
one side or the other. Still, I should be prevented from going
round in a circle, as travellers who have lost their way are apt
to do, to find themselves after many hours at the spot from
which they started. Every now and then I stood up in my
stirrups, looking out eagerly for the camp-fire. Not a glimmer
of light could I see. Dangers beset me also, I knew-old sand-
wells and pitfalls might be in my path. Lions also, attracted
by the smell of the meat I carried, might follow and seize ine.
I kept my rifle and hunting-knife ready for immediate use,
while I cast an anxious look round me, every moment trying
to pierce the gloom, lest some beast of prey might be stealthily
approaching. It was a trying time. It would have been
worse had I been suffering as before from thirst. At last I

TREACHEROUS GROUND.
began to fear that I must have passed the camp altogether. I
determined to halt, and was looking about for a bush or some
rock or slight elevation under which I might form my camp,
when I found my horse's fore-feet sinking into the ground. I
had great difficulty in keeping my seat; but immediately rear-
ing up, he sprang forward. The effort was vain, however, for
his feet alighted only on treacherous ground, and down he
sank into a large cavity. I made an attempt to spring off his
back, but the ground gave way, and I found myself sinking
down with him several feet below the surface. He kicked and
plunged, and very nearly struck me. I managed, however,
once more to get upon his back; and in a short time, finding
that his efforts to get out were hopeless, he remained quiet.
I had fallen into one of the holes I had dreaded. Even if I
could get out myself, there was no chance of extricating my
horse, and I should have to find my way to the camp on foot.
The loss, too, of the horse would be a serious matter. I was
as likely also to be attacked by a lion or hyena as I should
have been on the level ground; for though the wild beast,
if he got in, might not be able to get out again, I should
nevertheless become his prey. The pour horse could with
difficulty stand, and every now and then tried to change his
uncomfortable position. To relieve him, I got off and stood
as well as I was able, keeping my rifle ready for immediate
use.
Time went slowly by. Though tired and even drowsy, I
could not have gone to sleep, even had I wished it, in my un-
comfortable position. I could see the stars overhead; but how
deep down I was I could not well judge. It was a depth, I
feared, from which I should have great difficulty, even in
daylight, in scrambling out. Now and then, indeed, the
dread came over me that I should be unable to do so; for the
sides were of such soft sand that when I attempted to climb

537
up it gave way below my feet, while there was sand alone at
which I could grasp. I passed my time in devising plans for
getting out; but I could not help acknowledging that the best
of them were not likely to succeed. I might scrape the sand
down, and thus, filling up the hollow, gradually rise to the
surface; but there was danger of the mass above my head
sliding down and overwhelming me.
These unpleasant reflections were presenting themselves to
my mind, when I saw, against the sky, a huge head projecting
over the edge. I could not be mistaken. It was that of
a lion. In another instant he might spring down upon me.
My only hope of escape was to fire immediately, and drive him
off. Even then I dreaded that he might topple over when
shot, and destroy me in his dying struggles. I raised my rifle
and fired. A fearful roar was the answer to the sound of my
piece. Scarcely daring to look up, I began loading again as
rapidly as I could; for even then I feared that the monster
would spring down. Roar succeeded roar. It seemed to me
that it was echoed far and near by other lions. I waited for
some time, but still no creature appeared. I began to hope
that my shot had driven them away.
Once more I began to suffer from thirst; and cutting up a
water-melon, I took part of it myself, and gave a portion to
my poor steed, who showed his gratitude by licking my hand.
I waited for some time, wishing for the return of day. Except
when my horse made a movement, not a sound for many
minutes together reached me. Then the distant roar of a
lion might be heard, or the barks of hyenas or jackals. Sud-
denly I heard the sound of feet, as if a troop of antelopes was
passing by. I hoped that they might not inadvertently tumble
in on me. To scare them away I began to shout. I kept on,
raising my voice to the utmost. To my surprise a shout came
in return.

IIOW I WAS RESCUED.
" Hillo! Where are you ?"
I recognized Stanley's voice. I soon let him know. Pre-
sently I saw his head and Donald's projecting over the pit.
"A bad job for the horse, though we may soon get you out.
But you must be almost dead of thirst, lad, as we pretty nearly
are," observed Donald.
I told them of the water-melons I had found, and that I
still had some remaining.
" Then hand them up, lad! hand them up!" cried Donald.
" We shall have more strength to haul you up afterwards."
While he was speaking, he let down the tether-ropes. I
fastened the water-melons to them.
"You will excuse us, Andrew," said Stanley, "if we satisfy
our thirst before getting you up. You know from experience
what it is."
Not waiting for my reply, their heads were in the melons, I
suspected, before many seconds had passed. They did not
keep me waiting long; but the next time the rope came down
I fastened the meat to it. This was hauled up, Donald uttering
exclamations of satisfaction at seeing it. By the aid of the
rope I very quickly scrambled out; and as I did so I felt
thankful that assistance had come, for from the depth of the
hole and the nature of the sides I saw that I should not have
got out without assistance. They had come upon the remains
of the hartbeest, but had not discovered any water-melons,
and their horses were, therefore, scarcely able to proceed.
Even the small supply of the watery fruit we were able to give
the poor animals greatly relieved them.
The next question was, how to get my horse up. I volun-
teered to descend again. With the aid of the tethers and all
the straps we could muster, we managed to get a rope of
sufficient length round his shoulders, so as to leave his limbs
free, that he might help himself as much as possible. We

ONCE MORE ON LEVEL GROUND.
539
then shuffled down the sand, making him leap up on it as it
fell; and at length, by hard work, once more we got him on
level ground.
My horse was heavily laden, but my friends remarked that
could they have exchanged some of the meat for water-melons
they would gladly have done so. We, however, could dis-
cover none on the ground over which we passed. Fortunately
they knew the bearings of the camp, and at length its fires
appeared in sight. I was surprised to find in reality how
short a time I had been in the pit; for I supposed I had
passed the greater part of the night there.
We found our friends bitterly disappointed at having dis-
covered no water, as they had expected, at their halting-place.
Every one was complaining, -even Kate and Bella ; for even
the supply intended for the young ladies had been exhausted.
My tidings of the water-melons was joyfully received; and it
was arranged that a party should set out with oxen and
baskets at daylight. I lay down, as did Stanley and Donald,
to obtain a little sleep. I was to lead the party, as I fancied
I knew the direction where I had found the juicy fruit.
When Senhor Silva heard the account I gave, he expressed a
hope that we should find not only an abundance of melons,
but a root which he called leroshúa, which grows in the desert,
and is of an excessively juicy nature.
While the waggons proceeded on southward, Senhor Silva
and I scoured the plain in one direction, keeping sight of the
oxen with the panniers, that we might summon them directly
we discovered what we were in search of. Before going far,
we saw the ground turned up as if some animal had been
digging with its horns. Near it was a small plant, the stalk
about the thickness of a crow's quill. It had apparently been
broken off, and the root to which it had been attached had
been consumed. Not far off, however, we saw several similar

540
A SEARCH FOR WATER-ROOTS.
plants; and Igubo—who accompanied us with a spade—and the
other blacks, who were not far off, were directed to dig. They
had got down a little more than a foot, when a large tuber, twice
the size of the ordinary turnip, was discovered ; and the rind
being removed, we found it to consist of a mass of cellular
tissue, filled with fluid like the root I have mentioned. We
eagerly put it to our mouths, and found it deliciously cool.
The poor oxen, as soon as it was given to them, ate it eagerly.
We loaded one with the roots, and sent it on to overtake the
caravan.
Senhor Silva said there was another root, of a similar nature,
in other parts of the desert, called the mokúri. The tubers
are far larger. It is a herbaceous creeper. The stem, rising
out of the ground, sends out its branches horizontally to a
distance of a yard or more on either side. They deposit
underground a number of tubers, much larger than the first I
have mentioned. The natives, when seeking them, strike the
ground with a stone, and discover by the difference of sound
when one is beneath the spot.
In half an hour, great was our delight to see the ground
covered in all directions with the water-melons of which we
were in search. Igubo and his sons, who had never before seen
any, instantly set upon them. They spat out the first, with
wry faces. They had seized upon a bitter one. The other
blacks, more cautious, ran along, cutting a small piece off with
their knives, tasting each in succession, leaving the bitter and
only cutting the sweet.
As we had not more than a load for one buffalo, we pushed
on further, hoping to find a larger supply. After going a few
yards, I saw Donald, who was in front, standing up in his
stirrups. On getting up with him, he pointed ahead, when
we saw in the distance what looked like a number of black
mounds.


## p. 541 (#545) ############################################

ELEPHANTS FEEDING ON MELONS.
541
"A troop of elephants !" he exclaimed. "But it will be
no easy matter to get near enough for a shot in this open
plain."
Riding on a little further, the elephants came more closely
in sight; and near them were a number of rhinoceroses.
It was soon evident that they were busily employed; and
Senhor Silva said he had no doubt that they were eating the
water-melons, a number of which probably grew there.
Eager as Donald was to obtain the tusks, we declined
assisting him in so dangerous an undertaking. Turning
southward to return to the caravan, we shortly afterwards
caught sight of three lions, and a whole troop of hyenas and
jackals, apparently quenching their thirst with the same juicy
fruit. Scarcely had we lost sight of thern, when several herds
of antelopes appeared, scattered widely over the plain. They
also were evidently feeding on the melons. We fortunately,
however, fell in with a small patch of the fruit which had not
yet been attacked, and were thus able to load our oxen. We
did not overtake the caravan till nearly the time for halting.
I could not fail to remark the beneficent arrangement of Pro-
vidence in thus supplying the animals of the desert with the
means of quenching their thirst. We, indeed, should have run
a great risk of perishing had we not found the melons and the
leroshúa roots. Not a drop of water was to be obtained from
the well where we camped. We continued our course across
the desert, supported entirely by the watery fruit I have de-
scribed. Nothing could be more cool or delicious than a fresh
water-melon when eaten early in the morning.
We were pushing towards a village near a fountain, where
Donald expected to find an ample supply of water. He and
I were riding ahead. At length some circular, beehive.
looking huts appeared in sight, with a few people moving
about in front of them. The men were armed with spear

and buckler, and wore the usual waist-cloth in front, and
ornaments on their heads and arms. Several, when they saw
us, came forward, and began to shake their spears and vocifer-
ate loudly. Before we could understand their meaning, they
were joined by a tall oldish-looking man, who seemed to be
their chief. After he had made a long harangue, Donald
answered him ; but I saw by his gestures and those of his

EXORBITANT DEMANDS.
543
followers that no satisfactory arrangement had been arrived at.
Donald began to lose temper.
" The fellows guess the strait we are in, and refuse to give
or sell us water," he exclaimed, "unless I deliver to them six
of my best oxen, four muskets, and I do not know how many
articles besides. I have told them I will do nothing of the
sort; and we shall soon see that they will come down in their
demands. They know the country we have come through,
and probably think we are harder up for water than is the
case."
The chief waited to see if we would accede to his demands;
and Donald replied that as we could do very well without
water they would get nothing, whereas we would have paid
them liberally for what we took. Saying this, we turned round
our horses and rode off. We had not got far when several
arrows came whistling after us. Fortunately none struck us
or our horses, for if they had, as they probably were poisoned,
the result would have been serious. As we turned our heads
for an instant, we saw a large number of people collecting
from numerous huts scattered about in all directions.
We hastened back to the caravan to prepare for defence ;
for the natives, it seemed, were too likely to attack us. Stan-
ley at once proposed encamping and erecting a stockade,
within which we might defend ourselves.
"Oh yes!" exclaimed Leo, "we could easily drive them
off, as we should have done the natives of the north."
"But," observed Natty, "suppose they besiege us, what are
we to do for water ?"
"You are right, Natty," said Stanley. "It would be better
generalship to pass their village and try to gain another foun-
tain further on."
This, indeed, was our only secure course ; for though our
own blacks would certainly have fought well, Donald could

544
STEALING A MARCH.
not depend on his followers, who, he said, had shown the white
feather on more than one occasion.
We therefore, instead of camping, as we had proposed, turned
somewhat to the east, so as to leave the inhospitable village
on our left hand, hoping to get a considerable distance to the
south of it before daybreak. The country was tolerably level,
and the moon was high enough to give us sufficient light to
find our way. It was the first night we had attempted to
travel without stopping, but it was absolutely necessary to do
so to carry out our object. A battle with the natives was on
every account to be avoided. Stanley and I rode as scouts on
either hand, while Donald kept ahead to explore the way.
We hoped thus to avoid being taken by surprise. We could
see numerous animals moving around us. Once a vast herd
of elephants hove in sight, another time one of buffaloes, while
antelopes of various species bounded off as we came near. We
could hear occasionally the muttering sound of lions and the
cry of hyenas. Several, indeed, followed us, but as they did
not approach, we refrained from firing at them, lest the sound
of our rifles might betray our position. Timbo and Chickango
brought up the rear on oxen, with directions only to fire in
the case of any large body of natives being seen following, or
should a wild beast threaten to attack them. Thus we tra-
velled on hour after hour. We halted only once, to give the
oxen some water-melons or leroshúa roots, and to take a little
food and water-melon ourselves. I found that Kate and Bella
had become very anxious, because one of the Hottentot boys,
who spoke a little English, had been telling them all sorts of
stories of the ferocity of the natives, and of the way they had
attacked travellers and carried off their oxen. Donald, on
hearing this, soundly rated the lad, assuring the ladies that, as
he had never been in that part of the country before, he could
know nothing of the matter.

A SAND-WELL REACHED.
545
After a short rest we again pushed on. The sun at length
rose above the dry plain, shedding a brilliant glow of crimson
over the whole eastern horizon, and lighting up the summits of
the bare rocks, and clumps of trees here and there, with a red
tinge. I could not help dreading, with the prospect of a burn-
ing day before us, that water might not be found. At length
we arrived at one of the sand-wells I have before described.
We eagerly rushed into it, and sank our reeds, in the hope of
obtaining water. It came, but at a slow rate, which promised
but a scanty supply for our thirsty cattle, even though we
might obtain enough for our own wants. The blacks quenched
their thirst by sucking narrow reeds, which they ran into the
sand. Donald, after examining it, gave orders to them to
dig, in the hope of obtaining a larger quantity. The result of
the operation was satisfactory, and we accordingly resolved to
encamp there for a day or two, till our cattle had obtained
enough water to last them till we could get across the desert.
There was an abundance of grass, growing in tufts, and a small
group of trees near us, which would afford us shade and fire-
wood. Stanley also hoped to kill some game. The poor
cattle had to wait, though, till our horses had the water they
required.
Leo and Natty had been amusing themselves outside the
camp. "Here; see what we have got!" cried Leo, returning
after they had wandered to a short distance. "Hillo !" he
exclaimed, turning round as I went out to meet them. "Why,
it was a long creature just now; and see, it has turned into a

The ball of which Leo spoke was covered with large black
scales, somewhat the size and shape of the husk of the arti-
choke, which overlapped each other in a very curious and
beautiful manner. David quickly solved the mystery of the
scaly ball. Being allowed to remain quiet for a few minutes,

it unrolled itself, when it was seen to possess a head and a
broad tail, likewise covered with scales. He pronounced it to
be one of the manides or scaly ant-eaters—a rare animal, and
seldom seen. It had a long extensile tongue, furnished with a
glutinous mucous for securing its insect food. It was entirely
destitute of teeth, so that it was evident it must suck in the
creatures it caught, and swallow them whole.
David said that the manides are very inoffensive animals;
that they live solely on ants and termites. They burrow to a
great depth in the ground. For this, as also for extracting
their food from ant-hills and decayed wood, we found that the
creature's feet were armed with powerful claws, which it could
double up when walking.
"We are getting into a thorny district," observed Donald,
who had joined us, "very different to the thornless one we
have passed through. What do you think of this ?" he ob-
served, stooping down and picking up a round disc with a
sharp thorn in the centre. "Suppose this was to run into a
poor animal's foot; it would take him months to get it out,
even if he did not become lame for life."
Soon after we camped Donald started off on a hunt by him-
self. He had not been gone long when we saw him returning
from the north, with a gemsbok, or oryx, as I have before called
it, across his saddle. Considering the weight he carried, he
came pressing on at a rapid rate. He was not a man much
given to exhibiting his feelings, but I saw that something was
the matter.
"Quick, lads !" he exclaimed. "We must get ready to
defend our camp without loss of time. I thought as I rode
along that I would just take a look at our inhospitable friends,
and see what they were about. When I had got half-way
between this and their village, I caught sight of a large num-
ber of them stealing along across the plain. I think they

PREPARATIONS FOR ATTACK.

must have seen me, or perhaps they took me for a cameleopard
or ostrich; for I only showed for a moment behind an ant-hill,
then quickly again got under cover to reconnoitre them.
There are some two or three hundred fellows at least, and by
the way they were marching I am very certain that they
intend to attack us. I had just shot this oryx, and I had no
wish to leave it for them, or I might have been here sooner ;
but there is time to get ready, if we are sharp about it."
· Stanley, on hearing this, was in his element. He immediately
ordered out all hands to cut down the smaller trees from the
group I spoke of, to form palisades. The waggons and carts were
placed on one side, while palisades were fixed all round, and
strong cross-beams secured to them. This done, we set to
work to throw up an embankment, which, with the light sand,
was easily accomplished, the upright posts keeping it in its
place. We thus, in a wonderfully short time, had a little
fortress which might have stood a siege against men armed
with muskets. As we hoped our expected assailants had no
fire-arms among them, we felt no apprehension as to the result.
The chief danger was that they might try to starve us out,
which there was a possibility of their doing should they per-
severe in surrounding us. We were working away till long
after dark by the light of our fires. Scouts were sent out, but
came back after some time stating that they could see nothing
of the enemy. At length Stanley expressed his belief that
Donald had been mistaken; at which our friend bristled up.
No, he was certain he had seen an army of blacks; probably,
however, when they caught sight of him, they might have
thought better of the matter.
"But perhaps they were merely on a hunting expedition,"
said David, " or collecting water-melons."
" They were keeping too close together for hunting; and
as they were following in our track, they would have found

WAITING FOR THE ENEMY.
neither water-melons nor water-roots," answered Donald. "Do
not be too sure that they will not come yet. These people, as
I fancy you have experienced, like to take their enemies by
surprise; and they will not come on in broad daylight with
tom-toms and shouts, depend on that. It would be well that
those who have the morning watch should keep a bright look-
out, or we may be attacked when we least expect it."
Donald's advice was not thrown away on me. I had just
relieved Stanley, who had taken what would at sea be called
the middle watch, Jack and Timbo being my companions.
The night was perfectly still. I could hear the low mutter-
ing of lions in the far distance, with an occasional roar as
some other creature approached to dispute their prey with
them. Now and then the trumpeting of elephants reached
me, probably on their way to some distant fountain, or in
search of roots or water-melons. I thought it was almost
impossible that any enemies could approach without being
discovered. Still, I had been too well accustomed to discipline
at sea not to keep as bright a look-out as I should have done had
I known they were near. I was standing with Timbo on the
north side of the fort, when he asked me to let him go out
to a little distance.
"If dey come, dey come soon; and we no see dem till dey
close to de wall," he whispered.
Trusting to his judgment, I willingly let him do as he
proposed. He accordingly slipped over the palisade on one side,
and I could barely distinguish him as he crept along over the
ground towards the north. He was soon lost to sight. Jack
and I kept anxiously looking out for his return. I felt little
alarm about the natives, but I was afraid that some prowling
beast might attack him. I must have waited half an hour or
more, when I distinguished a long object crawling along on
the ground. In the gloom I could not make out whether it

549
was Timbo, or a panther perhaps, or a huge snake, so noise-
lessly and stealthily did it approach. It made, however, for the
side of the fort, and in a short time Timbo came up to me,
having been admitted by Jack through the sally-port in the
rear.
"Dey come!" he whispered. "Dey no see me, dough.
Dey t'ink dey find us all asleep. I go call de captain and de
rest, and de black fellows; and we all get ready, and lie down
and snore loud; and den, when de enemy come, we jump up
wid loud shout, and dey run away."
Timbo's plan of action was simple, and I hoped might prove
effective; so I begged him to carry it out. In a few seconds all
our party, crawling out from their huts, or from beneath the
waggon or lean-tos, assembled noiselessly, and took up their
station at the palisades, kneeling down so as not to be seen by
those approaching. Thus we all remained ready for the attack.
Some time passed away, and no enemy appeared ; and I could
not help suspecting that Timbo might by some means have
been mistaken. He, however, was positive that he had seen
the enemy, and was rather indignant at my supposing that
he could have been deceived. We kept watching on every
side, not knowing on which the blacks, if they really were
coming, might make their attack. At length I saw an object
moving along the ground, exactly as Timbo had approached
the fort; then another and another appeared. I found that
Timbo had seen them too, and immediately he managed to
give the information to our companions, when, somewhat to
my amusement, a loud chorus of snores ascended from all parts
of the camp. "Dat good," he whispered to me; "dey t'ink
we all sleepy. Now, see!"
As he spoke, we could distinguish several black figures
crawling on the ground close up to the fort. They stopped
and listened, then rising to their feet, ran back to their com-

A WARM RECEPTION.
panions, who yet, we supposed, remained concealed in the
neighbouring bushes and long grass. Fearing, probably, that
the snoring garrison might awake, the whole army of blacks
now advanced, crouching down close to the ground, and had we
not been watching for them, they might easily have got close
up without being discovered. They advanced in a semicircle,
closing gradually in on the fort. We lay still as death. The
dogs, I should have said, had been muzzled, and stowed away
under the waggon, where they remained quiet. Closer and
closer the blacks advanced. "Dey t'ink dey climb over and
we not know," whispered Timbo. "Now, see ! "
We let the blacks get close to the palisades. They were
touching them, expecting without difficulty to climb over,
when at a word from Stanley up we all started, firing directly
in their faces. The result was even more satisfactory than we
could have anticipated, for in an instant the front ranks rushed
away, knocking down those behind them in their terror, when
the whole army instantly took to flight. The two boys gave
vent to loud hurrahs, which were taken up by the rest of our
party, when Kate and Bella, who had not been told of what
was likely to take place, came rushing out of their tent to in-
quire what had occurred. We soon found, however, that we
were not to gain so easy a victory as we had hoped. The
blacks, recovering from their fright, and not acquainted with
the effects our fire-arms were able to produce at a distance,
once more assembled, and advanced bravely to the attack. We
were consequently compelled to give them a volley, but except
from the rifles of two or three of our best shots, very few of
our bullets took effect. Seeing that we were not to be taken
by surprise, the enemy again retired. We were in hopes that
they had gone off altogether. To ascertain whether this was
the case, Timbo volunteered once more to go out. He soon
returned, saying that they had only retired under shelter, and

551
from the sounds he had heard, he suspected that they proposed
making another attack. We waited anxiously till daybreak.
On looking out, we saw numerous blacks moving among
the bushes. Then a large body appeared, apparently assem-
bling to hold a consultation. After a time they separated,
dividing into several small bodies. These marched forward,
and posted themselves at equal distances round the camp. It
was now clear that, having failed in their expectation of taking
us by surprise, they had resolved on starving us out. Fortu-
nately they could not interfere with our water, or they would
have done so; indeed, they might possibly not have been aware
of the supply we were gradually obtaining from the well.
The day passed away, but our pertinacious enemies inade no
signs of moving. Of course they kept us on the alert all
night, not knowing at what moment they might again attack
us. On the second day things began to look serious; for
though we had water, provisions were growing scarce. Donald
began to talk of cutting our way through the enemy; but as
they could assail us at their pleasure as we marched along,
this would have been a dangerous proceeding.
"It must be done," he said at last; "if we remain here
another day we shall starve, and it is better to run the risk of
fighting than to do that."
We had at length obtained a sufficient supply of water for
the cattle, and had we been unmolested, we might now with
confidence proceed on to the next fountain, after which Donald
hoped to find each day a sufficient supply of water. Stanley
however proposed, instead of risking an attack while moving
on, to sally out with horse and foot and drive the enemy away.
He, with Senhor Silva and Donald, were to form the cavalry,
and I was to lead a party of infantry, consisting of Jack,
Chickango, Igubo and his two sons, and four of Donald's
Hottentots.

THE CAMP AGAIN ASSAULTED.
"We must go too, then !" exclaimed Leo, when he heard
the proposal.
"No," answered Stanley. "I have no doubt of your
bravery, but you will show it better by remaining to assist
David and Timbo in garrisoning the fort." After some hesi-
tation Donald agreed to this plan.
Our arrangements had just been made, the horses were
saddled, and we were about to make our sortie, when the
blacks were seen once more approaching. Stanley had ordered
the gate to be opened, when Donald exclaimed, "No, no; we
are safe behind our walls, and it would be of no use exposing
ourselves to their arrows by going outside."
Stanley was very indignant at this, but with divers opinions
among the leaders, he saw that it would be imprudent to take
the field. This time the blacks seemed as if they were re-
solved to conquer. In spite of three or four being wounded,
others came on, while showers of arrows fell into the camp.
We had dug a pit in the centre of it, and covered it thickly
over with boughs and earth at the top. In this Kate and
Bella, after some difficulty, were persuaded to take their seats.
They were there perfectly free from danger; and Stanley
assured them that we should all fight much better if we knew
that they were out of harm's way. So numerous were our
assailants, and in so determined a way did they come on, that
matters began to look serious. They had evidently made up
their minds to obtain the rich prize they expected to find in
the waggons, and supposing that we must be hard-pressed for
food, they felt sure that even should they fail in taking our
camp, they would be able to cut us off on our march. Since
they appeared, indeed, our provisions had got very low, though
we were on half rations. One thing was very evident, that
we must hold out as long as a particle of food remained, and
then endeavour to push on towards the south, even though we

553
should have to fight our way through them; for it would be
madness to trust to the clemency or good faith of such savages.
On every side the black warriors came round us. When two
or three of their number were wounded, they retreated under
shelter, but only to reappear shortly afterwards, more deter-
mined apparently than ever to conquer.
At length, as evening drew on, they once more appeared, in
greater numbers than before. Instead of allowing them to
approach, however, we opened a warm fire upon them, when
even at a considerable distance. This seemed to astonish them,
as probably they were not aware that our bullets would reach
so far, and once more they retreated under cover. Scarcely
had they gone, when Donald gave us the unsatisfactory infor-
mation that one meal alone remained for the party in the
camp.
"Then, my friends," said Stanley, "let us lose no time in
making our retreat. We may get to a long distance before
the blacks discover that we have left the fort; and if they follow
us, we must turn round and drive them off."
The necessity of moving was so obvious, that no time was
lost in preparing to start. The waggons were laden, the oxen
yoked. The usual fires were lighted, to deceive the enemy.
Then in perfect silence we quitted the camp, Stanley and I
bringing up the rear, and Timbo and Jack and four other
men, well-armed, on foot. We moved on slowly; for neither
we, our horses, nor cattle were capable of much exertion. Every
now and then Stanley halted and faced round to ascertain
whether we were pursued; but some hours passed by, and we
began to hope that the enemy had retreated before we com-
menced our march, or had not ventured to follow us. We
knew well, however, that if the blacks did pursue us, they
would come on stealthily, so that we should have but a short
time to prepare for their reception. Leo and Natty were per-

suaded to remain in the waggon with their guns loaded, ready
to do battle for Kate and Bella; while Donald had put arms
into the hands of the most trustworthy of his men, who pro-
mised to fight bravely should we be attacked. However, he
confessed that he had no confidence in their valour. After
riding for some time at a distance from the waggon we once
more joined them, hoping that we should be able to proceed
without molestation.
I was very thankful when the sun rose; and though his
beams were likely to be somewhat hot, they greatly cheered
our spirits. I was on the point, at Stanley's request, of riding
on to ask Donald Fraser when he proposed to camp, when,
looking round, I saw away to the north, on the summit of an
elevation we had passed over, a dark line moving towards us.
I pointed it out to Stanley.
"It is the blacks! There can be no doubt about that,"
he answered. "We must be prepared for them. I did not
suppose they would have ventured so far in pursuit."
A short way ahead was a clump of trees. Galloping on, I
told Donald what we had seen; and we now pushed forward as
fast as the oxen could move towards the trees. The instant
we arrived all hands set to work to prepare the best means of
defence in our power. There was room among the stems of
the trees for the waggons and cattle. We consequently placed
them inside the clump, and several smaller trees were cut down
with great rapidity to form a barricade. Our fortification was
far less complete than the one we had quitted, but still it was
more prudent to encounter the enemy within it than on the
open ground. We were still working away to complete it,
when the black army arrived almost within reach of our rifles.
They had not forgotten their effects on a former occasion, and
now, halting, appeared about to carry out their previous tactics.
I saw that even Stanley looked very grave; for it became

555
evident that unless we could put them to flight, we should
have to yield or 'starve. They had given us proof of their
courage, and shown that even should we attack them on horse-
back, before we could reach them they might salute us with a
flight of poisoned arrows, and kill us and our steeds. Senhor
Silva and David therefore entreated Stanley not to leave the
shelter of the wood, but to endeavour to keep our assailants at
a distance with our firearms, and let them learn that their
coreted prize might be bought at too high a price.
The blacks were now seen spreading out, with the evident
intention of completely surrounding us. As we had only a
dozen firearms, including those of Leo and Natty, we could place
only three men on each side—a small number to keep so
numerous a host at bay. In a short time we were completely
beset, and the blacks began to close in on us. It would have
been a serious matter even had there been only men in the
party, but with the two young ladies to protect, our anxieties
were greatly increased. Kate and Bella, who had been placed
as before in the centre of our hastily-formed camp, showed,
however, no sign of fear.
"I say, Andrew, we must drive these fellows off, and have
done with them," said Leo. "You will see how Natty and
I will fight!"
· I was sure from his determined look that he would be as
good as his word, and that Natty would not be less courageous,
though he made no remark. Stanley had given orders that
not a shot was to be fired till he issued the word of command.
We were standing in expectation of receiving it, when Timbo
shouted out, " See ! see! some horsemen come dis way !" We
looked towards the west-the direction in which he pointed-
where, under a cloud of dust, a herd of buffaloes were seen
scampering across the plain, with several horsemen in close
pursuit. On they came directly towards our black enemies,

HOW THE SIEGE WAS RAISED.
who did not perceive them till they were within a distance of
four or five hundred yards. The herd of buffaloes dashed
madly forward into the very midst of the blacks, whom they
scattered in every direction. Numbers were knocked over.
The rest, taken by surprise, attempted to escape by flight.
Instantly Stanley threw himself upon his horse and galloped
forward, shouting to the hunters. The buffaloes meantime
continued their charge wherever they saw the negroes as-
sembled, and in a few minutes swept half round the circle,
raising the siege in the most effectual manner. Stanley's
shouts soon attracted the attention of the hunters. A few
words from him explained the state of affairs,' and to-
gether they charged towards the remainder of the black army,
who had hitherto stood their ground. The latter, without
even stopping to draw their bows, took to flight towards the
north, still followed, in the most extraordinary manner, by the
buffaloes, who rushed in and out among them, urged on by the
shouts and cries of the hunters in the rear. In a few minutes
not a black was to be seen, except those who had been knocked
over by the infuriated animals. All this time the only shots
fired had been at the buffaloes, three of whom lay dead on the
ground. At length the herd, after pursuing the blacks for a
considerable distance, turned off to the east, leaving us pos-
sessors of the field.
As we were hurrying out to welcome the strangers, we saw
Stanley warmly shaking hands with them, when what was my
surprise as they rode up to recognize the Messrs. Rowley and
Terence O'Brien !
"We will tell you all about it," said the latter, as we warmly
shook hands. "But don't you know him?" and he pointed
to the fourth horseman.
I could scarcely believe my eyes, when my friend, the
worthy first mate of the Osprey-whom I thought had long

been numbered with the dead-jumped off his steed and took
me by the hand.
"I have not a very long yarn to spin," he said, "though
it is a somewhat wonderful one. When I was washed off
the deck, I found near me a topmast, which had probably
been carried away and cut adrift from some craft ahead
of us, I clung on to it, and was picked up a day or two
afterwards by a vessel which had to touch at Walfish Bay
on her way to the Cape. Finding a party settled there on
& whaling speculation, I agreed to remain. However, after
some time, as few whales were to be caught, I determined to
go on to the Cape. Just as I was about to sail, I received an
invitation from a gentleman-Mr. Ramsay—about to start into
the interior on a hunting and trading expedition, to accom-
pany him as an assistant. The life he proposed to lead was a
new one to me; but I had had enough of salt water, and after
a little consideration accepted it. Who should arrive directly
afterwards but our friends here, who, after having been cast on
shore and gone through all sorts of adventures as they travelled
down the coast from the north, had at length reached Walfish
Bay. But they will give you an account of themselves. Do
not ask, though, about their poor sister," he whispered. "She
is gone! Died soon after they landed; and that wretched
fellow Kydd, he was washed off the raft in passing through
the surf. These three young men alone remained, with scarce
a rag on their backs, and not a sixpence in the world. They
were therefore very glad to accept the offer made to them by
my friend, to assist him in shooting elephants, and rhino-
ceroses, and other game. From what I have seen of them,
they are better suited to that sort of work than the steady
business of a colonist. We have now been out six months,
and are on the point of turning westward; indeed, had the
buffaloes not led us in this direction, we should not have come

ADVENTURES OF OUR SHIPMATES.
further to the east. The prospect of the desert is not over-
inviting, and for my part, I have had enough of hunting. I
have run a narrow chance of being killed a score of times by
lions and elephants, not to speak of rhinoceroses and buffaloes,
hyenas and snakes, and I do not know what other creatures.
When my engagement is over, I have made up my mind not
to accept another of the same sort, but to stick to the sea as
long as I am fit for work, or till I can save enough to enable
me to settle down in a snug cottage in old England."
After the hint I had received from my friend Gritton, I fore-
bore to make too minute inquiries of the Rowleys as to their
adventures. Terence O'Brien, however, gave me most of the
particulars. They had undergone a fearful amount of suffering
even before they were cast ashore, and a still greater amount
afterwards. It is surprising, indeed, that poor Miss Rowley
should have survived so long on the raft; and we all, indeed,
had cause to be thankful that we had been preserved from
similar sufferings.
As soon as part of the buffalo flesh had been divided among
our half-famished party, and had been cooked and eaten, we
inspanned and pushed on to join Mr. Ramsay's caravan.
Though there was little chance of our being pursued by the
hostile natives, I was very thankful when at length the fires
of his camp appeared in sight. Terence O'Brien had gal-
loped on to announce our coming, and he now came up with
loud whoops and cries, followed by most of his party, from
whom we received the warmest welcome. We had still, how-
ever, a long journey before us; but the road was known,
the fountains were within moderate distances of each other,
and the natives were friendly. Mr. Ramsay had been successful
both in hunting and trading, and the large piles of huge ele-
phant and hippopotamus tusks, lion and panther skins, and other
articles, rather excited Donald Fraser's envy. "However," he

ON BOARD THE "FLYING FISH."

observed to me, as he looked at his fellow-trader's well-filled
waggons, "I have had the satisfaction of rescuing you and
your friends, Mr. Crawford, out of as dangerous a position as
travellers in Africa can well be placed in, and I have no reason
to complain of the liberality of your generous friend, Senhor
Silva."
We at length reached Walfish Bay, where we found a vessel,
the Flying Fish, just on the point of sailing for the Cape.
The Rowleys and Terence O'Brien were, however, so ena-
moured of their hunting life, that they determined to start off
into the wilds again on their own account. Our kind, noble-
minded, and generous friend, Senhor Silva, here bade us good-
bye, intending to wait for a vessel which was expected to call in
on her way to St. Paul de Loando. He shook my hand warmly.
"I am a widower, as you know, and I had a hope, I con-
fess, which I must not speak of, for I see that it is vain," he
said. "You will think of me, and so will your sweet cousin,
I trust, sometimes; and I shall be truly glad to hear of your
happiness."
We all embarked on board the Flying Fish, hoping at
length, after all our adventures, to reach our destination in
safety. I had made up my mind to settle on shore, and assist
my cousins in cultivating their farm. Perhaps my cousin
Kate had something to do with my resolution. At all events,
when I proposed it she appeared very well pleased.
Leo, when he heard of it, exclaimed, "Oh, how delightful!
because then, Andrew, you will not carry Natty away, as I
was afraid you might have done; and he and I can manage to
get on so capitally together. We have formed all sorts of
plans already, and I only hope that you may marry Kate, and
he, by-and-by, can marry Bella; and then we shall all be
brothers, and live happily together to the end of our days,'
as the story books say."

CONCLUSION.
Though our voyage was a pleasant one, I was very thankful
when at length the lofty height of Table Mountain appeared
ahead, covered with its table-cloth, and we dropped our anchor
off Cape Town. We had still a long journey before us; bui
at length the anxiety which my uncle and aunt had been so
long suffering on account of the non-appearance of their chil-
dren was relieved by our safe arrival at their farm.
After a few days' rest, we all set to work on the specia
duties apportioned us. Kate did not neglect Bella's educa
tion, even though in the course of the following year she be
came the mistress of a house of her own, of which I was th
master. David settled down as the medical man of the di:
trict. Stanley, though he occasionally went out hunting, be
came a first-rate farmer, ably assisted by. Timbo, Chickango,
and Igubo and his two sons, who expressed no desire to return
to their part of Africa. Jack Handspike accompanied M.
Gritton to sea, but lately came back again, saying that he ha
had enough of it, and was determined henceforth to plough
the land instead of the ocean. I may say of myself and of all
my friends indeed, that "whatsoever our hands find to do,
we do it with all our might," humbly endeavouring to serve
God in our daily walk in life, and thereby enjoy that true
happiness which even in this world can be obtained by those
who know the right way to seek it.
