<p> The Rev. T. B. Wright, Native Pastor of the Faji Church, 
Lagos, writes:ï¿½</p><p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">
Two of our members have been removed by death this year: one, Phebe 
John, the wife of the late Mr. John, a Scripture reader at Ibadan; and 
the other is Daniel Tambariki, a very popular man here, as well as at 
Abeokuta. He is famous at Abeokuta for deeds of bravery in war. At 
Lagos he shall be long remembered by both the heathen and Mohammedan population of the town, who all got to be familiar with 
him, by his untiring anxiety to get them all, if possible, under the saving 
knowledge of God. He reckoned it a duty incumbent on him to be going 
from house to house (without being particularly asked), throughout the 
days of the week when his business would allow, and also on Sundays, in 
the mornings and afternoons before service hours, telling the people the 
great folly there is in remaining in heathenism, whilst God has sent a 
light to them to better their immortal souls; showing them they could 
not be as happy as he was, as no other religion in this life can make one 
happy as the Christian religion. He was a man, although austere in 
appearance, yet amicable in disposition, so that he was much beloved, and 
was deeply lamented by all, both heathen and Christian. He was an 
Egba, of Igbore tribe, and on embracing Christianity was so persecuted 
by his relatives, and the authorities of his tribe, that he escaped hither, 
and the Rev. C. A. Gollmer allowed him to reside in the Mission compound, where he was with his family for a long time. During this later 
years he was sorely afflicted in his family circle by the deaths of his wife 
and eldest son, which occurred one year after another, and he only outlived 
the last for a year.</p></div>
