							<p>Within the last eight months, six of our pupils from the
								<settlement>Philipton</settlement> day-school passed their examinations for the office of
								schoolmaster, and have been appointed to their several spheres of labour; and it is pleasing
								and encouraging to see the attitude that evince in imparting instruction, and the pleasure
								they take in communicating knowledge to their little countrymen.<space extent="1"
								unit="chars"/>The more I see of working the system of native agency, and of growing
								intelligence and devotedness of our young men, more confirmed I become in the police we must
								ultimately look for the great results of Missionary enterprise.<space extent="1"
								unit="chars"/>Whether we look at the system in point of economy, the constitutional
								qualifications of the natives to endure the influence of climate, their acquaintance
								[with<!-- Typo in original. MT --> the habits, customs, and language of their countrymen,
								facilities they possess of ingratiating themselves with the people; and consequently the
								ready access they can obtain their understandings and affections:&#8212;all these
								considerations seem to warrant the conviction we entertain of the success that would attend
								the establishment of a comprehensive and well organised system of native agency.<space
								extent="1" unit="chars"/>The appointment of native schoolmasters has had a suprisingly
								beneficial effect on the young men, and even on the school children; as many of them are
								thereby encouraged to hope that they may at some future time be enabled to fill the
								situation of teacher, or other office of respectability, and are consequentaly led to apply
								themselves more diligently to the improvement of their minds, in order to qualify themselves

								grammar.<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>After their appointment they are expected to pursue
								their studies by coming to <settlement>Philipton</settlement> once a week to receive such
								aid as we can give them; and I am glad to say that their improvement is very

							<p>A committee under this name has been appointed, whose duty it is to co-operate with the
