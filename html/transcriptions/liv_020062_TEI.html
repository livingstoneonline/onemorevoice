<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> was never paid, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">General Cathcart</span>, under
date December 13, demanded of that chief, within
three days, 10,000 head of cattle and 1,000 horses,
and, in default, threatened to take them himself or
make reprisals. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span> came into the camp the

fired on him and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Tylden</span>. An attempt at
parley by the Governor was answered by a shot,
when two rounds of shrapnel caused the enemy to
fly from the southern angle of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Berea</span> towards
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thaba Bossigo</span>. The despatch proceeds:—

</p>
<p class="p small ">"While in this position the enemy were collecting in
fresh patches of horsemen in all directions; those <span class="word">approaching</span>
within distance were driven back. On the clearing
away of a thunderstorm and rain the enemy suddenly <span class="word">displayed</span>
his whole force. Masses of horsemen were observed

with 1,500 head of cattle, which it was necessary to secure,
for which purpose some kraals in a commanding position
were ordered to be occupied. The enemy, who had now
mustered not less than 6,000 horsemen, made every effort to
assail the troops moving into their bivouac, repeating their
attacks on front and rear, but were repulsed by the troops.
The demi-battery, by a round of canister, silenced the
enemy's fire, which had been kept up till 8 p.m., when they
disappeared from the field, having suffered severely."

<p class="p small ">"Having reached the foot of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Berea mountains</span>, I <span class="word">observed</span>
the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Basutas</span> drawn up in considerable force. A herd
of cattle was presented in view, as if to entice us on, while
by their war shouts they evidently defied our arms. On
the right I detached the light company of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">73d</span>, under
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lieutenant Gawler</span>, with directions to climb the krantz
which commanded the enemy on that side, and, bringing
his right shoulders forward, to turn the left flank of the
enemy. I directed the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Hon. L. Curzon</span> to advance with
the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Rifle Brigade</span>, and ascend the mountain a little on the
left of the ligit company of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">73d</span>. I moved up <span class="word">simultaneously</span>
with the remainder of my force along the regular
but rugged path which seemed to lead into the centre of the
enemy's position. The enemy fired and attempted to <span class="word">oppose</span>
our progress until we reached the crest of the heights,
when they instantly dispersed. I pursued them with the
few mounted men under <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lieutenant Goodrich</span>, of the
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Cape Mounted Rifles</span>, and we succeeded in capturing
at least 30,000 head of cattle, with many horses
having saddles on them. The enemy sustained some
loss; 38 were killed, and several were found dead;
and so completely defeated did the enemy appear
that some were taken prisoners and made to drive back
their own cattle. We found it, however, quite impossible,
with so few mounted men, to drive on such large numbers,
and in the effort to do so many thousand were driven by the
few mounted <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Fingoes</span> attached to my division down the
opposite side of the mountain to that which my instructions
required me to take. I was therefore obliged to abandon
them and content myself with some 1,500. About 1 o'clock
p.m. from 200 to 300 mounted men, with white caps and
lances (which caused us to mistake them for his Excellency's
escort), suddenly appeared in our front. Before the <span class="word">mistake</span>
could be discovered two or three of our party fell into
their hands, and I deeply regret to state that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain
Faunce</span>, <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">73d Regiment</span>, Deputy-Adjutant <span class="word">Quarter
master</span>-General, was of that number. The enemy's
force now rapidly increased, until we were opposed
to at least 700 or 800 mounted men, who drew up in line
in admirable order, and attempted to attack our front and
left flank. As it was necessary to present a front, in order
to protect our cattle and baggage, I formed three companies
in skirmishing order, two in front and one thrown back on
our left, keeping one in close order in support. The enemy
charged up to us several times within 200 or 300 yards, but,
daunted by the coolness and steadiness of the men lying
down to receive them, dared not to approach nearer. As
my instruction required me to proceed to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thaba Bossihgo</span>, I
directed the cattle to be driven down a path on my right,
intending to follow with the remainder of my force. No
sooner was this discerned by the enemy, than he cheered and
charged us, on which we halted and reformed in skirmishing
order, and again repelled him. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain the Hon. G. Devereux</span>
at the same time made some good shots with the rockets,
and the result was the total disappearance of the enemy."
</p>
<p class="p "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Lieutenant-Colonel G. Napier</span> states his force to
have been—<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">12th Lancers</span>, 114 rank and file, under

under <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Major Somerset</span>, and says, "Having <span class="word">collected</span>
a great number of cattle I commenced
driving them down the north-east side of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Berea
mountains</span>; when half way down, 700 mounted men
attacked the rear, who retired. On the open
ground the Lancers charged, and the enemy fled.
Near the drift, on the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Caledon</span>, a large body of
mounted <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffres</span> were repulsed by the Minie rifles of
the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">74th Highlanders</span>, under <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Bruce</span>."
</p>
<p class="p ">In this contest, begun early in the morning of the
20th of December, and not closed until 8 p.m.,
6,000 mounted <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffres</span> are said to have been <span class="word">engaged</span>.
At the close <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Colonel Eyre</span> had secured
1,500 and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Colonel Napier</span> 3,000 head of cattle.
</p>
<p class="p ">The casualties on the part of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">British</span> were
very severe. Killed—<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Faunce</span>, <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">73d</span>, and
2 privates; <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">12th Lancers</span>, 4 non-commissioned officers

38; wounded, 15.
</p>
<p class="p ">This great sacrifice seems, however, to have
secured the submission of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moshesh</span>, who, the next
day, the 21st of December, sent to the camp the
following letter:—

never breaks his word, otherwise the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span> would not have
sent me here. I have taken the fine by force, and I am
satisfied.
</p>
<p class="p small ">"I am not angry with your people for fighting in defence
of their property; for those who fought—and fought well—
were not all of them thieves, and I am sorry that many
were killed. This is your fault; for if you had paid the
fine, it would not have happened. I now desire not to <span class="word">consider</span>
you, Chief, as an enemy of the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span>, but I must
proclaim martial law in the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Sovereignty</span>, to give to <span class="word">commandants</span>
and fieldcornets power to make commandos in a
regular manner, and, with the consent of the Resident,
enter your country in search of plundered horses and cattle
that may be stolen after this time. And I expect you to
assist them; for though you are a great chief, it seems that
you either do not, or cannot, keep your own people from
stealing; and among the cattle you sent as part of your
fine there were three oxen the property of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Bain</span>, of
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bloem Fontein</span>, stolen since I crossed the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Caledon River</span>.
Now, therefore, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief Moshesh</span>, I consider your past <span class="word">obligations</span>
fulflled, and hope that you will take measures for
preventing such abuses in future. In the meantime, as the
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Queen</span>'s representative, I subscribe myself
</p>
<p class="p small right ">"Your friend,<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p small ">"P.S.—Chief, I shall be glad to see either yourself or
your sons, in the same friendly manner and in the same
good faith as before the fight, at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Platberg</span>, <span class="word">tomorrow</span>
or next day, but I shall now send away the army, and go back
to the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">colony</span> in a few days' time.<span class="seg right ">"G. C."<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</p>
<p class="p small ">"Whereas the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chief Moshesh</span>, as the result of the battle
of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Berea</span>, has made full and humble submission, and sued
for peace, which has been granted.
</p>
<p class="p small ">"And whereas, although the said chief has evinced his
desire to preserve the good understanding and amity with
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Her Majesty's Government</span>, now happily restored, by <span class="word">promising</span>
to do all in his power to keep his people in order, it
is scarcely to be expected that he will be able so to restrain
their lawless practices as to entirely prevent cattle stealing
for the future.
</p>
<p class="p small ">"And whereas, in my last reply to the said Chief, I <span class="word">expressed</span>
my intention of proclaiming martial law, in order to
restore to the burghers the full powers of making <span class="word">commandos,</span>
which seem to have fallen into disuse; and whereas,
upon further consideration, I have reason to believe that
the course of proclaiming martial law might be <span class="word">misinterpreted</span>
and misunderstood, and tend to unnecessary irritation,
excitement, and alarm, and that the object I have in view
can be attained without proclaiming martial law as <span class="word">aforesaid</span>;
now, therefore, I do hereby, by virtue of all the
powers vested in me, provisionally and until sufficient legal
enactment may be framed with the same intent, order, <span class="word">command</span>,
and direct all civil commissioners, commandants, and
fieldcornets within the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Orange River</span> Territory</span>, to be ready
to organise their burghers for the purposes of self defence,
and for the protection, security, and recovery of their <span class="word">property</span>
in case of need.
