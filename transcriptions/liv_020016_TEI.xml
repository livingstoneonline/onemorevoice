<p><persName><hi rend="smallcaps">Apolo Kagwa</hi></persName>, Katikiro of <country>Uganda</country>, and his Secretary, <persName>Ham Mukasa</persName>, were among <persName>King Edward</persName>'s guests at the Coronation. <country>Uganda</country>, where <term type="animal">elephants</term> are still numerous and the <term type="plant">banana</term> grows in wild profusion, is under the administration of a <term type="collective">British</term> Commissioner. But it has its native King, and the Katikiro is his Chief Minister, being, at once, a sort of Premier and Chief Justice, the maker of laws and the righter of wrongs.</p>

<p>These ebony-skinned visitors from <region>Central <bloc>Africa</bloc></region> won the esteem and regard of all who were brought into relations with them by their intelligence and alertness, the keen interest they displayed in the wonders of civilisation, their agreeable ways, and, above all, the contagious glint of their smiles. The Katikiro was the taller of the two, being a couple of inches over six feet, and well built in proportion. He became a <term type="collective">Christian</term> at an early age, and to him, mainly, is due the progress of <country>Uganda</country> from a barbarous and unruly to an orderly and industrious community.</p>

<p>He was asked what were his impressions of <country>England</country>. "First," he replied, "that you have no <term type="insect">mosquitoes</term>; second, that your roads are all good, and that you have many <term type="animal">horses</term> and carriages; thirdly, that your houses are large and well built; fourthly, that you live together in great crowds; and lastly, that you have a splendid <orgName>police force</orgName><!-- Not sure if this gets term or orgName, or not a tag at all? HB --><!-- orgName if anything, so I've put that in, but it could also go without anything since it's not a "formally-named group" in this instance. AW -->, which prevents fighting in the streets, and keeps order even when many have gathered together."</p>
