  <h5 style="text-align:center;">NEW-ZEALAND CHIEFS IN COMMITTEE DRAWING UP A
    REPLY TO THE SOCIETY'S JUBILEE LETTER</h5>
  <p>C<small>HRISTMAS-DAY</small> is Midsummer in New Zealand. At that season
    numbers of Native Christians of different tribes&#8212;men who had once
    fought with each other and contended as enemies in deadly strife&#8212;meet
    at Wanganui, the Station of the Rev. R. Taylor, from different
    parts of his immense district, to unite in prayer and praise, and
    benefit by the instruction of their Minister. The last Christmas
    Meeting of which we have received an account, that of 1849,
    was numerously attended, and deeply interesting. In that year
    Christmas-day fell on Tuesday. On the previous Sunday, the 23d,
    the Congregation was so large, that, the Church was not being capable
    of containing it, the pulpit was carried into an adjoining field.
    The day was fine, and the congregation attentive; Mr. Taylor,
    in his sermon, remarking that the present assembly proved the
    power of God: no earthly cause would have brought so many
    tribes together: God's word had done it. After the Service, the
    Sacrament was administered to 295 individuals, and a collection
    made, amounting to <em>2l</em>. <em>13s</em>.</p>
  <p>The 24th as a lovely morning, most suitable for the purpose for
    which it was intended&#8212;a Missionary Meeting; to those who
    possess the spirit of Christian Missions, and know their value, a
    delightful and animating occasion. At five <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>/ Morning Service
    was held, and after breakfast about 2000 Christian Native assembled
    in the open air, in God's own temple&#8212;for "the Lord by wisdom
    hath founded the earth; by understanding hath He established the
    heavens"&#8212;the pavement carpetted with the grass which He makes
    to grow, and the clear blue sky of New Zealand extended as a
    canopy over their heads. The proceedings commenced with singing
    the hymn in Maori,</p>
  <p style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;text-align:center;">"Salvation! oh, the joyful
    sound!<br />
    What pleasure to our ears!"</p>
  <p>Mr. Taylor says&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;">I then opened the Meeting by stating that a Letter
    had been addressed
    by the Church Missionary Society to them, in common with the
    rest of their countrymen who had embraced the Gospel through the
    instrumentality of the Society; that a similar one had been sent to all
    parts of the world where they were labouring to spread the Gospel, and
    that now they were assembled to hear the Letter read; that it was filled
    with love to them; that the Society style themselves elder brethren,
    but, for my part, I thought they were rather entitled to the name of
    fathers, as they had begotten them to be a new people in Christ Jesus;
    that very large Meetings had been held in England to spread the
    Gospel throughout the world; and that they had sent this Letter of love
    to confirm their faith, and interest their hearts in the same glorious
    cause. But, to explain more fully the object of the Letter, I had also
    written an introductory one, which we had got printed, together with
    that of the Society, which should now be read to them. I then called on
    Mr. Baker to read the introductory Letter, and that of the Society.</p>
  <p>Several Resolutions were then moved and seconded, in suitable
    speeches, by Native Chiefs and Catechists. The first was by
    Tamehana Te Rauparaha, the son of the warrior and cannibal
    Rauparaha, who in his day slew multitudes of his countrymen.
    This is his speech&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;">Listen to these words. You have just heard the Letter
    of the Church
    Missionary Society read to you, and you see that we ought to be united
    in spirit and love towards them, as they are towards us. To do this we
    must write them a Letter. We have seen and felt the power of the
    Gospel, for all our old customs have been given up through its instrumentality.
    Now we have begun a new work let us not go back, but
    strive to go forward. Some have foolishly tried to continue their evil
    ways, but have found they can do so no longer. The Missionaries first
    drew our feet out of the mire, and placed us on a firm foundation. We
    are now called upon to thank the Church Missionary Society for our
    Ministers. They are a peculiar blessing to us: they are but few in
    number, and therefore ought to be more highly prized. For, whilst
    we can at all times get plenty of merchants and settlers to come amongst
    us, who only come for their own interest, we cannot so easily obtain
    Missionaries. I feel much for our Ministers, for they have to contend
    with Europeans as well as Maori, and have truly the care of all the
    Churches upon them. It is to them alone we owe our present state of
    civilization; and now we are called upon to show that we are aware of
    our obligations to the Church Missionary Society.</p>
  <p>Another speech, made by Matini Wiwi, was as follows&#8212;</p>
  <p style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;">Are there not many still amongst us who were once
    strongly attached
    to all our old customs, and the superstitions of our forefathers? Let me
    ask them, what was it that made you forsake those ancient customs?
    My friends, it was the Word of God, which sunk deep into your hearts.
    We did not lay them aside as a man does an old garment when it is no
    longer fit to wear. No! but because it opened our eyes to see the folly
    of them. St. Paul truly says, that though our bodies may be separated
    according to the flesh, still the spirits may be near. This is the case with
    the Members of the Church Missionary Society. We do not know them
    personally, nor the place where they live; but we know them in our
    hearts as our sincere friends, and the remembrance of what they have
    done for our welfare will always claim our love.</p>
