  <h5 style="text-align:center;">THE REV. IMADUDD—N, OF UMRITSUR.</h5>
  <p>I left everybody, and went out into the jungles, and became a fakir,
    putting on clothes covered with red ochre, and wandered here and there,
    from city to city, and from village to village, step by step, alone, for about
    2,500 miles, without plan or baggage. In this state I entered the city of
    Karuli, where a stream called Cholida flows beneath a mountain, and
    there I stayed to perform the "Hisbul bahar," according to the following
    rules:—The celebrant must first perform his ablutions on the bank of a
    flowing stream, and, wearing an unsewn dress, must sit in a particular
    manner on one knee for twelve days, and repeat the prayer called "Jugopar" thirty times every
    day with a loud voice. He must not eat any food
    with salt, or anything at all except some barley bread, of flour lawfully
    earned, which he has made with his own hands, and baked with wood
    that he has brought himself from the jungles. During the day he must
    fast entirely, after performing his ablutions in the river before daylight;
    and he must remain barefooted, wearing no shoes; nor must he touch any
    man, nor, except at an appointed time, even speak to any one. The
    object of it all is that he may meet with God, and from the longing desire
    to attain this, I underwent all this pain. In addition to the above,
    I wrote the name of God on paper during this time 125,000 times, and I
    cut out each word separately with scissors, and wrapped them up each in
    a little ball of flour, and fed the fishes of the river with them, as my book
    on the practice of devotion prescribed.</p>
