<p class="p noindent "><span class="small caps ">A brief</span> but gratifying account of the state of
the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Mission church schools in the Kat River settlement</span> was inserted in&nbsp;the
<span class="italic "><em>Missionary Magazine</em></span> for December last, at
which time we had also the satisfaction to communicate the return to the station
of the
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Rev. James Read, sen.</span>, together with the turly pleasing circumstance
under which he had recommenced his labours.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since that period
we have received a further report of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Mission</span> from the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Rev.

<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em>Examination of the Children.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">Since my return from <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> the number of schools has been increased
to 17; in which are daily taught, 400 pupils, whose progress is very encouraging
to us, and
credible to the young native teachers who have the charge of them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The course of instruction comprehends reading, (English and Dutch,) writing,
arithmetic, geography, scripture history, and elements of the use of the globe.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>During the past year we have had several most interesting
examinations, which excite great interest among both parents and children.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Besides our monthly examinations of individual schools, we have had an annual
and general examination of all the schools; and, as these are widely scattered,
we
invariably take 3 days to accomplish this eating cutie.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
children have to bring their provisions and bedding with them.
</p>
<p class="p ">At our last annual examination we were honoured by the presence of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Capt.
Stretch</span>, diplomatic agent in <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Caffreland</span>, as our chairman.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This gentleman feels deeply interested in the education of the
rising generation among the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We had about 1000 pupils present.

<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Juvenile Missionary Society</span>.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">After the examination was over, and the prices had been distributed, we had a most
interesting meeting of the children in the evening for the purpose of forming
a
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Juvenile Missionary Society</span>; speeches were delivered by the
schoolmasters,, and letters received from some of our young friends in
<span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> were read to the young people of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Kat
River</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was, indeed, a most gratifying little
meeting; and we hope it has served to interest our children in welfare of
their neighbours
the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffres</span> and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Tambookies</span>, whose still unenlightened state was very impressively contrasted with

upon their minds the necessity of eary associating in their feelings the spread

<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em>Names of Stations and Teachers.</em></h4>

<br>
<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em>Appointment of Schoolmasters.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">Within the last eight months, six of our pupils from the
<span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Philipton</span> day-school passed their examinations for the office of
schoolmaster, and have been appointed to their several spheres of labour;
and it is pleasing
and encouraging to see the attitude that evince in imparting instruction,
and the pleasure
they take in communicating knowledge to their little countrymen.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The more I see of working the system of native agency, and of growing
intelligence and devotedness of our young men, more confirmed I become in
the police we must
ultimately look for the great results of Missionary enterprise.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether we look at the system in point of economy, the constitutional
qualifications of the natives to endure the influence of climate, their acquaintance
[with the habits, customs, and language of their countrymen,
facilities they possess of ingratiating themselves with the people; and consequently
the
ready access they can obtain their understandings and affections:—all these
considerations seem to warrant the conviction we entertain of the success
that would attend
the establishment of a comprehensive and well organised system of native agency.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appointment of native schoolmasters has had a suprisingly
beneficial effect on the young men, and even on the school children; as many
of them are
thereby encouraged to hope that they may at some future time be enabled to
fill the
situation of teacher, or other office of respectability, and are consequentaly
led to apply
themselves more diligently to the improvement of their minds, in order to
qualify themselves
to undertake it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="div ">
<br>
<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em>Education of Schoolmasters.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">Previous to appointment the schoolmasters go through the following course :—English
reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Roman</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> history, use of the globes, natural history, and English
grammar.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After their appointment they are expected to pursue
their studies by coming to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Philipton</span> once a week to receive such
aid as we can give them; and I am glad to say that their improvement is very
encouraging.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The books the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Society</span> sent us
have been particularly serviceable in promoting our object.
</p>
</div>
<div class="div ">
<br>
<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em>Building of School-rooms.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">Since my return from <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, three new school-rooms have been built,
and fourth is building, and all the people's own expense, except the furnishing
them with
seats, &amp;c.
</p>
</div>
<div class="div ">
<br>
<h4 class="head subheading center italic "><em><span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Local School Committee</span>.</em></h4>
<p class="p ">A committee under this name has been appointed, whose duty it is to co-operate with
the
Missionaries in extending the work of education in the Settlement, and watching
over the
instruction of the children.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have found it advisable to
invite some of the most intelligent and respectable of our young men to become
members of
the committee.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No sooner was the proposal made to them, that
they came forward to join it.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their principal work, as I have
said, is to assist the Missionary in founding new schools, to see after the
conduct of the
schoolmasters, to take care that the people contribute regularly towards their
support and
to oversee the building of school-rooms, &amp;c.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the first
place, but the appointment of such a committee, the people become interested
in, and
qualified for, the management of their own affairs, so as gradually to carry
on the
education of their own children, without looking ofr assistance to the parent
<span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Society</span>; and, secondly, it supplies a stimulant to the exertion in our
schools. There is nothing like giving men a voice in the management of their
own
institutions.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: It">it</u>
seldom fails to produce good effects.
</p>
<p class="p ">Besides superintending the schools, I take my regular turn in preaching and itinerating
among the people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To this I add superintendence, in part, of
the two recently established settlements of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Blinkwater</span> and
<span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Fish River</span></span>; both of which I am happy to say
are doing well under the care of our two native teachers, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dirk Hather</span>,
and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Andreis Jagers</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On my last visit to
the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity."><span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Fish River</span></span>,I was truly gratified to see
the activity and devotedness of the native teacher to the

<div class="div ">
<p class="p noindent ">concerns of the people, both spiritual and
temporal.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I would conclude by desiring the continuance of an
interest in the prayers of the Directors, and our other <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Christian</span> friends in <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, that the Lord would grant unto us
greater grace, more devotedness to the work to which we trust he has called
us, and make us
faithful unto death.
