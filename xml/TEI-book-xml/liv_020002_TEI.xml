<!-- In theroy, this document has a lot of errors in it that normally we would code with sic/corr. However, it's clear that in this instance, the original c19 editors deliberately left the language as is, in order to capture Osman's voice. Close reading of the errors shows, indeed, that there is a specific pattern of which words are misspelled and that such mispelling is confined on the whole to only a few words that repeat over and over. As a result, we've deviated from usual practice by using orig/reg for such errors (to faciliate searching) rather than sic/corr, which would have been to pedantic and against the spirit of what's going on in this text. Only in a few cases, where there is an obvious typographical error, we have used sic/corr. AW -->
