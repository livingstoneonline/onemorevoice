<h5 style="text-align: center">Sick and Dying Christians in Yoruba [excerpt]</h5>
<p>The Rev. Samuel Pearce, Native Pastor at Badagry, gives two cases, the former of which is one of exceptional interest:�</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">The year which I now hold in review opened upon us with sore trials. 
The Lord was most graciously pleased to beckon home to the heavenly 
rest two of His dear children from our midst.</p><p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">
1. Maria Ekidan, a most zealous and devoted sister, left us rather 
abruptly for the world above, as if saying still to us, "Thus a Christian 
ought to live, and thus to die." She was an Egba, converted by the 
ministry of the late Rev. Thomas King, at Abeokuta. It was her zeal 
for the glory of God, and her love for souls, which made her a resident of 
this place. She came here some time before the outbreak in Abokuta, 
of 1867, and though she paid two or three visits to her relations in that 
place, yet she returned again as if to spend her remaining life here. 
She had often signified to me how strongly the incredulity of Badagry 
resembled hers in her heathen state, and that nothing short of infinite 
mercy could save her; that as a heathen she was so much bigoted and 
fierce, that nobody dared to speak a word to her about God, and that she 
did much to hurt the cause of God, hated and persecuted all who aban-
doned their idols and became Christians. Therefore, after her conversation, 
she exclusively appropriated the term "Elese" to her christian name, 
Maria, and thus was commonly known as "Maria Elese," <em>i.e.</em>, Maria the 
sinner, and as an object of mercy she was also called "Omo Alanu," <em>i.e.</em>, 
a child of the merciful, which latter name she applied to all Christians. 
She lived with us here as a petty trader, and was a blessed example to our 
little flock of how to "be diligent in business, serving the Lord." We 
were always indebted to her for wise counsels in adjusting cases that may 
arise among the converts. She was a staunch reprover of sin wherever it 
was found, and a great lover of truth and holiness, and had ample opportunity by her vocation of testifying of the love of God in Christ, to all 
classes in the streets of Badagry, and as if this was her sole object, wilst 
she travelled about to sell, she went from house to house, so that in the 
heart and outskirts of the town she was known not so much as a trader, 
as "Mammy Oniwasu," <em>i.e.</em>, mammy the preacher, so intent was she on 
her Master's work. She did preach to all, rich and poor, old and young, 
male and female, heathens and Mohammedans. She was ripe for glory, 
and as an especial honour conferred on her, it was remarkable how 
silently but triumphantly she passed through death. On a Friday night 
she turned in complaining of earache. She was missed at early prayers 
next morning, quite an unusual thing, and when we felt it our duty to 
force open her door and awake her, she was quite unconscious of all we 
said or did; but every time we disturbed her, she would bow and kneel in 
a praying posture, and then quietly lay down to sleep again, and thus she 
never spoke one word more to man, as if she was ordered to be silent after 
having spoken so much during her lifetime. On Sunday night, November 
16th, 1873, which was the third day of her illness, she breathed her last. 
Her remains were interred in the Christian burial ground, in the afternoon of the following day, in the midst of bitter lamentations from 
a concourse of people, who were either Christians, Mohammedans, or 
heathens. After her burial, I learnt that she had left two hens in chare 
of one of her god-daughters, with instructions to rear them up for God, 
and the proceeds to go to the repairs of the house of God.</p><p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">
2. On the 7th May also our ranks became thinner by the removal from 
this scene of troubles of our dear Eliza Afresi, the old Popo convert. 
For some four or five months before this event she became quite disabled 
by weakness, and subsequently was blind from extreme age. All her 
heathen relations had forsaken her, because she could not have been so 
old as to survive her generation unless she was a witch. And since she 
embraced Christianity she became more hateful to them�to that extent 
that many of the Popo fetish devotees would not meet her by the way 
without spitting at her. During her confinement in a room, Paul Akibode, 
her landlord, with his wife and household, took the greatest possible care 
of her, and never suffered her to want. I particularly observed this personally, with heartfelt gratitude to God. I visited her often, and found 
her very patient in her confinement. Once she said, "I am not alone, my 
Saviour is with me, and always sits by me when nobody is in the room." On 
another occasion she assured me, "I live by prayer; it strengthens me as 
food is to the body." Though so old, yet her reason was not impaired almost 
to the last. Two days before her death, Paul Akibode informed me that she 
sang out joyously, "My eyes are open! my eyes are open!" and was in 
a state of ecstacy to the last, calling our late sister loudly and repeatedly, 
as if she saw her. On the following day she was heard singing loudly, 
"Olugbala, Juo il obba mimosti," <em>i.e.</em>, "O Saviour, Thou are the holy 
King, &c.," a song of praise composed by the late Maria Ekidan. I met 
her singing it on the morning before her death, with a rather fainting 
voice. But before my return the next morning her enraptured spirit 
had taken its flight.</p>
