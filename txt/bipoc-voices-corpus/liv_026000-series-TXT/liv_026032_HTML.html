<p>Then follows the narrative, describing the address of Devenderan,
with Vishnu's reply, in which he promises to appear on 
earth as "Vasanta Rayar." He is accordingly born on the tenth 
day of the tenth month in the year 1850, in Gowdama, on the 
Godaveri, north-east of Cashmere. In due course he is instructed
by the holy sages of Mount Meru, and their utterances 
regarding him are recorded as oracles. Various kinds of deaths 
and ailments befalling the opponents are mentioned as precursors 
of the great event of Vasanta Rayar's reign. Thus:�</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">"By the treachery of friends and assaults of open foes some will fall. 
By atrocities of various kinds will the goddess Kali destroy some. By the
volcanic action of Mount Keilasam some will die. The idols in the Siva
and Vishnu temples will rise up and dance, and this sight will kill some.
Infants and old men will fall from mountain tops and die. Foxes, 
kites, and owls will howl and screech day and night unceasingly. 
Four stars will appear in the sky in open day, and a fearful sound be 
heard in the heavens. Creatures that live in water will cry out, 'We have 
got on land, we have got on land,' and making straight for Mount Keilasam,
and entering Veera Malaram Temple, will stay there eight days, and 
then vanish. In the Temple of Kumara Sami, the door will be shut seven 
days, and in consequence a furious wind will blow, and destroy many 
people. Demons, tigers, and wild beasts will injure multitudes, and blood 
suffuse all eyes. At time of new moon, full moon will rise. At dead of 
night the sun will rise. Blood will fall as rain. The goddess of fortune 
will weep. The ocean and rivers will rage. The goddess Terra will salute 
and acknowledge Vasanta Rayar as supreme lord. Then charities and 
virtues will flourish as of old. People of every caste will rejoice. Rain 
will pour three times every month. Crops of grain will grow profusely. 
Gifts and charities be everywhere abundant. Brahmins, Chattriyas, Visyas, 
and Sudras will be prosperous, performing their respective duties."</p>
<p>Then follow promises to those who promote the matter:�</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">"Whoever believes what is herein mentioned, whoever performs poojah 
to this book, will have health, with long life, riches, possessions, and conveyances.
Whoever will not write, nor read, nor hear this book, but 
ridicule and revile it, will be annihilated, worms will breed in their 
mouth, and the furies will torment them."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">"We, the emissaries in this matter, were seized and brought before the 
vile fellows who hold the present reins of government. They put powder 
and shot in their guns and fired at us, when the two balls came and fell 
into our hands."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">"Therefore in the year Perabava (1867) Vasanta Rayar will come to 
reign, and that you who are virtuous may know this matter, we have 
written and sent this revelation to the several provinces. The virtuous 
and those who meditate on Siva, even if weak in the eyes, if they copy 
this book, and make poojah to it, will receive all that they wish for in 
their prayers. All who write, or read, or hear and worship this book, 
 whatever be their present age, will be prosperous till he, Vasanta Rayar, 
come. Pluto cannot approach nor afflict with his pangs any who laud this 
book. The gods prosper you."</p>
<p>Observing the excitement created on all sides by these proclamations,
I determined to meet it, and take advantage of it, by 
publishing a tract reviewing the documents, and setting forth 
Jesus Christ as the true Vasanta Rayar. This tract of forty 
pages became for the time exceedingly popular, not only in Tinnevelly,
but also in Travancore and Malabar, where a Malayalim 
translation of it was read with great avidity. It served not only 
to explode the current notions regarding the Hindu Messiah, but 
it was made useful under God's blessing to the conversion of 
several parties. One of the Basle missionaries wrote to me to 
say that he knew four persons who had been converted to 
Christianity by the perusal of this tract. It was styled:�</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>(Truth Victorious.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"GLORIOUS NEWS OF THE TRUE VASANTA RAYAR."</p>
<p>Within three months after the publication of the tract, the 
excitement regarding Vasanta Rayar ceased, and not long after 
the matter was completely ignored.</p>
