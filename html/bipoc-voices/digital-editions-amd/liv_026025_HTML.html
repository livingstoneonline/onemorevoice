<h3 id="h3-title" class="center">DESTRUCTIVE FIRE AT ABBEOKUTA.</h3>
<p class="noindent">A<span class="small">BBEOKUTA</span> is subject to frequent fires of a very destructive character.
The materials of the houses, their light and combustible
roofs, thatched with grass, help the fire to spread, and it extends
itself with wonderful rapidity, bidding defiance to the efforts of the
inhabitants. A fearful conflagration, attended not only by loss of
property, but of life, occurred in March last, of which our native
catechist, Mr. T. King, gives us the following <span style="white-space: nowrap;">description&#8212;</span></p>
<section class="small">
<p><em>March 15, 1853</em>&#8212;Of all the fires that have
occurred in this town,
that of to-day was the greatest. The rapidity that attended its progress,
and the destruction of lives and property it occasioned, has no equal
since the commencement of Abbeokuta, and may God in mercy never
permit the like to happen any more! That more than two-thirds
of the town was reduced to ashes, and that the number of houses consumed
on this occasion was not less than a thousand, is not the opinion of
certain individuals only, but is the general and concurrent assertion of
everybody. And to affirm that not fewer than sixty persons perished in
this calamity is no exaggeration whatever, besides many of whose recovery
there is little hope. The fire having begun at Toko, near the rock
Olumo, it consumed great part of that district and Ijemo, till it descended
the range of Olumo, making a clean sweep of all Iporo, Ilawo Ijeun,
Owu, Obba, Ika&#8212;in short, all the Gbagura, the densely-populated parts
of the town. This fearful accident commenced about eleven <span class="small">A</span>.<span class="small">M</span>.,
and
before three <span class="small">P</span>.<span class="small">M</span>. it had completed its horrible work. A very sharp
and
acute harmatan wind, which had been blowing about three days,
greatly facilitated the progress of the fire. At its commencement,
all our workmen and girls at Owu, and a great number of people that
came out of their houses, stood viewing it in great anxiety of mind, hoping
and praying it might not descend to the other side of the rocks, as all were
fully convinced that, should that be the case, the calamity would be very
appalling, and such at last it proved to be. Immediately when the fire
was seen on the other side of the rocks, all of us instantly quitted the
spot in confused dispersion, running homeward. The passage through
the Kobiti, my only way home in this part of the town, became impassable,
and I was obliged to turn my head to Mr. Crowther&#8212;s quarter, the
wind bearing the flakes so rapidly that the fearful leaps the fire made
were almost incredible. While it was burning by the late Sodeke&#8212;s
house, on a sudden it was found at Owu hill, the central part of Igbagura.</p>
<p>After it was all over, Mr. Crowther and I went to see
the converts, who
were the sufferers, as well as to ascertain how far the ravages extended.
With the exception of the iron furnace-house, all the houses on that hill
by our new Station were burnt up. Had our church and dwelling-house
been already roofed, they might have unavoidably undergone the same
fate. After visiting Lara, the elder chief of Owu, and many others, we
came to Basorun's house, to ascertain whether the furniture of the brass
gun in his place had escaped the fire, as it is a public property for protection.
Fortunately, we found the gun with all its materials quite safe.
From thence we visited Ogubonna. His house, which I had not the
least expectation of being in the number, shared the same fate, though
he did not suffer the loss of property, from having good ceiling.</p>
<p>Besides those who perished in the attempt to save
their property,
there were many who were overtaken in their flight from the danger.
The Apèna of Ido, a sick and infirm man, together with about four
individuals who were trying to lead him away, perished. Others,
who went to walk in the town, met with their unexpected and unhappy
fate in some of the narrow lanes and roads, where the
houses are too closely constructed. Some, having carried their children
to the river side, and returning to the house to save some property,
perished in that attempt; and the children, in going back to seek
for their parents, were either suffocated by the smoke, or overtaken by
flames. Those who perished in endeavouring to save their orisas or
idols, as well as their animals, were the most of the number. Of all those
who died in this calamity, the case of two little children was very affecting.
The parents happened to be absent from home. The younger one
sleeping in the house, and natural affection did not allow the other to
run away without trying to awake her; but, alas! these poor children
not permitted to see their parents any more in this world. Sad
case indeed! What a cause for thankfulness to our gracious God, that
not a life was lost among our converts!</p>
