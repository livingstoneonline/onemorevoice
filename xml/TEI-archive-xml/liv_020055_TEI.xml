<p>I have observed evident tokens of a silent, but mighty

<lb/>this conflict between the two, may be compared to a chronic <w>di-

<lb/>for years, till an effective remedy, on the other part, is applied
<lb/>to its cure. The chronic disease being disturbed in its indolent
<lb/>state, the patient will more or less feel the painful action 
<lb/>of the physic which will as it may be expected make him
<lb/>uneasy; the disease, being disturbed in its indolent state may
<lb/>shift its position, as it is said, is experienced in the gout or
<lb/>rheumatism, till by perservering applications of the medicine,

<p rend="no-indent">now we have put the intruder, the new religion in the shade.</p> 
<lb/><p>It would certainly have been very faithless and cowardly on their part
<lb/>with out a struggle so at once to give way submissively to the
<lb/>newly imported religion from a strange country. But to proceed.
<lb/>The <placeName><term type="collective">Juju</term> house of skulls</placeName> has been <unclear>stringly</unclear> rebuilt, and the
<lb/>skulls are being replaced; the roof now rests upon iron <unclear><choice><sic>stensions</sic><corr>stanchions</corr></choice></unclear>
<lb/>or pillars instead of wood which soon decays, the roof is covered
<lb/>with galvanized corrugated iron sheets and the body of the
<lb/>temple is <unclear>covered</unclear> with plain sheets of the same materials, instead of <term type="plant">bamboo</term>: 
<lb/>now as to durability, it looks down with contempt on our
<lb/>temporary schoolroom close by. The fallen platform, the
<lb/>receptacle of the bones and limbs of human victims has been
<lb/>newly erected and the scattered bones picked up and replaced
<lb/>on it, and to shew that they were not beaten, an additional
<lb/>platform was erected, on both which are to be seen <del>the</del>
<lb/>fresh bones of three human victims newly taken as prisoners
<lb/>of war, killed and devoured: these victims were, a <hi rend="underline">man</hi>,
<lb/>a <hi rend="underline">woman</hi> and <hi rend="underline">her child</hi>, relatives of their opponents, caught
<lb/>from the opposite side of the river. Having been thus caught
<lb/>killed and eaten, their bones and skulls were added to the 
<lb/>trophies in the temple. Our native agents were <w>eyewit-
<lb/>nesses</w> of these attrocities only a few months ago: the <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">people</add> made
<lb/>no disguise of the acts, they rather gloried in the deeds.</p>
<lb/><p>A priestess was seen bearing one of the gory skulls in 
<lb/>her hands to be prepared and deposited in its place; while
<lb/>the body was being prepared as animal sacrifice among the 
<lb/>members. That our agents were not <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">only</add> shocked but frighted at
<lb/>the sight, may easily be concluded, but they could not <w>inter-
<lb/>fere</w> for one may sooner disturb a <term type="animal">lion</term> at its prey.</p>
<lb/><p>Several times I passed by the Temple, and these fresh limbs
<lb/>caught my eyes, my heart <del>as</del><add place="over-text">is</add> stirred to appeal to him <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">who has the power,</add> to turn

<lb/><p n="par1 liv_020055_0003">English speaking is prevalent here, in the same way and

<lb/>along this coast, we therefore take advantage of it in teaching the
<lb/>children to read English school books, while we preach to the
<lb/>native congregation through an interpreter, at the same time
<lb/>we are preparing books in the native tongue.</p>
<lb/><p>Since the school and Sunday services have been removed
<lb/>from the temporary schoolroom in <settlement>Bonny Town</settlement> to the new
<lb/>mission premises near <settlement>Andony village</settlement>, things have been going
<lb/>on more comfortably. The distance between this and <settlement>Bonny
<lb/>Town</settlement> is about 15 minutes walk on the beach; the children
<lb/>have been regular in their attendance both at school and

<lb/>I propose cutting a new straight road through the swamps to <w>con-
<lb/>-nect</w> this and the town, clear out of the tide, to facilitate <w>commu-
<lb/>nication</w> without the use of a canoe at high water, which is
<lb/>approved of by the chiefs who also promise their cooperation.</p>
<lb/><p>The mission station has become a playground to the children<!-- overwriting or correction in author's hand? MBT -->
<lb/>where they spend their <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">time</add> most cheerfully before and after school
<lb/>hours daily. To teach them habits of industry, small patches

<lb/>and reaped, they took home to their parents as the produce
<lb/>of their own growing. The girls improve in washing and ironing.</p>

<lb/><p>I was told by <persName>King George</persName>, that the fact of the Bell being
