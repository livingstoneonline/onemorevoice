 Time, they say, must the best of us capture. 
 
 And travel and battle and gems and gold 
 No more can kindle the ancient rapture. 
 
 For even the youngest of hearts grows old. 
 But in you, I think, the boy is not over ; 
 
 So take this medley of ways and wars 
 As the gift of a friend and a fellow-lover 
 
 Of the fairest country under the stars.

 Chapter I. 
 
 THE MAN ON THE KIRKCAPLE SHORE. 
 
 T MIND as if it were yesterday my first sight of 
 the man. Little I knew at the time how big 
 the moment was with destiny, or how often that 
 face seen in the fitful moonlight would haunt my 
 sleep and disturb my waking hours. But I mind 
 yet the cold grue of terror I got from it, a 
 terror which was surely more than the due of 
 a few truant lads breaking the Sabbath with their 
 
 play. 
 
 The town of Kirkcaple, of which and its adja- 
 cent parish of Portincross my father was the 
 minister, lies on a hillside above the little bay of 
 Caple, and looks squarely out on the North Sea. 
 Round the horns of land which enclose the bay

 the coast shows on either side a battlement of 
 stark red cliffs through which a burn or two 
 makes a pass to the water's edge. The bay itself 
 is ringed with fine clean sands, where we lads of 
 the burgh school loved to bathe in the warm 
 weather. But on long holidays the sport was to 
 go farther afield among the cliffs ; for there there 
 were many deep caves and pools, where podleys 
 might be caught with the line, and hid treasures 
 sought for at the expense of the skin of the knees 
 and the buttons of the trousers. Many a long 
 Saturday I have passed in a crinkle of the cliffs, 
 having lit a fire of driftwood, and made believe 
 that I was a smuggler or a Jacobite new landed 
 from France. There was a band of us in Kirk- 
 caple, lads of my own age, including Archie Leslie, 
 the son of my father's session-clerk, and Tam 
 Dyke, the provost's nephew. We were sealed to 
 silence by the blood oath, and we bore each the 
 name of some historic pirate or sailorman. I was 
 Paul Jones, Tam was Captain Kidd, and Archie, 
 need I say it, was Morgan himself. Our tryst 
 was a cave where a little water called the Dyve 
 Burn had cut its way through the cliffs to the sea. 
 There we forgathered in the summer evenings

 and of a Saturday afternoon in winter, and told 
 mighty tales of our prowess and flattered our silly 
 hearts. But the sober truth is that our deeds 
 were of the humblest, and a dozen of fish or a 
 handful of" apples was all our booty, and our 
 greatest exploit a fight with the roughs at the 
 Dyve tan-work. 
 
 My father's spring Communion fell on the last 
 Sabbath of April, and on the particular Sabbath of 
 which I speak the weather was mild and bright 
 for the time of year. I had been surfeited with 
 the Thursday's and Saturday's services, and the 
 two long diets of worship on the Sabbath were 
 hard for a lad of twelve to bear with the spring in 
 his bones and the sun slanting through the gallery 
 window. There still remained the service on the 
 Sabbath evening — a doleful prospect, for the Rev. 
 Mr. Murdoch of Kilchristie, noted for the length 
 of his discourses, had exchanged pulpits with my 
 father. So my mind was ripe for the proposal 
 of Archie Leslie, on our way home to tea, that 
 by a little skill we might give the kirk the slip. 
 At our Communion the pews were emptied of 
 their regular occupants and the congregation 
 seated itself as it pleased. The manse seat was

 lo PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 full of the Kirkcaple relations of Mr. Murdoch, 
 who had been invited there by my mother to hear 
 him, and it was not hard to obtain permission to sit 
 with Archie and Tam Dyke in the cock-loft in the 
 gallery. Word was sent to Tam, and so it hap- 
 pened that three abandoned lads duly passed the 
 plate and took their seats in the cock-loft. But 
 when the bell had done j owing, and we heard by 
 the sounds of their feet that the elders had gone in 
 to the kirk, we slipped down the stairs and out of 
 the side door. We were through the churchyard 
 in a twinkling, and hot-foot on the road to the 
 Dyve Burn. 
 
 It was the fashion of the genteel in Kirkcaple to 
 put their boys into what were known as Eton 
 suits — long trousers, cut-away jackets, and chimney- 
 pot hats. I had been one of the earliest victims, 
 and well I remember how I fled home from the 
 Sabbath school with the snowballs of the town 
 roughs rattling off my chimney-pot. Archie had 
 followed, his family being in all things imitators of 
 mine. We were now clothed in this wearisome 
 garb, so our first care was to secrete safely our hats 
 in a marked spot under some whin bushes on the 
 links. Tam was free from the bondage of fashion.

 and wore his ordinary best knickerbockers. From 
 inside his jacket he unfolded his special treasure, 
 which was to light us on our expedition — an evil- 
 smelling old tin lantern with a shutter. 
 
 Tarn was of the Free Kirk persuasion, and as 
 his Communion fell on a different day from ours, 
 he was spared the bondage of church attendance 
 from which Archie and I had revolted. But 
 notable events had happened that day in his 
 church. A black man, the Rev. John Some- 
 thing-or-other, had been preaching, Tam was 
 full of the portent. "A nigger," he said, "a 
 great black chap as big as your father, Archie." 
 He seemed to have banged the bookboard with 
 some effect, and had kept Tam, for once in his 
 life, awake. He had preached about the heathen 
 in Africa, and how a black man was as good as a 
 white man in the sight of God, and he had forecast 
 a day when the negroes would have something to 
 teach the British in the way of civilization. So at 
 any rate ran the account of Tam Dyke, who did 
 not share the preacher's views. " It's all non- 
 sense, Davie. The Bible says that the children 
 of Ham were to be our servants. If I were the 
 minister I wouldn't let a nigger into the pulpit.

 I wouldn't let him farther than the Sabbath 
 school." 
 
 Night fell as we came to the broomy spaces of 
 the links, and ere we had breasted the slope of the 
 neck which separates Kirkcaple Bay from the cliffs 
 it was as dark as an April evening with a full 
 moon can be. Tarn would have had it darker. 
 He got out his lantern, and after a prodigious 
 waste of matches kindled the candle-end inside, 
 turned the dark shutter, and trotted happily on. 
 We had no need of his lighting till the Dyve 
 Burn was reached and the path began to descend 
 steeply through the rift in the crags. 
 
 It was here we found that some one had gone 
 before us. Archie was great in those days at 
 tracking, his ambition running in Indian paths. 
 He would walk always with his head bent and his 
 eyes on the ground, whereby he several times 
 found lost coins and once a trinket dropped by the 
 provost's wife. At the edge of the burn, where 
 the path turns downward, there is a patch of 
 shingle washed up by some spate. Archie was on 
 his knees in a second. " Lads," he cried, " there's 
 spoor here ; " and then after some nosing, " it's a 
 man's track, going downward, a big man with flat

 feet. It's fresh, too, for it crosses the damp bit 
 of gravel, and the water has scarcely filled the 
 holes yet." 
 
 We did not dare to question Archie's woodcraft, 
 but it puzzled us who the stranger could be. In 
 summer weather you might find a party of pic- 
 nickers here, attracted by the fine hard sands at 
 the burn mouth. But at this time of night and 
 season of the year there was no call for any one to 
 be trespassing on our preserves. No fishermen 
 came this way, the lobster-pots being all to the 
 east, and the stark headland of the Red Neb made 
 the road to them by the water's edge difficult. 
 The tan-work lads used to come now and then for 
 a swim, but you would not find a tan-work lad 
 bathing on a chill April night. Yet there was no 
 question where our precursor had gone. He was 
 making for the shore. Tam unshuttered his 
 lantern, and the steps went clearly down the cork- 
 screw path. " Maybe he is after our cave. We'd 
 better go cannily." 
 
 The glim was dowsed — the words were Archie's 
 — and in the best contraband manner we stole 
 down the gully. The business had suddenly 
 taken an eerie turn, and 1 think in our hearts we

 were all a little afraid. But Tarn had a lantern, 
 and it would never do to turn back from an 
 adventure which had all the appearance of being 
 the true sort. Half way down there is a scrog 
 of wood, dwarf alders and hawthorn, which makes 
 an arch over the path. I, for one, was glad when 
 we got through this with no worse mishap than a 
 stumble from Tam which caused the lantern door 
 to fly open and the candle to go out. We did 
 not stop to relight it, but scrambled down the 
 screes till we came to the long slabs of reddish 
 rock which abutted on the beach. We could not 
 see the track, so we gave up the business of 
 scouts, and dropped quietly over the big boulder 
 and into the crinkle of cliflF which we called our 
 cave. 
 
 There was nobody there, so we relit the lantern 
 and examined our properties. Two or three 
 fishing-rods for the burn, much dam^aged by 
 weather ; some sea-lines on a dry shelf of rock ; a 
 couple of wooden boxes ; a pile of driftwood for 
 fires, and a heap of quartz in which we thought 
 we had found veins of gold — such was the modest 
 furnishing of our den. To this I must add some 
 broken clay pipes, with which we made believe to

 imitate our elders, smoking a foul mixture of 
 coltsfoot leaves and brown paper. The band was 
 in session, so following our ritual we sent out a 
 picket. Tarn was deputed to go round the edge 
 of the cliff from which the shore was visible, and 
 report if the coast was clear. 
 
 He returned in three minutes, his eyes round 
 with amazement in the lantern light. " There's 
 a fire on the sands," he repeated, "and a man 
 beside it." 
 
 Here was news indeed. Without a word we 
 made for the open, Archie first, and Tam, who 
 had seized and shuttered his lantern, coming last. 
 We crawled to the edge of the cliff and peered 
 round, and there sure enough on the hard bit of 
 sand which the tide had left by the burn mouth 
 was a twinkle of light and a dark figure. 
 
 The moon was rising, and besides there was that 
 curious sheen from the sea which you will often 
 notice in spring. The glow was maybe a hundred 
 yards distant, a little spark of fire I could have put 
 in my cap, and, from its crackling and smoke, com- 
 posed of dry seaweed and half-green branches 
 from the burnside thickets. A man's figure stood 
 near it, and as we looked it moved round and

 1 6 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 round the fire in circles which first of all widened 
 and then contracted. 
 
 The sight was so unexpected, so beyond the 
 beat of our experience, that we were all a little 
 scared. What could this strange being want with 
 a fire at half-past eight of an April Sabbath night 
 on the Dyve Burn sands ? We discussed the 
 thing in whispers behind a boulder, but none of 
 us had any solution. " Belike he's come ashore in 
 a boat," said Archie. " He's maybe a foreigner." 
 But 1 pointed out that, from the tracks which 
 Archie himself had found, the man must have 
 come overland down the cliffs. Tam was clear he 
 was a madman, and was for withdrawing promptly 
 from the whole business. 
 
 But some spell kept our feet tied there in that 
 silent world of sand and moon and sea. 1 re- 
 member looking back and seeing the solemn, 
 frowning faces of the cliffs, and feeling somehow 
 shut in with this unknown being in a strange 
 union. What kind of chance had brought this 
 interloper into our territory ? For a wonder 1 
 was less afraid than curious. I wanted to get to 
 the heart of the matter, and to discover what the 
 man was up to with his fire and his circles.

 The same thought must have been in Archie's 
 head, for he dropped on his belly and began to 
 crawl softly seawards. 1 followed, and Tarn, with 
 sundry complaints, crept after my heels. Between 
 the cliffs and the fire lay some sixty yards of debris 
 and boulders above the level of all but the high 
 spring tides. Beyond lay a string of seaweedy 
 pools and then the hard sands of the burnfoot. 
 There was excellent cover among the big stones, 
 and apart from the distance and the dim light, the 
 man by the fire was too preoccupied in his task to 
 keep much look-out towards the land. I re- 
 member thinking he had chosen his place well, for 
 save from the sea he could not be seen. The cliffs 
 are so undercut that unless a watcher on the coast 
 were on their extreme edge he would not see the 
 burnfoot sands. 
 
 Archie, the skilled tracker, was the one who all 
 but betrayed us. His knee slipped on the sea- 
 weed, and he rolled off a boulder, bringing down 
 with him a clatter of small stones. We lay as still 
 as mice, in terror lest the man should have heard 
 the noise and have come to look for the cause. 
 By-and-by when I ventured to raise my head 
 above a flat-topped stone I saw that he was un-

 disturbed. The fire still burned, and he was 
 pacing round it. 
 
 Just on the edge of the pools was an outcrop of 
 red sandstone much fissured by the sea. Here 
 was an excellent vantage-ground, and all three of 
 us curled behind it, with our eyes just over the 
 edge. The man was not twenty yards off, and I 
 could see clearly what manner of fellow he was. 
 For one thing he was huge of size, or so he seemed 
 to me in the half-light. He wore nothing but a 
 shirt and trousers, and I could hear by the flap of 
 his feet on the sand that he was barefoot. 
 
 Suddenly Tam Dyke gave a gasp of astonish- 
 ment. " Gosh, it's the black minister ! " he said. 
 
 It was indeed a black man, as we saw when the 
 moon came out of a cloud. His head was on his 
 breast, and he walked round the fire with measured, 
 regular steps. At intervals he would stop and 
 raise both hands to the sky, and bend his body in 
 the direction of the moon. But he never uttered 
 a word. 
 
 " It's magic," said Archie. " He's going to 
 raise Satan. We must bide here and see what 
 happens, for he'll grip us if we try to go back. 
 The moon's ower high."

 The procession continued as if to some slow 
 music. I had been in no fear of the adventure 
 back there by our cave ; but now that I saw the 
 thing from close at hand, my courage began to 
 ebb. There was something desperately uncanny 
 about this great negro, who had shed his clerical 
 garments, and was now practising some strange 
 magic alone by the sea. I had no doubt it was 
 the black art, for there was that in the air and the 
 scene which spelled the unlawful. As we watched, 
 the circles stopped, and the man threw something 
 on the fire. A thick smoke rose of which we 
 could feel the aromatic scent, and when it was 
 gone the flame burned with a silvery blueness like 
 moonlight. Still no sound came from the minister, 
 but he took something from his belt, and began to 
 make odd markings in the sand between the inner 
 circle and the fire. As he turned, the moon 
 gleamed on the implement, and we saw it was a 
 great knife. 
 
 We were now scared in real earnest. Here 
 were we, three boys, at night in a lonely place a 
 few yards from a great savage with a knife. The 
 adventure was far past my liking, and even the 
 intrepid Archie was having qualms, if I could

 20 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 judge from his set face. As for Tarn, his teeth 
 were chattering like a threshing-mill. 
 
 Suddenly I felt something soft and warm on 
 the rock at my right hand. I felt again, and, 
 lo ! it was the man's clothes. There were his 
 boots and socks, his minister's coat and his min- 
 ister's hat. 
 
 This made the predicament worse, for if we 
 waited till he finished his rites we should for 
 certain be found by him. At the same time, to 
 return over the boulders in the bright moonlight 
 seemed an equally sure way to discovery. I 
 whispered to Archie, who was for waiting a little 
 longer. " Something may turn up," he said. It 
 was always his way. 
 
 I do not know what would have turned up, for 
 we had no chance of testing it. The situation had 
 proved too much for the nerves of Tam Dyke. 
 As the man turned towards us in his bowings and 
 bendings, Tam suddenly sprang to his feet and 
 shouted at him a piece of schoolboy rudeness then 
 fashionable in Kirkcaple. 
 
 " Wha called ye partan-face, my bonny man ,?" 
 
 Then, clutching his lantern, he ran for dear life, 
 while Archie and I raced at his heels. As I turned

 ON THE KIRKCAPLE SHORE. 21 
 
 I had a glimpse of a huge figure, knife in hand, 
 bounding towards us. 
 
 Though I only saw it in the turn of a head, the 
 face stamped itself indelibly upon my mind. It 
 was black, black as ebony, but it was different from 
 the ordinary negro. There were no thick lips and 
 fiat nostrils ; rather, if I could trust my eyes, the 
 nose was high-bridged, and the lines of the mouth 
 sharp and firm. But it was distorted into an ex- 
 pression of such terror and devilish fury and 
 amazement that my heart became like water. 
 
 We had a start, as I have said, of some twenty 
 or thirty yards. Among the boulders we were 
 not at a great disadvantage, for a boy can flit 
 quickly over them, while a grown man must pick 
 his way. Archie, as ever, kept his wits the best of 
 us. " Make straight for the burn," he shouted in 
 a hoarse whisper ; "we'll beat him on the slope." 
 
 We passed the boulders and slithered over the 
 outcrop of red rock and the patches of sea-pink till 
 we reached the channel of the Dyve water, which 
 flows gently among pebbles after leaving the gully. 
 Here for the first time I looked back and saw 
 nothing. I stopped involuntarily, and that halt 
 was nearly my undoing. For our pursuer had

 22 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 reached the burn before us, but lower down, and 
 was coming up its bank to cut us off. 
 
 At most times I am a notable coward, and in 
 these days I was still more of one, owing to a 
 quick and easily-heated imagination. But now I 
 think I did a brave thing, though more by instinct 
 than resolution. Archie was running first, and 
 had already splashed through the burn ; Tarn 
 came next, just about to cross, and the black man 
 was almost at his elbow. Another second and 
 Tam would have been in his clutches had 1 not 
 yelled out a warning and made straight up the 
 bank of the burn. Tam fell into the pool — I 
 could hear his spluttering cry — but he got across ; 
 for I heard Archie call to him, and the two vanished 
 into the thicket which clothes all the left bank of 
 the gully. The pursuer, seeing me on his own 
 side of the water, followed straight on ; and before 
 I knew it had become a race between the two 
 of us. 
 
 I was hideously frightened, but not without 
 hope, for the screes and shelves of this right side 
 of the gully were known to me from many a day's 
 exploring. I was light on my feet and un- 
 commonly sound in wind, being by far the best

 long-distance runner in Kirkcaple. If I could 
 only keep my lead till I reached a certain corner I 
 knew of, I could outwit my enemy ; for it was 
 possible from that place to make a detour behind 
 a waterfall and get into a secret path of ours among 
 the bushes. I flew up the steep screes, not daring 
 to look round ; but at the top, where the rocks 
 begin, I had a glimpse of my pursuer. The man 
 could run. Heavy in build though he was he was 
 not six yards behind me, and I could see the white 
 of his eyes and the red of his gums. I saw some- 
 thing else — a glint of white metal in his hand. 
 He still had his knife. 
 
 Fear sent me up the rocks like a seagull, and 
 I scrambled and leaped, making for the corner I 
 knew of. Something told me that the pursuit was 
 slackening, and for a moment I halted to look 
 round. A second time a halt was nearly the end 
 of me. A great stone flew through the air, and 
 took the cliffy an inch from my head, half-blinding 
 me with splinters. And now I began to get 
 angry. I pulled myself into cover, skirted a rock 
 till I came to my corner, and looked back for the 
 enemy. There he was scrambling by the way I 
 had come, and making a prodigious clatter among

 the stones. I picked up a loose bit of rock and 
 hurled It with all my force in his direction. It 
 broke before it reached him, but a considerable 
 lump to my joy took him full in the face. Then 
 my terrors revived. I slipped behind the waterfall 
 and was soon in the thicket, and toiling towards 
 the top. 
 
 I think this last bit was the worst in the race, 
 for my strength was failing, and I seemed to hear 
 those horrid steps at my heels. My heart was in 
 my mouth as, careless of my best clothes, I tore 
 through the hawthorn bushes. Then I struck the 
 path and, to my relief, came on Archie and Tam, 
 who were running slowly in desperate anxiety 
 about my fate. We then took hands and soon 
 reached the top of the gully. 
 
 For a second we looked back. The pursuit had 
 ceased, and far down the burn we could hear the 
 sounds as of some one going back to the sands. 
 
 "Your face is bleeding, Davie. Did he get 
 near enough to hit you ? " Archie asked. 
 
 " He hit me with a stone. But I gave him 
 better. He's got a bleeding nose to remember 
 this night by." 
 
 We did not dare take the road by the links, but

 made for the nearest human habitation. This was 
 a farm about half a mile inland, and when we 
 reached it we lay down by the stack-yard gate and 
 panted. 
 
 "I've lost my lantern," said Tam. "The big 
 black brute ! See if I don't tell my father." 
 
 " Ye'll do nothing of the kind," said Archie 
 fiercely. " He knows nothing about us and can't 
 do us any harm. But if the story got out and 
 he found out who we were, he'd murder the lot 
 of us." 
 
 He made us swear secrecy, which we were will- 
 ing enough to do, seeing very clearly the sense in 
 his argument. Then we found the highroad and 
 trotted back at our best pace to Kirkcaple, fear of 
 our families gradually ousting fear of pursuit. In 
 our excitement Archie and I forgot about our 
 Sabbath hats, reposing quietly below a whin bush 
 on the links. 
 
 We were not destined to escape without de- 
 tection. As ill luck would have it, Mr. Murdoch 
 had been taken ill with the stomach-ache after the 
 second psalm, and the congregation had been 
 abruptly dispersed. My mother had waited for 
 me at the church door, and, seeing no signs of her

 son, had searched the gallery. Then the truth 
 came out, and, had I been only for a mild walk on 
 the links, retribution would have overtaken my 
 truantry. But to add to this I arrived home with 
 a scratched face, no hat, and several rents in my 
 best trousers. I was well cuffed and sent to 
 bed, with the promise of full-dress chastisement 
 when my father should come home in the 
 morning. 
 
 My father arrived before breakfast next day, 
 and I was duly and soundly whipped. I set out 
 for school with aching bones to add to the usual 
 depression of Monday morning. At the corner of 
 the Nethergate I fell in with Archie, who was 
 staring at a trap carrying two men which was 
 coming down the street. It was the Free Church 
 minister — he had married a rich wife and kept a 
 horse — driving the preacher of yesterday to the 
 railway station. Archie and I were in behind a 
 doorpost in a twinkling, so that we could see in 
 safety the last of our enemy. He was dressed in 
 minister's clothes, with a heavy fur-coat and a 
 brand new yellow-leather Gladstone bag. He was 
 talking loudly as he passed, and the Free Church 
 minister seemed to be listening attentively. I

 heard his deep voice saying something about the 
 " work of God in this place." But what I noticed 
 specially — and the sight made me forget my aching 
 hinder parts — was that he had a swollen eye, and 
 two strips of sticking-plaster on his cheek.

 TN this plain story of mine there will be so many 
 wild doings ere the end is reached, that I beg 
 my reader's assent to a prosaic digression. I will 
 tell briefly the things which happened between my 
 sight of the man on the Kirkcaple sands and my 
 voyage to Africa. 
 
 I continued for three years at the burgh school, 
 where my progress was less notable in my studies 
 than in my sports. One by one I saw my com- 
 panions pass out of idle boyhood and be set to 
 professions. Tam Dyke on two occasions ran off 
 to sea in the Dutch schooners which used to load 
 with coal in our port ; and finally his father gave 
 him his will, and he was apprenticed to the mer- 
 chant service. Archie Leslie, who was a year my 
 elder, was destined for the law, so he left Kirkcaple 
 for an Edinburgh office, where he was also to take

 out classes at the college. I remained on at 
 school till I sat alone by myself in the highest 
 class — a position of little dignity and deep loneli- 
 ness. I had grown a tall, square-set lad, and my 
 prowess at Rugby football was renowned beyond 
 the parishes of Kirkcaple and Portincross. To 
 my father I fear 1 was a disappointment. He 
 had hoped for something in his son more book- 
 ish and sedentary, more like his gentle, studious 
 self. 
 
 On one thing I was determined : I should 
 follow a learned profession. The fear of being 
 sent to an office, like so many of my schoolfellows. 
 Inspired me to the little progress I ever made in 
 my studies. I chose the ministry, not, I fear, out 
 of any reverence for the sacred calling, but because 
 my father had followed it before me. Accordingly 
 I was sent at the age of sixteen for a year's finish- 
 ing at the High School of Edinburgh, and the 
 following winter began my Arts course at the 
 university. 
 
 If Fate had been kinder to me, I think I might 
 have become a scholar. At any rate I was just 
 acquiring a taste for philosophy and the dead 
 languages when my father died suddenly of a

 paralytic shock, and I had to set about earning a 
 living. 
 
 My mother was left badly off, for my poor 
 father had never been able to save much from his 
 modest stipend. When all things were settled, it 
 turned out that she might reckon on an income of 
 about fifty pounds a year. This was not enough 
 to live on, however modest the household, and 
 certainly not enough to pay for the colleging of 
 a son. At this point an uncle of hers stepped 
 forward with a proposal. He was a well-to-do 
 bachelor, alone in the world, and he invited my 
 mother to live with him and take care of his 
 house. For myself he proposed a post in some 
 mercantile concern, for he had much influence in 
 the circles of commerce. There was nothing for 
 it but to accept gratefully. We sold our few 
 household goods, and moved to his gloomy house 
 in Dundas Street. A few days later he announced 
 at dinner that he had found for me a chance which 
 might lead to better things. 
 
 "You see, Davie," he explained, "you don't 
 know the rudiments of business life. There's no 
 house in the country that would take you in ex- 
 cept as a common clerk, and you would never earn

 FURTH! FORTUNE! 31 
 
 much more than a hundred pounds a year all your 
 days. If you want to better your future you must 
 go abroad, where white men are at a premium. 
 By the mercy of Providence I met yesterday an 
 old friend, Thomas Mackenzie, who was seeing 
 his lawyer about an estate he is bidding for. He 
 is the head of one of the biggest trading and ship- 
 ping concerns in the world — Mackenzie, Mure, 
 and Oldmeadows — you may have heard the name. 
 Among other things he has half the stores in South 
 Africa, where they sell everything from Bibles to 
 fish-hooks. Apparently they like men from home 
 to manage the stores, and to make a long story 
 short, when I put your case to him, he promised 
 you a place. I had a wire from him this morning 
 confirming the offer. You are to be assistant store- 
 keeper at — " (my uncle fumbled in his pocket, and 
 then read from the yellow slip) "at Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein. There's a mouthful for you." 
 
 In this homely way I first heard of a place which 
 was to be the theatre of so many strange doings. 
 
 " It's a fine chance for you," my uncle continued. 
 "You'll only be assistant at first, but when you 
 have learned your job you'll have a store of your 
 own. Mackenzie's people will pay you three

 32 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 hundred pounds a year, and when you get a store 
 you'll get a percentage on sales. It lies with you 
 to open up new trade among the natives. I hear 
 that Blaauw — something or other, is in the far 
 north of the Transvaal, and I see from the map 
 that it is in a wild, hilly country. You may find 
 gold or diamonds up there, and come back and 
 buy up Portincross House." My uncle rubbed 
 his hands and smiled cheerily. 
 
 Truth to tell I was both pleased and sad. If a 
 learned profession was denied me I vastly pre- 
 ferred a veld store to an Edinburgh office stool. 
 Had I not been still under the shadow of my 
 father's death I might have welcomed the chance 
 of new lands and new folk. As it was, I felt the 
 loneliness of an exile. That afternoon I walked on 
 the Braid Hills, and when I saw in the clear spring 
 sunlight the coast of Fife, and remembered Kirk- 
 caple and my boyish days, I could have found it in 
 me to sit down and cry. 
 
 A fortnight later I sailed. My mother bade me 
 a tearful farewell, and my uncle, besides buying me 
 an outfit and paying my passage money, gave me 
 a present of twenty sovereigns. " You'll not be 
 your mother's son, Davie," were his last words,

 " if you don't come home with it multiplied by a 
 thousand." I thought at the time that I would 
 give more than twenty thousand pounds to be 
 allowed to bide on the windy shores of Forth. 
 
 I sailed from Southampton by an intermediate 
 steamer, and went steerage to save expense. 
 Happily my acute homesickness was soon for- 
 gotten in another kind of malady. It blew half a 
 gale before we were out of the Channel, and by 
 the time we had rounded Ushant it was as dirty 
 weather as ever I hope to see. I lay mortal sick 
 in my bunk, unable to bear the thought of food, 
 and too feeble to lift my head. I wished I had 
 never left home, but so acute was my sickness that 
 if some one had there and then offered me a 
 passage back or an immediate landing on shore 
 I should have chosen the latter. 
 
 It was not till we got into the fair-weather seas 
 around Madeira that I recovered enough to sit on 
 deck and observe my fellow-passengers. There 
 were some fifty of us in the steerage, mostly wives 
 and children going to join relations, with a few 
 emigrant artisans and farmers. I early found a 
 friend in a little man with a yellow beard and

 spectacles, who sat down beside me and remarked 
 on the weather in a strong Scotch accent. He 
 turned out to be a Mr. Wardlaw from Aberdeen, 
 who was going out to be a schoolmaster. He 
 was a man of good education, who had taken a 
 university degree, and had taught for some years 
 as an under-master in a school in his native town. 
 But the east winds had damaged his lungs, and he 
 had been glad to take the chance of a poorly paid 
 country school in the veld. When I asked him 
 where he was going I was amazed to be told, 
 " Blaauwildebeestefontein." 
 
 Mr. Wardlaw was a pleasant little man, with 
 a sharp tongue but a cheerful temper. He laboured 
 all day at primers of the Dutch and Kaffir tongues, 
 but in the evening after supper he would walk 
 with me on the after-deck and discuss the future. 
 Like me, he knew nothing of the land he was going 
 to, but he was insatiably curious, and he affected 
 me with his interest. "This place, Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein," he used to say, "is among the 
 Zoutpansberg mountains, and as far as I can see, 
 not above ninety miles from the railroad. It looks 
 from the map a well-watered country, and the 
 Agent-General in London told me it was healthy

 or I wouldn't have taken the job. It seems we'll 
 be in the heart of native reserves up there, for 
 here's a list of chiefs — 'Mpefu, Sikitola, Majinje, 
 Magata ; and there are no white men living to the 
 east of us because of the fever. The name means 
 the * spring of the blue wildebeeste,' whatever 
 fearsome animal that may be. It sounds like a 
 place for adventure, Mr. Crawfurd. You'll ex- 
 ploit the pockets of the black men and I'll see 
 what I can do with their minds." 
 
 There was another steerage passenger whom I 
 could not help observing because of my dislike 
 of his appearance. He, too, was a little man, 
 by name Henriques, and in looks the most atro- 
 cious villain I have ever clapped eyes on. He 
 had a face the colour of French mustard — a sort of 
 dirty green — and bloodshot, beady eyes with the 
 whites all yellowed with fever. He had Waxed 
 moustaches, and a curious, furtive way of walk- 
 ing and looking about him. We of the steerage 
 were careless in our dress, but he was always 
 clad in immaculate white linen, with pointed, 
 yellow shoes to match his complexion. He spoke 
 to no one, but smoked long cheroots all day in the 
 stern of the ship, and studied a greasy pocket-

 book. Once 1 tripped over him in the dark, and 
 he turned on me with a snarl and an oath. I was 
 short enough with him in return, and he looked as 
 if he could knife me. 
 
 " I'll wager that fellow has been a slave-driver 
 in his time," I told Mr. Wardlaw, who said, " God 
 pity his slaves, then." 
 
 And now 1 come to the incident which made the 
 rest of the voyage pass all too soon for me, and fore- 
 shadowed the strange events which were to come. 
 It was the day after we crossed the Line, and the 
 first-class passengers were having deck-sports. A 
 tug-of-war had been arranged between the three 
 classes, and a half-dozen of the heaviest fellows in 
 the steerage, myself included, were invited to join. 
 It was a blazing hot afternoon, but on the saloon 
 deck there were awnings and a cool wind blow- 
 ing from the bows. The first-class beat the second 
 easily, and after a tremendous struggle beat the 
 steerage also. Then they regaled us with iced- 
 drinks and cigars to celebrate the victory. 
 
 I was standing at the edge of the crowd of 
 spectators, when my eye caught a figure which 
 seemed to have little interest in our games. A 
 large man in clerical clothes was sitting on a

 FURTH! FORTUNE! 37 
 
 deck-chair reading a book. There was nothing 
 novel about the stranger, and I cannot explain 
 the impulse which made me wish to see his 
 face. I moved a few steps up the deck, and 
 then I saw that his skin was black. I went a little 
 further, and suddenly he raised his eyes from 
 his book and looked round. It was the face of 
 the man who had terrified me years ago on the 
 Kirkcaple shore. 
 
 I spent the rest of the day in a brown study. 
 It was clear to me that some destiny had pre- 
 arranged this meeting. Here was this man travel- 
 ling prosperously as a first-class passenger with 
 all the appurtenances of respectability. I alone 
 had seen him invoking strange gods in the moon- 
 light, I alone knew of the devilry in his heart, 
 and I could not but believe that some day or other 
 there might be virtue in that knowledge. 
 
 The second engineer and I had made friends, so 
 I got him to consult the purser's list for the name 
 of my acquaintance. He was down as the Rev. 
 John Laputa, and his destination was Durban. 
 
 The next day being Sunday, who should appear 
 to address us steerage passengers but the black 
 minister. He was introduced by the captain him-

 self, a notably pious man, who spoke of the labours 
 of his brother in the dark places of heathendom. 
 Some of us were hurt in our pride in being 
 made the target of a black man's oratory. 
 Especially Mr. Henriques, whose skin spoke of 
 the tar-brush, protested with oaths against the 
 insult. Finally he sat down on a coil of rope, 
 and spat scornfully in the vicinity of the preacher. 
 
 For myself I was intensely curious, and not a 
 little impressed. The man's face was as com- 
 manding as his figure, and his voice was the most 
 wonderful thing that ever came out of human 
 mouth. It was full and rich, and gentle, with the 
 tones of a great organ. He had none of the squat 
 and preposterous negro lineaments, but a hawk 
 nose like an Arab, dark flashing eyes, and a cruel 
 and resolute mouth. He was black as my hat, 
 but for the rest he might have sat for a figure of 
 a Crusader. I do not know what the sermon was 
 about, though others told me that it was excellent. 
 All the time I watched him, and kept saying to 
 myself, " You hunted me up the Dyve Burn, but 
 I bashed your face for you." Indeed, I thought 
 I could see faint scars on his cheek. 
 
 The following night I had toothache, and could

 FURTH! FORTUNE! 39 
 
 not sleep. It was too hot to breathe under cover, 
 so I got up, lit a pipe, and walked on the after- 
 deck to ease the pain. The air was very still, save 
 for the whish of water from the screws and the 
 steady beat of the engines. Above, a great yellow 
 moon looked down on me, and a host of pale stars. 
 
 The moonlight set me remembering the old 
 affair of the Dyve Burn, and my mind began 
 to run on the Rev. John Laputa. It pleased 
 me to think that I was on the track of some 
 mystery of which I alone had the clue. I promised 
 myself to search out the antecedents of the minister 
 when I got to Durban, for I had a married cousin 
 there, who might know something of his doings. 
 Then, as I passed by the companion-way to the 
 lower deck, I heard voices, and peeping over the 
 rail, I saw two men sitting In the shadow just 
 beyond the hatch of the hold. 
 
 I thought they might be two of the sailors seek- 
 ing coolness on the open deck, when something 
 in the figure of one of them made me look again. 
 The next second I had slipped back and stolen 
 across the after-deck to a point just above them. 
 For the two were the black minister and that ugly 
 yellow villain, Henrlques.

 I had no scruples about eavesdropping, but I 
 could make nothing of their talk. They spoke 
 low, and in some tongue which may have been 
 Kaffir or Portuguese, but was in any case un- 
 known to me. I lay, cramped and eager, for many 
 minutes, and was just getting sick of it when a 
 familiar name caught my ear. Henriques said 
 something in which I caught the word " Blaau- 
 wildebeestefontein." I listened intently, and there 
 could be no mistake. The minister repeated the 
 name, and for the next few minutes it recurred 
 often in their talk. I went back stealthily to bed, 
 having something to make me forget my aching 
 tooth. First of all, Laputa and Henriques were 
 allies. Second, the place I was bound for had 
 something to do with their schemes. 
 
 I said nothing to Mr. Wardlaw, but spent the 
 next week in the assiduous toil of the amateur 
 detective. I procured some maps and books from 
 my friend, the second engineer, and read all I 
 could about Blaauwildebeestefontein. Not that 
 there was much to learn ; but I remember I had 
 quite a thrill when I discovered from the chart of 
 the ship's run one day that we were in the same 
 latitude as that uncouthly-named spot. I found

 FURTH! FORTUNE! 41 
 
 out nothing, however, about Henriques or the 
 Rev. John Laputa. The Portuguese still smoked 
 in the stern, and thumbed his greasy notebook ; 
 the minister sat in his deck-chair, and read heavy 
 volumes from the ship's library. Though I watched 
 every night, I never found them again together. 
 
 At Cape Town Henriques went ashore and did 
 not return. The minister did not budge from the 
 ship the three days we lay in port, and, indeed, it 
 seemed to me that he kept his cabin. At any rate 
 I did not see his great figure on deck till we were 
 tossing in the choppy seas round Cape Agulhas. 
 Sea-sickness again attacked me, and with short 
 lulls during our stoppages at Port Elizabeth and 
 East London, I lay wretchedly in my bunk till we 
 sighted the bluffs of Durban harbour. 
 
 Here it was necessary for me to change my ship, 
 for in the interests of economy I was going by sea 
 to Delagoa Bay, and thence by the cheap railway 
 journey into the Transvaal. I sought out my 
 cousin, who lived in a fine house on the Berea, 
 and found a comfortable lodging for the three 
 days of my stay there. I made inquiries about 
 Mr. Laputa, but could h'ear nothing. There was 
 no native minister of that name, said my cousin.

 who was a great authority on all native questions. 
 I described the man, but got no further light. 
 No one had seen or heard of such a being, 
 " unless," said my cousin, " he is one of those 
 American Ethiopian rascals." 
 
 My second task was to see the Durban manager 
 of the firm which I had undertaken to serve. He 
 was a certain Mr. Colles, a big fat man, who 
 welcomed me in his shirt-sleeves, with a cigar 
 in his mouth. He received me pleasantly, and 
 took me home to dinner with him. 
 
 " Mr. Mackenzie has written about you," he 
 said. " I'll be quite frank with you, Mr. Craw- 
 furd. The firm is not exactly satisfied about the 
 way business has been going lately at Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein. There's a grand country up there, 
 and a grand opportunity for the man who can take 
 it. J^PP) who is in charge, is an old man now 
 and past his best, but he has been long with the 
 firm, and we don't want to hurt his feelings. 
 When he goes, which must be pretty soon, you'll 
 have a good chance of the place, if you show your- 
 self an active young fellow." 
 
 He told me a good deal more about Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein, principally trading details. Incident-

 FURTH! FORTUNE! 43 
 
 ally he let drop that Mr. Japp had had several 
 assistants in the last few years. I asked him why 
 they had left, and he hesitated. 
 
 " It's a lonely place, and they didn't like the 
 life. You see, there are few white men near, and 
 young fellows want society. They complained, 
 and were moved on. But the firm didn't think 
 the more of them." 
 
 I told him I had come out with the new school- 
 master. 
 
 " Yes," he said reflectively, " the school. That's 
 been vacant pretty often lately. What sort of 
 fellow is this Wardlaw .'' Will he stay, I wonder ? " 
 
 " From all accounts," I said, " Blaauwildebeeste- 
 fontein does not seem popular." 
 
 " It isn't. That's why we've got you out from 
 home. The colonial-born doesn't find it fit in 
 with his idea of comfort. He wants society, and 
 he doesn't like too many natives. There's nothing 
 up there but natives and a few back-veld Dutch- 
 men with native blood in them. You fellows 
 from home are less set on an easy life, or you 
 wouldn't be here." 
 
 There was something in Mr. Colles's tone which 
 made me risk another question.

## p. 44 (#50) ##############################################


 
 44 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 " What's the matter with the place ? There 
 must be more wrong with it than loneliness to 
 make everybody clear out. I have taken on this 
 job, and 1 mean to stick to it, so you needn't be 
 afraid to tell me." 
 
 The manager looked at me sharply. " That's 
 the way to talk, my lad. You look as if you had 
 a stiff back, so I'll be frank with you. There is 
 something about the place. It gives the ordinary 
 man the jumps. What it is, I don't know, and 
 the men who come back don't know themselves. 
 I want you to find out for me. You'll be doing 
 the firm an enormous service if you can get on the 
 track of it. It may be the natives, or it may be 
 the laakkaars, or it may be something else. Only 
 old Japp can stick it out, and he's too old and dod- 
 dering to care about moving. I want you to keep 
 your eyes skinned, and write privately to me if you 
 want any help. You're not out here for your 
 health, I can see, and here's a chance for you to 
 get your foot on the ladder. 
 
 " Remember, I'm your friend," he said to me 
 again at the garden gate. " Take my advice and 
 lie very low. Don't talk, don't meddle with drink, 
 learn all you can of the native jabber, but don't

 let on you understand a word. You're sure to get 
 on the track of something. Good-bye, my boy," 
 and he waved a fat hand to me. 
 
 That night I embarked on a cargo-boat which 
 was going round the coast to Delagoa Bay. It is 
 a small world — at least for us far-wandering Scots. 
 For who should I find when I got on board but 
 my old friend, Tam Dyke, who was second mate 
 on the vessel ? We wrung each other's hands, 
 and 1 answered, as best I could, his questions 
 about Kirkcaple. I had supper with him in the 
 cabin, and went on deck to see the moorings 
 cast. 
 
 Suddenly there was a bustle on the quay, and a 
 big man with a handbag forced his way up the 
 gangway. The men who were getting ready to 
 cast off tried to stop him, but he elbowed his 
 way forward, declaring he must see the captain. 
 Tam went up to him and asked civilly if he had a 
 passage taken. He admitted he had not, but said 
 he would make it right in two minutes with the 
 captain himself. The Rev. John Laputa, for some 
 reason of his own, was leaving Durban with more 
 haste than he had entered it. 
 
 I do not know what passed with the captain, but

 46 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 the minister got his passage right enough, and 
 Tarn was even turned out of his cabin to make 
 room for him. This annoyed my friend in- 
 tensely. 
 
 " That black brute must be made of money, 
 for he paid through the nose for this, or I'm a 
 Dutchman. My old man doesn't take to his 
 black brethren any more than I do. Hang it all, 
 what are we coming to, when we're turning into a 
 blooming cargo-boat for niggers ? " 
 
 I had all too little of Tarn's good company, for 
 on the afternoon of the second day we reached the 
 little town of Louren^o Marques. This was my 
 final landing in Africa, and I mind how eagerly I 
 looked at the low, green shores and the bush- 
 covered slopes of the mainland. We were landed 
 from boats while the ship lay out in the bay, and 
 Tam came ashore with me to spend the evening. 
 By this time I had lost every remnant of home- 
 sickness. I had got a job before me which prom- 
 ised better things than colleging at Edinburgh, 
 and I was as keen to get up country now as I had 
 been loth to leave England. My mind being full 
 of mysteries, I scanned every Portuguese loafer on 
 the quay as if he had been a spy, and when Tam

 and I had had a bottle of Collares in a caf(6 I felt 
 that at last I had got to foreign parts and a new 
 world. 
 
 Tarn took me to supper with a friend of his, a 
 Scot by the name of Aitken, who was landing- 
 agent for some big mining house on the Rand. 
 He hailed from Fife and gave me a hearty wel- 
 come, for he had heard my father preach in his 
 young days. Aitken was a strong, broad-shoul- 
 dered fellow who had been a sergeant in the 
 Gordons, and during the war he had done secret- 
 service work in Delagoa. He had hunted, too, and 
 traded up and down Mozambique, and knew every 
 dialect of the Kaffirs. He asked me where I was 
 bound for, and when I told him there was the 
 same look in his eyes as I had seen with the 
 Durban manager. 
 
 " You're going to a rum place, Mr. Crawfurd," 
 he said, 
 
 " So I'm told. Do you know anything about 
 it } You're not the first who has looked queer 
 when I've spoken the name." 
 
 " I've never been there," he said, " though I've 
 been pretty near it from the Portuguese side. 
 That's the funny thing about Blaauwildebeeste-

 fontein. Everybody has heard of it, and nobody 
 knows it." 
 
 " I wish you would tell me what you have 
 heard." 
 
 " Well, the natives are queer up thereaways. 
 There's some kind of a holy place which every 
 Kaffir from Algoa Bay to the Zambesi and away 
 beyond knows about. When I've been hunting 
 in the bush-veld I've often met strings of Kaffirs 
 from hundreds of miles distant, and they've all 
 been going or coming from Blaauwildebeestefontein. 
 It's like Mecca to the Mohammedans, a place they 
 go to on pilgrimage. I've heard of an old man up 
 there who is believed to be two hundred years old. 
 Anyway there's some sort of great witch or wizard 
 living in the mountains." 
 
 Aitken smoked in silence for a time ; then he 
 said, " I'll tell you another thing. I believe there's 
 a diamond mine. I've often meant to go up and 
 look for it." 
 
 Tam and I pressed him to explain, which he did 
 slowly after his fashion. 
 
 " Did you ever hear of I.D.B. — illicit diamond 
 broking ? " he asked me. " Well, its notorious that 
 the Kaffirs on the diamond fields get away with a

 fair number of stones, and they are bought by Jew 
 and Portuguese traders. It's against the law to 
 deal in them, and when I was in the Intelligence 
 here we used to have a lot of trouble with the 
 vermin. But I discovered that most of the stones 
 came from natives in one part of the country — 
 more or less round Blaauwildebeestefontein — and 
 I see no reason to think that they had all been 
 stolen from Kimberley or the Premier. Indeed 
 some of the stones I got hold of were quite dif- 
 ferent from any I had seen in South Africa before. 
 I shouldn't wonder if the Kaffirs in the Zoutpans- 
 berg had struck some rich pipe, and had the sense 
 to keep quiet about it. Maybe some day Fll take 
 a run up to see you and look into the matter." 
 
 After this the talk turned on other topics till 
 Tarn, still nursing his grievance, asked a question 
 on his own account. 
 
 " Did you ever come across a great big native 
 parson called Laputa .'' He came on board as we 
 were leaving Durban, and I had to turn out of my 
 cabin for him." Tam described him accurately 
 but vindictively, and added that " he was sure he 
 was up to no good." 
 
 Aitken shook his head. " No, I don't know the

 man. You say he landed here ? Well, I'll keep 
 a look-out for him. Big native parsons are not so 
 common." 
 
 Then 1 asked about Henriques, of whom Tarn 
 knew nothing. I described his face, his clothes, 
 and his habits. Aitken laughed uproariously. 
 
 "Tut, my man, most of the subjects of his 
 Majesty the King of Portugal would answer to 
 that description. If he's a rascal, as you think, 
 you may be certain he's in the I.D.B. business, 
 and if I'm right about Blaauwildebeestefontein 
 you'll likely have news of him there some time or 
 other. Drop me a line if he comes, and I'll get 
 on to his record." 
 
 I saw Tam off in the boat with a fairly satisfied 
 mind. I was going to a place with a secret, and I 
 meant to find it out. The natives round Blaau- 
 wildebeestefontein were queer, and diamonds were 
 suspected somewhere in the neighbourhood. Hen- 
 riques had something to do with the place, and so 
 had the Rev. John Laputa, about whom I knew one 
 strange thing. So did Tam, by the way, but he 
 had not identified his former pursuer, and I had 
 told him nothing. I was leaving two men behind 
 me, Colles at Durban and Aitken at Louren90

 Marques, who would help me if trouble came. 
 Things were shaping well for some kind of ad- 
 venture. 
 
 The talk with Aitken had given Tarn an inkling 
 of my thoughts. His last words to me were an 
 appeal to let him know if there was any fun going. 
 
 " I can see you're in for a queer job. Promise 
 to let me hear from you if there's going to be a 
 row, and I'll come up country, though I should 
 have to desert the service. Send us a letter to the 
 agents at Durban in case we should be in port. 
 You haven't forgotten the Dyve Burn, Davie .'' "

 Chapter III. 
 BLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN. 
 
 '' I "^HE "Pilgrim's Progress" had been the Sabbath 
 reading of my boyhood, and as I came in 
 sight of Blaauwildebeestefontein a passage ran in 
 my head. It was that which tells how Christian 
 and Hopefulj after many perils of the way, came to 
 the Delectable Mountains, from which they had a 
 prospect of Canaan. After many dusty miles by 
 rail, and a weariful journey in a Cape-cart through 
 arid plains and dry and stony gorges, I had come 
 suddenly into a haven of green. The Spring of 
 the Blue Wildebeeste was a clear rushing moun- 
 tain torrent, which swirled over blue rocks into 
 deep fern-fringed pools. All around was a table- 
 land of lush grass with marigolds and arum lilies 
 instead of daisies and buttercups. Thickets of 
 tall trees dotted the hill slopes and patched the 
 meadows as if some landscape-gardener had been

 at work on them. Beyond, the glen fell steeply 
 to the plains, which ran out in a faint haze to the 
 horizon. To north and south I marked the 
 sweep of the Berg, now rising high to a rocky 
 peak and now stretching in a level rampart of 
 blue. On the very edge of the plateau where the 
 road dipped for the descent stood the shanties of 
 Blaauwildebeestefontein. The fresh hill air had 
 exhilarated my mind, and the aromatic scent of 
 the evening gave the last touch of intoxication. 
 Whatever serpent might lurk in it, it was a verit- 
 able Eden I had come to. 
 
 Blaauwildebeestefontein had no more than two 
 buildings of civilized shape ; the store, which 
 stood on the left side of the river, and the school- 
 house opposite. For the rest, there were some 
 twenty native huts, higher up the slope, of the 
 type which the Duch call rondavels. The school- 
 house had a pretty garden, but the store stood 
 bare in a pitch of dust with a few outhouses and 
 sheds beside it. Round the door lay a few old 
 ploughs and empty barrels, and beneath a solitary 
 blue gum was a wooden bench with a rough table. 
 Native children played in the dust, and an old 
 Kaffir squatted by the wall.

 My few belongings were soon lifted from the 
 Cape-cart, and I entered the shop. It was the 
 ordinary pattern of up-country store — a bar in 
 one corner with an array of bottles, and all round 
 the walls tins of canned food and the odds and 
 ends of trade. The place was empty, and a cloud 
 of flies buzzed over the sugar cask. 
 
 Two doors opened at the back, and I chose the 
 one to the right. I found myself in a kind of 
 kitchen with a bed in one corner, and a litter of 
 dirty plates on the table. On the bed lay a man, 
 snoring heavily. I went close to him, and found 
 an old fellow with a bald head, clothed only in a 
 shirt and trousers. His face was red and swollen, 
 and his breath came in heavy grunts. A smell of 
 bad whisky hung over everything. I had no 
 doubt that this was Mr. Peter Japp, my senior in 
 the store. One reason for the indifferent trade at 
 Blaauwildebeestefontein was very clear to me : 
 the storekeeper was a sot. 
 
 I went back to the shop and tried the other 
 door. It was a bedroom too, but clean and 
 pleasant. A little native girl — Zeeta, I found 
 they called her — was busy tidying it up, and when 
 I entered she dropped me a curtsy. " This is

 BLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN. 55 
 
 your room, Baas," she said in very good English 
 in reply to my question. The child had been 
 well trained somewhere, for there was a cracked 
 dish full of oleander blossom on the drawers'- 
 head, and the pillow-slips on the bed were as clean 
 as I could wish. She brought me water to wash, 
 and a cup of strong tea, while I carried my baggage 
 indoors and paid the driver of the cart. Then, 
 having cleaned myself and lit a pipe, I walked 
 across the road to see Mr. Wardlaw. 
 
 I found the schoolmaster sitting under his own 
 fig-tree reading one of his Kaffir primers. Having 
 come direct by rail from Cape Town, he had been 
 a week in the place, and ranked as the second 
 oldest white resident. 
 
 " Yon's a bonny chief you've got, Davie," were 
 his first words, " For three days he's been as fou 
 as the Baltic." 
 
 I cannot pretend that the misdeeds of Mr. Japp 
 greatly annoyed me. I had the reversion of his 
 job, and if he chose to play the fool it was all in 
 my interest. But the schoolmaster was depressed 
 at the prospect of such company. " Besides you 
 and me, he's the only white man in the place. 
 It's a poor look-out on the social side."

## p. 56 (#62) ##############################################


 
 56 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 The school, it appeared, was the merest farce. 
 There were only five white children, belonging to 
 Dutch farmers in the mountains. The native 
 side was more flourishing, but the mission schools 
 in the locations got most of the native children in 
 the neighbourhood. Mr. Wardlaw's educational 
 zeal ran high. He talked of establishing a work- 
 shop and teaching carpentry and blacksmith's 
 work, of which he knew nothing. He rhapsodized 
 over the intelligence of his pupils and bemoaned 
 his inadequate gift of tongues. " You and I, 
 Davie," he said, " must sit down and grind at the 
 business. It is to the interest of both of us. 
 The Dutch is easy enough. It's a sort of kitchen 
 dialect you can learn in a fortnight. But these 
 native languages are a stiff job. Sesuto is the 
 chief hereabouts, and I'm told once you've got 
 that it's easy to get the Zulu. Then there's the 
 thing the Shangaans speak — Baronga, I think 
 they call it. I've got a Christian Kaffir living 
 up in one of the huts who comes every morn- 
 ing to talk to me for an hour. You'd better 
 join me." 
 
 I promised, and in the sweet-smelling dust 
 crossed the road to the store. Japp was still

 BLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN. 57 
 
 sleeping, so I got a bowl of mealie porridge from 
 Zeeta and went to bed. 
 
 m * * * * * 
 
 Japp was sober next morning and made me 
 some kind of apology. He had chronic lumbago, 
 he said, and " to go on the bust " now and then 
 was the best cure for it. Then he proceeded to 
 initiate me into my duties in a tone of exaggerated 
 friendliness. " I took a fancy to you the first time 
 1 clapped eyes on you," he said. " You and me 
 will be good friends, Crawfurd, I can see that. 
 You're a spirited young fellow, and you'll stand 
 no nonsense. The Dutch about here are a slim 
 lot, and the Kaffirs are slimmer. Trust no man, 
 that's my motto. The firm know that, and I've 
 had their confidence for forty years." 
 
 The first day or two things went well enough. 
 There was no doubt that, properly handled, a fine 
 trade could be done in Blaauwildebeestefontein. 
 The countryside was crawling with natives, and 
 great strings used to come through from Shangaan 
 territory on the way to the Rand mines. Besides, 
 there was business to be done with the Dutch 
 farmers, especially with the tobacco, which 1 fore- 
 saw could be worked up into a profitable export.

 58 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 There was no lack of money either, and we had 
 to give very little credit, though it was often asked 
 for. I flung myself into the work, and in a few 
 weeks had been all round the farms and locations. 
 At first Japp praised my energy, for it left him 
 plenty of leisure to sit indoors and drink. But 
 soon he grew suspicious, for he must have seen 
 that I was in a fair way to oust him altogether. 
 He was very anxious to know if I had seen Colles 
 in Durban, and what the manager had said. " I 
 have letters," he told me a hundred times, " from 
 Mr. Mackenzie himself praising me up to the 
 skies. The firm couldn't get along without old 
 Peter Japp, I can tell you." I had no wish to 
 quarrel with the old man, so I listened politely to 
 all he said. But this did not propitiate him, and 
 I soon found him so jealous as to be a nuisance. 
 He was Colonial-born and was always airing the 
 fact. He rejoiced in my rawness, and when I 
 made a blunder would crow over it for hours. 
 " It's no good, Mr. Crawfurd ; you new chums 
 from England may think yourselves mighty clever, 
 but we men from the old Colony can get ahead of 
 you every time. In fifty years you'll maybe learn 
 a little about the country, but we know all about

 it before we start." He roared with laughter 
 at my way of tying a voorslag, and he made 
 merry (no doubt with reason) on my management 
 of a horse. I kept my temper pretty well, but I 
 own there were moments when I came near to 
 kicking Mr. Japp. 
 
 The truth is he was a disgusting old ruffian. 
 His character was shown by his treatment of Zeeta. 
 The poor child slaved all day and did two men's 
 work in keeping the household going. She was 
 an orphan from a mission station, and in Japp's 
 opinion a creature without rights. Hence he 
 never spoke to her except with a curse, and used 
 to cuff her thin shoulders till my blood boiled. 
 One day things became too much for my temper. 
 Zeeta had spilled half a glass of Japp's whisky 
 while tidying up the room. He picked up a 
 sjambok, and proceeded to beat her unmercifully 
 till her cries brought me on the scene. I tore 
 the whip from his hands, seized him by the 
 scruff and flung him on a heap of potato sacks, 
 where he lay pouring out abuse and shaking 
 with rage. Then I spoke my mind. I told him 
 that if anything of the sort happened again I 
 would report it at once to Mr. Colles at Durban.

## p. 60 (#66) ##############################################


 
 6o PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 I added that before making my report I would 
 beat him within an inch of his degraded life. 
 After a time he apologized, but I could see 
 that thenceforth he regarded me with deadly 
 hatred. 
 
 There was another thing I noticed about Mr. 
 Japp. He might brag about his knowledge of 
 how to deal with natives, but to my mind his 
 methods were a disgrace to a white man. Zeeta 
 came in for oaths and blows, but there were other 
 Kaffirs whom he treated with a sort of cringing 
 friendliness. A big black fellow would swagger 
 into the shop, and be received by Japp as if he 
 were his long-lost brother. The two would col- 
 logue for hours ; and though at first I did not 
 understand the tongue, I could see that it was 
 the white man who fawned and the black man 
 who bullied. Once when Japp was away one 
 of these fellows came into the store as if it 
 belonged to him, but he went out quicker than 
 he entered. Japp complained afterwards of my 
 behaviour. " 'Mwanga is a good friend of mine," 
 he said, " and brings us a lot of business. I'll 
 thank you to be civil to him the next time." I 
 replied very shortly that 'Mwanga or anybody

 BLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN. 6 1 
 
 else who did not mend his manners would feel 
 the weight of my boot. 
 
 The thing went on, and I am not sure that 
 he did not give the Kaffirs drink on the sly. At 
 any rate, I have seen some very drunk natives 
 on the road between the locations and Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein, and some of them I recognized as 
 Japp's friends. I discussed the matter with Mr. 
 Wardlaw, who said, " I believe the old villain has 
 got some sort of black secret, and the natives 
 know it, and have got a pull on him." And 1 
 was inclined to think he was ris^ht. 
 
 By-and-by 1 began to feel the lack of company, 
 for Wardlaw was so full of his books that he was 
 of little use as a companion. So I resolved to 
 acquire a dog, and bought one from a prospector, 
 who was stony-broke and would have sold his soul 
 for a drink. It was an enormous Boer hunting:- 
 dog, a mongrel in whose blood ran mastiff and 
 bulldog and foxhound, and Heaven knows what 
 beside. In colour it was a kind of brindled red, 
 and the hair on its back P:rew afjainst the lie of 
 
 CD O 
 
 the rest of its coat. Some one had told me, or 
 I may have read it, that a back like this meant

 62 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 that a dog would face anything mortal, even to 
 a charging lion, and it was this feature which 
 first caught my fancy. The price I paid was ten 
 shillings and a pair of boots, which I got at 
 cost price from stock, and the owner departed 
 with injunctions to me to beware of the brute's 
 temper. Colin — for so I named him — began 
 his career with me by taking the seat out of my 
 breeches and frightening Mr. Wardlaw into a 
 tree. It took me a stubborn battle of a fortnight 
 to break his vice, and my left arm to-day bears 
 witness to the struggle. After that he became a 
 Second shadow, and woe betide the man who had 
 dared to raise his hand to Colin's master. Japp 
 declared that the dog was a devil, and Colin repaid 
 the compliment with a hearty dislike. 
 
 With Colin, I now took to spending some of 
 my ample leisure in exploring the fastnesses of 
 the Berg. I had brought out a shot-gun of my 
 own, and I borrowed a cheap Mauser sporting rifle 
 from the store. 1 had been born with a good 
 eye and a steady hand, and very soon I became a 
 fair shot with a gun and, I believe, a really fine 
 shot with the rifle. The sides of the Berg were 
 full of quail and partridge and bush pheasant, and

 BLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN. 6^ 
 
 on the grassy plateau there was abundance of a 
 bird not unlike our own blackcock, which the 
 Dutch called korhaan. But the great sport was 
 to stalk bush-buck in the thickets, which is a game 
 in which the hunter is at small advantage. I have 
 been knocked down by a wounded bush-buck ram, 
 and but for Colin might have been badly damaged. 
 Once, in a kloof not far from the Letaba, 1 killed 
 a fine leopard, bringing him down with a single 
 shot from a rocky shelf almost on the top of 
 Colin. His skin lies by my fireside as I write 
 this tale. But it was during the days I could spare 
 for an expedition into the plains that I proved the 
 great qualities of my dog. There we had nobler 
 game to follow — wildebeest and hartebeest, impala, 
 and now and then a koodoo. At first I was a com- 
 plete duffer, and shamed myself in Colin's eyes. 
 But by-and-by I learned something of veld-craft : 
 I learned how to follow spoor, how to allow for 
 the wind, and stalk under cover. Then, when a 
 shot had crippled the beast, Colin was on its track 
 like a flash to pull it down. The dog had the nose 
 of a retriever, the speed of a greyhound, and the 
 strength of a bull-terrier. I blessed the day when 
 the wandering prospector had passed the store.

 64 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 Colin slept at night at the foot of my bed, and 
 it was he who led me to make an important dis- 
 covery ; for I now became aware that I was being 
 subjected to constant espionage. It may have been 
 going on from the start, but it was not till my 
 third month at Blaauwildebeestefontein that I 
 found it out. One night I was going to bed, 
 when suddenly the bristles rose on the dog's 
 back and he barked uneasily at the window. I 
 had been standing in the shadow, and as I stepped 
 to the window to look out I saw a black face 
 disappear below the palisade of the backyard. The 
 incident was trifling, but it put me on my guard. 
 The next night I looked, but saw nothing. The 
 third night I looked, and caught a glimpse of a 
 face almost pressed to the pane. Thereafter I 
 put up the shutters after dark, and shifted my 
 bed to a part of the room out of line with the 
 window. 
 
 It was the same out of doors. I would sud- 
 denly be conscious, as I walked on the road, that 
 I was being watched. If I made as if to walk into 
 the roadside bush there would be a faint rustling, 
 which told that the watcher had retired. The 
 stalking was brilliantly done, for I never caught

## p. 65 (#71) ##############################################


 
 BLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN. 65 
 
 a glimpse of one of the stalkers. Wherever I 
 went — on the road, on the meadows of the plateau, 
 or on the rugged sides of the Berg — it was the 
 same. I had silent followers, who betrayed them- 
 selves now and then by the crackling of a branch, 
 and eyes were always looking at me which I could 
 not see. Only when I went down to the plains 
 did the espionage cease. This thing annoyed 
 Colin desperately, and his walks abroad were one 
 continuous growl. Once, in spite of my efforts, 
 he dashed into the thicket, and a squeal of pain 
 followed. He had got somebody by the leg, and 
 there was blood on the grass. 
 
 Since I came to Blaauwildebeestefontein I had 
 forgotten the mystery I had set out to track in 
 the excitement of a new life and my sordid con- 
 test with Japp. But now this espionage brought 
 back my old preoccupation. I was being watched 
 because some person or persons thought that I was 
 dangerous. My suspicions fastened on Japp, but 
 1 soon gave up that clue. It was my presence 
 in the store that was a danger to him, not my 
 wanderings about the countryside. It might be 
 that he had engineered the espionage so as to 
 drive me out of the place in sheer annoyance ;

## p. 66 (#72) ##############################################


 
 (iS PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 but I flattered myself that Mr. Japp knew me too 
 well to imagine that such a game was likely to 
 succeed. 
 
 The mischief was that I could not make out 
 who the trackers were. I had visited all the sur- 
 rounding locations, and was on good enough 
 terms with all the chiefs. There was 'Mpefu, 
 a dingy old fellow who had spent a good deal 
 of his life in a Boer gaol before the war. There 
 was a mission station at his place, and his 
 people seemed to me to be well behaved and 
 prosperous. Majinje was a chieftainess, a little 
 girl whom nobody was allowed to see. Her 
 location was a miserable affair, and her tribe was 
 yearly shrinking in numbers. Then there was 
 Magata further north among the mountains. He 
 had no quarrel with me, for he used to give me 
 a meal when I went out hunting in that direction ; 
 and once he turned out a hundred of his young 
 men, and I had a great battue of wild dogs. 
 Sikitola, the biggest of all, lived some distance 
 out in the flats. I knew less about him ; but if 
 his men were the trackers, they must have spent 
 most of their days a weary way from their kraal. 
 The Kaflirs in the huts at Blaauwildebeestefontein

 were mostly Christian, and quiet, decent fellows, 
 who farmed their little gardens, and certainly pre- 
 ferred me to Japp. I thought at one time of 
 riding into Pietersdorp to consult the Native Com- 
 missioner. But 1 discovered that the old man, 
 who knew the country, was gone, and that his 
 successor was a young fellow from Rhodesia, who 
 knew nothing about anything. Besides, the natives 
 round Blaauwildebeestefontein were well conducted, 
 and received few official visitations. Now and then 
 a couple of Zulu policemen passed in pursuit of 
 some minor malefactor, and the collector came 
 for the hut-tax ; but we gave the Government 
 little work, and they did not trouble their heads 
 about us. 
 
 As I have said, the clues 1 had brought out 
 with me to Blaauwildebeestefontein began to occupy 
 my mind again ; and the more I thought of the 
 business the keener I grew. I used to amuse 
 myself with setting out my various bits of know- 
 ledge. There was first of all the Rev. John 
 Laputa, his doings on the Kirkcaple shore, his talk 
 with Henriques about Blaauwildebeestefontein, and 
 his strange behaviour at Durban. Then there was 
 what Colles had told me about the place being

 68 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 queer, how nobody would stay long either in the 
 store or the schoolhouse. Then there was my 
 talk with Aitken at Louren9o Marques, and his 
 story of a great wizard in the neighbourhood to 
 whom all Kaffirs made pilgrimages, and the sus- 
 picion of a diamond pipe. Last and most 
 important, there was this perpetual spying on 
 myself. It was as clear as daylight that the place 
 held some secret, and I wondered if old Japp 
 knew. 1 was fool enough one day to ask him 
 about diamonds. He met me with contemptuous 
 laughter. "There's your ignorant Britisher," he 
 cried. " If you had ever been to Kimberley you 
 would know the look of a diamond country. 
 You're as likely to find diamonds here as ocean 
 pearls. But go out and scrape in the spruit if 
 you like ; you'll maybe find some garnets." 
 
 I made cautious inquiries, too, chiefly through 
 Mr. Wardlaw, who was becoming a great expert 
 at Kaffir, about the existence of Aitken's wizard, 
 but he could get no news. The most he found 
 out was that there was a good cure for fever 
 among Sikitola's men, and that Majinje, if she 
 pleased, could bring rain. 
 
 The upshot of it all was that, after much

 brooding, I wrote a letter to Mr. Colles, and, to 
 make sure of its going, gave it to a missionary to 
 post in Pietersdorp. I told him frankly what 
 Aitken had said, and 1 also told him about the 
 espionage. I said nothing about old Japp, for, 
 beast as he was, I did not want him at his age 
 to be without a livelihood.

 Chapter IV. 
 MY JOURNEY TO THE WINTER-VELD. 
 
 A REPLY came from Colles, addressed not to 
 ¦^^ me but to Japp. It seemed that the old 
 fellow had once suggested the establishment of 
 a branch store at a place out in the plains called 
 Umvelos', and the firm was now prepared to take 
 up the scheme. Japp was in high good humour, 
 and showed me the letter. Not a word was said 
 of what I had written about, only the bare 
 details about starting the branch. I was to get 
 a couple of masons, load up two wagons with 
 bricks and timber, and go down to Umvelos' and 
 see the store built. The stocking of it and the 
 appointment of a storekeeper would be matter for 
 further correspondence. Japp was delighted, for, 
 besides getting rid of me for several weeks, it 
 showed that his advice was respected by his 
 
 superiors. He went about bragging that the firm

 MY JOURNEY TO THE VELD. 71 
 
 could not get on without him, and was inclined 
 to be more insolent to me than usual in his new 
 self-esteem. He also got royally drunk over the 
 head of it. 
 
 I confess I was hurt by the manager's silence 
 on what seemed to me more vital matters. But 
 I soon reflected that if he wrote at all he would 
 write direct to me, and I eagerly watched for the 
 post-runner. No letter came, however, and I was 
 soon too busy with preparations to look for one. 
 I got the bricks and timber from Pietersdorp, and 
 hired two Dutch masons to run the job. The 
 place was not very far from Sikitola's kraal, so 
 there would be no difficulty about native helpers. 
 Having my eyes open for trade, I resolved to kill 
 two birds with one stone. It is the fashion among 
 the old-fashioned farmers on the high-veld to drive 
 the cattle down into the bush-veld — which they 
 call the winter-veld — for winter pasture. There 
 is no fear of red-water about that season, and the 
 grass of the plains is rich and thick compared with 
 the uplands. I discovered that some big droves 
 were passing on a certain day, and that the owners 
 and their families were travelling with them in 
 wagons. Accordingly I had a light naachtmaal

 fitted up as a sort of travelling store, and with 
 my two wagons full of building material joined the 
 caravan. I hoped to do good trade In selling little 
 luxuries to the farmers on the road and at Umvelos'. 
 
 It was a clear cold morning when we started 
 down the Berg. At first my hands were full with 
 the job of getting my heavy wagons down the 
 awesome precipice which did duty as a highway. 
 We locked the wheels with chains, and tied great 
 logs of wood behind to act as brakes. Happily 
 my drivers knew their business, but one of the 
 Boer wagons got a wheel over the edge, and it 
 was all that ten men could do to get it back 
 again. 
 
 After that the road was easier, winding down 
 the side of a slowly opening glen. I rode beside 
 the wagons, and so heavenly was the weather that 
 I was content with my own thoughts. The sky 
 was clear blue, the air warm, yet with a wintry 
 tonic in It, and a thousand aromatic scents came 
 out of the thickets. The pied birds called " Kaffir 
 queens " fluttered across the path. Below, the 
 Klein Labongo churned and foamed in a hundred 
 cascades. It's waters were no more the clear grey 
 of the " Blue Wildebeeste's Spring," but were

 growing muddy with its approach to the richer 
 soil of the plains. 
 
 Oxen travel slow, and we outspanned that night 
 half a day's march short of Umvelos'. I spent 
 the hour before sunset lounging and smoking with 
 the Dutch farmers. At first they had been silent 
 and suspicious of a newcomer, but by this time 
 I talked their taal fluently, and we were soon on 
 good terms. I recall a discussion arising about a 
 black thing in a tree about five hundred yards 
 away. I thought it was an aasvogel, but another 
 thought it was a baboon. Whereupon the oldest 
 of the party, a farmer called Coetzee, whipped up 
 his rifle and, apparently without sighting, fired. 
 A dark object fell out of the branch, and when we 
 reached it we found it a baviaan* sure enough, shot 
 through the head. "Which side are you on in 
 the next war } " the old man asked me, and, laugh- 
 ing, I told him " Yours." 
 
 After supper, the ingredients of which came 
 largely from my naachtmaal, we sat smoking and 
 talking round the fire, the women and children 
 being snug in the covered wagons. The Boers 
 were honest companionable fellows, and when I

 had made a bowl of toddy in the Scotch fashion 
 to keep out the evening chill, we all became 
 excellent friends. They asked me how I got on 
 with Japp. Old Coetzee saved me the trouble of 
 answering, for he broke in with Skelium ! Skellum I * 
 I asked him his objection to the storekeeper, but 
 he would say nothing beyond that he was too 
 thick with the natives. I fancy at some time Mr. 
 Japp had sold him a bad plough. 
 
 We spoke of hunting, and I heard long tales of 
 exploits — away on the Limpopo, in Mashonaland, 
 on the Sabi and in the Lebombo. Then we verged 
 on politics, and I listened to violent denunciations 
 of the new land tax. These were old residenters, 
 I reflected, and I might learn perhaps something 
 of value. So very carefully I repeated a tale I 
 said I had heard at Durban of a great wizard 
 somewhere in the Berg, and asked if any one knew 
 of it. They shook their heads. The natives had 
 given up witchcraft and big medicine, they said, 
 and were more afraid of a parson or a policeman 
 than any witch-doctor. Then they were starting 
 on reminiscences, when old Coetzee, who was deaf, 
 broke in and asked to have my question repeated.

 " Yes," he said, " I know. It is in the Rooirand. 
 There is a devil dwells there." 
 
 I could get no more out of him beyond the fact 
 that there was certainly a great devil there. His 
 grandfather and father had seen it, and he himself 
 had heard it roaring when he had gone there as 
 a boy to hunt. He would explain no further, and 
 went to bed. 
 
 Next morning, close to Sikitola's kraal, I bade 
 the farmers good-bye, after telling them that there 
 would be a store in my wagon for three weeks at 
 Umvelos' if they wanted supplies. We then struck 
 more to the north towards our destination. As 
 soon as they had gone I had out my map and 
 searched it for the name old Coetzee had men- 
 tioned. It was a very bad map, for there had been 
 no surveying east of the Berg, and most of the 
 names were mere guesses. But I found the word 
 " Rooirand " marking: an eastern continuation of 
 the northern wall, and probably set down from 
 some hunter's report. I had better explain here 
 the chief features of the country, for they bulk 
 largely in my story. The Berg runs north and 
 south, and from it run the chief streams which 
 water the plain. They are, beginning from thg

 south, the Olifants, the Groot Letaba, the Letsi- 
 tela, the Klein Letaba, and the Klein Labongo, on 
 which stands Blaauwildebeestefontein. But the 
 greatest river of the plain, into which the others 
 ultimately flow, is the Groot Labongo, which appears 
 full-born from some subterranean source close to 
 the place called Umvelos'. North from Blaau- 
 wildebeestefontein the Berg runs for some twenty 
 miles, and then makes a sharp turn eastward, be- 
 coming, according to my map, the Rooirand. 
 
 I pored over these details, and was particularly 
 curious about the Great Labongo. It seemed to 
 me unlikely that a spring in the bush could pro- 
 duce so great a river, and I decided that its source 
 must lie in the mountains to the north. As well 
 as I could guess, the Rooirand, the nearest part of 
 the Berg, was about fifty miles distant. Old 
 Coetzee had said that there was a devil in the 
 place, but I thought that if it were explored the 
 first thing found would be a fine stream of water. 
 
 We got to Umvelos' after midday, and out- 
 spanned for our three weeks' work. I set the 
 Dutchmen to unload and clear the ground for 
 foundations, while I went off to Sikitola to ask for 
 labourers. I got a dozen lusty blacks, and soon

 we had a business-like encampment, and the work 
 went on merrily. It was rough architecture and 
 rougher masonry. All we aimed at was a two- 
 roomed shop with a kind of outhouse for stores. 
 I was architect, and watched the marking out of 
 the foundations and the first few feet of the walls. 
 Sikitola's people proved themselves good helpers, 
 and most of the building was left to them, while 
 the Dutchmen worked at the carpentry. Bricks 
 ran short before we got very far, and we had to 
 set to brickmaking on the bank of the Labongo, 
 and finish ofi^ the walls with green bricks, which 
 gave the place a queer piebald look. 
 
 I was not much of a carpenter, and there were 
 plenty of builders without me, so I found a con- 
 siderable amount of time on my hands. At first I 
 acted as shopkeeper in the naachtmaal^ but I soon 
 cleared out my stores to the Dutch farmers and 
 the natives. I had thought of going back for more, 
 and then it occurred to me that I might profitably 
 give some of my leisure to the Rooirand. I could 
 see the wall of the mountains quite clear to the 
 north, within an easy day's ride. So one morning 
 I packed enough food for a day or two, tied my 
 sleeping-bag on my saddle, and set off to explore,

 after appointing the elder of the Dutchmen fore- 
 man of the job in my absence. 
 
 It was very hot jogging along the native path 
 with the eternal olive-green bush around me. 
 Happily there was no fear of my losing the way, 
 for the Rooirand stood very clear in front, and 
 slowly, as I advanced, I began to make out the 
 details of the cliffs. At luncheon-time, when I was 
 about half-way, I sat down with my Zeiss glass — 
 my mother's farewell gift — to look for the valley. 
 But valley I saw none. The wall — reddish purple 
 it looked, and, I thought,. of porphyry — was con- 
 tinuous and unbroken. There were chimneys and 
 fissures, but none great enough to hold a river. 
 The top was sheer cliff; then came loose kranzes 
 in tiers, like the seats in a gallery, and, below, a 
 dense thicket of trees. I raked the whole line for 
 a break, but there seemed none. " It's a bad job 
 for me," I thought, " if there is no water, for I 
 must pass the night there." 
 
 The night was spent in a sheltered nook at the 
 foot of the rocks, but my horse and I went to bed 
 without a drink. My supper was some raisins and 
 biscuits, for I did not dare to run the risk of in- 
 creasing my thirst. I had found a great bank of

 MY JOURNEY TO THE VELD. 79 
 
 debris sloping up to the kranzes, and thick wood 
 clothing all the slope. The grass seemed wonder- 
 fully fresh, but of water there was no sign. 
 There was not even the sandy channel of a stream 
 to dig in. 
 
 In the morning I had a difficult problem to face. 
 Water I must find at all costs, or I must go home. 
 There was time enough for me to get back with- 
 out suffering much, but if so I must give up 
 my explorations. This I was determined not to 
 do. The more I looked at these red cliffs the 
 more eager I was to find out their secret. There 
 must be water somewhere ; otherwise how account 
 for the lushness of the vegetation } 
 
 My horse was a veld pony, so I set him loose 
 to see what he would do. He strayed back on the 
 path to Umvelos'. This looked bad, for it meant 
 that he did not smell water along the cliff front. 
 If I was to find a stream it must be on the top, 
 and I must try a little mountaineering. 
 
 Then, taking my courage in both my hands, I 
 decided. I gave my pony a cut, and set him off 
 on the homeward road. 1 knew he was safe to get 
 back in four or five hours, and in broad day there 
 was little fear of wild beasts attacking him. I had

 8o PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 tied my sleeping-bag on to the saddle, and had 
 with me but two pocketfuls of food. I had also 
 fastened on the saddle a letter to my Dutch fore- 
 man, bidding him send a native with a spare horse 
 to fetch me by the evening. Then I started off to 
 look for a chimney. 
 
 A boyhood spent on the cliffs at Kirkcaple had 
 made me a bold cragsman, and the porphyry of 
 the Rooirand clearly gave excellent holds. But I 
 walked many weary miles along the cliff-foot before 
 I found a feasible road. To begin with, it was no 
 light task to fight one's way through the dense 
 undergrowth of the lower slopes. Every kind of 
 thorn bush lay in wait for my skin, creepers tripped 
 me up, high trees shut out the light, and I was in 
 mortal fear lest a black mamba might appear out of 
 the tangle. It grew very hot, and the screes above 
 the thicket were blistering to the touch. My 
 tongue, too, stuck to the roof of my mouth with 
 thirst. 
 
 The first chimney I tried ran out on the face 
 into nothingness, and I had to make a dangerous 
 descent. The second was a deep gully, but so 
 choked with rubble that after nearly braining 
 myself I desisted. Still going eastwards, I found

 MY JOURNEY TO THE VELD. 8i 
 
 a sloping ledge which took me to a platform from 
 which ran a crack with a little tree growing in it. 
 My glass showed me that beyond this tree the 
 crack broadened into a clearly defined chimney 
 which led to the top. If I can once reach that 
 tree, I thought, the battle is won. 
 
 The crack was only a few inches wide, large 
 enough to let in an arm and a foot, and it ran 
 slantwise up a perpendicular rock. I do not think 
 I realized how bad it was till 1 had gone too far to 
 return. Then my foot jammed, and I paused for 
 breath with my legs and arms cramping rapidly. 
 I remember that I looked to the west, and saw 
 through the sweat which kept dropping into my 
 eyes that about half a mile off a piece of cliff which 
 looked unbroken from the foot had a fold in it to 
 the right. The darkness of the fold showed me 
 that it was a deep, narrow gully. However, I had 
 no time to think of this, for I was fast in the 
 middle of my confounded crack. With immense 
 labour 1 found a chockstone above my head, and 
 managed to force my foot free. The next few 
 yards were not so difficult, and then I stuck once 
 more. 
 
 For the crack suddenly grew shallow as the cliff

 82 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 bulged out above me. I had almost given up 
 hope, when I saw that about three feet above 
 my head grew the tree. If I could reach it 
 and swing out I might hope to pull myself up 
 to the ledge on which it grew. I confess it 
 needed all my courage, for I did not know but 
 that the tree might be loose, and that it and I 
 might go rattling down four hundred feet. It 
 was my only hope, however, so I set my teeth, 
 and wriggling up a few inches, made a grab at 
 it. Thank God it held, and with a great effort 
 I pulled my shoulder over the ledge, and breathed 
 freely. 
 
 My difficulties were not ended, but the worst 
 was past. The rest of the gully gave me good 
 and safe climbing, and presently a very limp and 
 weary figure lay on the cliff-top. It took me 
 many minutes to get back my breath and to 
 conquer the faintness which seized me as soon as 
 the need for exertion was over. 
 
 When 1 scrambled to my feet and looked 
 round, I saw a wonderful prospect. It was a 
 plateau like the high-veld, only covered with 
 bracken and little bushes like hazels. Three or 
 four miles off the ground rose, and a shallow vale

 MY JOURNEY TO THE VELD. 83 
 
 opened. But in the foreground, half a mile or so 
 distant, a lake lay gleaming in the sun. 
 
 I could scarcely believe my eyes as I ran towards 
 it, and doubts of a mirage haunted me. But it 
 was no mirage, but a real lake, perhaps three miles 
 in circumference, with bracken-fringed banks, a 
 shore of white pebbles, and clear deep blue water. 
 I drank my fill, and then stripped and swam in 
 the blessed coolness. After that I ate some 
 luncheon, and sunned myself on a flat rock. " I 
 have discovered the source of the Labongo," I 
 said to myself. " I will write to the Royal Geo- 
 graphical Society, and they will give me a medal." 
 
 I walked round the lake to look for an outlet. 
 A fine mountain stream came in at the north end, 
 and at the south end, sure enough, a considerable 
 river debouched. My exploring zeal redoubled, 
 and I followed its course in a delirium of expecta- 
 tion. It was a noble stream, clear as crystal, and 
 very unlike the muddy tropical Labongo at Um- 
 velos'. Suddenly, about a quarter of a mile from 
 the lake, the land seemed to grow over it, and 
 with a swirl and a hollow roar, it disappeared into 
 a pot-hole. I walked a few steps on, and from 
 below my feet came the most uncanny rumbling

 84 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 and groaning. Then I knew what old Coetzee's 
 devil was that howled in the Rooirand. 
 
 Had I continued my walk to the edge of the 
 cliff, I might have learned a secret which would 
 have stood me in good stead later. But the 
 descent began to make me anxious, and I retraced 
 my steps to the top of the chimney whence I had 
 come. I was resolved that nothing would make 
 me descend by that awesome crack, so I kept on 
 eastward along the top to look for a better way. 
 I found one about a mile farther on, which, though 
 far from easy, had no special risks save from the 
 appalling looseness of the debris. When I got 
 down at length, I found that it was near sunset. 
 I went to the place I had bidden my native look 
 for me at, but, as I had feared, there was no sign of 
 him. So, making the best of a bad job, 1 had 
 supper and a pipe, and spent a very chilly night in 
 a hole among the boulders. 
 
 I got up at dawn stiff and cold, and ate a 
 few raisins for breakfast. There was no sign of 
 horses, so I resolved to fill up the time in looking 
 for the fold of the cliff which, as I had seen from 
 the horrible crack of yesterday, contained a gully. 
 It was a difficult job, for to get the sidelong view

## p. 85 (#91) ##############################################


 
 MY JOURNEY TO THE VELD. 85 
 
 of the cliff I had to scramble through the under- 
 growth of the slopes again, and even a certain way 
 up the kranzes. At length I got my bearings, 
 and fixed the place by some tall trees in the bush. 
 Then I descended and walked westwards. 
 
 Suddenly, as I neared the place, I heard the 
 strangest sound coming from the rocks. It was 
 a deep muffled groaning, so eerie and unearthly 
 that for the moment I stood and shivered. Then I 
 remembered my river of yesterday. It must be 
 above this place that it descended into the earth, 
 and in the hush of dawn the sound was naturally 
 louder. No wonder old Coetzee had been afraid of 
 devils. It reminded me of the lines in Marmion — 
 
 " Diving as if condemned to lave 
 Some demon's subterranean cave, 
 Who, prisoned by enchanter's spell. 
 Shakes the dark rock with groan and yell." 
 
 While I was standing awestruck at the sound, I 
 observed a figure moving towards the cliffs. I 
 was well in cover, so I could not have been noticed. 
 It was a very old man, very tall, but bowed in the 
 shoulders, who was walking slowly with bent head. 
 He could not have been thirty yards from me, so 
 I had a clear view of his face. He was a native,

 86 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 but of a type I had never seen before. A long 
 white beard fell on his breast, and a magnificent 
 kaross of leopard skin covered his shoulders. His 
 face was seamed and lined and shrunken, so that 
 he seemed as old as Time itself. 
 
 Very carefully I crept after him, and found 
 myself opposite the fold where the gully was. 
 There was a clear path through the jungle, a path 
 worn smooth by many feet. I followed it through 
 the undergrowth and over the screes till it turned 
 inside the fold of the gully. And then it stopped 
 short. I was in a deep cleft, but in front was a 
 slab of sheer rock. Above, the gully looked darker 
 and deeper, but there was this great slab to pass. 
 I examined the sides, but they were sheer rock 
 with no openings. 
 
 Had I had my wits about me, I would have 
 gone back and followed the spoor, noting where it 
 stopped. But the whole thing looked black magic 
 to me ; my stomach was empty and my enterprise 
 small. Besides, there was the terrible moaning of 
 the Imprisoned river in my ears. 1 am ashamed 
 to confess it, but I ran from that gully as if the 
 devil and all his angels had been following me. 
 Indeed I did not slacken till I had put a good

 mile between me and those uncanny cliffs. After 
 that I set out to foot it back. If the horses would 
 not come to me 1 must go to them. 
 
 I walked twenty-five miles in a vile temper, 
 enraged at my Dutchmen, my natives and every- 
 body. The truth is I had been frightened, and 
 my pride was sore about it. It grew very hot, 
 the sand rose and choked me, the mopani trees 
 with their dull green wearied me, the " Kaffir 
 queens " and jays and rollers which flew about 
 the path seemed to be there to mock me. About 
 half-way home I found a boy and two horses, and 
 roundly I cursed him. It seemed that my pony 
 had returned right enough, and the boy had been 
 sent to fetch me. He had got half-way before 
 sunset the night before, and there he had stayed. 
 I discovered from him that he was scared to death, 
 and did not dare to go any nearer the Rooirand. 
 It was accursed, he said, for it was an abode of 
 devils, and only wizards went near it. I was 
 bound to admit to myself that I could not blame 
 him. At last I had got on the track of something 
 certain about this mysterious country, and all the 
 way back I wondered if I should have the courage 
 to follow it up.

 MR. WARDLAW HAS A PREMONITION. 
 
 A WEEK later the building job was finished, I 
 locked the door of the new store, pocketed 
 the key, and we set out for home. Sikitola was 
 entrusted with the general care of it, and 1 knew 
 him well enough to be sure that he would keep 
 his people from doing mischief, I left my empty 
 wagons to follow at their leisure and rode on, with 
 the result that I arrived at Blaauwildebeestefontein 
 two days before I was looked for. 
 
 I stabled my horse, and went round to the back 
 to see Colin. (I had left him at home in case of 
 fights with native dogs, for he was an ill beast in 
 a crowd.) 1 found him well and hearty, for Zeeta 
 had been looking after him. Then some whim 
 seized me to enter the store through my bedroom 
 window. It was open, and I crawled softly in to 
 find the room fresh and clean from Zeeta's care.

## p. 89 (#95) ##############################################


 
 MR. WARDLAW'S PREMONITION. 89 
 
 The door was ajar, and, hearing voices, I peeped 
 into the shop. 
 
 Japp was sitting on the counter talking in a low 
 voice to a big native — the same 'Mwanga whom I 
 had bundled out unceremoniously. I noticed that 
 the outer door giving on the road was shut, a 
 most unusual thing in the afternoon. Japp had 
 some small objects in his hand, and the two were 
 evidently arguing about a price. I had no inten- 
 tion at first of eavesdropping, and was just about 
 to push the door open, when something in Japp's 
 face arrested me. He was up to no good, and I 
 thought it my business to wait. 
 
 The low tones went on for a little, both men 
 talking in Kaffir, and then Japp lifted up one of 
 the little objects between finger and thumb. It 
 was a small roundish stone about the size of a 
 bean, but even in that half light there was a dull 
 lustre in it. 
 
 At that I shoved the door open and went in. 
 Both men started as if they had been shot. Japp 
 went as white as his mottled face permitted. 
 "What the — " he gasped, and he dropped the 
 thing he was holding. 
 
 I picked it up, and laid it on the counter.

 " So," I said, " diamonds, Mr. Japp. You have 
 found the pipe I was looking for. I congratulate 
 you. 
 
 My words gave the old ruffian his cue. " Yes, 
 yes," he said, " I have, or rather my friend 'Mwanga 
 has. He has just been telling me about it." 
 
 The Kaffir looked miserably uncomfortable. 
 He shifted from one leg to the other, casting long- 
 ing glances at the closed door. 
 
 " I tink I go," he said. " Afterwards we will 
 speak more." 
 
 I told him I thought he had better go, and 
 opened the door for him. Then I bolted it again, 
 and turned to Mr. Japp. 
 
 " So that's your game," I said. " I thought 
 there was something funny about you, but I didn't 
 know it was I.D.B. you were up to." 
 
 He looked as if he could kill me. For five 
 minutes he cursed me with a perfection of phrase 
 which I had thought beyond him. It was no 
 I.D.B., he declared, but a pipe which 'Mwanga had 
 discovered. 
 
 " In this kind of country ? " I said, quoting his 
 own words. " Why, you might as well expect to 
 find ocean pearls as diamonds. But scrape in

 the spruit If you like ; you'll maybe find some 
 garnets." 
 
 He choked down his wrath, and tried a new 
 tack. " What will you take to hold your tongue ? 
 I'll make you a rich man if you'll come in with 
 me." And then he started with offers which 
 showed that he had been making a good thing 
 out of the traffic. 
 
 I stalked over to him, and took him by the 
 shoulder. "You old reprobate," I roared, "if 
 you breathe such a proposal to me again, I'll tie 
 you up like a sack and carry you to Pietersdorp." 
 
 At this he broke down and wept maudlin tears, 
 disgusting to witness. He said he was an old 
 man who had always lived honestly, and it would 
 break his heart if his grey hairs were to be dis- 
 graced. As he sat rocking himself with his hands 
 over his face, I saw his wicked little eyes peering 
 through the slits of his fingers to see what my 
 next move would be. 
 
 " See here, Mr. Japp," I said, " I'm not a police 
 spy, and it's no business of mine to inform against 
 you. I'm willing to keep you out of gaol, but it 
 must be on my own conditions. The first is that 
 you resign this job and clear out. You will write

## p. 92 (#98) ##############################################


 
 92 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 to Mr. Colles a letter at my dictation, saying that 
 you find the work too much for you. The second 
 is that for the time you remain here the diamond 
 business must utterly cease. If 'Mwanga or any- 
 body like him comes inside the store, and if I get 
 the slightest hint that you're back at the trade, in 
 you go to Pietersdorp. I'm not going to have 
 my name disgraced by being associated with you. 
 The third condition is that when you leave this 
 place you go clear away. If you come within 
 twenty miles of Blaauwildebeestefontein and I find 
 you, I will give you up." 
 
 He groaned and writhed at my terms, but in 
 the end accepted them. He wrote the letter, and 
 I posted it. I had no pity for the old scamp, who 
 had feathered his nest well. Small wonder that 
 the firm's business was not as good as it might be, 
 when Japp was giving most of his time to buying 
 diamonds from native thieves. The secret put 
 him in the power of any Kaffir who traded him 
 a stone. No wonder he cringed to ruffians like 
 'Mwanga. 
 
 The second thing I did was to shift my quarters. 
 Mr. Wardlaw had a spare room which he had 
 offered me before, and now I accepted it. I wanted

 MR. WARDLAW'S PREMONITION. 93 
 
 to be no more mixed up with Japp than I could 
 help, for I did not know what villainy he might 
 let me In for. Moreover, I carried Zeeta with me, 
 being ashamed to leave her at the mercy of the old 
 bully, Japp went up to the huts and hired a 
 slattern to mind his house, and then drank heavily 
 for three days to console himself. 
 
 That night I sat smoking with Mr. Wardlaw in 
 his sitting-room, where a welcome fire burned, for 
 the nights on the Berg were chilly. I remember 
 the occasion well for the queer turn the conversa- 
 tion took. Wardlaw, as I have said, had been 
 working like a slave at the Kaffir tongues. I 
 talked a kind of Zulu well enough to make my- 
 self understood, and I could follow it when spoken ; 
 but he had real scholarship in the thing, and knew 
 all about the grammar and the different dialects. 
 Further, he had read a lot about native history, 
 and was full of the doings of Chaka and Mosili- 
 katse and Moshesh, and the kings of old. Having 
 little to do in the way of teaching, he had made 
 up for it by reading omnlvorously. He used to 
 borrow books from the missionaries, and he must 
 have spent half his salary in buying new ones.

 To-night as he sat and puffed In his arm-chair, 
 he was full of stories about a fellow called Mono- 
 motapa. It seems he was a great black emperor 
 whom the Portuguese discovered about the six- 
 teenth century. He lived to the north in Ma- 
 shonaland, and had a mountain full of gold. The 
 Portuguese did not make much of him, but they 
 got his son and turned him into a priest. 
 
 I told Wardlaw that he was most likely only 
 a petty chief, whose exploits were magnified by 
 distance, the same as the caciques in Mexico. 
 But the schoolmaster would not accept this. 
 
 " He must have been a big man, Davie. You 
 know that the old ruins in Rhodesia, called Zim- 
 babwe, were long believed to be Phoenician in 
 origin. I have a book here which tells all about 
 them. But now it is believed that they were built 
 by natives. I maintain that the men who could 
 erect piles like that " — and he showed me a 
 picture — " were something more than petty 
 chiefs." 
 
 Presently the object of this conversation appeared. 
 Mr. Wardlaw thought that we were underrating 
 the capacity of the native. This opinion was 
 natural enough in a schoolmaster, but not in the

 precise form Wardlaw put it. It was not his in- 
 telligence which he thought we underrated, but his 
 dangerousness. His reasons, shortly, were these : 
 There were five or six of them to every white 
 man ; they were all, roughly speaking, of the same 
 stock, with the same tribal beliefs ; they had only 
 just ceased being a warrior race, with a powerful 
 military discipline ; and, most important, they lived 
 round the rim of the high-veld plateau, and if they 
 combined could cut off the white man from the 
 sea. I pointed out to him that it would only be 
 a matter of time before we opened the road again. 
 " Ay," he said, " but think of what would happen 
 before then. Think of the lonely farms and the 
 little dorps wiped out of the map. It would be 
 a second and bloodier Indian Mutiny. 
 
 " I'm not saying it's likely," he went on, " but 
 I maintain it's possible. Supposing a second Chaka 
 turned up, who could get the different tribes to 
 work together. It wouldn't be so very hard to 
 smuggle in arms. Think of the long, unwatched 
 coast in Gazaland and Tongaland. If they got 
 a leader with prestige enough to organize a crusade 
 against the white man, I don't see what could 
 prevent a rising."

 " We should get wind of it in time to crush it 
 at the start," I said. 
 
 " I'm not so sure. They are cunning fellows, 
 and have arts that we know nothing about. You 
 have heard of native telepathy. They can send 
 news over a thousand miles as quick as the tele- 
 graph, and we have no means of tapping the wires. 
 If they ever combined they could keep it as secret 
 as the grave. My houseboy might be in the 
 rising, and I would never suspect it till one fine 
 morning he cut my throat." 
 
 " But they would never find a leader. If there 
 was some exiled prince of Chaka's blood, who 
 came back like Prince Charlie to free his people, 
 there might be danger ; but their royalties are fat 
 men with top hats and old frock coats, who live in 
 dirty locations." 
 
 Wardlaw admitted this, but said that there 
 might be other kinds of leaders. He had been 
 reading a lot about Ethiopianism, which educated 
 American negroes had been trying to preach in 
 South Africa. He did not see why a kind of 
 bastard Christianity should not be the motive of a 
 rising. " The Kaffir finds it an easy job to mix 
 up Christian emotion and pagan practice. Look

 at Hayti and some of the performances in the 
 Southern States." 
 
 Then he shook the ashes out of his pipe and 
 leaned forward with a solemn face. "I'll admit 
 the truth to you, Davie. I'm black afraid." 
 
 He looked so earnest and serious sitting there 
 with his short-sighted eyes peering at me that I 
 could not help being impressed. 
 
 " Whatever is the matter ? " I asked. " Has 
 anything happened ? " 
 
 He shook his head. " Nothing I can put a 
 name to. But I have a presentiment that some 
 mischief is afoot in these hills. I feel it in my 
 bones." 
 
 I confess I was startled by these words. You 
 must remember that I had never given a hint of 
 my suspicions to Mr. Wardlaw beyond asking 
 him if a wizard lived in the neighbourhood — a 
 question anybody might have put. But here was 
 the schoolmaster discovering for himself some 
 mystery in Blaauwildebeestefontein. 
 
 I tried to get at his evidence, but it was very 
 little. He thought there were an awful lot of 
 blacks about. " The woods are full of them," he 
 said. I gathered he did not imagine he was being

 spied on, but merely felt that there were more 
 natives about than could be explained. 
 
 "There's another thing," he said. "The 
 native bairns have all left the school. I've only 
 three scholars left, and they are from Dutch farms. 
 I went to Majinje to find out what was up, and 
 an old crone told me the place was full of bad 
 men. I tell you, Davie, there's something brew- 
 mg, and that something is not good for us." 
 
 There was nothing new to me in what Wardlaw 
 had to tell, and yet that talk late at night by a 
 dying fire made me feel afraid for the second time 
 since I had come to Blaauwildebeestefontein. I 
 had a clue and had been on the look-out for 
 mysteries, but that another should feel the strange- 
 ness for himself made it seem desperately real to 
 me. Of course I scoffed at Mr. Wardlaw's fears. 
 I could not have him spoiling all my plans by 
 crying up a native rising for which he had not a 
 scrap of evidence. 
 
 " Have you been writing to anybody ? " I asked 
 him. 
 
 He said that he had told no one, but he meant 
 to, unless things got better. " I haven't the nerve 
 for this job, Davie," he said ; " I'll have to resign.

 And it's a pity, for the place suits my health fine. 
 You see I know too much, and I haven't your 
 whinstone nerve and total lack of imagination." 
 
 I told him that it was simply fancy, and came 
 from reading too many books and taking too little 
 exercise. But 1 made him promise to say nothing 
 to anybody either by word of mouth or letter, 
 without telling me first. Then I made a rummer 
 of toddy and sent him to bed a trifle comforted. 
 
 The first thing I did in my new room was to 
 shift the bed into the corner out of line with the 
 window. There were no shutters, so I put up an 
 old table-top and jammed it between the window 
 frames. Also, I loaded my shot gun and kept it 
 by my bedside. Had Wardlaw seen these pre- 
 parations he might have thought more of my 
 imagination and less of my nerve. It was a real 
 comfort to me to put out a hand in the darkness 
 and feel Colin's shaggy coat.

 THE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET. 
 
 JAPP was drunk for the next day or two, and I 
 had the business of the store to myself. I 
 was glad of this, for it gave me leisure to reflect 
 upon the various perplexities of my situation. As 
 I have said, 1 was really scared, more out of a 
 sense of impotence than from dread of actual 
 danger. 1 was in a fog of uncertainty. Things 
 were happening around me which I could only 
 dimly guess at, and I had no power to take one 
 step in defence. That Wardlaw should have felt 
 the same without any hint from me was the final 
 proof that the mystery was no figment of my 
 nerves. I had written to CoUes and got no 
 answer. Now the letter with Japp's resignation 
 in it had gone to Durban. Surely some notice 
 would be taken of that. If I was given the post, 
 CoUes was bound to consider what 1 had said in

 my earlier letter and give me some directions. 
 Meanwhile it was my business to stick to my job 
 till I was relieved. 
 
 A change had come over the place during my 
 absence. The natives had almost disappeared 
 from sight. Except the few families living round 
 Blaauwildebeestefontein one never saw a native on 
 the roads, and none came into the store. They 
 were sticking close to their locations, or^else they 
 had gone after some distant business. Except a 
 batch of three Shangaans returning from the Rand, 
 I had nobody in the store for the whole of one 
 day. So about four o'clock 1 shut it up, whistled 
 on Colin, and went for a walk along the Berg. 
 
 If there were no natives on the road, there were 
 plenty in the bush. I had the impression, of 
 which Wardlaw had spoken, that the native 
 population of the countryside had suddenly been 
 hugely increased. The woods were simply botch- 
 ing with them. 1 was being spied on as before, 
 but now there were so many at the business that 
 they could not all conceal their tracks. Every 
 now and then I had a glimpse of a black shoulder 
 or leg, and Colin, whom I kept on the leash, was 
 half-mad with excitement. I had seen all I

 I02 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 wanted, and went home with a preoccupied mind. 
 I sat long on Wardlaw's garden-seat, trying to 
 puzzle out the truth of this spying. 
 
 What perplexed me was that I had been left 
 unmolested when I had gone to Umvelos'. Now, 
 as I conjectured, the secret of the neighbourhood, 
 whatever it was, was probably connected with the 
 Rooirand. But when I had ridden in that direc- 
 tion and had spent two days in exploring, no one 
 had troubled to watch me. I was quite certain 
 about this, for my eye had grown quick to note 
 espionage, and it is harder for a spy to hide in the 
 spare bush of the flats than in the dense thickets 
 on these uplands. 
 
 The watchers, then, did not mind my fossicking 
 round their sacred place. Why, then, was I so 
 closely watched in the harmless neighbourhood of 
 the store ? I thought for a long time before an 
 answer occurred to me. The reason must be that 
 going to the plains I was going into native country 
 and away from civilization. But Blaauwildebeeste- 
 fontein was near the frontier. There must be 
 some dark business brewing of which they may 
 have feared that I had an inkling. They wanted 
 to see if I proposed to go to Pietersdorp or Wes-

 selsburg and tell what I knew, and they clearly 
 were resolved that I should not. I laughed, I 
 remember, thinking that they had forgotten the 
 post-bag. But then 1 reflected that I knew noth- 
 ing of what might be happening daily to the 
 post-bag. 
 
 When I had reached this conclusion, my first 
 impulse was to test it by riding straight west on 
 the main road. If I was right, I should certainly 
 be stopped. On second thoughts, however, this 
 seemed to me to be flinging up the game pre- 
 maturely, and I resolved to wait a day or two 
 before acting. 
 
 Next day nothing happened, save that my sense 
 of loneliness increased. I felt that I was being 
 hemmed in by barbarism, and cut off^ in a ghoulish 
 land from the succour of my own kind. I only 
 kept my courage up by the necessity of presenting 
 a brave face to Mr. Wardlaw, who was by this 
 time in a very broken condition of nerves. I had 
 often thought that it was my duty to advise him 
 to leave, and to see him safely ofi^, but I shrank 
 from severing myself from my only friend. I 
 thought, too, of the few Dutch farmers within 
 riding distance, and had half a mind to visit them.

 but they were far over the plateau and could know 
 little of my anxieties. 
 
 The third day events moved faster. Japp was 
 sober and wonderfully quiet. He gave me good 
 morning quite in a friendly tone, and set to posting 
 up the books as if he had never misbehaved in his 
 days. I was so busy with my thoughts that I, 
 too, must have been gentler than usual, and the 
 morning passed like a honeymoon till I went 
 across to dinner. 
 
 I was just sitting down when I remembered that 
 I had left my watch in my waistcoat behind the 
 counter, and started to go back for it. But at the 
 door I stopped short. For two horsemen had 
 drawn up before the store. 
 
 One was a native with what I took to be 
 saddlebags ; the other was a small slim man with 
 a sun helmet, who was slowly dismounting. Some- 
 thing in the cut of his jib struck me as familiar. 
 I slipped into the empty schoolroom and stared 
 hard. Then, as he half-turned in handing his 
 bridle to the Kaffir, I got a sight of his face. It 
 was my former shipmate, Henriques. He said 
 something to his companion, and entered the 
 store.

## p. 105 (#111) ############################################


 
 THE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET. 105 
 
 You may imagine that my curiosity ran to 
 fever-heat. My first impulse was to march over 
 for my waistcoat, and make a third with Japp at 
 the interview. Happily I reflected in time that 
 Henriques knew my face, for I had grown no 
 beard, having a great dislike to needless hair. If 
 he was one of the villains in the drama, he would 
 mark me down for his vengeance once he knew I 
 was here, whereas at present he had probably for- 
 gotten all about me. Besides, if I walked in 
 boldly I would get no news. If Japp and he had 
 a secret, they would not blab it in my presence. 
 
 My next idea was to slip in by the back to the 
 room I had once lived in. But how was I to 
 cross the road } It ran white and dry some distance 
 each way in full view of the Kaffir with the horses. 
 Further, the store stood on a bare patch, and it 
 would be a hard job to get in by the back, assum- 
 ing, as 1 believed, that the neighbourhood was 
 thick with spies. 
 
 The upshot was that 1 got my glasses and 
 turned them on the store. The door was open, 
 and so was the window. In the gloom of the 
 interior I made out Henriques' legs. He was 
 standing by the counter, and apparently talking to

 io6 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 Japp. He moved to shut the door, and came 
 back inside my focus opposite the window. There 
 he stayed for maybe ten minutes, while I hugged 
 my impatience. I would have given a hundred 
 pounds to be snug in my old room with Japp 
 thinking me out of the store. 
 
 Suddenly the legs twitched up, and his boots 
 appeared above the counter. Jap had invited him 
 to his bedroom, and the game was now to be 
 played beyond my ken. This was more than I 
 could stand, so I stole out at the back door and 
 took to the thickest bush on the hillside. My 
 notion was to cross the road half a mile down, 
 where it had dropped into the defile of the stream, 
 and then to come swiftly up the edge of the water 
 so as to effect a back entrance into the store. 
 
 As fast as I dared I tore through the bush, and 
 in about a quarter of an hour had reached the 
 point I was making for. Then I bore down to 
 the road, and was in the scrub about ten yards off 
 it, when the clatter of horses pulled me up again. 
 Peeping out I saw that it was my friend and his 
 Kaffir follower, who were riding at a very good 
 pace for the plains. Toilfully and crossly I re- 
 turned on my tracks to my long-delayed dinner.

## p. 107 (#113) ############################################


 
 THE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET. 107 
 
 Whatever the purport of their talk, Japp and the 
 Portuguese had not taken long over it. 
 
 In the store that afternoon 1 said casually to 
 Japp that I had noticed visitors at the door during 
 my dinner hour. The old man looked me frankly 
 enough in the face. " Yes, it was Mr. Hendricks," 
 he said, and explained that the man was a Por- 
 tuguese trader from Delagoa way, who had a lot of 
 Kaffir stores east of the Lebombo Hills. I asked 
 his business, and was told that he always gave Japp 
 a call in when he was passing. 
 
 "Do you take every man that calls into your 
 bedroom, and shut the door .^^ " I asked. 
 
 Japp lost colour and his lip trembled. " I 
 swear to God, Mr. Crawfurd, I've been doing 
 nothing wrong. I've kept the promise I gave you 
 like an oath to my mother. I see you suspect 
 me, and maybe you've cause, but I'll be quite 
 honest with you. I have dealt in diamonds before 
 this with Hendricks. But to-day, when he asked 
 me, I told him that that business was off. I only 
 took him to my room to give him a drink. He 
 likes brandy, and there's no supply in the shop." 
 
 I distrusted Japp wholeheartedly enough, but I 
 was convinced that in this case he spoke the truth.

## p. 108 (#114) ############################################


 
 io8 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 " Had the man any news ? " I asked. 
 
 " He had and he hadn't," said Japp. " He 
 was always a sullen beggar, and never spoke much. 
 But he said one queer thing. He asked me if I 
 was going to retire, and when I told him 'yes,' 
 he said I had put it off rather long. I told him I 
 was as healthy as I ever was, and he laughed in his 
 dirty Portugoose way. * Yes, Mr. Japp,* he says, 
 ' but the country is not so healthy.' I wonder 
 what the chap meant. He'll be dead of black- 
 water before many months, to judge by his eyes." 
 
 This talk satisfied me about Japp, who was 
 clearly in desperate fear of offending me, and 
 disinclined to return for the present to his old 
 ways. But I think the rest of the afternoon was 
 the most wretched time in my existence. It was 
 as plain as daylight that we were in for some grave 
 trouble, trouble to which I believed that I alone 
 held any kind of clue. I had a pile of evidence— 
 the visit of Henriques was the last bit — which 
 pointed to some great secret approaching its dis- 
 closure. 1 thought that that disclosure meant 
 blood and ruin. But I knew nothing definite. If 
 the commander of a British army had come to me 
 then and there and offered help, I could have done

 THE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET. 109 
 
 nothing, only asked him to wait like me. The peril, 
 whatever it was, did not threaten me only, though 
 I and Wardlaw and Japp might be the first to 
 suffer ; but I had a terrible feeling that I alone 
 could do something to ward it off, and just what 
 that something was I could not tell. I was horri- 
 bly afraid, not only of unknown death, but of my 
 impotence to play any manly part. I was alone, 
 knowing too much and yet too little, and there 
 was no chance of help under the broad sky. I 
 cursed myself for not writing to Aitken at Lou- 
 ren9o Marques weeks before. He had promised 
 to come up, and he was the kind of man who kept 
 his word. 
 
 In the late afternoon I dragged Wardlaw out for 
 a walk. In his presence I had to keep up a forced 
 cheerfulness, and I believe the pretence did me 
 good. We took a path up the Berg among 
 groves of stinkwood and essenwood, where a 
 falling stream made an easy route. It may have 
 been fancy, but it seemed to me that the wood 
 was emptier and that we were followed less closely. 
 I remember it was a lovely evening, and in the 
 clear fragrant gloaming every foreland of the Berg 
 stood out like a great ship above the dark green

 sea of the bush. When we reached the edge 
 of the plateau we saw the sun sinking between 
 two far blue peaks in Makapan's Country, and 
 away to the south the great roll of the high 
 veld. I longed miserably for that country where 
 white men were thronged together in dorps and 
 cities. 
 
 As we gazed a curious sound struck our ears. 
 It seemed to begin far up in the north — a low roll 
 like the combina: of breakers on the sand. Then 
 it grew louder and travelled nearer — a roll, with 
 sudden spasms of harsher sound in it ; reminding 
 me of the churning in one of the pot-holes of 
 Kirkcaple cliffs. Presently it grew softer again as 
 the sound passed south, but new notes were always 
 emerging. The echo came sometimes, as it were, 
 from stark rock, and sometimes from the deep 
 gloom of the forests. I have never heard an eerier 
 sound. Neither natural nor human it seemed, but 
 the voice of that world between which is hid from 
 man's sight and hearing. 
 
 Mr. Wardlaw clutched my arm, and in that 
 moment 1 guessed the explanation. The native 
 drums were beating, passing some message from 
 the far north down the line of the Berg, where the

 THE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET, iii 
 
 locations were thickest, to the great black popula- 
 tions of the south. 
 
 "But that means war," Mr. Wardlaw cried. 
 
 " it means nothing of the kind," I said shortly. 
 " It's their way of sending news. It's as likely to 
 be some change in the weather or an outbreak of 
 cattle disease." 
 
 When we got home I found Japp with a face 
 like grey paper. " Did you hear the drums ? " he 
 asked. 
 
 " Yes," I said shortly. " What about them .?" 
 
 " God forgive you for an ignorant Britisher," he 
 almost shouted. " You may hear drums any 
 night, but a drumming like that I only once heard 
 before. It was in '79 in the 'Zeti valley. Do you 
 know what happened next day ? Cetewayo's impis 
 came over the hills, and in an hour there wasn't a 
 living white soul in the glen. Two men escaped, 
 and one of them was called Peter Japp." 
 
 "We are in God's hands then, and must wait 
 on His will," I said solemnly. 
 
 There was no more sleep for W^ardlaw and my- 
 self that night. We made the best barricade we 
 could of the windows, loaded all our weapons, and 
 trusted to Colin to give us early news. Before

 112 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 supper I went over to get Japp to join us, but 
 found that that worthy had sought help from his 
 old protector, the bottle, and was already sound 
 asleep with both door and window open. 
 
 I had made up my mind that death was certain, 
 and yet my heart belied my conviction, and I could 
 not feel the appropriate mood. If anything, I was 
 more cheerful since I had heard the drums. It 
 was clearly now beyond the power of me or any 
 man to stop the march of events. My thoughts 
 ran on a native rising, and I kept telling myself 
 how little that was probable. Where were the 
 arms, the leader, the discipline .? At any rate such 
 arguments put me to sleep before dawn, and I 
 wakened at eight to find that nothing had happened. 
 The clear morning sunlight, as of old, made Blaau- 
 wildebeestefontein the place of a dream. Zeeta 
 brought in my cup of coffee as if this day were just 
 like all others, my pipe tasted as sweet, the fresh air 
 from the Berg blew as fragrantly on my brow. I 
 went over to the store in reasonably good spirits, 
 leaving Wardlaw busy on the penitential Psalms. 
 
 The post-runner had brought the mail as usual, 
 and there was one private letter for me. I opened 
 it with great excitement, for the envelope bore the

## p. 113 (#119) ############################################


 
 THE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET. 113 
 
 stamp of the firm. At last Colles had deigned to 
 answer. 
 
 Inside was a sheet of the firm's notepaper, with 
 the signature of Colles across the top. Below 
 some one had pencilled these five words : 
 
 " The Blesbok'^ are changing ground ^ 
 
 I looked to see that Japp had not suffocated 
 himself, then shut up the store, and went back to 
 my room to think out this new mystification. 
 
 The thing had come from Colles, for it was the 
 private notepaper of the Durban office, and there 
 was Colles' signature. But the pencilling was in a 
 different hand. My deduction from this was that 
 some one wished to send me a message, and that 
 Colles had given that some one a sheet of signed 
 paper to serve as a kind of introduction. I might 
 take it, therefore, that the scribble was Colles' 
 reply to my letter. 
 
 Now, my argument continued, if the unknown 
 person saw fit to send me a message, it could not 
 be merely one of warning. Colles must have told 
 him that I was awake to some danger, and as I was 
 in Blaauwildebeestefontein, 1 must be nearer the 
 
 * A species of buck.

 114 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 heart of things than any one else. The message 
 must therefore be in the nature of some pass-word, 
 which I was to remember when I heard it again. 
 
 I reasoned the whole thing out very clearly, and 
 I saw no gap in my logic. I cannot describe how 
 that scribble had heartened me. I felt no more 
 the crushing isolation of yesterday. There were 
 others beside me in the secret. Help must be on 
 the way, and the letter was the first tidings. 
 
 But how near ? — that was the question ; and It 
 occurred to me for the first time to look at the 
 postmark. I went back to the store and got the 
 envelope out of the waste-paper basket. The post 
 mark was certainly not Durban. The stamp was 
 a Cape Colony one, and of the mark I could only 
 read three letters, T.R.S. This was no sort of 
 clue, and I turned the thing over, completely 
 baffled. Then I noticed that there was no mark 
 of the post town of delivery. Our letters to 
 Blaauwildebeestefontein came through Pietersdorp, 
 and bore that mark. 1 compared the envelope 
 with others. They all had a circle, and " Pieters- 
 dorp " in broad black letters. But this envelope 
 had nothing except the stamp. 
 
 I was still slow at detective work, and It was

 some minutes before the explanation flashed on 
 me. The letter had never been posted at all. The 
 stamp was a fake, and had been borrowed from an 
 old envelope. There was only one way in which it 
 could have come. It must have been put in the 
 letter-bag while the postman was on his way from 
 Pietersdorp. My unknown friend must therefore 
 be somewhere within eighty miles of me. I 
 hurried off to look for the post-runner, but he had 
 started back an hour before. There was nothing 
 for it but to wait on the coming of the unknown. 
 
 That afternoon I again took Mr. Wardlaw for a 
 walk. It is an ingrained habit of mine that I never 
 tell any one more of a business than is practically 
 necessary. For months I had kept all my know- 
 ledge to myself, and breathed not a word to a soul- 
 But I thought it my duty to tell Wardlaw about 
 the letter, to let him see that we were not for- 
 gotten. I am afraid it did not encourage his mind. 
 Occult messages seemed to him only the last proof 
 of a deadly danger encompassing us, and I could 
 not shake his opinion. 
 
 We took the same road to the crown of the 
 Berg, and I was confirmed in my suspicion that the 
 woods were empty and the watchers gone. The

 place was as deserted as the bush at Umvelos*. 
 When we reached the summit about sunset we 
 waited anxiously for the sound of drums. It came, 
 as we expected, louder and more menacing than 
 before. Wardlaw stood pinching my arm as the 
 great tattoo swept down the escarpment, and died 
 away in the far mountains beyond the Olifants. 
 Yet it no longer seemed to be a wall of sound, 
 shutting us out from our kindred in the West. A 
 message had pierced the wall. If the blesbok 
 were changing ground, I believed the hunters were 
 calling out their hounds and getting ready for the 
 chase.

 TT froze in the night, harder than was common 
 on the Berg even in winter, and as I crossed 
 the road next morning it was covered with rime. 
 All my fears had gone, and my mind was strung 
 high with expectation. Five pencilled words 
 may seem a small thing to build hope on, but it 
 was enough for 'me, and I went about my work in 
 the store with a reasonably light heart. One of 
 the first things I did was to take stock of our 
 armoury. There were five sporting Mausers of a 
 cheap make, one Mauser pistol, a Lee-Speed car- 
 bine, and a little nickel-plated revolver. There 
 was also Japp's shot gun, an old hammered breech^ 
 loader, as well as the gun I had brought out with 
 me. There was a good supply of cartridges, in- 
 cluding a stock for a .400 express which could not 
 be found. I pocketed the pistol, and searched

 till I discovered a good sheath-knife. If fight- 
 ing was in prospect I might as well look to my 
 arms. 
 
 All the morning I sat among flour and sugar 
 possessing my soul in as much patience as I could 
 command. Nothing came down the white road 
 from the west. The sun melted the rime ; the 
 flies came out and buzzed in the window ; Japp 
 got himself out of bed, and brewed strong coff'ee, 
 and went back to his slumbers. Presently it was 
 dinner-time, and I went over to a silent meal with 
 Wardlaw. When I returned I must have fallen 
 asleep over a pipe, for the next thing I knew I was 
 blinking drowsily at the patch of sun in the door, 
 and listening for footsteps. In the dead stillness 
 of the afternoon I thought I could discern a shuf- 
 fling in the dust. I got up and looked out, and 
 there sure enough was some one coming down the 
 road. 
 
 But it was only a Kafiir, and a miserable-looking 
 object at that. I had never seen such an anatomy. 
 It was a very old man, bent almost double, and 
 clad in a ragged shirt and a pair of foul khaki 
 trousers. He carried an iron pot, and a few be- 
 longings were tied up in a dirty handkerchief. He

 must have been a dacha ^-smoker, for he coughed 
 hideously, twisting his body with the paroxysms. I 
 had seen the type before — the old broken-down 
 native who had no kin to support him, and no 
 tribe to shelter him. They wander about the 
 roads, cooking their wretched meals by their little 
 fires, till one morning they are found stiff under 
 a bush. 
 
 The native gave me good-day in Kaffir, then 
 begged for tobacco or a handful of mealie-meal. 
 
 I asked him where he came from. 
 
 " From the west, Inkoos," he said, " and before 
 that from the south. It is a sore road for old 
 bones." 
 
 I went into the store to fetch some meal, and 
 when I came out he had shuffled close to the door. 
 He had kept his eyes on the ground, but now he 
 looked up at me, and I thought he had very bright 
 eyes for such an old wreck. 
 
 " The nights are cold, Inkoos," he wailed, " and 
 my folk are scattered, and I have no kraal. The 
 aasvogels follow me, and I can hear the blesbok." 
 
 " What about the blesbok ? " I asked with a 
 start. 
 
 * Hemp.

## p. 120 (#126) ############################################


 
 120 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 " The blesbok are changing ground," he said, 
 and looked me straight in the face. 
 
 "And where are the hunters ?'' I asked. 
 
 " They are here and behind me," he said in 
 English, holding out his pot for my meal, 
 while he began to edge into the middle of the 
 road. 
 
 I followed, and, speaking English, asked him if 
 he knew of a man named Colles. 
 
 " I come from him, young Baas. Where is your 
 house } Ah, the school. There will be a way in 
 by the back window ? See that it is open, for I'll 
 be there shortly." Then lifting up his voice he 
 called down in Sesuto all manner of blessings on 
 me for my kindness, and went shuffling down the 
 sunlit road, coughing like a volcano. 
 
 In high excitement I locked up the store and 
 went over to Mr. Wardlaw. No children had 
 come to school that day, and he was sitting idle, 
 playing patience. " Lock the door," I said, " and 
 come into my room. We're on the brink of ex- 
 planations." 
 
 In about twenty minutes the bush below the 
 back-window parted and the Kaffir slipped out. 
 He grinned at me, and after a glance round.

 hopped very nimbly over the sill. Then he ex- 
 amined the window and pulled the curtains. 
 
 " Is the outer door shut ? " he asked in excel- 
 lent English. "Well, get me some hot water, 
 and any spare clothes you may possess, Mr. Craw- 
 furd. I must get comfortable before we begin our 
 indaba* We've the night before us, so there's 
 plenty of time. But get the house clear, and see 
 that nobody disturbs me at my toilet. I am a 
 modest man, and sensitive about my looks." 
 
 I brought him what he wanted, and looked on 
 at an amazing transformation. Taking a phial 
 from his bundle, he rubbed some liquid on his 
 face and neck and hands, and got rid of the black 
 colouring. His body and legs he left untouched, 
 save that he covered them with shirt and trousers 
 from my wardrobe. Then he pulled off a scaly 
 wig, and showed beneath it a head of close-cropped 
 grizzled hair. In ten minutes the old Kaffir had 
 been transformed into an active soldierly-looking 
 man of maybe fifty years. Mr. Wardlaw stared as 
 if he had seen a resurrection. 
 
 " I had better introduce myself," he said, when 
 he had taken the edge off his thirst and hunger. 
 
 * Council.

 122 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 " My name is Arcoll, Captain James Arcoll. I am 
 speaking to Mr. Crawfurdj the storekeeper, and 
 Mr. Wardlaw, the schoolmaster, of Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein. Where, by the way, is Mr, Peter 
 Japp ? Drunk ? Ah, yes, it was always his fail- 
 ing. The quorum, however, is complete without 
 him." 
 
 By this time it was about sunset, and I remem- 
 ber I cocked my ear to hear the drums beat. 
 Captain Arcoll noticed the movement as he noticed 
 all else. 
 
 " You're listening for the drums, but you won't 
 hear them. That business is over here. To-night 
 they beat in Swaziland and down into the Tonga 
 border. Three days more, unless you and I, Mr. 
 Crawfurd, are extra smart, and they'll be hearing 
 them in Durban." 
 
 It was not till the lamp was lit, the fire burning 
 well, and the house locked and shuttered, that 
 Captain Arcoll began his tale. 
 
 " First," he said, " let me hear what you know. 
 Colles told me that you were a keen fellow, and 
 had wind of some mystery here. You wrote him 
 about the way you were spied on, but I told him 
 to take no notice. Your affair, Mr. Crawfurd, had

 CAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE. 123 
 
 to wait on more urgent matters. Now, what do 
 you think is happening ? " 
 
 I spoke very shortly, weighing my words, for I 
 felt I was on trial before these bright eyes. " I 
 think that some kind of native rising is about to 
 commence." 
 
 "Ay," he said dryly, "you would, and your 
 evidence would be the spying and drumming. 
 Anything more ? " 
 
 " I have come on the tracks of a lot of LD.B. 
 work in the neighbourhood. The natives have 
 some supply of diamonds, which they sell bit by 
 bit, and I don't doubt but they have been getting 
 guns with the proceeds." 
 
 He nodded. " Have you any notion who has 
 been engaged in the job ? " 
 
 I had it on my tongue to mention Japp, but 
 forbore, remembering my promise. " I can name 
 one," I said, " a little yellow Portugoose, who calls 
 himself Henriques or Hendricks. He passed by 
 here the day before yesterday." 
 
 Captai'n Arcoll suddenly was consumed with 
 quiet laughter. "Did you notice the Kaffir who 
 rode with him and carried his saddlebags .? Well, 
 he's one of my men. Henriques would have a fit

 if he knew what was in those saddlebags. They 
 contain my change of clothes, and other odds and 
 ends. Henriques's own stuff is in a hole in the 
 spruit. A handy way of getting one's luggage 
 sent on, eh ? The bags are waiting for me at a 
 place I appointed." And again Captain Arcoll 
 indulged his sense of humour. Then he became 
 gmve, and returned to his examination. 
 
 " A rising, with diamonds as the sinews of war, 
 and Henriques as the chief agent. Well and good ! 
 But who is to lead, and what are the natives going 
 to rise about ? " 
 
 " I know nothing further, but I have made 
 some guesses." 
 
 "Let's hear your guesses," he said, blowing 
 smoke rings from his pipe. 
 
 " I think the main mover is a great black min- 
 ister who calls himself John Laputa." 
 
 Captain Arcoll nearly sprang out of his chair. 
 " Now, how on earth did you find that out ? 
 Quick, Mr. Crawfurd, tell me all you know, for 
 this is desperately important." 
 
 I began at the beginning, and told him the story 
 of what happened on the Kirkcaple shore. Then I 
 spoke of my sight of him on board ship, his talk

 CAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE. 125 
 
 with Henriques about Blaauwildebeestefontein, 
 and his hurried departure from Durban. 
 
 Captain Arcoll listened intently, and at the men- 
 tion of Durban he laughed. " You and I seem to 
 have been running on lines which nearly touched. 
 I thought I had grabbed my friend Laputa that 
 night in Durban, but I was too cocksure and he 
 slipped off. Do you know, Mr. Crawfurd, you 
 have been on the right trail long before me ? 
 When did you say you saw him at his devil- 
 worship ^ Seven years ago } Then you were the 
 first man alive to know the Reverend John in his 
 true colours. You knew seven years ago what I 
 only found out last year." 
 
 " Well, that's my story," I said. " I don't know 
 what the rising is about, but there's one other 
 thing I can tell you. There's some kind of sacred 
 place for the Kaffirs, and I've found out where it 
 is." I gave him a short account of my adventures 
 in the Rooirand. 
 
 He smoked silently for a bit after I had finished. 
 " You've got the skeleton of the whole thing right, 
 and you only want the filling up. And you found 
 out everything for yourself ? Colles was right ; 
 you're not wanting in intelligence, Mr. Crawfurd."

 126 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 It was not much of a compliment, but 1 have 
 never been more pleased in my life. This slim, 
 grizzled man, with his wrinkled face and bright 
 eyes, was clearly not lavish in his praise, I felt it 
 was no small thing to have earned a word of com- 
 mendation. 
 
 " And now I will tell you my story," said Cap- 
 tain Arcoll. " It is a long story, and I must begin 
 far back. It has taken me years to decipher it, 
 and, remember, I've been all my life at this native 
 business. I can talk every dialect, and I have the 
 customs of every tribe by heart. I've travelled 
 over every mile of South Africa, and Central and 
 East Africa too. I was in both the Matabele wars, 
 and I've seen a heap of other fighting which never 
 got into the papers. So what I tell you you can 
 take as gospel, for it is knowledge that was not 
 learned in a day." 
 
 He puffed away, and then asked suddenly, 
 " Did you ever hear of Prester John .'' " 
 
 " The man that lived in Central Asia ? " I asked, 
 with a reminiscence of a story-book I had as a 
 boy. 
 
 " No, no," said Mr. Wardlaw, " he means the 
 king of Abyssinia in the fifteenth century. I've

 CAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE. 127 
 
 been readinsf all about him. He was a Christian, 
 and the Portuguese sent expedition after expedi- 
 tion to find him, but they never got there. Albu- 
 querque wanted to make an alliance with him and 
 capture the Holy Sepulchre." 
 
 ArcoU nodded. "That's the one I mean. 
 There's not very much known about him, except 
 Portuguese legends. He was a sort of Christian, 
 but I expect that his practices were as pagan as his 
 neighbours'. There is no doubt that he was a 
 great conqueror. Under him and his successors 
 the empire of Ethiopia extended far south of 
 Abyssinia away down to the Great Lakes." 
 
 " How long did this power last } " I asked, 
 wondering to what tale this was prologue. 
 
 " That's a mystery no scholar has ever been 
 able to fathom. Anyhow, the centre of authority 
 began to shift southward, and the warrior tribes 
 moved in that direction. At the end of the six- 
 teenth century the chief native power was round 
 about the Zambesi. The Mazimba and the 
 Makaranga had come down from the Lake Nyassa 
 quarter, and there was a strong kingdom in 
 Manicaland. That was the Monomotapa that the 
 Portuguese thought so much of."

 128 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 Wardlaw nodded eagerly. The story was get- 
 ting into ground that he knew about. 
 
 " The thing to remember is that all these little 
 empires thought themselves the successors of 
 Prester John. It took me a long time to find 
 this out, and I have spent days in the best 
 libraries in Europe over it. They all looked back 
 to a great king in the north, whom they called by 
 about twenty different names. They had forgotten 
 all about his Christianity, but they remembered 
 that he was a conqueror. 
 
 " Well, to make a long story short, Monomotapa 
 disappeared in time, and fresh tribes came down 
 from the north, and pushed right down to Natal 
 and the Cape. That is how the Zulus first 
 appeared. They brought with them the story of 
 Prester John, but by this time it had ceased to be 
 a historical memory, and had become a religious 
 cult. They worshipped a great Power who had 
 been their ancestor, and the favourite Zulu word 
 for him was Umkulunkulu. The belief was per- 
 verted into fifty different forms, but this was the 
 central creed — that Umkulunkulu had been the 
 father of the tribe, and was alive as a spirit to 
 watch over them.

## p. 129 (#135) ############################################


 
 CAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE. 129 
 
 " They brought more than a creed with them. 
 Somehow or other, some fetich had descended 
 from Prester John by way of the Mazimba and 
 Angoni and Makaranga. What it is I do not 
 know, but it was always in the hands of the 
 tribe which for the moment held the leadership. 
 The great native wars of the sixteenth century, 
 which you can read about in the Portuguese his- 
 torians, were not for territory but for leadership, 
 and mainly for the possession of this fetich. Any- 
 how, we know that the Zulus brought it down 
 with them. They called it Ndhlondhlo^ which 
 means the Great Snake, but I don't suppose that 
 it was any kind of snake. The snake was their 
 totem, and they would naturally call their most 
 sacred possession after it. 
 
 " Now I will tell you a thing that few know. 
 You have heard of Chaka. He was a sort of 
 black Napoleon early in the last century, and he 
 made the Zulus the paramount power in South 
 Africa, slaughtering about two million souls to 
 accomplish it. Well, he had the fetich, whatever 
 it was, and it was believed that he owed his con- 
 quests to it. Mosilikatse tried to steal it, and that 
 was why he had to fly to Matabel eland. But

 with Chaka it disappeared. Dingaan did not have 
 it, nor Panda, and Cetewayo never got it, though 
 he searched the length and breadth of the country 
 for it. It had gone out of existence, and with it 
 the chance of a Kaffir empire." 
 
 Captain Arcoll got up to light his pipe, and I 
 noticed that his face was grave. He was not tell- 
 ing us this yarn for our amusement. 
 
 " So much for Prester John and his charm," he 
 said. "Now I have to take up the history at a 
 different point. In spite of risings here and there, 
 and occasional rows, the Kaffirs have been quiet for 
 the better part of half a century. It is no credit to us. 
 They have had plenty of grievances, and we are no 
 nearer understanding them than our fathers were. 
 But they are scattered and divided. We have 
 driven great wedges of white settlement into their 
 territory, and we have taken away their arms. 
 Still, they are six times as many as we are, and 
 they have long memories, and a thoughtful man 
 may wonder how long the peace will last. I 
 have often asked myself that question, and till 
 lately I used to reply, ' For ever, because they 
 cannot find a leader with the proper authority, 
 and they have no common cause to fight for.'

## p. 131 (#137) ############################################


 
 CAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE. 131 
 
 But a year or two ago I began to change my 
 mind. 
 
 " It is my business to act as chief Intelligence 
 officer among the natives. Well, one day, I came 
 on the tracks of a curious person. He was a 
 Christian minister called Laputa, and he was going 
 among the tribes from Durban to the Zambesi as 
 a roving evangelist. I found that he made an 
 enormous impression, and yet the people I spoke 
 to were chary of saying much about him. Pres- 
 ently I found that he preached more than the 
 Gospel. His word was ' Africa for the Africans,' 
 and his chief point was that the natives had had a 
 great empire in the past, and might have a great 
 empire again. He used to tell the story of Prester 
 John, with all kinds of embroidery of his own. 
 You see, Prester John was a good argument for 
 him, for he had been a Christian as well as a great 
 potentate. 
 
 " For years there has been plenty of this talk in 
 South Africa, chiefly among Christian Kaffirs. It 
 is what they call ' Ethiopianism,' and American 
 negroes are the chief apostles. For myself, I 
 always thought the thing perfectly harmless. I 
 don't care a fig whether the native missions break

 away from the parent churches in England and call 
 themselves by fancy names. The more freedom 
 they have in their religious life, the less they are 
 likely to think about politics. But I soon found 
 out that Laputa was none of your flabby educated 
 negroes from America, and I began to watch him. 
 
 " I first came across him at a revival meeting in 
 London, where he was a great success. He came 
 and spoke to me about my soul, but he gave up 
 when I dropped into Zulu. The next time 1 met 
 him was on the lower Limpopo, when I had the 
 honour of trying to shoot him from a boat." 
 
 Captain ArcoU took his pipe from his mouth 
 and laughed at the recollection. 
 
 " I had got on to an I.D.B. gang, and to my 
 amazement found the evangelist among them. 
 But the Reverend John was too much for me. He 
 went overboard in spite of the crocodiles, and 
 managed to swim below water to the reed bed at 
 the side. However, that was a valuable experience 
 for me, for it gave me a clue. 
 
 " I next saw him at a Missionary Conference in 
 Cape Town, and after that at a meeting of the 
 Geographical Society in London, where I had a 
 long talk with him. My reputation does not

 follow me home, and he thought I was an English 
 publisher with an interest in missions. You see I 
 had no evidence to connect him with LD.B., and 
 besides I fancied that his real game was something 
 bigger than that ; so 1 just bided my time and 
 watched. 
 
 " I did my best to get on to his dossier^ but it 
 was no easy job. However, 1 found out a few 
 things. He had been educated in the States, and 
 well educated too, for the man is a good scholar 
 and a great reader, besides the finest natural orator 
 1 have ever heard. There was no doubt that he 
 was of Zulu blood, but I could get no traces of 
 his family. He must come of high stock, for he 
 is a fine figure of a man. 
 
 " Very soon I found it was no good following 
 him in his excursions into civilization. There he 
 was merely the educated Kaffir ; a great pet of 
 missionary societies, and a favourite speaker at 
 Church meetings. You will find evidence given 
 by him in Blue-Books on native affairs, and he 
 counted many members of Parliament at home 
 among his correspondents. I let that side go, and 
 resolved to dog him when on his evangelizing tours 
 in the back-veld.

 134 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 " For six months I stuck to him like a leech. 
 I am pretty good at disguises, and he never knew 
 who was the broken-down old Kaffir who squatted 
 in the dirt at the edge of the crowd when he spoke, 
 or the half-caste who called him ' Sir ' and drove 
 his Cape-cart. I had some queer adventures, but 
 these can wait. The gist of the thing is, that after 
 six months which turned my hair grey I got a 
 glimmering of what he was after. He talked 
 Christianity to the mobs in the kraals, but to the 
 indunas * he told a different story." 
 
 Captain Arcoll helped himself to a drink. " You 
 can guess what that story was, Mr. Crawfurd. At 
 full moon when the black cock was blooded, the 
 Reverend John forgot his Christianity. He was 
 back four centuries among the Mazimba sweeping 
 down on the Zambesi. He told them, and they 
 believed him, that he was the Umkulunkulu, the 
 incarnated spirit of Prester John. He told them 
 that he was there to lead the African race to con- 
 quest and empire. Ay, and he told them more : 
 for he has, or says he has, the Great Snake itself, 
 the necklet of Prester John." 
 
 Neither of us spoke ; we were too occupied 
 
 * Lesser chiefs.

 CAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE. 135 
 
 with fittinof this news into our chain of know- 
 ledge. 
 
 Captain Arcoll went on. "Now that I knew his 
 purpose, I set myself to find out his preparations. 
 It was not long before I found a mighty organiza- 
 tion at work from the Zambesi to the Cape. The 
 great tribes were up to their necks in the conspir- 
 acy, and all manner of little sects had been taken 
 in. 1 have sat at tribal councils and been sworn a 
 blood brother, and I have used the secret password 
 to get knowledge in odd places. It was a danger- 
 ous game, and, as I have said, 1 had my adventures, 
 but I came safe out of it — with my knowledge. 
 
 " The first thing 1 found out was that there was 
 a great deal of wealth somewhere among the tribes. 
 Much of it was m diamonds, which the labourers 
 stole from the mines and the chiefs impounded. 
 Nearly every tribe had its secret chest, and our 
 friend Laputa had the use of them all. Of course 
 the difficulty was changing the diamonds into coin, 
 and he had to start I.D.B. on a big scale. Your 
 pal, Henriques, was the chief agent for this, but 
 he had others at Mozam-bique and Johannesburg, 
 ay, and in London, whom 1 have on my list. 
 With the money, guns and ammunition were bought.

 and it seems that a pretty flourishing trade has 
 been going on for some time. They came in 
 mostly overland through Portuguese territory, 
 though there have been cases of consignments to 
 Johannesburg houses, the contents of which did 
 not correspond with the Invoice. You ask what 
 the Governments were doing to let this go on. 
 Yes, and you may well ask. They were all asleep. 
 They never dreamed of danger from the natives, 
 and in any case it was difficult to police the Por- 
 tuguese side. Laputa knew our weakness, and he 
 staked everything on it. 
 
 " My first scheme was to lay Laputa by the 
 heels ; but no Government would act on my 
 information. The man was strongly buttressed 
 by public support at home, and South Africa has 
 burned her fingers before this with arbitrary arrests. 
 Then I tried to fasten I.D.B. on him, but I could 
 not get my proofs till too late. I nearly had him 
 in Durban, but he got away ; and he never gave 
 me a second chance. For five months he and 
 Henriques have been lying low, because their 
 scheme was getting very ripe. 1 have been fol- 
 lowing them through Zululand and Gazaland, and 
 I have discovered that the train is ready, and only

 wants the match. For a month I have never 
 been more than five hours behind him on the 
 trail ; and if he has laid his train, I have laid 
 mine also." 
 
 Arcoll's whimsical, humorous face had hardened 
 into grimness, and in his clear eyes there was the 
 light of a fierce purpose. The sight of him com- 
 forted me, in spite of his tale. 
 
 " But what can he hope to do ? " I asked. 
 "Though he roused every Kaffir in South Africa 
 he would be beaten. You say he is an educated 
 man. He must know he has no chance in the 
 long run." 
 
 " I said he was an educated man, but he is also 
 a Kaffir. He can see the first stage of a thing, and 
 maybe the second, but no more. That is the native 
 mind. If it was not like that our chance would be 
 the worse." 
 
 " You say the scheme is ripe," I said ; " how 
 ripe : 
 
 ArcoU looked at the clock. " In half an hour's 
 time Laputa will be with 'Mpefu. There he will 
 stay the night. To-morrow morning he goes to 
 Umvelos' to meet Henriques. To-morrow even- 
 ing the gathering begins."

 " One question," I said. " How big a man is 
 Laputa ? " 
 
 "The biggest thing that the Kaffirs have ever 
 produced, I tell you, in my opinion he is a great 
 genius. If he had been white he might have been 
 a second Napoleon. He is a born leader of men, 
 and as brave as a lion. There is no villainy he 
 would not do if necessary, and yet I should hesi- 
 tate to call him a blackguard. Ay, you may look 
 surprised at me, you two pragmatical Scotsmen ; 
 but I have, so to speak, lived with the man for 
 months, and there's fineness and nobility in him. 
 He would be a terrible enemy, but a just one. 
 He has the heart of a poet and a king, and it is 
 God's curse that he has been born among the 
 children of Ham. I hope to shoot him like a dog 
 in a day or two, but I am glad to bear testimony 
 to his greatness." 
 
 "If the rising starts to-morrow," I asked, "have 
 you any of his plans ? " 
 
 He picked up a map from the table and opened 
 it. " The first rendezvous is somewhere near 
 Sikitola's. Then they move south, picking up 
 contingents ; and the final concentration is to be 
 on the high veld near Amsterdam, which is con-

 venient for the Swazis and the Zulus. After that 
 I know nothing, but of course there are local con- 
 centrations along the whole line of the Berg from 
 Mashonaland to Basutoland. Now, look here. 
 To get to Amsterdam they must cross the Delagoa 
 Bay Railway. Well, they won't be allowed to. 
 If they get as far, they will be scattered there. 
 As I told you, I too have laid my train. We have 
 the police ready all along the scarp of the Berg. 
 Every exit from native territory is watched, and 
 the frontier farmers are out on commando. We 
 have regulars on the Delagoa Bay and Natal lines, 
 and a system of field telegraphs laid which can 
 summon further troops to any point. It has all 
 been kept secret, because we are still in the dark 
 ourselves. The newspaper public knows nothing 
 about any rising, but in two days every white 
 household in South Africa will be in a panic. 
 Make no mistake, Mr. Crawfurd ; this is a grim 
 business. We shall smash Laputa and his men, 
 but it will be a fierce fight, and there will be much 
 good blood shed. Besides, it will throw the country 
 back another half-century. Would to God I had 
 been man enough to put a bullet through his head 
 in cold blood. But I could not do it — it was too

 like murder ; and maybe 1 shall never have the 
 chance now." 
 
 " There's one thing puzzles me," I said. " What 
 makes Laputa come up here to start with ? Why 
 didn't he begin with Zululand ? " 
 
 " God knows ! There's sure to be sense in it, 
 for he does nothing without reason. We may 
 know to-morrow." 
 
 But as Captain Arcoll spoke, the real reason 
 suddenly flashed into my mind : Laputa had to 
 get the Great Snake, the necklet of Prester John, 
 to give his leadership prestige. Apparently he had 
 not yet got it, or Arcoll would have known. He 
 started from this neighbourhood because the fetich 
 was somewhere hereabouts. I was convinced 
 that my guess was right, but I kept my own 
 counsel. 
 
 " To-morrow Laputa and Henriques meet at 
 Umvelos', probably at your new store, Mr. Craw- 
 furd. And so the ball commences." 
 
 My resolution was suddenly taken. 
 
 " I think," 1 said, " 1 had better be present at 
 the meeting, as representing the firm." 
 
 Captain Arcoll stared at me and laughed. " I 
 had thought of going myself," he said.

 pect. If you're to get any news, I'm the man 
 to go." 
 
 He looked at me steadily for a minute or so. 
 " I'm not sure that's such a bad idea of yours. I 
 would be better employed myself on the Berg, 
 and, as you say, I would have little chance of 
 hearing anything. You're a plucky fellow, Mr. 
 Crawfurd. I suppose you understand that the 
 risk is pretty considerable." 
 
 *' I suppose I do ; but since I'm in this thing, I 
 may as well see it out. Besides, I've an old quarrel 
 with our friend Laputa." 
 
 " Good and well," said Captain Arcoll. " Draw 
 in your chair to the table, then, and I'll explain to 
 you the disposition of my men. I should tell you 
 that I have loyal natives in my pay in most tribes, 
 and can count on early intelligence. We can't 
 match their telepathy ; but the new type of field 
 telegraph is not so bad, and may be a trifle more 
 reliable."

 lishment, now that we knew the worst and had a

 I FALL IN AGAIN WITH THE REVEREND 
 JOHN LAPUTA. 
 
 /^NCE, as a boy, I had earnestly desired to go 
 into the army, and had hopes of rising to be 
 a great general. Now that I know myself better, 
 I do not think I would have been much good at a 
 general's work. I would have shirked the loneli- 
 ness of it, the isolation of responsibility. But I think 
 I would have done well in a subaltern command, 
 for I had a great notion of carrying out orders, 
 and a certain zest in the mere act of obedience. 
 Three days before I had been as nervous as a 
 kitten because I was alone and it was " up to me," 
 as Americans say, to decide on the next step. But 
 now that I was only one wheel in a great machine 
 of defence my nervousness seemed to have fled. 
 I was well aware that the mission I was bound on 
 was full of risk ; but, to my surprise, I felt no fear.

 144 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 Indeed, I had much the same feeling as a boy on a 
 Saturday's holiday who has planned a great expedi- 
 tion. One thing only I regretted— that Tarn Dyke 
 was not with me to see the fun. The thought of 
 that faithful soul, now beating somewhere on the 
 seas, made me long for his comradeship. As I 
 shaved, I remember wondering if I would ever 
 shave again, and the thought gave me no tremors. 
 For once in my sober life I was strung up to the 
 gambler's pitch of adventure. 
 
 My job was to go to Umvelos' as if on my 
 ordinary business, and if possible find out some- 
 thing of the evening's plan of march. The ques- 
 tion was how to send back a message to Arcoll, 
 assuming I had any difficulty in getting away. At 
 first this puzzled us both, and then I thought of 
 Colin. I had trained the dog to go home at my 
 bidding, for often when 1 used to go hunting 
 1 would have occasion to visit a kraal where he 
 would have been a nuisance. Accordingly, I 
 resolved to take Colin with me, and, if I got into 
 trouble, to send word by him. 
 
 I asked about Laputa's knowledge of our prepa- 
 rations. Arcoll was inclined to think that he 
 suspected little. The police and the commandos

 had been kept very secret, and, besides, they were 
 moving on the high veld and out of the ken of the 
 tribes. Natives, he told me, were not good scouts 
 so far as white man's work was concerned, for they 
 did not understand the meaning of what we did. 
 On the other hand, his native scouts brought him 
 pretty accurate tidings of any Kaffir movements. 
 He thought that all the bush country of the plain 
 would be closely watched, and that no one would 
 get through without some kind of pass. But he 
 thought also that the storekeeper might be an 
 exception, for his presence would give rise to no 
 suspicions. Almost his last words to me were to 
 come back hell-for-leather if I saw the game was 
 hopeless, and in any case to leave as soon as I got 
 any news. " If you're there when the march 
 begins," he said, " they'll cut your throat for a 
 certainty." 1 had all the various police posts on 
 the Berg clear in my mind, so that I would know 
 where to make for if the road to Blaauwildebeeste- 
 fontein should be closed. 
 
 I said good-bye to ArcoU and Wardlaw with 
 a light heart, though the schoolmaster broke down 
 and implored me to think better of it. As I 
 turned down into the gorge I heard the sound

 of horses' feet far behind, and, turning back, 
 saw white riders dismounting at the dorp. At 
 any rate I was leaving the country well-guarded in 
 my rear. 
 
 It was a fine morning in mid-winter, and I was 
 in very good spirits as I jogged on my pony down 
 the steep hill-road, with Colin running beside me. 
 A month before I had taken the same journey, 
 with no suspicion in my head of what the future 
 was to bring. I thought about my Dutch com- 
 panions, now with. their cattle far out on the plains. 
 Did they know of the great danger, I wondered. 
 All the way down the glen I saw no sign of human 
 presence. The game-birds mocked me from the 
 thicket ; a brace of white herghaan circled far up 
 in the blue ; and I had for pleasant comrade the 
 brawling river. I dismounted once to drink, and 
 in that green haven of flowers and ferns I was 
 struck sharply with a sense of folly. Here were 
 we wretched creatures of men making for each 
 other's throats, and outraging the good earth which 
 God had made so fair a habitation. 
 
 I had resolved on a short cut to Umvelos', 
 avoiding the neighbourhood of Sikitola's kraal, 
 so when the river emerged from the glen I crossed

 it and struck into the bush. I had not gone far 
 before I realized that something strange was going 
 on. It was like the woods on the Berg a week 
 before. I had the impression of many people 
 moving in the bush, and now and then I caught a 
 glimpse of them. My first thought was that I 
 should be stopped, but soon it appeared that these 
 folk had business of their own which did not con- 
 cern me. I was conscious of being watched, yet it 
 was clear that the bush folk were not there for the 
 purpose of watching me. 
 
 For a little I kept my spirits, but as the hours 
 passed with the same uncanny hurrying to and fro 
 all about me my nerves began to suffer. Weeks 
 of espionage at Blaauwildebeestefontein had made 
 me jumpy. These people apparently meant me 
 no ill, and had no time to spare on me. But the 
 sensation of moving through them was like walk- 
 ing on a black-dark night with precipices all around. 
 I felt odd quiverings between my shoulder blades 
 where a spear might be expected to lodge. Over- 
 head was a great blue sky and a blazing sun, and I 
 could see the path running clear before me be- 
 tween the walls of scrub. But it was like mid- 
 night to me, a midnight of suspicion and unknown

 perils. I began to wish heartily I had never 
 come. 
 
 1 stopped for my midday meal at a place called 
 Taqui, a grassy glade in the bush where a tiny 
 spring of water crept out from below a big stone, 
 only to disappear in the sand. Here I sat and 
 smoked for half an hour, wondering what was go- 
 ing to become of me. The air was very still, but I 
 could hear the rustle of movement somewhere 
 within a hundred yards. The hidden folk were 
 busy about their own ends, and I regretted that 
 I had not taken the road by Sikitola's and seen 
 how the kraals looked. They must be empty now, 
 for the young men were already out on some mis- 
 sion. So nervous I got that I took my pocket- 
 book and wrote down certain messages to my 
 mother, which I implored whoever should find 
 my body to transmit. Then, a little ashamed 
 of my childishness, I pulled myself together, and 
 remounted. 
 
 About three in the afternoon I came over a low 
 ridge of bush and saw the corrugated iron roof 
 of the store and the gleam of water from the 
 Labongo. The sight encouraged me, for at any 
 rate it meant the end of this disquieting ride.

## p. 149 (#155) ############################################


 
 THE REVEREND JOHN LAPUTA. 149 
 
 Here the bush changed to trees of some size, and 
 after leaving the ridge the road plunged for a 
 little into a thick shade. I had forgotten for a 
 moment the folk in the bush, and when a man 
 stepped out of the thicket I pulled up my horse 
 with a start. 
 
 It was a tall native, who carried himself proudly, 
 and after a glance at me, stalked along at my side. 
 He wore curious clothes, for he had a kind of 
 linen tunic, and around his waist hung a kilt of 
 leopard-skin. In such a man one would have 
 looked for a ring-kop* but instead he had a mass of 
 hair, not like a Kaffir's wool, but long and curled 
 like some popular musician. I should have been 
 prepared for the face, but the sight of it sent a sud- 
 den chill of fright through my veins. For there 
 was the curved nose, the deep flashing eyes, and 
 the cruel lips of my enemy of the Kirkcaple shore. 
 
 Colin was deeply suspicious and followed his 
 heels growling, but he never turned his head. 
 
 "The day is warm, father," I said in Kaffir. 
 " Do you go far } " 
 
 He slackened pace till he was at my elbow.

 " But a short way, Baas," he replied in English ; 
 " I go to the store yonder." 
 
 " Well met, then," said I, " for I am the store- 
 keeper. You will find little in it, for it is newly 
 built and not yet stocked. I have ridden over 
 to see to it." 
 
 He turned his face to me. " That is bad news. 
 I had hoped for food and drink yonder. I have 
 travelled far, and in the chill nights I desire a 
 cover for my head. Will the Baas allow me to 
 sleep the night in an outhouse ? " 
 
 By this time I had recovered my nerve, and was 
 ready to play the part I had determined on. 
 " Willingly," I said. "You may sleep in the store- 
 room if you care. You will find sacks for bed- 
 ding, and the place is snug enough on a cold 
 night." 
 
 He thanked me with a grave dignity which I 
 had never seen in any Kaffir. As my eye fell 
 on his splendid proportions I forgot all else in my 
 admiration of the man. In his minister's clothes 
 he had looked only a heavily built native, but 
 now in his savage dress I saw how noble a figure 
 he made. He must have been at least six feet and 
 a half, but his chest was so deep and his shoulders

 so massive that one did not remark his height. 
 He put a hand on my saddle, and 1 remember 
 noting how slim and fine it was, more like a high- 
 bred woman's than a man's. Curiously enough 
 he filled me with a certain confidence. " I do 
 not think you will cut my throat," I said to 
 myself. " Your game is too big for common 
 murder." 
 
 The store at Umvelos' stood as I had left it. 
 There was the sjambok I had forgotten still lying 
 on the window sill. I unlocked the door, and 
 a stifling smell of new paint came out to meet 
 me. Inside there was nothing but the chairs and 
 benches, and in a corner the pots and pans I had 
 left against my next visit. 1 unlocked the cup- 
 board and got out a few stores, opened the 
 windows of the bedroom next door, and flung my 
 kaross on the cartel which did duty as bed. Then 
 I went out to find Laputa standing patiently In the 
 sunshine. 
 
 1 showed him the outhouse where I had said he 
 might sleep. It was the largest room In the store, 
 but wholly unfurnished. A pile of barrels and 
 packing-cases stood In the corner, and there was 
 enough sacking to make a sort of bed.

 " I am going to make tea," I saido "If you have 
 come far you would maybe like a cup ? " 
 
 He thanked me, and I made a fire in the grate 
 and put on the kettle to boil. Then I set on the 
 table biscuits, and sardines, and a pot of jam. It 
 was my business now to play the fool, and I be- 
 lieve I succeeded to admiration in the part. I 
 blush to-day to think of the stuff I talked. First 
 I made him sit on a chair opposite me, a thing no 
 white man in the country would have done. Then 
 I told him affectionately that I liked natives, that 
 they were fine fellows and better men than the 
 dirty whites round about. I explained that I 
 was fresh from England, and believed in equal 
 rights for all men, white or coloured. God for- 
 give me, but I think I said I hoped to see the day 
 when Africa would belong once more to its right- 
 ful masters. 
 
 He heard me with an impassive face, his grave 
 eyes studying every line of me. I am bound to 
 add that he made a hearty meal, and drank three 
 cups of strong tea of my brewing. I gave him a 
 cigar, one of a lot I had got from a Dutch farmer 
 who was experimenting with their manufacture — and 
 all the while I babbled of myself and my opinions.

 He must have thought me half-witted, and hideed 
 before long I began to be of the same opinion myself. 
 I told him that I meant to sleep the night here, 
 and s:o back in the morning to Blaauwildebeeste- 
 fontein, and then to Pietersdorp for stores. By- 
 and-by I could see that he had ceased to pay any 
 attention to what I said. I was clearly set down in 
 his mind as a fool. Instead he kept looking at 
 Colin, who was lying blinking in the doorway, one 
 wary eye cocked on the stranger. 
 
 " You have a fine dog," he observed. 
 
 "Yes," I agreed, with one final effort of men- 
 dacity, " he's fine to look at, but he has no grit in 
 him. Any mongrel from a kraal can make him 
 turn tail. Besides he is a born fool and can't find 
 his way home. I'm thinking of getting rid of 
 him." 
 
 Laputa rose and his eye fell on the dog's back. 
 1 could see that he saw the lie of the coat, and that 
 he did not agree with me. 
 
 " The food was welcome. Baas," he said. " If 
 you will listen to me I can repay hospitality with 
 advice. You are a stranger here. Trouble comes, 
 and if you are wise you will go back to the Berg." 
 
 " I don't know what you mean," I said, with

 an air of cheerful idiocy. " But back to the Berg I 
 go the first thing in the morning. I hate these 
 stinking plains." 
 
 " It were wise to go to-night," he said, with a 
 touch of menace in his tone. 
 
 "I can't," I said, and began to sing the chorus 
 of a ridiculous music-hall song. 
 
 " There's no place like home — but 
 I'm afraid to go home in the dark." 
 
 Laputa shrugged his shoulders, stepped over the 
 bristling Colin, and went out. When I looked 
 after him two minutes later he had disappeared.

 my thoughts. I.aputa had gone, and would 
 return sooner or later with Henriques. If I 
 was to remain alive till morning, both of them 
 must be convinced that I was harmless. Laputa 
 was probably of this opinion, but Henriques would 
 recognize me, and I had no wish to have that 
 yellow miscreant investigating my character. There 
 was only one way out of it — I must be incapably 
 drunk. There was not a drop of liquor in the 
 store, but I found an old whisky bottle half full 
 of methylated spirits. With this I thought I might 
 raise an atmosphere of bad whisky, and for the 
 rest I must trust to my meagre gifts as an actor. 
 
 Supposing 1 escaped suspicion, Laputa and 
 Henriques would meet in the outhouse, and I 
 must find some means of overhearing them. Here

 I was fairly baffled. There was no window in the 
 outhouse save in the roof, and they were sure to 
 shut and bolt the door. I might conceal myself 
 among the barrels inside ; but apart from the 
 fact that they were likely to search them before 
 beginning their conference, it was quite certain 
 that they would satisfy themselves that I was safe 
 in the other end of the building before going to 
 the outhouse. 
 
 Suddenly I thought of the cellar which we had 
 built below the store. There was an entrance by 
 a trap-door behind the counter, and another in the 
 outhouse. I had forgotten the details, but my 
 hope was that the second was among the barrels. 
 I shut the outer door, prised up the trap, and 
 dropped into the vault, which had been floored 
 roughly with green bricks. Lighting match after 
 match, I crawled to the other end and tried to 
 lift the door. It would not stir, so I guessed that 
 the barrels were on the top of it. Back to the 
 outhouse I went, and found that sure enough 
 a heavy packing-case was standing on a corner. 
 I fixed it slightly open, so as to let me hear, and 
 so arranged the odds and ends round about it 
 that no one looking from the floor of the outhouse

 THE STORE AT UMVELOS'. 157 
 
 would guess at its existence. It occurred to me 
 that the conspirators would want seats, so I placed 
 two cases at the edge of the heap, that they might 
 not be tempted to forage in the interior. 
 
 This done, I went back to the store and pro- 
 ceeded to rig myself out for my part. The cellar 
 had made me pretty dirty, and I added some new 
 daubs to my face. My hair had grown longish, 
 and I ran my hands through it till it stood up 
 like a cockatoo's crest. Then I cunningly disposed 
 the methylated spirits in the places most likely 
 to smell. I burned a little on the floor, I spilt 
 some on the counter and on my hands, and I let 
 it dribble over my coat. In five minutes I had 
 made the room stink like a shebeen. I loosened 
 the collar of my shirt, and when I looked at 
 myself in the cover of my watch I saw a specimen 
 of debauchery which would have done credit to 
 a Saturday night's police cell. 
 
 By this time the sun had gone down, but I 
 thought it better to kindle no light. It was the 
 night of the full moon — for which reason, I sup- 
 posed, Laputa had selected it — and in an hour 
 or two the world would be lit with that ghostly 
 radiance. I sat on the counter while the minutes

 passed, and I confess I found the time of waiting 
 very trying for my courage. I had got over my 
 worst nervousness by having something to do, but 
 whenever I was idle my fears returned. Laputa 
 had a big night's work before him, and must 
 begin soon. My vigil, I told myself, could not 
 be long. 
 
 My pony was stalled In a rough shed we had 
 built opposite the store. I could hear him shaking 
 his head and stamping the ground above the croak- 
 ing of the frogs by the Labongo. Presently it 
 seemed to me that another sound came from behind 
 the store — the sound of horses' feet and the rattle 
 of bridles. It was hushed for a moment, and then 
 I heard human voices. The riders had tied up 
 their horses to a tree and were coming nearer. 
 
 I sprawled gracefully on the counter, the empty 
 bottle in my hand, and my eyes fixed anxiously 
 on the square of the door, which was filled with 
 the blue glimmer of the late twilight. The square 
 darkened, and two men peered in. Colin growled 
 from below the counter, but with one hand I held 
 the scruff of his neck, 
 
 " Hullo," I said, " ish that my black friend ? 
 Awfly shorry, old man, but I've f'nish'd th'

 whisky. The bo-o-ottle shempty," and I waved 
 it upside down with an imbecile giggle. 
 
 Laputa said something which I did not catch. 
 Henriques laughed an ugly laugh. 
 
 " We had better make certain of him," he said. 
 
 The two argued for a minute, and then Laputa 
 seemed to prevail. The door was shut and the 
 key, which I had left in the lock, turned on me. 
 
 I gave them five minutes to get to the outhouse 
 and settle to business. Then I opened the trap, 
 got into the cellar, and crawled to the other end. 
 A ray of light was coming through the partially- 
 raised door. By a blessed chance some old bricks 
 had been left behind, and of these I made a foot- 
 stool, which enabled me to get my back level with 
 the door and look out. My laager of barrels was 
 intact, but through a gap I had left I could see 
 the two men sitting on the two cases I had pro- 
 vided for them. A lantern was set between them, 
 and Henriques was drinking out of a metal flask. 
 
 He took something — I could not see what — out 
 of his pocket, and held it before his companion. 
 
 " Spoils of war," he said. " I let Sikitola's men 
 draw first blood. They needed it to screw up their 
 courage. Now they are as wild as Umbooni's."

 Laputa asked a question. 
 
 " It was the Dutchmen, who were out on the 
 Koodoo Flats with their cattle. Man, it's no good 
 being squeamish. Do you think you can talk over 
 these surly back-veld fools .? If we had not done 
 it, the best of their horses would now be over 
 the Berg to give warning. Besides, I tell you, 
 Sikitola's men wanted blooding. I did for the old 
 swine, Coetzee, with my own hands. Once he 
 set his dogs at me, and I don't forget an injury." 
 
 Laputa must have disapproved, for Henriques' 
 voice grew high. 
 
 " Run the show the way you please," he cried ; 
 "but don't blame me if you make a hash of it. 
 God, man, do you think you are going to work 
 a revolution on skim milk.? If I had my will, 
 I would go in and stick a knife in the drunken 
 hos: next door." 
 
 " He is safe enough," Laputa replied. " I gave 
 him the chance of life, and he laughed at me. He 
 won't get far on his road home." 
 
 This was pleasant hearing for me, but I scarcely 
 thought of myself. I was consumed with a passion 
 of fury against that murdering yellow devil. With 
 Laputa I was not angry ; he was an open enemy.

 playing a fair game. But my fingers itched to get 
 at the Portugoose — that double-dyed traitor to 
 his race. As I thought of my kindly old friends, 
 lying butchered with their kinsfolk out in the 
 bush, hot tears of rage came to my eyes. Perfect 
 love casteth out fear, the Bible says ; but, to speak 
 it reverently, so does perfect hate. Not for safety 
 and a king's ransom would I have drawn back from 
 the game. I prayed for one thing only, that God 
 in His mercy would give me the chance of settling 
 with Henriques. 
 
 I fancy I missed some of the conversation, being 
 occupied with my own passion. At any rate, when 
 I next listened the two were deep in plans. Maps 
 were spread beside them, and Laputa's delicate 
 forefinger was tracing a route. I strained my 
 ears, but could catch only a few names. Appar- 
 ently they were to keep in the plains till they had 
 crossed the Klein Labongo and the Letaba. I 
 thought 1 caught the name of the ford of the 
 latter; it sounded like Dupree's Drift. After 
 that the talk became plainer, for Laputa was ex- 
 plaining in his clear voice. The force would leave 
 the bush, ascend the Berg by the glen of the Groot 
 Letaba, and the first halt would be called at a place

 called Inanda's Kraal, where a promontory of the 
 high-veld juts out behind the peaks called the 
 Wolkberg or Cloud Mountains. All this was 
 very much to the point, and the names sunk into 
 my memory like a die into wax. 
 
 " Meanwhile," said Laputa, "there is the gather- 
 ing at Ntabakaikonjwa.* It will take us three 
 hours hard riding to get there." 
 
 Where on earth was Ntabakaikonjwa ? It must 
 be the native name for the Rooirand, for after all 
 Laputa was not likely to use the Dutch word for 
 his own sacred place. 
 
 " Nothing has been forgotten. The men are 
 massed below the cliffs, and the chiefs and the 
 great indunas will enter the Place of the Snake. 
 The door will be guarded, and only the password 
 will get a man through. That word is " Im- 
 manuel," which means, " God with us." 
 
 " Well, when we get there, what happens .? " 
 Henriques asked with a laugh. "What kind of 
 magic will you spring on us .f* " 
 
 There was a strong contrast between the flippant 
 tone of the Portugoose and the grave voice which 
 answered him.

 " The Keeper of the Snake will open the holy 
 place, and bring forth the Isetembiso sami.* As 
 the leader of my people, I will assume the collar 
 of Umkulunkulu in the name of our God and 
 the spirits of the great dead." 
 
 " But you don't propose to lead the march in 
 a necklace of rubies," said Henriques, with a 
 sudden eagerness in his voice. 
 
 Again Laputa spoke gravely, and, as it were, 
 abstractedly. I heard the voice of one whose mind 
 was fixed on a far horizon. 
 
 " When I am acclaimed king, I restore the Snake 
 to its Keeper, and swear never to clasp it on my 
 neck till I have led my people to victory." 
 
 " I see," said Henriques. " What about the 
 purification you mentioned ? " 
 
 I had missed this before and listened earnestly. 
 
 " The vows we take in the holy place bind us 
 till we are purged of them at Inanda's Kraal. Till 
 then no blood must be shed and no flesh eaten. 
 It was the fashion of our forefathers." 
 
 "Well, I think you've taken on a pretty risky 
 job," Henriques said. " You propose to travel 
 a hundred miles, binding yourself not to strike

 a blow. It is simply putting yourself at the 
 mercy of any police patrol." 
 
 "There will be no patrol," Laputa replied. 
 " Our march will be as secret and as swift as death. 
 I have made my preparations." 
 
 " But suppose you met with opposition," the 
 Portugoose persisted, "would the rule hold.''" 
 
 " If any try to stop us, we shall tie them hand 
 and foot, and carry them with us. Their fate 
 will be worse than if they had been slain in battle." 
 
 " I see," said Henriques, whistling through his 
 teeth. " Well, before we start this vow business, 
 I think I'll go back and settle that storekeeper." 
 
 Laputa shook his head. " Will you be serious 
 and hear me ? We have no time to knife harmless 
 fools. Before we start for Ntabakaikonjwa I must 
 have from you the figures of the arming in the 
 south. That is the one thing which remains to be 
 settled." 
 
 I am certain these fissures would have been most 
 interesting, but I never heard them. My feet 
 were getting cramped with standing on the bricks, 
 and I inadvertently moved them. The bricks 
 came down with a rattle, and unfortunately in 
 slipping I clutched at the trap. This was too

 much for my frail prop, and the door slammed 
 down with a great noise. 
 
 Here was a nice business for the eavesdropper ! 
 I scurried along the passage as stealthily as I could 
 and clambered back into the store, while I heard 
 the sound of Laputa and Henriques ferreting 
 among the barrels. I managed to throttle Colin 
 and prevent him barking, but I could not get 
 the confounded trap to close behind me. Some- 
 thing had jammed in it, and it remained half a 
 foot open. 
 
 I heard the two approaching the door, and I did 
 the best thing that occurred to me. I pulled Colin 
 over the trap, rolled on the top of him, and began 
 to snore heavily as if in a drunken slumber. 
 
 The key was turned, and the gleam of a lantern 
 was thrown on the wall. It flew up and down as 
 its bearer cast the light into the corners. 
 
 " By God, he's gone," I heard Henriques say. 
 " The swine was listening, and he has bolted now." 
 
 " He won't bolt far," Laputa said. " He is 
 here. He is snoring behind the counter." 
 
 These were anxious moments for me. I had 
 a firm grip on Colin's throat, but now and then 
 a growl escaped, which was fortunately blended

 with my snores. I felt that a lantern was flashed 
 on me, and that the two men were peering down 
 at the heap on the half-opened trap. I think that 
 was the worst minute I ever spent, for, as I have 
 said, my courage was not so bad in action, but 
 in a passive game it oozed out of my fingers. 
 
 " He is safe enough," Laputa said, after what 
 seemed to me an eternity. " The noise was only 
 the rats among the barrels." 
 
 I thanked my Maker that they had not noticed 
 the other trap-door. 
 
 "All the same I think I'll make him safer," said 
 Henriques. 
 
 Laputa seemed to have caught him by the arm. 
 " Come back and get to business," he said. " I've 
 told you I'll have no more murder. You will do 
 as I tell you, Mr. Henriques." 
 
 I did not catch the answer, but the two went 
 out and locked the door. I patted the outraged 
 Colin, and got to my feet with an aching side 
 where the confounded lid of the trap had been 
 pressing. There was no time to lose, for the 
 two in the outhouse would soon be setting out, 
 and I must be before them. 
 
 With no better light than a ray of the moon

 through the window, I wrote a message on a leaf 
 from my pocket-book. I told of the plans I had 
 overheard, and especially I mentioned Dupree's 
 Drift on the Letaba. I added that I was going 
 to the Rooirand to find the secret of the cave, and 
 in one final sentence implored ArcoU to do justice 
 on the Portugoose. That was all, for I had no time 
 for more. I carefully tied the paper with string 
 below the collar of the dog. 
 
 Then very quietly I went into the bedroom next 
 door — the side of the store farthest from the out- 
 house. The place was flooded with moonlight, 
 and the window stood open, as I had left it in 
 the afternoon. As softly as I could I swung 
 Colin over the sill and clambered after him. In 
 my haste I left my coat behind me with my pistol 
 in the pocket. 
 
 Now came a check. My horse was stabled in 
 the shed, and that was close to the outhouse. The 
 sound of lead^ing him out would most certainly 
 bring Laputa and Henriques to the door. In 
 that moment I all but changed my plans. I 
 thought of slipping back to the outhouse and 
 trying to shoot the two men as they came forth. 
 But I reflected that, before I could get them both.

 one or ether would probably shoot me. Besides, 
 I had a queer sort of compunction about killing 
 Laputa. I understood now why Arcoll had stayed 
 his hand from murder, and I was beginning to be 
 of his opinion on our arch-enemy. 
 
 Then I remembered the horses tied up in the 
 bush. One of them I could get with perfect 
 safety. I ran round the end of the store and 
 into the thicket, keeping on soft grass to dull 
 my tread. There, tied up to a merula tree, were 
 two of the finest beasts I had seen in Africa. I 
 selected the better, an Africander stallion of the 
 blaauw-schmmelj or blue-roan type, which is famous 
 for speed and endurance. Slipping his bridle from 
 the branch, I led him a little way into the bush in 
 the direction of the Rooirand. 
 
 Then I spoke to Colin. " Home with you," 
 1 said. " Home, old man, as if you were running 
 down a tsessebe." * 
 
 The dog seemed puzzled. " Home," I said 
 again, pointing west in the direction of the Berg. 
 " Home, you brute." 
 
 And then he understood. He gave one low 
 whine, and cast a reproachful eye on me and the

 blue roan. Then he turned, and with his head 
 down set off with great lopes on the track of the 
 road I had ridden in the morning. 
 
 A second later and I was in the saddle, riding 
 hell-for-leather for the north.

 T?OR a mile or so I kept the bush, which was 
 open and easy to ride through, and then 
 turned into the path. The moon was high, and 
 the world was all a dim dark green, with the track 
 a golden ivory band before me. I had looked at 
 my watch before I started, and seen that it was 
 just after eight o'clock. I had a great horse under 
 me, and less than fifty miles to cover. Midnight 
 should see me at the cave. With the password I 
 would gain admittance, and there would wait for 
 Laputa and Henriques, Then, if my luck held, I 
 should see the inner workings of the mystery 
 which had puzzled me ever since the Kirkcaple 
 shore. No doubt I should be roughly treated, 
 tied up prisoner, and carried with the army when 
 the march began. But till Inanda's Kraal my life 
 was safe, and before that came the ford of the

 Letaba. Colin would carry my message to Arcoll, 
 and at the Drift the tables would be turned on 
 Laputa's men. 
 
 Looking back in cold blood, it seems the craziest 
 chain of accidents to count on for preservation. 
 A dozen possibilities might have shattered any link 
 of it. The password might be wrong, or I might 
 never get the length of those who knew it. The 
 men in the cave might butcher me out of hand, 
 or Laputa might think my behaviour a sufficient 
 warrant for the breach of the solemnest vow. 
 Colin might never get to Blaauwildebeestefontein, 
 Laputa might change his route of march, or 
 Arcoll's men might fail to hold the drift. Indeed, 
 the other day at Portincross I was so overcome 
 by the recollection of the perils I had dared and 
 God's goodness towards me that I built a new hall 
 for the parish kirk as a token of gratitude. 
 
 Fortunately for mankind the brain in a life of 
 action turns more to the matter in hand than to 
 conjuring up the chances of the future. Certainly 
 it was in no discomfort of mind that I swung along 
 the moonlit path to the north. Truth to tell, I was 
 almost happy. The first honours in the game had 
 fallen to me. I knew more about Laputa than any

 man living save Henriques ; I had my finger on 
 the central pulse of the rebellion. There was hid 
 treasure ahead of me — a great necklace of rubies, 
 Henriques had said. Nay, there must be more, I 
 argued. This cave of the Rooirand was the head- 
 quarters of the rising, and there must be stored 
 their funds — -diamonds, and the gold they had 
 been bartered for. I believe that every man has 
 deep in his soul a passion for treasure-hunting, 
 which will often drive a coward into prodigies of 
 valour. I lusted for that treasure of jewels and 
 gold. Once 1 had been high-minded, and thought 
 of my duty to my country, but in that night ride I 
 fear that what I thought of was my duty to enrich 
 David Crawfurd. One other purpose simmered 
 in my head. I was devoured with wrath against 
 Henriques. Indeed, I think that was the strongest 
 motive for my escapade, for even before I heard 
 Laputa tell of the vows and the purification, I had 
 it in my mind to go at all costs to the cave. I am 
 a peaceable man at most times, but 1 think I would 
 rather have had the Portugoose's throat in my 
 hands than the collar of Prester John. 
 
 But behind my thoughts was one master-feeling, 
 that Providence had given me my chance and I

 must make the most of it. Perhaps the Calvinism 
 of my father's preaching had unconsciously taken 
 grip of my soul. At any rate I was a fatalist in 
 creed, believing that what was willed would 
 happen, and that man was but a puppet in the 
 hands of his Maker. I looked on the last months 
 as a clear course which had been mapped out for 
 me. Not for nothing had I been given a clue to 
 the strange events which were coming. It was 
 foreordained that I should go alone to Umvelos', 
 and in the promptings of my own fallible heart I 
 believed I saw the workings of Omnipotence. 
 Such is our mortal arrogance, and yet without such 
 a belief I think that mankind would have ever 
 been content to bide sluggishly at home. 
 
 I passed the spot where on my former journey 
 I had met the horses, and knew that I had covered 
 more than half the road. My ear had been alert 
 for the sound of pursuit, but the bush was quiet as 
 the grave. The man who rode my pony would 
 find him a slow traveller, and I pitied the poor 
 beast bucketed along by an angry rider. Gradually 
 a hazy wall of purple began to shimmer before me, 
 apparently very far off. I knew the ramparts of 
 the Rooirand, and let my schimmel feel my knees

 in his ribs. Within an hour I should be at the 
 cliflF's foot. 
 
 I had trusted for safety to the password, but as 
 it turned out I owed my life mainly to my horse. 
 For, a mile or so from the cliffs, I came to the 
 fringes of a great army. The bush was teeming 
 with men, and I saw horses picketed in bunches, 
 and a multitude of Cape-carts and light wagons. 
 It was like a colossal gathering for naachtmaal* at 
 a Dutch dorp, but every man was black. I saw 
 through a corner of my eye that they were armed 
 with guns, though many carried in addition their 
 spears and shields. Their first impulse was to 
 stop me. I saw guns fly to shoulders, and a rush 
 towards the path. The boldest game was the 
 safest, so I dug my heels into the schimmel and 
 shouted for a passage. " Make way 1 " I cried in 
 Kaffir. " I bear a message from the Inkulu.f 
 Clear out, you dogs 1 " 
 
 They recognized the horse, and fell back with a 
 salute. Had I but known it, the beast was famed 
 from the Zambesi to the Cape. It was their king's 
 own charger I rode, and who dared question such

 a warrant ? I heard the word pass through the 
 bush, and all down the road I got the salute. In 
 that moment I fervently thanked my stars that I 
 had got away first, for there would have been no 
 coming second for me. 
 
 At the cliff- foot I found a double line of 
 warriors who had the appearance of a royal guard, 
 for all were tall men with leopard-skin cloaks. 
 Their rifle barrels glinted in the moonlight, and 
 the sight sent a cold shiver down my back. Above 
 them, among the scrub and along the lower slopes 
 of the kranzes, I could see further lines with the 
 same gleaming weapons. The Place of the Snake 
 was in strong hands that night. 
 
 I dismounted and called for a man to take my 
 horse. Two of the guards stepped forward in 
 silence and took the bridle. This left the track to 
 the cave open, and with as stiff a back as I could 
 command, but a sadly fluttering heart, I marched 
 through the ranks. 
 
 The path was lined with guards, all silent and 
 rigid as graven images. As I stumbled over the 
 stones I felt that my appearance scarcely fitted the 
 dignity of a royal messenger. Among those 
 splendid men-at-arms 1 shambled along in old

 breeches and leggings, hatless, with a dirty face, 
 dishevelled hair, and a torn flannel shirt. My 
 mind was no better than my body, for now that I 
 had arrived I found my courage gone. Had it 
 been possible I would have turned tail and fled, 
 but the boats were burned behind me, and I had 
 no choice. I cursed my rash folly, and wondered 
 at my exhilaration of an hour ago. I was going 
 into the black mysterious darkness, peopled by 
 ten thousand cruel foes. My knees rubbed against 
 each other, and I thought that no man had ever 
 been in more deadly danger. 
 
 At the entrance to the gorge the guards ceased, 
 and I went on alone. Here there was no moon- 
 light, and I had to feel my way by the sides. I 
 moved very slowly, wondering how soon I should 
 find the end my folly demanded. The heat of the 
 ride had gone, and I remember feeling my shirt 
 hang clammily on my shoulders. 
 
 Suddenly a hand was laid on my breast, and a 
 voice demanded, "The word.''" 
 
 " Immanuel," I said hoarsely. 
 
 Then unseen hands took both my arms, and 
 I was led farther into the darkness. My 
 hopes revived for a second. The password had

 proved true, and at any rate I should enter the 
 cave. 
 
 In the darkness I could see nothing, but I 
 judged that we stopped before the stone slab 
 which, as I remembered, filled the extreme end of 
 the gorge. My guide did something with the 
 right-hand wall, and I felt myself being drawn into 
 a kind of passage. It was so narrow that two 
 could not go abreast, and so low that the creepers 
 above scraped my hair. Something clicked behind 
 me like the turnstile at the gate of a show. 
 
 Then we began to ascend steps, still in utter 
 darkness, and a great booming tell on my ear. 
 It was the falling river which had scared me on 
 my former visit, and I marvelled that I had not 
 heard it sooner. Presently we came out into a 
 gleam of moonlight, and I saw that we were 
 inside the gorge and far above the slab. We 
 followed a narrow shelf on its left side (or " true 
 right," as mountaineers would call it) until we 
 could go no farther. Then we did a terrible 
 thing. Across the gorge, which here was at its 
 narrowest, stretched a slab of stone. Far, far 
 below I caught the moonlight on a mass of hurry- 
 ing waters. This was our bridge, and though I

 have a good head for crags, 1 confess I grew 
 dizzy as we turned to cross it. Perhaps it was 
 broader than it looked ; at any rate my guides 
 seemed to have no fear, and strode across it as if 
 it was a highway, while I followed in a sweat of 
 fright. Once on the other side, I was handed over 
 to a second pair of guides, who led me down a 
 high passage running into the heart of the mountain. 
 
 The boom of the river sank and rose as the 
 passage twined. Soon I saw a gleam of light 
 ahead which was not the moon. It grew larger, 
 until suddenly the roof rose and I found myself 
 in a gigantic chamber. So high it was that I could 
 not make out anything of the roof, though the 
 place was brightly lit with torches stuck round the 
 wall, and a great fire which burned at the farther 
 end. But the wonder was on the left side, where 
 the floor ceased in a chasm. The left wall was 
 one sheet of water, where the river fell from the 
 heights into the infinite depth below. The torches 
 and the fire made the sheer stream glow and sparkle 
 like the battlements of the Heavenly City. I have 
 never seen any sight so beautiful or so strange, and 
 for a second my breath stopped in admiration. 
 
 There were two hundred men or more in the

 chamber, but so huge was the place that they 
 seemed only a little company. They sat on the 
 ground in a circle, with their eyes fixed on the fire 
 and on a figure which stood before it. The glow 
 revealed the old man I had seen on that morning 
 a month before moving towards the cave. He 
 stood as if in a trance, straight as a tree, with his 
 arms crossed on his breast. A robe of some shin- 
 ing white stuff fell from his shoulders, and was 
 clasped round his middle by a broad circle of gold. 
 His head was shaven, and on his forehead was 
 bound a disc of carved gold. I saw from his gaze 
 that his old eyes were blind. 
 
 "Who comes ?" he asked as I entered. 
 
 "A messenger from the Inkulu," I spoke up boldly. 
 " He follows soon with the white man, Henriques." 
 
 Then I sat down in the back row of the circle to 
 await events. 1 noticed that my neighbour was 
 the fellow 'Mwanga whom I had kicked out of the 
 store. Happily I was so dusty that he could 
 scarcely recognize me, but I kept my face turned 
 away from him. What with the light and the 
 warmth, the drone of the water, the silence of the 
 folk, and my mental and physical stress, 1 grew 
 drowsy and all but slept.

 Chapter XI. 
 
 THE CAVE OF THE ROOIRAND. 
 
 T WAS roused by a sudden movement. The 
 whole assembly stood up, and each man clapped 
 his right hand to his brow and then raised it high. 
 A low murmur of " Inkulu " rose above the din of 
 the water. Laputa strode down the hall, with 
 Henriques limping behind him. They certainly 
 did not suspect my presence in the cave, nor did 
 Laputa show any ruffling of his calm. Only Hen- 
 riques looked weary and cross. I guessed he had 
 had to ride my pony. 
 
 The old man whom 1 took to be the priest 
 advanced towards Laputa with his hands raised 
 over his head. A pace before they met he halted, 
 and Laputa went on his knees before him. He 
 placed his hands on his head, and spoke some 
 words which I could not understand. It reminded 
 me, so queer are the tricks of memory, of an old

 THE CAVE OF THE ROOIRAND. i8i 
 
 Sabbath-school book I used to have which had a 
 picture of Samuel ordaining Saul as king of Israel. 
 I think I had forgotten my own peril and was 
 enthralled by the majesty of the place — the waver- 
 ing torches, the dropping wall of green water, 
 above all, the figures of Laputa and the Keeper of 
 the Snake, who seemed to have stepped out of an 
 antique world. 
 
 Laputa stripped off his leopard skin till he stood 
 stark, a noble form of a man. Then the priest 
 sprinkled some herbs on the fire, and a thin smoke 
 rose to the roof. The smell was that I had 
 smelled on the Kirkcaple shore, sweet, sharp, and 
 stranp:e enouorh to chill the marrow. And round 
 the fire went the priest in widening and contract- 
 ing circles, just as on that Sabbath evening in 
 spring. 
 
 Once more we were sitting on the ground, all 
 except Laputa and the Keeper. Henriques was 
 squatting in the front row, a tiny creature among 
 so many burly savages. Laputa stood with bent 
 head in the centre. 
 
 Then a song began, a wild incantation in which 
 all joined. The old priest would speak some 
 words, and the reply came in barbaric music. The

 words meant nothing to me ; they must have been 
 in some tongue long since dead. But the music 
 told its own tale. It spoke of old kings and great 
 battles, of splendid palaces and strong battlements, 
 of queens white as ivory, of death and life, love 
 and hate, joy and sorrow. It spoke, too, of des- 
 perate things, mysteries of horror long shut to the 
 world. No Kaffir ever forged that ritual. It 
 must have come straight from Prester John or 
 Sheba's queen, or whoever ruled in Africa when 
 time was young. 
 
 I was horribly impressed. Devouring curiosity 
 and a lurking nameless fear filled my mind. My 
 old dread had gone. I was not afraid now of 
 Kaffir guns, but of the black magic of which Laputa 
 had the key. 
 
 The incantation died away, but still herbs were 
 flung on the fire, till the smoke rose in a great 
 cloud, through which the priest loomed misty and 
 huge. Out of the smoke-wreaths his voice came 
 high and strange. It was as if some treble stop 
 had been opened in a great organ, as against the 
 bass drone of the cataract. 
 
 He was asking Laputa questions, to which came 
 answers in that rich voice which on board the

 liner had preached the gospel of Christ. The 
 tongue I did not know, and I doubt if my neigh- 
 bours were in better case. It must have been 
 some old sacred language — Phoenician, Sabaean, I 
 know not what — which had survived in the rite of 
 the Snake. 
 
 Then came silence while the fire died down and 
 the smoke eddied away in wreaths towards the 
 river. The priest's lips moved as if in prayer : of 
 Laputa I saw only the back, and his head was 
 bared. 
 
 Suddenly a rapt cry broke from the Keeper. 
 " God has spoken," he cried. " The path is clear. 
 The Snake returns to the house of its birth." 
 
 An attendant led forward a black goat, which 
 bleated feebly. With a huge antique knife the 
 old man slit its throat, catching the blood in a 
 stone ewer. Some was flung on the fire, which had 
 burned small and low. 
 
 "Even so," cried the priest, "will the king 
 quench in blood the hearth-fires of his foes." 
 
 Then on Laputa's forehead and bare breast he 
 drew a bloody cross. 
 
 " I seal thee," said the voice, " priest and king 
 of God's people."

 The ewer was carried round the assembly, and 
 each dipped his finger in it and marked his fore- 
 head. I ffot a dab to add to the other marks on 
 my face. 
 
 " Priest and king of God's people," said the 
 voice again, " I call thee to the inheritance of John. 
 Priest and king was he, king of kings, lord of 
 hosts, master of the earth. When he ascended on 
 high he left to his son the sacred Snake, the ark of 
 his valour, to be God's dower and pledge to the 
 people whom He has chosen." 
 
 I could not make out what followed. It seemed 
 to be a long roll of the kings who had borne the 
 Snake. None of them I knew, but at the end I 
 thought I caught the name of Chaka the Terrible, 
 and I remembered Arcoll's tale. 
 
 The Keeper held in his arms a box of curiously 
 wrought ivory, about two feet long and one broad. 
 He was standing beyond the ashes, from which, in 
 spite of the blood, thin streams of smoke still 
 ascended. He opened it, and drew out something 
 which swung from his hand like a cascade of red 
 fire. 
 
 " Behold the Snake," cried the Keeper, and every 
 man in the assembly, excepting Laputa and in-

 eluding me, bowed his head to the ground and 
 cried " Ow." 
 
 " Ye who have seen the Snake," came the voice, 
 " on you is the vow of silence and peace. No blood 
 shall ye shed of man or beast, no flesh shall ye eat 
 till the vow is taken from you. From the hour 
 of midnight till sunrise on the second day ye are 
 bound to God. Whoever shall break the vow, on 
 him shall the curse fall. His blood shall dry in his 
 veins, and his flesh shrink on his bones. He shall 
 be an outlaw and accursed, and there shall follow 
 him through life and death the Avengers of the 
 Snake. Choose ye, my people ; upon you is 
 the vow." 
 
 By this time we were all flat on our faces, and 
 a great cry of assent went up. I lifted my head 
 as much as 1 dared to see what would happen 
 next. 
 
 The priest raised the great necklace till it shone 
 above his head like a halo of blood. 1 have never 
 seen such a jewel, and I think there has never 
 been another such on earth. Later I was to have 
 the handling of it, and could examine it closely, 
 though now I had only a glimpse. There were 
 fifty-five rubies in it, the largest as big as a

 pigeon's egg, and the least not smaller than my 
 thumb-nail. In shape they were oval, cut on both 
 sides en cahochon, and on each certain characters 
 were engraved. No doubt this detracted from 
 their value as gems, yet the characters might have 
 been removed and the stones cut in facets, and 
 these rubies would still have been the noblest in 
 the world. I was no jewel merchant to guess 
 their value, but 1 knew enough to see that here 
 was wealth beyond human computation. At each 
 end of the string was a great pearl and a golden 
 clasp. The sight absorbed me to the exclusion of 
 all fear. I, David Crawfurd, nineteen years of 
 age, and assistant-storekeeper in a back-veld dorp, 
 was privileged to see a sight to which no Portu- 
 guese adventurer had ever attained. There, float- 
 ing on the smoke-wreaths, was the jewel which 
 may once have burned in Sheba's hair. 
 
 As the priest held the collar aloft, the assembly 
 rocked with a strange passion. Foreheads were 
 rubbed in the dust, and then adoring eyes would 
 be raised, while a kind of sobbing shook the wor- 
 shippers. In that moment I learned something of 
 the secret of Africa, of Prester John's empire and 
 Chaka's victories.

 " In the name of God," came the voice, " I 
 deliver to the heir of John the Snake of John." 
 
 Laputa took the necklet and twined it in two 
 loops round his neck till the clasp hung down over 
 his breast. The position changed. The priest 
 knelt before him, and received his hands on his 
 head. Then I knew that, to the confusion of all 
 talk about equality, God has ordained some men 
 to be kings and others to serve. Laputa stood, 
 naked as when he was born. The rubies were 
 dulled against the background of his skin, but they 
 still shone with a dusky fire. Above the blood- 
 red collar his face had the passive pride of a Roman 
 emperor. Only his great eyes gloomed and burned 
 as he looked on his followers. 
 
 " Heir of John," he said, " I stand before you 
 as priest and king. My kingship is for the morrow. 
 Now I am the priest to make intercession for my 
 people." 
 
 He prayed — prayed as I never heard man pray 
 before — and to the God of Israel ! It was no 
 heathen fetich he was invoking, but the God of 
 whom he had often preached in Christian kirks. I 
 recognized texts from Isaiah and the Psalms and 
 the Gospels, and very especially from the two last

 chapters of Revelation. He pled with God to 
 forget the sins of his people, to recall the bondage 
 of Zion. It was amazing to hear these blood- 
 thirsty savages consecrated by their leader to the 
 meek service of Christ. An enthusiast may deceive 
 himself, and I did not question his sincerity. I 
 knew his heart, black with all the lusts of paganism. 
 I knew that his purpose was to deluge the land 
 with blood. But I knew also that in his eyes his 
 mission was divine, and that he felt behind him all 
 the armies of Heaven. 
 
 " Thou hast been a strength to the poor,''' said the 
 voice, " a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the 
 heat, when the blast of the Terrible Ones is as a storm 
 against a wall. 
 
 " Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as 
 the heat in a dry place ; . . . the branch of the 
 Terrible Ones shall be brought low. 
 
 ^^ And in this mountain shall the Lord of Hosts 
 make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of 
 wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow. 
 
 " And He will destroy in this mountain the face of 
 the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is 
 brought over alt nations.

 away from off all the earth ; for the Lord hath 
 spoken itr 
 
 I listened spellbound as he prayed. I heard 
 the phrases familiar to me in my schooldays at 
 Kirkcaple. He had some of the tones of my 
 father's voice, and when I shut my eyes I could 
 have believed myself a child again. So much he 
 had got from his apprenticeship to the ministry. 
 I wondered vaguely what the good folks who had 
 listened to him in churches and halls at home 
 would think of him now. But there was in the 
 prayer more than the supplications of the quondam 
 preacher. There was a tone of arrogant pride, 
 the pride of the man to whom the Almighty Is 
 only another and greater Lord of Hosts. He 
 prayed less as a suppliant than as an ally. A 
 strange emotion tingled in my blood, half awe, 
 half sympathy. As I have said, I understood that 
 there are men born to kingship. 
 
 He ceased with a benediction. Then he put 
 on his leopard-skin cloak and kilt, and received 
 from the kneeling chief a spear and shield. Now 
 he was more king than priest, more barbarian than 
 Christian. It was as a king that he now spoke. 
 
 I had heard him on board the liner, and had

 thought his voice the most wonderful I had ever 
 met with. But now in that great resonant hall the 
 magic of it was doubled. He played upon the 
 souls of his hearers as on a musical instrument. 
 At will he struck the chords of pride, fury, hate, 
 and mad joy. Now they would be hushed in 
 breathless quiet, and now the place would echo 
 with savage assent. I remember noticing that the 
 face of my neighbour, 'Mwanga, was running with 
 tears. 
 
 He spoke of the great days of Prester John, 
 and a hundred names I had never heard of. He 
 pictured the heroic age of his nation, when every 
 man was a warrior and hunter, and rich kraals 
 stood in the spots now desecrated by the white 
 man, and cattle wandered on a thousand hills. 
 Then he told tales of white infamy, lands snatched 
 from their rightful possessors, unjust laws which 
 forced the Ethiopian to the bondage of a despised 
 caste, the finger of scorn everywhere, and the 
 mocking word. If it be the part of an orator to 
 rouse the passion of his hearers, Laputa was the 
 greatest on earth. "What have ye gained from 
 the white man ?" he cried. "A bastard civilization 
 which has sapped your manhood ; a false religion

 which would rivet on you the chains of the slave. 
 Ye, the old masters of the land, are now the servants 
 of the oppressor. And yet the oppressors are few, 
 and the fear of you is in their hearts. They feast 
 in their great cities, but they see the writing on 
 the wall, and their eyes are anxiously turning lest 
 the enemy be at their gates." I cannot hope in 
 my prosaic words to reproduce that amazing dis- 
 course. Phrases which the hearers had heard at 
 mission schools now suddenly appeared, not as 
 the white man's learning, but as God's message to 
 His own. Laputa fitted the key to the cipher, 
 and the meaning was clear. He concluded, I 
 remember, with a picture of the overthrow of the 
 alien, and the golden age which should dawn for 
 the oppressed. Another Ethiopian empire should 
 arise, so majestic that the white man everywhere 
 would dread its name, so righteous that all men 
 under it would live in ease and peace. 
 
 By rights, I suppose, my blood should have 
 been boiling at this treason. I am ashamed to 
 confess that it did nothing of the sort. My mind 
 was mesmerized by this amazing man. I could 
 not refrain from shouting with the rest. Indeed 
 I was a convert, if there can be conversion when

 192 PRESTER^ JOHN. 
 
 the emotions are dominant and there is no assent 
 from the brain. I had a mad desire to be of 
 Laputa's party. Or rather, I longed for a leader 
 who should master me and make my soul his own, 
 as this man mastered his followers. I have already 
 said that I might have made a good subaltern 
 soldier, and the proof is that I longed for such 
 a general. 
 
 As the voice ceased there was a deep silence. 
 The hearers were in a sort of trance, their eyes 
 fixed glassily on Laputa's face. It was the quiet 
 of tense nerves and imagination at white-heat. I 
 had to struggle with a spell which gripped me 
 equally with the wildest savage. I forced myself 
 to look round at the strained faces, the wall of the 
 cascade, the line of torches. It was the sight of 
 Henriques that broke the charm. Here was one 
 who had no part in the emotion. I caught his 
 eye fixed on the rubies, and in it I read only a 
 devouring greed. It flashed through my mind 
 that Laputa had a foe in his own camp, and the 
 Prester's collar a votary whose passion was not 
 that of worship. 
 
 The next thing I remember was a movement 
 among the first ranks. The chiefs were swearing

 THE CAVE OF THE ROOIRAND. 193 
 
 fealty. Laputa took off the collar and called God 
 to witness that it should never again encircle his 
 neck till he had led his people to victory. Then 
 one by one the great chiefs and indunas ad- 
 vanced, and swore allegiance with their foreheads 
 on the ivory box. Such a collection of races has 
 never been seen. There were tall Zulus and 
 Swazis with ringkops and feather head-dresses. 
 There were men from the north with heavy brass 
 collars and anklets ; men with quills in their ears, 
 and earrings and nose-rings ; shaven heads, and 
 heads with wonderfully twisted hair ; bodies naked 
 or all but naked, and bodies adorned with skins 
 and necklets. Some were light in colour, and 
 some were black as coal ; some had squat negro 
 features, and some thin, high-boned Arab faces. 
 But in all there was the air of mad enthusiasm. 
 For a day they were forsworn from blood, but 
 their wild eyes and twitching hands told their 
 future purpose. 
 
 For an hour or two I had been living in a dream- 
 world. Suddenly my absorption was shattered, 
 for I saw that my time to swear was coming. I 
 sat in the extreme back row at the end nearest the 
 
 entrance, and therefore I should naturally be the

 last to go forward. The crisis was near when I 
 should be discovered, for there was no question of 
 my shirking the oath. 
 
 Then for the first time since I entered the cave 
 I realized the frightful danger in which I stood. 
 My mind had been strung so high by the ritual 
 that I had forgotten all else. Now came the 
 rebound, and with shaky nerves I had to face dis- 
 covery and certain punishment. In that moment 
 I suffered the worst terror of my life. There was 
 much to come later, but by that time my senses 
 were dulled. Now they had been sharpened by 
 what I had seen and heard, my nerves were already 
 quivering and my fancy on fire. I felt every limb 
 shaking as 'Mwanga went forv/ard. The cave swam 
 before my eyes, heads were multiplied giddily, and 
 I was only dimly conscious when he rose to return. 
 
 Nothing would have made m'e advance, had I 
 not feared Laputa less than my neighbours. They 
 might rend me to pieces, but to him the oath was 
 inviolable. I staggered crazily to my feet, and 
 shambled forwards. My eye was fixed on the 
 ivory box, and it seemed to dance before me and 
 retreat. 
 
 Suddenly I heard a voice — the voice of Hen-

 rlques — cry, " By God, a spy ! " I felt my throat 
 caught, but I was beyond resisting. 
 
 It was released, and I was pinned by the arms. 
 I must have stood vacantly, with a foolish smile, 
 while unchained fury raged round me. I seemed 
 to hear Laputa's voice saying, " It is the store- 
 keeper." His face was all that I could see, and 
 it was unperturbed. There was a mocking ghost 
 of a smile about his lips. 
 
 Myriad hands seemed to grip me and crush my 
 breath, but above the clamour I heard a fierce 
 word of command. 
 
 After that I fainted.

 CAPTAIN ARCOLL SENDS A MESSAGE. 
 
 T ONCE read — I think in some Latin writer — • 
 the story of a man who was crushed to a jelly 
 by the mere repeated touch of many thousand 
 hands. His murderers were not harsh, but an 
 infinite repetition of the gentlest handling meant 
 death. I do not suppose that I was very brutally 
 manhandled in the cave. I was trussed up tight 
 and carried out to the open, and left in the care of 
 the guards. But when my senses returned I felt 
 as if I had been cruelly beaten in every part. The 
 raw-hide bonds chafed my wrists and ankles and 
 shoulders, but they were the least part of my aches. 
 To be handled by a multitude of Kaffirs is like 
 being shaken by some wild animal. Their skins 
 are insensible to pain, and I have seen a Zulu 
 stand on a piece of red-hot iron without noticing it 
 till he was warned by the smell of burning hide.

 Anyhow, after I had been bound by Kaffir hands 
 and tossed on Kaffir shoulders, I felt as if I had 
 been in a scrimmage of mad bulls. 
 
 I found myself lying looking up at the moon. 
 It was the edge of the bush, and all around was the 
 stir of the army getting ready for the road. You 
 know how a native babbles and chatters over any 
 work he has to do. It says much for Laputa's 
 iron hand that now everything was done in 
 silence. I heard the nickering of horses and 
 the jolt of carts as they turned from the bush 
 into the path. There was the sound of hurried 
 whispering, and now and then a sharp com- 
 mand. And all the while I lay, staring at the 
 moon and wondering if I was going to keep my 
 reason. 
 
 If he who reads this doubts the discomfort of 
 bonds let him try them for himself Let him be 
 bound foot and hand and left alone, and in half an 
 hour he will be screaming for release. The sense 
 of impotence is stifling, and I felt as if I were 
 buried in some landslip instead of lying under the 
 open sky, with the night wind fanning my face. 
 I was in the second stage of panic, which is next 
 door to collapse. I tried to cry, but could only

 raise a squeak like a bat. A wheel started to run 
 round in my head, and, when I looked at the 
 moon, I saw that it was rotating in time. Things 
 were very bad with me. 
 
 It was 'Mwanga who saved me from lunacy. 
 He had been appointed my keeper, and the first I 
 knew of it was a violent kick in the ribs. I rolled 
 over on the grass down a short slope. The brute 
 squatted beside me, and prodded me with his 
 gun-barrel. 
 
 " Ha, Baas," he said in his queer English. 
 " Once you ordered me out of your store and 
 treated me like a dog. It is 'Mwanga's turn now. 
 You are 'Mwanga's dog, and he will skin you with 
 a sjambok soon." 
 
 My wandering wits were coming back to me. 
 I looked into his bloodshot eyes and saw what I 
 had to expect. The cheerful savage went on to 
 discuss just the kind of beating I should get from 
 him. My bones were to be uncovered till the 
 lash curled round my heart. Then the jackals 
 would get the rest of me. 
 
 This was ordinary Kaffir brag, and it made me 
 angry. But I thought it best to go cannily. 
 
 *' It I am to be your slave," I managed to say.

## p. 199 (#205) ############################################


 
 CAPT. ARCOLL SENDS A MESSAGE. 199 
 
 "it would be a pity to beat me so hard. You 
 would get no more work out of me." 
 
 'Mwanga grinned wickedly. "You are my 
 slave for a day and a night. After that we kill 
 you — slowly. You will burn till your legs fall 
 off and your knees are on the ground, and then 
 you will be chopped small with knives." 
 
 Thank God, my courage and common sense 
 were coming back to me. 
 
 "What happens to me to-morrow," I said, "is 
 the Inkulu's business, not yours. I am his prisoner. 
 But if you lift your hand on me to-day so as to 
 draw one drop of blood the Inkulu will make 
 short work of you. The vow is upon you, and if 
 you break it you know what happens." And I 
 repeated, in a fair imitation of the priest's voice, 
 the terrible curse he had pronounced in the cave. 
 
 You should have seen the change in that cur's 
 face. I had guessed he was a coward, as he was 
 most certainly a bully, and now I knew it. He 
 shivered, and drew his hand over his eyes. 
 
 "Nay, Baas," he pleaded, "it was but a joke. 
 No harm shall come on you to-day. But to- 
 morrow — " and his ugly face grew more cheerful. 
 
 "To-morrow we shall see what we shall see,"

 I said stoically, and a loud drum-beat sounded 
 through the camp. 
 
 It was the signal for moving, for in the east a 
 thin pale line of gold was beginning to show over 
 the trees. The bonds at my knees and ankles 
 were cut, and I was bundled on to the back of a 
 horse. Then my feet were strapped firmly below 
 Its belly. The bridle of my beast was tied to 
 'Mwanga's, so that there was little chance of escape 
 even if I had been unshackled. 
 
 My thoughts were very gloomy. So far all had 
 happened as I planned, but I seemed to have lost 
 my nerve, and I could not believe in my rescue at 
 the Letaba, while I thought of Inanda's Kraal with 
 sheer horror. Last night I had looked Into the 
 heart of darkness, and the sight had terrified me. 
 What part should I play In the great purification ? 
 Most likely that of the Biblical scapegoat. But the 
 dolour of my mind was surpassed by the discomfort 
 of my body. I was broken with pains and weariness, 
 and I had a desperate headache. Also, before we 
 had gone a mile, I began to think that I should split 
 In two. The paces of my beast were uneven, to say 
 the best of It, and the bump-bump was like being 
 on the rack. I remembered that the saints of the

 CAPT. ARCOLL SENDS A MESSAGE. 201 
 
 Covenant used to journey to prison this way, 
 especially the great Mr. Peden, and I wondered 
 how they liked it. When I hear of a man doing 
 a brave deed, I always want to discover whether 
 at the time he was well and comfortable in body. 
 That, I am certain, is the biggest ingredient in 
 courage, and those who plan and execute great 
 deeds in bodily weakness have my homage as 
 truly heroic. For myself, I had not the spirit of 
 a chicken as I jogged along at 'Mwanga's side. I 
 wished he would begin to insult me, if only to 
 distract my mind, but he kept obstinately silent. 
 He was sulky, and I think rather afraid of me. 
 
 As the sun got up I could see something of 
 the host around me. I am no hand at guessing 
 numbers, but I should put the fighting men I saw 
 at not less than twenty thousand. Every man of 
 them was on this side his prime, and all were 
 armed with good rifles and bandoliers. There 
 were none of your old roers* and decrepit Enfields, 
 which I had seen signs of in Kaffir kraals. These 
 guns were new, serviceable Mausers, and the men 
 who bore them looked as if they knew how to 
 handle them. There must have been \o\\o months

 of training behind this show, and I marvelled at 
 the man who had organized it. 1 saw no field- 
 guns, and the little transport they had was evi- 
 dently for food only. We did not travel in ranks 
 like an orthodox column. About a third of the 
 force was mounted, and this formed the centre. 
 On each wing the infantry straggled far afield, but 
 there was method in their disorder, for in the 
 bush close ranks would have been impossible. At 
 any rate we kept wonderfully well together, and 
 when we mounted a knoll the whole army seemed 
 to move in one piece. I was well in the rear of the 
 centre column, but from the crest of a slope I 
 sometimes got a view in front. I could see nothing 
 of Laputa, who was probably with the van, but in 
 the very heart of the force I saw the old priest of 
 the Snake, with his treasure carried in the kind of 
 litter which the Portuguese call a machila, between 
 rows of guards. A white man rode beside him, 
 whom I judged to be Henriques. Laputa trusted 
 this fellow, and I wondered why. I had not for- 
 gotten the look on his face while he had stared at 
 the rubies in the cave. I had a notion that the 
 Portugoose might be an unsuspected ally of mine, 
 though for blackguard reasons.

 About ten o'clock, as far as I could judge by the 
 sun, we passed Umvelos', and took the right bank 
 of the Labongo. There was nothnig in the store 
 to loot, but it was overrun by Kaffirs, who carried 
 off the benches for firewood. It gave me an odd 
 feeling to see the remains of the meal at which 
 I had entertained Laputa in the hands of a dozen 
 warriors. I thought of the long sunny days 
 when I had sat by my nachtmaal while the Dutch 
 farmers rode in to trade. Now these men were 
 all dead, and I was on my way to the same 
 bourne. 
 
 Soon the blue line of the Berg rose in the west, 
 and through the corner of my eye, as I rode, I 
 could see the gap of the Klein Labongo. I won- 
 dered if Arcoll and his men were up there watching 
 us. About this time I began to be so wretched in 
 body that I ceased to think of the future. I had 
 had no food for seventeen hours, and I was drop- 
 ping from lack of sleep. The ache of my bones 
 was so great that I found myself crying like a 
 baby. What between pain and weakness and 
 nervous exhaustion, I was almost at the end of 
 my tether, and should have fainted dead away if 
 a halt had not been called. But about midday,

 after we had crossed the track from Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein to the Portuguese frontier, we came 
 to the broad, shallow drift of the Klein Labongo. 
 It Is the way of the Kaffirs to rest at noon, and 
 on the other side of the drift we encamped. I 
 remember the smell of hot earth and clean water 
 as my horse scrambled up the bank. Then came 
 the smell of wood-smoke as fires were lit. It 
 seemed an age after we stopped before my feet 
 were loosed and I was allowed to fall over on the 
 ground. I lay like a log where I fell, and was 
 asleep in ten seconds. 
 
 I awoke two hours later much refreshed, and 
 with a raging hunger. My ankles and knees had 
 been tied again, but the sleep had taken the worst 
 stiffness out of my joints. The natives were 
 squatting in groups round their fires, but no one 
 came near me. I satisfied myself by straining at 
 my bonds that this solitude gave no chance of 
 escape. I wanted food, and I shouted on 'Mwanga, 
 but he never came. Then I rolled over into the 
 shadow of a wacht-en-beetje bush to get out of the 
 glare. 
 
 I saw a Kaffir on the other side of the bush

 moved round to my side, and stood regarding me 
 with interest. 
 
 " For God's sake get me some food," I said. 
 
 " Ja, Baas," was the answer ; and he disappeared 
 for a minute, and returned with a wooden bowl of 
 hot mealle-meal porridge, and a calabash full of 
 water. 
 
 I could not use my hands, so he fed me with 
 the blade of his knife. Such porridge without 
 salt or cream Is beastly food, but my hunger was 
 so great that I could have eaten a vat of It. 
 
 Suddenly It appeared that the Kaffir had some- 
 thing to say to me. As he fed me he began to 
 speak In a low voice in English. 
 
 " Baas," he said, " I come from Ratltswan, and 
 I have a message for you." 
 
 I guessed that Ratltswan was the native name 
 for Arcoll. There was no one else likely to send 
 a message. 
 
 " Ratltswan says," he went on, " ' Look out for 
 Dupree's Drift.' I will be near you and cut your 
 bonds ; then you must swim across when Ratltswan 
 begins to shoot." 
 
 The news took all the weight of care from my 
 mind. Colin had got home, and my friends were

 out for rescue. So volatile is the mood of nine- 
 teen that I veered round from black despair to 
 an unwarranted optimism. I saw myself already 
 safe, and Laputa's rising scattered. I saw my 
 hands on the treasure, and Henriques' ugly neck 
 below my heel. 
 
 " I don't know your name," I said to the Kaffir, 
 " but you are a good fellow. When I get out of 
 this business I won't forget you." 
 
 "There is another message, Baas," he said. " It 
 is written on paper in a strange tongue. Turn 
 your head to the bush and see ; I will hold it 
 inside the bowl, that you may read it." 
 
 I did as I was told, and found myself looking at 
 a dirty half-sheet of notepaper, marked by the 
 Kaffir's thumbs. Some words were written on 
 it in Wardlaw's hand ; and, characteristically, in 
 Latin, which was not a bad cipher. I read, — 
 
 " Henricus de Letaha transeunda apud Duprei 
 vadajam nos certiores fecit^* 
 
 I had guessed rightly. Henriques was a traitor 
 to the cause he had espoused. Arcoll's message 
 had given me new heart, but Wardlaw's gave me 
 
 * " Henriques has already told us about the crossing at Dupree's 
 Drift."

 CAPT. ARCOLL SENDS A MESSAGE. 207 
 
 information of tremendous value. I repented that 
 I had ever underrated the schoohnaster's sense. 
 He did not come out of Aberdeen for nothing. 
 
 I asked the Kaffir how far it was to Dupree's 
 Drift, and was told three hours' march. We 
 should get there after the darkening. It seemed 
 he had permission to ride with me instead of 
 'Mwanga, who had no love for the job. How 
 he managed this I do not know ; but ArcoU's 
 men had their own ways of doing things. He 
 undertook to set me free when the first shot was 
 fired at the ford. Meantime I bade him leave me, 
 to avert suspicion. 
 
 There is a story of one of King Arthur's knights 
 — Sir Percival, I think — that once, riding through 
 a forest, he found a lion fighting with a serpent. 
 He drew his sword and helped the lion, for he 
 thought it was the more natural beast of the two. 
 To me Laputa was the lion, and Henriques the 
 serpent ; and though I had no good will to either, 
 I was determined to spoil the serpent's game. He 
 was after the rubies, as I had fancied ; he had 
 never been after anything else. He had found 
 out about ArcoU's preparations, and had sent him 
 a warning, hoping, no doubt, that, if Laputa's force

 was scattered on the Letaba, he would have a 
 chance of getting off with the necklace in the 
 confusion. If he succeeded, he would go over 
 the Lebombo to Mozambique, and whatever hap- 
 pened afterwards in the rising would be no concern 
 of Mr. Henriques. I determined that he should 
 fail ; but how to manage it I could not see. Had 
 I had a pistol, I think I should have shot him ; 
 but I had no weapon of any kind. I could not 
 warn Laputa, for that would seal my own fate, 
 even if I were believed. It was clear that Laputa 
 must go to Dupree's Drift, for otherwise I could 
 not escape ; and it was equally clear that I must 
 find the means of spoiling the Portugoose's game. 
 
 A shadow fell across the sunlight, and I looked 
 up to see the man I was thinking of standing 
 before me. He had a cigarette in his mouth, and 
 his hands in the pockets of his riding-breeches. 
 He stood eyeing me with a curious smile on his 
 face. 
 
 " Well, Mr. Storekeeper," he said, " you and I 
 have met before under pleasanter circumstances." 
 
 I said nothing, my mind being busy with what 
 to do at the Drift. 
 
 "We were shipmates, if I am not mistaken,"

 he said. " I dare say you found it nicer work 
 smoking on the after-deck than lying here in the 
 sun. 
 
 Still 1 said nothing. If the man had come to 
 mock me, he would get no change out of David 
 Crawfurd. 
 
 "Tut, tut, don't be sulky. You have no 
 quarrel with me. Between ourselves," and he 
 dropped his voice, " I tried to save you ; but you 
 had seen rather too much to be safe. What devil 
 prompted you to steal a horse and go to the cave ? 
 I don't blame you for overhearing us ; but if you 
 had had the sense of a louse you would have gone 
 off to the Berg with your news. By the way, how 
 did you manage it .'' A cellar, I suppose. Our 
 friend Laputa was a fool not to take better precau- 
 tions ; but I must say you acted the drunkard 
 pretty well." 
 
 The vanity of nineteen is an incalculable thing. 
 I rose to the fly. 
 
 " I know the kind of precaution you wanted to 
 take," I muttered. 
 
 " You heard that too ? Well, I confess I am 
 in favour of doing a job thoroughly when I take 
 It up.

 ** In the Koodoo Flats, for example," I said. 
 
 He sat down beside me, and laughed softly, 
 " You heard my little story ? You are clever. 
 Mr. Storekeeper, but not quite clever enough. 
 What if I can act a part as well as yourself } " 
 And he thrust his yellow face close to mine. 
 
 1 saw his meaning, and did not for a second 
 believe him ; but I had the sense to temporize. 
 
 " Do you mean to say that you did not kill 
 the Dutchmen, and did not mean to knife me .'' " 
 
 " I mean to say that I am not a fool," he said, 
 lighting another cigarette. 
 
 ** I am a white man, Mr. Storekeeper, and I play 
 the white man's game. Why do you think 1 
 am here ? Simply because I was the only man in 
 Africa who had the pluck to get to the heart of 
 this business. I am here to dish Laputa, and 
 by God I am going to do it." 
 
 I was scarcely prepared for such incredible bluff. 
 I knew that every word was a lie, but I wanted to 
 hear more, for the man fascinated me. 
 
 " I suppose you know what will happen to you," 
 he said, flicking the ashes from his cigarette. " To- 
 morrow at Inanda's Kraal, when the vow is over, 
 they will give you a taste of Kaffir habits. Not

 death, my friend — that would be simple enough — 
 but a slow death with every refinement of horror. 
 You have broken into their sacred places, and you 
 will be sacrificed to Laputa's god. I have seen 
 native torture before, and his own mother would 
 run away shrieking from a man who had endured 
 It. 
 
 I said nothing, but the thought made my flesh 
 creep. 
 
 "Well," he went on, "you're in an awkward 
 plight, but 1 think I can help you. What if I can 
 save your life, Mr. Storekeeper ? You are trussed 
 up like a fowl, and can do nothing. I am the 
 only man alive who can help you. I am willing to 
 do it, too — on my own terms." 
 
 I did not wait to hear those terms, for I had 
 a shrewd guess what they would be. My hatred 
 of Henriques rose and choked me. I saw murder 
 and trickery in his mean eyes and cruel mouth. 
 I could not, to be saved from the uttermost horror, 
 have made myself his ally. 
 
 " Now listen, Mr. Portugoose," I cried. " You 
 tell me you are a spy. What if I shout that 
 through the camp } There would be short shrift 
 for you if Laputa hears it."

 He laughed loudly. "You are a bigger fool 
 than I took you for. Who would believe you, 
 my friend ? Not Laputa. Not any man in this 
 army. It would only mean tighter bonds for these 
 long legs of yours." 
 
 By this time I had given up all thought of 
 diplomacy. " Very well, you yellow-faced devil, 
 you will hear my answer. I would not take 
 my freedom from you, though I were to be boiled 
 alive. I know you for a traitor to the white man's 
 cause, a dirty I.D.B. swindler, whose name is a 
 byword among honest men. By your own con- 
 fession you are a traitor to this idiot rising. You 
 murdered the Dutchmen and God knows how 
 many more, and you would fain have murdered 
 me. I pray to Heaven that the men v/hose cause 
 you have betrayed and the men whose cause you 
 would betray may join to stamp the life out of 
 you and send your soul to hell. I know the 
 game you would have me join in, and I fling 
 your oflFer in your face. But I tell you one 
 thing — you are damned yourself. The white 
 men are out, and you will never get over the 
 Lebombo. From black or white you will get 
 justice before many hours, and your carcass will

 be left to rot in the bush. Get out of my sight, 
 you swine." 
 
 In that moment I was so borne up in my passion 
 that I forgot my bonds and my grave danger. I 
 was inspired like a prophet with a sense of ap- 
 proaching retribution. Henriques heard me out ; 
 but his smile changed to a scowl, and a flush rose 
 on his sallow cheek. 
 
 " Stew in your own juice," he said, and spat 
 in my face. Then he shouted in Kaffir that I had 
 insulted him, and demanded that I should be 
 bound tighter and gagged. 
 
 It was Arcoll's messenger who answered his 
 summons. That admirable fellow rushed at me 
 with a great appearance of savagery. He made 
 a pretence of swathing me up in fresh raw-hide 
 ropes, but his knots were loose and the thing was 
 a farce. He gagged me with what looked like 
 a piece of wood, but was in reality a chunk of dry 
 banana. And all the while, till Henriques was out 
 of hearing, he cursed me with a noble gift of 
 tongues. 
 
 The drums beat for the advance, and once more 
 I was hoisted on my horse, while Arcoll's Kaffir 
 tied my bridle to his own. A Kaffir cannot wink,

 but he has a way of slanting his eyes which does as 
 well, and as we moved on he would turn his head 
 to me with this strange grimace. 
 
 Henriques wanted me to help him to get the 
 rubies — that I presumed was the offer he had 
 meant to make. Well, thought I, I will perish be- 
 fore the jewel reaches the Portuguese's hands. He 
 hoped for a stampede when ArcoU opposed the 
 crossing of the river, and in the confusion intended 
 to steal the casket. My plan must be to get as 
 near the old priest as possible before we reached 
 the ford. I spoke to my warder and told him 
 what I wanted. He nodded, and in the first mile 
 we managed to edge a good way forward. Several 
 things came to aid us. As I have said, we of 
 the centre were not marching in close ranks, but In 
 a loose column, and often it was possible by taking 
 a short cut on rough ground to join the column 
 some distance ahead. There was a vle'i^ too, which 
 many circumvented, but we swam, and this helped 
 our lead. In a couple of hours we were so near 
 the priest's litter that I could have easily tossed a 
 cricket ball on the head of Henriques who rode 
 beside it. 
 
 Very soon the twilight of the winter day began

 to fall. The far hills grew pink and mulberry 
 in the sunset, and strange shadows stole over 
 the bush. Still creeping forward, we found our- 
 selves not twenty yards behind the litter, while far 
 ahead I saw a broad, glimmering space of water 
 with a high woody bank beyond. 
 
 " Dupree's Drift ; " whispered my warder. 
 "Courage, Inkoos ;* in an hour's time you will 
 be free." 
 
 * Great chief.

 Chapter XIII. 
 
 THE DRIFT OF THE LETABA. 
 
 '' I ''HE dusk was gathering fast as we neared the 
 stream. From the stagnant reaches above 
 and below a fine white mist was rising, but the 
 long shallows of the ford were clear. My heart 
 was beginning to flutter wildly, but I kept a tight 
 grip on myself and prayed for patience. As I 
 stared into the evening my hopes sank. I had 
 expected, foolishly enough, to see on the far bank 
 some sign of my friends, but the tall bush was 
 dead and silent. 
 
 The drift slants across the river at an acute 
 angle, roughly S.S.W. I did not know this at the 
 time, and was amazed to see the van of the march 
 turn apparently upstream. Laputa's great voice 
 rang out in some order which was repeated down the 
 column, and the wide flanks of the force converged 
 on the narrow cart-track which entered the water.

 THE DRIFT OF THE LETABA. 217 
 
 We had come to a standstill while the front ranks 
 began the passage. 
 
 I sat shaking with excitement, my eyes straining 
 into the gloom. Water holds the evening light 
 for long, and I could make out pretty clearly what 
 was happening. The leading horsemen rode into 
 the stream with Laputa in front. The ford is not 
 the best going, so they had to pick their way, but 
 in five or ten minutes they were over. Then came 
 some of the infantry of the flanks, who crossed 
 with the water to their waists, and their guns held 
 high above their heads. They made a portentous 
 splashing, but not a sound came from their throats. 
 I shall never know how Laputa imposed silence on 
 the most noisy race on earth. Several thousand 
 footmen must have followed the riders, and dis- 
 appeared into the far bush. But not a shot came 
 from the bluffs in front. 
 
 1 watched with a sinking heart. ArcoU had 
 failed, and there was to be no check at the drift. 
 There remained for me only the horrors at Inanda's 
 Kraal. I resolved to make a dash for freedom, 
 at all costs, and was in the act of telling Arcoll's 
 man to cut my bonds, when a thought occurred 
 to me.

## p. 218 (#224) ############################################


 
 2i8 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 Henrlques was after the rubies, and It was his 
 interest to get Laputa across the river before the 
 attack began. It was Arcoll's business to split the 
 force, and above all to hold up the leader. Hen- 
 riques would tell him, and for that matter he must 
 have assumed himself, that Laputa would ride in 
 the centre of the force. Therefore there would 
 be no check till the time came for the priest's litter 
 to cross. 
 
 It was well that I had not had my bonds cut. 
 Henriques came riding towards me, his face sharp 
 and bright as a ferret's. He pulled up and asked 
 if I were safe. My Kaffir showed my strapped 
 elbows and feet, and tugged at the cords to prove 
 their tightness. 
 
 " Keep him well," said Henriques, " or you will 
 answer to Inkulu. Forward with him now and 
 get him through the water." Then he turned and 
 rode back. 
 
 My warder, apparently obeying orders, led me 
 out of the column and into the bush on the right 
 hand. Soon we were abreast of the litter and 
 some twenty yards to the west of it. The water 
 gleamed through the trees a few paces in front. 
 1 could see the masses of infantry converging on

 THE DRIFT OF THE LETABA. 219 
 
 the drift, and the churning like a cascade which 
 they made in the passage. 
 
 Suddenly from the far bank came an order. It 
 was Laputa's voice, thin and high-pitched, as the 
 Kaffir cries when he wishes his words to carry a 
 great distance. Henriques repeated it, and the in- 
 fantry halted. The riders of the column in front 
 of the litter began to move into the stream. 
 
 We should have gone with them, but instead we 
 pulled our horses back into the darkness of the bush. 
 It seemed to me that odd things were happening 
 around the priest's litter. Henriques had left it, 
 and dashed past me so close that I could have 
 touched him. From somewhere among the trees 
 a pistol-shot cracked into the air. 
 
 As if in answer to a signal the high bluff across 
 the stream burst into a sheet of fire. " A sheet of 
 fire " sounds odd enough for scientific warfare. I 
 saw that my friends were using shot-guns and 
 firing with black powder into the mob in the water. 
 It was humane and it was good tactics, for the 
 flame in the grey dusk had the appearance of a 
 heavy battery of ordnance. 
 
 Once again I heard Henriques' voice. He was 
 turning the column to the right. He shouted to

 220 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 them to get into cover, and take the water higher 
 up. I thought, too, that from far away I heard 
 Laputa. 
 
 These were maddening seconds. We had left 
 the business of cutting my bonds almost too late. 
 In the darkness of the bush the strips of hide 
 could only be felt for, and my Kaffir had a woe- 
 fully blunt knife. Reims are always tough to sever, 
 and mine had to be sawn through. Soon my arms 
 were free, and I was plucking at my other bonds. 
 The worst were those on my ankles below the 
 horse's belly. The Kaffir fumbled away in the 
 dark, and pricked my beast so that he reared 
 and struck out. And all the while I was chok- 
 ing with impatience, and gabbling prayers to 
 myself. 
 
 The men on the other side had begun to use 
 ball-cartridge. I could see through a gap the 
 centre of the river, and It was filled with a mass 
 of struggling men and horses. I remember that 
 it amazed me that no shot was fired in return. 
 Then I remembered the vow, and was still more 
 amazed at the power of a ritual on that savage 
 horde. 
 
 The column was moving past me to the right.

## p. 221 (#227) ############################################


 
 THE DRIFT OF THE LETABA. 221 
 
 It was a disorderly rabble which obeyed Hen- 
 riques' orders. Bullets began to sing through 
 the trees, and one rider was hit in the shoulder 
 and came down with a crash. This increased the 
 confusion, for most of them dismounted and tried 
 to lead their horses in the cover. The infantry 
 coming in from the wings collided with them, and 
 there was a struggle of excited beasts and men in 
 the thickets of thorn and mopani. And still my 
 Kaffir was trying to get my ankles loose as fast as 
 a plunging horse would let him. 
 
 At last I was free, and dropped stiffly to the 
 ground. I fell prone on my face with cramp, 
 and when I got up I rolled like a drunk man. 
 Here I made a great blunder. I should have 
 left my horse with my Kaffir, and bidden him 
 follow me. But I was too eager to be cautious, 
 so I let it go, and crying to the Kaffir to await me, 
 I ran towards the litter. 
 
 Henriques had laid his plans well. The column 
 had abandoned the priest, and by the litter were 
 only the two bearers. As I caught sight of them 
 one fell with a bullet in his chest. The other, 
 wild with fright, kept turning his head to every 
 quarter of the compass. Another bullet passed

 222 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 close to his head. This was too much for him, 
 and with a yell he ran away. 
 
 As I broke through the thicket I looked to the 
 quarter whence the bullets had come. These, I 
 could have taken my oath, were not fired by my 
 friends on the further bank. It was close-quarter 
 shooting, and I knew who had done it. But I 
 saw nobody. The last few yards of the road were 
 clear, and only out in the water was the struggling 
 shouting mass of humanity. I saw a tall man on 
 a big horse plunge into the river on his way back. 
 It must be Laputa returning to command the 
 panic. 
 
 My business was not with Laputa but with 
 Henriques. The old priest in the litter, who had 
 been sleeping, had roused himself, and was look- 
 ing vacantly round him. He did not look long. 
 A third bullet, fired from a dozen yards away, 
 drilled a hole in his forehead. He fell back dead, 
 and the ivory box, which lay on his lap, tilted 
 forward on the ground. 
 
 I had no weapon of any kind, and I did not 
 want the fourth bullet for myself. Henriques 
 was too pretty a shot to trifle with. I waited 
 quietly on the edge of the shade till the Portu-

 goose came out of the thicket. I saw him running 
 forward with a rifle in his hand. A whinny from 
 a horse told me that somewhere near his beast was 
 tied up. It was all but dark, but it seemed to me 
 that I could see the lust of greed in his eyes as he 
 rushed to the litter. 
 
 Very softly I stole behind him. He tore off 
 the lid of the box, and pulled out the great neck- 
 lace. For a second it hung In his hands, but only 
 for a second. So absorbed was he that he did not 
 notice me standing full before him. Nay, he 
 lifted his head, and gave me the finest chance of 
 my life. I was something of a boxer, and all my 
 accumulated fury went into the blow. It caught 
 him on the point of the chin, and his neck cricked 
 like the bolt of a rifle. He fell limply on the 
 ground and the jewels dropped from his hand. 
 
 I picked them up and stuff*ed them into my 
 breeches pocket. 
 
 Then I pulled the pistol out of his belt. It 
 was six-chambered, and I knew that only one had 
 been emptied. I remembered feeling extraor- 
 dinarily cool and composed, and yet my wits must 
 have been wandering or I would have never taken 
 the course I did.

 224 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 The right thing to do — on Arcoll's instructions 
 — was to make for the river and swim across to 
 my friends. But Laputa was coming back, and 
 I dreaded meeting him. Laputa seemed to my 
 heated fancy omnipresent. I thought of him as 
 covering the whole bank of the river, whereas I 
 might easily have crossed a little further down, 
 and made my way up the other bank to my 
 friends. It was plain that Laputa intended to 
 evade the patrol, not to capture it, and there, 
 consequently, I should be safe. The next best 
 thing was to find Arcoll's Kaffir, who was not 
 twenty yards away, get some sort of horse, and 
 break for the bush. Long before morning we 
 should have been over the Berg and in safety. 
 Nay, if I wanted a mount, there was Henriques' 
 whinnying a few paces off. 
 
 Instead I did the craziest thing of all. With 
 the jewels in one pocket, and the Portugoose's 
 pistol in the other, I started running back the 
 road we had come.

 I CARRY THE COLLAR OF PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 T RAN till my breath grew short, for some kind 
 of swift motion I had to have or choke. The 
 events of the last few minutes had inflamed my 
 brain. For the first time in my life I had seen 
 men die by violence — nay, by brutal murder. I 
 had put my soul into the blow which laid out 
 Henriques, and I was still hot with the pride of it. 
 Also I had in my pocket the fetich of the whole 
 black world ; I had taken their Ark of the 
 Covenant, and soon Laputa would be on my trail. 
 Fear, pride, and a blind exultation all throbbed in 
 my veins. I must have run three miles before 
 I came to my sober senses. 
 
 I put my ear to the ground, but heard no sound 
 of pursuit. Laputa, I argued, would have enough 
 to do for a little, shepherding his flock over the 
 water. He might surround and capture the

 226 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 patrol, or he might evade it ; the vow prevented 
 him from fighting it. On the whole I was clear 
 that he would ignore it and push on for the 
 rendezvous. All this would take time, and the 
 business of the priest would have to wait. When 
 Henriques came to he would no doubt have a 
 story to tell, and the scouts would be on my 
 trail. I wished I had shot the Portugoose while I 
 was at the business. It would have been no 
 murder, but a righteous execution. 
 
 Meanwhile I must get off the road. The sand 
 had been disturbed by an army, so there was little 
 fear of my steps being traced. Still it was only 
 wise to leave the track which I would be assumed 
 to have taken, for Laputa would guess I had fled 
 back the way to Blaauwildebeestefontein. I turned 
 into the bush, which here was thin and sparse like 
 whins on a common. 
 
 The Berg must be my goal. Once on the 
 plateau I would be inside the white man's lines. 
 Down here in the plains I was in the country of 
 my enemies. Arcoll meant to fight on the uplands 
 when it came to fighting. The black man might 
 rage as he pleased in his own flats, but we stood 
 to defend the gates of the hills. Therefore over

 PRESTER JOHN'S COLLAR. 227 
 
 the Berg I must be before morning, or there would 
 be a dead man with no tales to tell. 
 
 I think that even at the start of that night's 
 work I realized the exceeding precariousness of 
 my chances. Some thirty miles of bush and 
 swamp separated me from the foot of the moun- 
 tains. After that there was the climbing of them, 
 for at the point opposite where I now stood the 
 Berg does not descend sharply on the plain, but is 
 broken into foot-hills around the glens of the Klein 
 Letaba and the Letsitela. From the spot where 
 these rivers emerge on the flats to the crown of 
 the plateau is ten miles at the shortest. I had 
 a start of an hour or so, but before dawn I had 
 to traverse forty miles of unknown and difficult 
 country. Behind me would follow the best 
 trackers in Africa, who knew every foot of the 
 wilderness. It was a wild hazard, but it was my 
 only hope. At this time I was feeling pretty 
 courageous. For one thing I had Henriques' 
 pistol close to my leg, and for another I still 
 thrilled with the satisfaction of having smitten his 
 face. 
 
 I took the rubies, and stowed them below my 
 shirt and next my skin. I remember taking stock

 of my equipment and laughing at the humour of 
 it. One of the heels was almost twisted off my 
 boots, and my shirt and breeches were old at the 
 best and ragged from hard usage. The whole out- 
 fit would have been dear at five shillings, or seven- 
 and-six with the belt thrown in. Then there was 
 the Portugoose's pistol, costing, say, a guinea; 
 and last, the Prester's collar, worth several millions. 
 
 What was more important than my clothing 
 was my bodily strength. I was still very sore 
 from the bonds and the jog of that accursed 
 horse, but exercise was rapidly suppling my joints. 
 About five hours ago I had eaten a filling, though 
 not very sustaining, meal, and I thought I could 
 go on very well till morning. But I was still 
 badly in arrears with my sleep, and there was no 
 chance of my snatching a minute till I was over 
 the Berg. It was going to be a race against time, 
 and I swore that I should drive my body to the 
 last ounce of strength. 
 
 Moonrise was still an hour or two away, and 
 the sky was bright with myriad stars. I knew 
 now what starlight meant, for there was ample 
 light to pick my way by. I steered by the 
 Southern Cross, for I was aware that the Berg ran

 north and south, and with that constellation on 
 my left hand I was bound to reach it sooner or 
 later. The bush closed around me with its 
 mysterious dull green shades, and trees, which in 
 the daytime were thin scrub, now loomed like 
 tall timber. It was very eerie moving, a tiny 
 fragment of mortality, in that great wide silent 
 wilderness, with the starry vault, like an impassive 
 celestial audience, watching with many eyes. They 
 cheered me, those stars. In my hurry and fear 
 and passion they spoke of the old calm dignities 
 of man. I felt less alone when I turned my face 
 to the lights which were slanting alike on this 
 eerie bush and on the homely streets of Kirkcaple. 
 The silence did not last long. First came the 
 long-drawn howl of a wolf, to be answered by 
 others from every quarter of the compass. This 
 serenade went on for a bit, till the jackals chimed 
 in with their harsh bark. I had been caught by 
 darkness before this when hunting on the Berg, and 
 I was not afraid of wild beasts. That is one terror 
 of the bush which travellers' tales have put too 
 high. It was true that I might meet a hungry 
 lion, but the chance was remote, and I had my 
 pistol. Once indeed a huge animal bounded

 across the road a little in front of me. For a 
 moment I took him for a lion, but on reflection 
 I was inclined to think him a very large bush- 
 
 By this time I was out of the thickest bush and 
 into a piece of parkland with long, waving tam- 
 buki grass, which the Kaffirs would burn later. 
 The moon was coming up, and her faint rays sil- 
 vered the flat tops of the mimosa trees. I could 
 hear and feel around me the rustling of animals. 
 Once or twice a big buck — an eland or a koodoo 
 — broke cover, and at the sight of me went off 
 snorting down the slope. Also there were droves 
 of smaller game — rhebok and springbok and duikers 
 — which brushed past at full gallop without even 
 noticing me. 
 
 The sight was so novel that it set me thinking. 
 That shy wild things should stampede like this 
 could only mean that they had been thoroughly 
 scared. Now obviously the thing that scared 
 them must be on this side of the Letaba. This 
 must mean that Laputa's army, or a large part of it, 
 had not crossed at Dupree's Drift, but had gone 
 up the stream to some higher ford. If that was 
 so, I must alter my course ; so I bore away to the

 right for a mile or two, making a line due north- 
 west. 
 
 In about an hour's time the ground descended 
 steeply, and I saw before me the shining reaches 
 of a river. I had the chief features of the country- 
 side clear in my mind, both from old porings over 
 maps, and from Arcoll's instructions. This stream 
 must be the Little Letaba, and I must cross it if I 
 would get to the mountains. I remembered that 
 Majinje's kraal stood on its right bank, and higher 
 up in its valley in the Berg 'Mpefu lived. At all 
 costs the kraals must be avoided. Once across it 
 I must make for the Letsitela, another tributary of 
 the Great Letaba, and by keeping the far bank of 
 that stream I should cross the mountains to the 
 place on the plateau of the Wood Bush which 
 Arcoll had told me would be his headquarters. 
 
 It is easy to talk about crossing a river, and 
 looking to-day at the slender streak on the map I 
 am amazed that so small a thing should have given 
 me such ugly tremors. Yet I have rarely faced a 
 job I liked so little. The stream ran yellow and 
 sluggish under the clear moon. On the near side 
 a thick growth of bush clothed the bank, but on the 
 far side I made out a swamp with tall bulrushes.

 232 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 The distance across was no more than fifty yards, 
 but I would have swum a mile more readily In 
 deep waters. The place stank of crocodiles. There 
 was no ripple to break the oily flow except where a 
 derelict branch swayed with the current. Some- 
 thing in the stillness, the eerie light on the water, 
 and the rotting smell of the swamp made that 
 stream seem unhallowed and deadly. 
 
 I sat down and considered the matter. Croco- 
 diles had always terrified me more than any created 
 thing, and to be dragged by iron jaws to death in 
 that hideous stream seemed to me the most awful 
 of endings. Yet cross it I must if I were to get 
 rid of my human enemies. I remembered a story 
 of an escaped prisoner during the war who had 
 only the Komati River between him and safety. 
 But he dared not enter it, and was recaptured by a 
 Boer commando. I was determined that such 
 cowardice would not be laid to my charge. If I 
 was to die, I would at least have given myself 
 every chance of life. So I braced myself as best I 
 could, and looked for a place to enter. 
 
 The veld-craft I had mastered had taught me a 
 few things. One was that wild animals drink at 
 night, and that they have regular drinking places.

## p. 233 (#239) ############################################


 
 PRESTER JOHN'S COLLAR. 233 
 
 I thought that the likeliest place for crocodiles 
 was at or around such spots, and, therefore, I 
 resolved to take the water away from a drinking 
 place. I went up the bank, noting where the 
 narrow bush-paths emerged on the water-side. I 
 scared away several little buck, and once the vio- 
 lent commotion in the bush showed that I had 
 frightened some bigger animal, perhaps a harte- 
 beest. Still following the bank I came to a reach 
 where the undergrowth was unbroken and the 
 water looked deeper. 
 
 Suddenly — I fear I must use this adverb often, 
 for all the happenings on that night were sudden 
 — I saw a biggish animal break through the reeds 
 on the far side. It entered the water and, whether 
 wading or swimming I could not see, came out a 
 little distance. Then some sense must have told 
 it of my presence, for it turned and with a grunt 
 made its way back. 
 
 I saw that it was a big wart-hog, and began to 
 think. Pig, unlike other beasts, drink not at 
 night, but in the daytime. The hog had, there- 
 fore, not come to drink, but to swim across. Now, 
 I argued, he would choose a safe place, for the 
 wart-hog, hideous though he is, is a wise beast.

## p. 234 (#240) ############################################


 
 234 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 What was safe for him would, therefore, in all 
 likelihood be safe for me. 
 
 With this hope to comfort me I prepared to 
 enter. My first care was the jewels, so, feeling 
 them precarious in my shirt, I twined the collar 
 round my neck and clasped it. The snake-clasp 
 was no flimsy device of modern jewellery, and I had 
 no fear but that it would hold. I held the pistol 
 between my teeth, and with a prayer to God 
 slipped into the muddy waters. 
 
 I swam in the wild way of a beginner who 
 fears cramp. The current was light and the water 
 moderately warm, but I seemed to go very slowly, 
 and I was cold with apprehension. In the middle 
 it suddenly shallowed, and my breast came against 
 a mudshoal. I thought it was a crocodile, and in 
 my confusion the pistol dropped from my mouth 
 and disappeared. 
 
 I waded a few steps and then pliinged into deep 
 water again. Almost before I knew, I was among 
 the bulrushes, with my feet in the slime of the 
 bank. With feverish haste I scrambled through 
 the reeds and up through roots and undergrowth 
 to the hard soil. I was across, but, alas, I had lost 
 my only weapon.

 PRESTER JOHN'S COLLAR. 235 
 
 The swim and the anxiety had tired me con- 
 siderably, and though it meant delay, I did not 
 dare to continue with the weight of water-logged 
 clothes to impede me. I found a dry sheltered 
 place in the bush and stripped to the skin. I 
 emptied my boots and wrung out my shirt and 
 breeches, while the Prester's jewels were blazing 
 on my neck. Here was a queer counterpart to 
 Laputa in the cave ! 
 
 The change revived me, and I continued my 
 way in better form. So far there had been no 
 sign of pursuit. Before me the Letsitela was the 
 only other stream, and from what I remembered 
 of its character near the Berg I thought I should 
 have little trouble. It was smaller than the Klein 
 Letaba, and a rushing torrent where shallows must 
 be common. 
 
 I kept running till I felt my shirt getting dry 
 on my back. Then I restored the jewels to their 
 old home, and found their cool touch on my breast 
 very comforting. The country was getting more 
 broken as I advanced. Little kopjes with thickets 
 of wild bananas took the place of the dead levels. 
 Long before I reached the Letsitela, I saw that I 
 was right in my guess. It ran, a brawling moun-

 tain stream, in a narrow rift in the bush. I crossed 
 it almost dry-shod on the boulders above a little 
 fall, stopping for a moment to drink and lave my 
 brow. 
 
 After that the country changed again. The 
 wood was now getting like that which clothed the 
 sides of the Bere. There were tall timber-trees — 
 yellowwood, sneezewood, essenwood, stinkwood — 
 and the ground was carpeted with thick grass and 
 ferns. The sight gave me my first earnest of 
 safety. I was approaching my own country. Be- 
 hind me was heathendom and the black fever 
 flats. In front were the cool mountains and bright 
 streams, and the guns of my own folk. 
 
 As I struggled on — for I was getting very foot- 
 sore and weary — I became aware of an odd sound 
 in my rear. It was as if something were follow- 
 ing me. I stopped and listened with a sudden 
 dread. Could Laputa's trackers have got up with 
 me already ? But the sound was not of human 
 feet. It was as if some heavy animal were plung- 
 ing through the undergrowth. At intervals came 
 the soft pad of its feet on the grass. 
 
 It must be the hungry lion of my nightmare, 
 and Henriques' pistol was in the mud of the

 Klein Letaba ! The only thing was a tree, and I 
 had sprung for one and scrambled wearily into the 
 first branches when a great yellow animal came 
 into the moonlight. 
 
 Providence had done kindly in robbing me of 
 my pistol. The next minute I was on the ground 
 with Colin leaping on me and baying with joy. I 
 hugged that blessed hound and buried my head in 
 his shaggy neck, sobbing like a child. How he 
 had traced me 1 can never tell. The secret be- 
 longs only to the Maker of good and faithful 
 dogs. 
 
 With him by my side I was a new man. The 
 awesome loneliness had gone. I felt as if he were 
 a message from my own people to take me safely 
 home. He clearly knew the business afoot, for he 
 padded beside me with never a glance to right or 
 left. Another time he would have been snowking 
 in every thicket. But now he was on duty, a 
 serious, conscientious dog with no eye but for 
 business. 
 
 The moon went down, and the starry sky was 
 now our only light. The thick gloom which 
 brooded over the landscape pointed to the night 
 being far gone. I thought I saw a deeper black-

 ness ahead which might be the line of the Berg. 
 Then came that period of utter stillness when 
 every bush sound is hushed and the world seems 
 to swoon. I felt almost impious hurrying through 
 that profound silence, when not even the leaves 
 stirred or a frog croaked. 
 
 Suddenly as we came over a rise a little wind 
 blew on the back of my head, and a bitter chill 
 came into the air. I knew from nights spent in 
 the open that it was the precursor of dawn. Sure 
 enough, as I glanced back, far over the plain a 
 pale glow was stealing upwards into the sky. In 
 a few minutes the pall melted into an airy haze, 
 and above me I saw the heavens shot with tremors 
 of blue light. Then the foreground began to 
 clear, and there before me, with their heads still 
 muffled in vapour, were the mountains. 
 
 Xenophon's Ten Thousand did not hail the sea 
 more gladly than I welcomed those frowning ram- 
 parts of the Berg. 
 
 Once again my weariness was eased. I cried to 
 Colin^ and together we ran down into the wide, 
 shallow trough which lies at the foot of the hills. 
 As the sun rose above the horizon, the black 
 masses changed to emerald and rich umber, and

 the fleecy mists of the summits opened and re- 
 vealed beyond shining spaces of green. Some 
 lines of Shakespeare ran in my head, which I have 
 always thought the most beautiful of all poetry. 
 
 " Night's candles are burned out, and jocund day 
 Walks tiptoe on the misty mountain tops." 
 
 Up there among the clouds was my salvation. 
 Like the Psalmist, I lifted my eyes to the hills 
 from whence came my aid. 
 
 Hope is a wonderful restorative. To be near 
 the hills, to smell their odours, to see at the head 
 of the glens the lines of the plateau where were 
 white men and civilization — all gave me new life 
 and courage. Colin saw my mood, and spared a 
 moment now and then to inspect a hole or a 
 covert. Down in the shallow trough I saw the 
 links of a burn, the Machudi, which flows down 
 the glen it was my purpose to ascend. Away to 
 the north in the direction of Majinje's were patches 
 of Kafiir tillage, and I thought I discerned the 
 smoke from fires. Majinje's womankind would 
 be cooking their morning meal. To the south 
 ran a thick patch of forest, but I saw beyond it the 
 spur of the mountain over which runs the high-

 road to Wesselsburg. The clear air of dawn 
 was like wine in my blood. I was not free, but I 
 was on the threshold of freedom. If I could only 
 reach my friends with the Prester's collar in my 
 shirt, I would have performed a feat which would 
 never be forgotten. I would have made history 
 by my glorious folly. Breakfastless and footsore 
 I was yet a proud man as I crossed the hollow 
 to the mouth of Machudi's glen. 
 
 My chickens had been counted too soon, and 
 there was to be no hatching. Colin grew uneasy, 
 and began to sniff up wind. I was maybe a 
 quarter of a mile from the glen foot, plodding 
 through the long grass of the hollow, when the 
 behaviour of the dog made me stop and listen. 
 In that still air sounds carry far, and I seemed to 
 hear the noise of feet brushing through cover. 
 The noise came both from north and south, from 
 the forest and from the lower course of the Ma- 
 chudi. 
 
 I dropped into shelter, and running with bent 
 back got to the summit of a little bush-clad knoll. 
 It was Colin who first caught sight of my pursuers. 
 He was staring at a rift in the trees, and suddenly 
 gave a short bark. I looked and saw two men.

 running hard, cross the grass and dip into the bed 
 of the stream. A moment later I had a glimpse 
 of figures on the edge of the forest, moving fast 
 to the mouth of the glen. The pursuit had not 
 followed me ; it had waited to cut me off. Fool 
 that I was, I had forgotten the wonders of Kaffir 
 telegraphy. It had been easy for Laputa to send 
 word forty miles ahead to stop any white man who 
 tried to cross the Berg:. 
 
 And then I knew that I was very weary.

 T WAS perhaps half a mile the nearer to the 
 glen, and was likely to get there first. And 
 after that ? I could see the track winding by the 
 waterside and then crossing a hill-shoulder which 
 diverted the stream. It was a road a man could 
 scarcely ride, and a tired man would have a hard 
 job to climb. I do not think that I had any hope. 
 My exhilaration had died as suddenly as it had 
 been born. 1 saw myself caught and carried off 
 to Laputa, who must now be close on the rendez- 
 vous at Inanda's Kraal. I had no weapon to make 
 a fight for it. My foemen were many and un- 
 tired. It must be only a matter of minutes till I 
 was in their hands. 
 
 More in a dogged fury of disappointment than 
 with any hope of escape 1 forced my sore legs up 
 the glen. Ten minutes ago 1 had been exulting

 MORNING IN THE BERG. 243 
 
 In the glories of the morning, and now the sun 
 was not less bright or the colours less fair, but the 
 heart had gone out of the spectator. At first 1 
 managed to get some pace out of myself, partly 
 from fear and partly from anger. But I soon 
 found that my body had been tried too far. I 
 could plod along, but to save my life I could not 
 have hurried. Any healthy savage could have 
 caught me in a hundred yards. 
 
 The track, I remember, was overhung with 
 creepers, and often I had to squeeze through 
 thickets of tree-ferns. Countless little brooks ran 
 down from the hillside, threads of silver among 
 the green pastures. Soon I left the stream and 
 climbed up on the shoulder, where the road was 
 not much better than a precipice. Every step was 
 a weariness. I could hardly drag one foot after 
 the other, and my heart was beating like the 
 fanners of a mill. I had spasms of acute sickness, 
 and it took all my resolution to keep me from 
 lying down by the roadside. 
 
 At last I was at the top of the shoulder and 
 could look back. There was no sign of anybody 
 on the road so far as I could see. Could I have 
 escaped them ? I had been in the shadow of the

 trees for the first part, and they may have lost 
 sight of me and concluded that I had avoided the 
 glen or tried one of the faces. Before me, I 
 remember, there stretched the upper glen, a green 
 cup-shaped hollow with the sides scarred by 
 ravines. There was a high waterfall in one of 
 them which was white as snow against the red 
 rocks. My wits must have been shaky, for I took 
 the fall for a snowdrift, and wondered sillily why 
 the Berg had grown so Alpine. 
 
 A faint spasm of hope took me into that green 
 cup. The bracken was as thick as on the Pent- 
 lands, and there was a multitude of small lovely 
 flowers in the grass. It was like a water-meadow 
 at home, such a place as I had often in boyhood 
 searched for moss-cheepers' and corncrakes' eggs. 
 Birds were crying round me as I broke this soli- 
 tude, and one small buck — a klipspringer — rose 
 from my feet and dashed up one of the gullies. 
 Before me was a steep green wall with the sky 
 blue above it. Beyond it was safety, but as my 
 sweat-dimmed eyes looked at it I knew that I 
 could never reach it. 
 
 Then I saw my pursuers. High up on the left 
 side, and rounding the rim of the cup, were little

 MORNING IN THE BERG. 245 
 
 black figures. They had not followed my trail, 
 but, certain of my purpose, had gone forward to 
 intercept me. I remember feeling a puny weak- 
 ling compared with those lusty natives who could 
 make such good going on steep mountains. They 
 were certainly no men of the plains, but hillmen, 
 probably some remnants of old Machudi's tribe 
 who still squatted in the glen. Machudi was a 
 blackguard chief whom the Boers long ago smashed 
 in one of their native wars. He was a fierce old 
 warrior and had put up a good fight to the last, 
 till a hired impi of Swazis had surrounded his 
 hiding-place in the forest and destroyed him. A 
 Boer farmer on the plateau had his skull, and used 
 to drink whisky out of it when he was merry. 
 
 The sight of the pursuit was the last straw. I 
 gave up hope, and my intentions were narrowed 
 to one frantic desire — to hide the jewels. Patriot- 
 Ism, which I had almost forgotten, flickered up in 
 the crisis. At any rate Laputa should not have 
 the Snake. If he drove out the white man, he 
 should not clasp the Prester's rubies on his great 
 neck. 
 
 There was no cover in that green cup, so I 
 turned up the ravine on the right side. The

 enemy, so far as I could judge, were on the left 
 and in front, and In the gully I might find a pot- 
 hole to bury the necklet in. Only a desperate 
 resolution took me through the tangle of juniper 
 bushes into the red screes of the gully. At first I 
 could not find what I sought. The stream in the 
 ravine slid down a long slope like a mill race, and 
 the sides were bare and stony. Still I plodded on, 
 helping myself with a hand on Colin's back, for 
 my legs were numb with fatigue. By-and-by the 
 gully narrowed, and I came to a flat place with a 
 long pool. Beyond was a little fall, and up this I 
 climbed into a network of tiny cascades. Over 
 one pool hung a dead tree-fern, and a bay from 
 it ran into a hole of the rock. 1 slipped the 
 jewels far into the hole, where they lay on the 
 firm sand, showing odd lights through the dim 
 blue water. Then I scrambled down again to the 
 flat space and the pool, and looked round to see if 
 any one had reached the edge of the ravine. There 
 was no sign as yet of the pursuit, so I dropped 
 limply on the shingle and waited. For I had 
 suddenly conceived a plan. 
 
 As my breath came back to me my wits came 
 back from their wandering. These men were not

 there to kill me, but to capture me. They could 
 know nothing of the jewels, for Laputa would 
 never have dared to make the loss of the sacred 
 Snake public. Therefore they would not suspect 
 what I had done, and would simply lead me to 
 Laputa at Inanda's Kraal. I began to see the 
 glimmerings of a plan for saving my life, and by 
 God's grace, for saving my country from the 
 horrors of rebellion. The more I thought the 
 better I liked it. It demanded a bold front, and 
 it might well miscarry, but I had taken such 
 desperate hazards during the past days that I was 
 less afraid of fortune. Anyhow the choice lay 
 between certain death and a slender chance of 
 life, and it was easy to decide. 
 
 Playing football I used to notice how towards 
 the end of a game I might be sore and weary, 
 without a kick in my body ; but when I had a 
 straight job of tackling a man my strength miracu- 
 lously returned. It was even so now. I lay on 
 my side, luxuriating in being still, and slowly a 
 sort of vigour crept back into my limbs. Perhaps 
 a half-hour of rest was given me before, on the 
 lip of the gully, I saw figures appear. Looking 
 down I saw several men who had come across

 from the opposite side of the valley, scrambling up 
 the stream. I got to my feet, with Colin bristling 
 beside me, and awaited them with the stiffest face 
 I could muster. 
 
 As I expected, they were Machudi's men. I 
 recognized them by the red ochre in their hair and 
 their copper-wire necklets. Big fellows they were, 
 long-legged and deep in the chest, the true breed 
 of mountaineers. I admired their light tread on 
 the slippery rock. It was hopeless to think of 
 evading such men in their own hills. 
 
 The men from the side joined the men in front, 
 and they stood looking at me from about twelve 
 yards off. They were armed only with knob- 
 kerries, and very clearly were no part of Laputa's 
 army. This made their errand plain to me. 
 
 " Halt ! " I said in Kaffir, as one of them made 
 a hesitating step to advance. " Who are you and 
 what do you seek ? " 
 
 There was no answer, but they looked at me 
 curiously. Then one made a motion with his 
 stick. Colin gave a growl, and would have been 
 on him if 1 had not kept a hand on his collar. 
 The rash man drew back, and ail stood stiff and 
 perplexed.

 " Keep your hands by your side," I said, " or 
 the dog, who has a devil, will devour you. One 
 of you speak for the rest and tell me your pur- 
 pose." 
 
 For a moment I had a wild notion that they 
 might be friends, some of Arcoll's scouts, and out 
 to help me. But the first words shattered the 
 fancy. 
 
 "We are sent by Inkulu," the biggest of them 
 said. " He bade us bring you to him." 
 
 " And what if I refuse to go ? " 
 
 " Then, Baas, we must take you to him. We 
 are under the vow of the Snake." 
 
 "Vow of fiddlestick ! " I cried. "Who do you 
 think is the bigger chief, the Inkulu or Ratitswan ? 
 I tell you Ratitswan is now driving Inkulu before 
 him as a wind drives rotten leaves. It will be 
 well for you, men of Machudi, to make peace 
 with Ratitswan and take me to him on the Berg. 
 If you bring me to him, I and he will reward you ; 
 but if you do Inkulu's bidding you will soon be 
 hunted like buck out of your hills." 
 
 They grinned at one another, but I could see 
 that my words had no effect. Laputa had done 
 his business too well.

 way the Kaffirs have. 
 
 "We wish you no ill, Baas, but we have been 
 bidden to take you to Inkulu. We cannot dis- 
 obey the command of the Snake." 
 
 My weakness was coming on me again, and 
 I could talk no more. I sat down plump on the 
 ground, almost falling into the pool. " Take me 
 to Inkulu," I stammered with a dry throat, " I do 
 not fear him ; " and I rolled half-fainting on my 
 back. 
 
 These clansmen of Machudi were decent 
 fellows. One of them had some Kaffir beer in a 
 calabash, which he gave me to drink. The stuff 
 was thin and sickly, but the fermentation in it did 
 me good. I had the sense to remember my need 
 of sleep. "The day is young," I said, "and I 
 have come far. I ask to be allowed to sleep for 
 an hour." 
 
 The men made no difficulty, and with my head 
 between Colin's paws I slipped into dreamless 
 slumber. 
 
 When they wakened me the sun was beginning 
 to climb the sky. I judged it to be about eight 
 o'clock. The had made a little fire and roasted

 mealies. Some of the food they gave me, and I 
 ate it thankfully. I was feeling better, and I 
 think a pipe would have almost completed my 
 cure. 
 
 But when I stood up I found that I was worse 
 than I had thought. The truth is, I was leg- 
 weary, which you often see in horses, but rarely in 
 men. What the proper explanation is I do not 
 know, but the muscles simply refuse to answer the 
 direction of the will. I found my legs sprawling 
 like a child's who is learning to walk. 
 
 " If you want me to go to the Inkulu, you must 
 carry me," I said, as I dropped once more on the 
 ground. 
 
 The men nodded and set to work to make a 
 kind of litter out of their knobkerries and some 
 old ropes they carried. As they worked and 
 chattered I looked idly at the left bank of the 
 ravine — that is, the left as you ascend it. Some 
 of Machudi's men had come down there, and, 
 though the place looked sheer and perilous, I saw 
 how they had managed it. I followed out bit by bit 
 the track upwards, not with any thought of escape, 
 but merely to keep my mind under control. The 
 right road was from the foot of the pool up a long

 shelf to a clump of juniper. Then there was an 
 easy chimney ; then a piece of good hand-and- 
 foot climbing ; and last, another ledge which led 
 by an easy gradient to the top. I figured all this 
 out as I have heard a condemned man will count 
 the windows of the houses on his way to the 
 scaffold. 
 
 Presently the litter was ready, and the men 
 made signs to me to get into it. They carried me 
 down the ravine and up the Machudi burn to the 
 green walls at its head. I admired their bodily 
 fitness, for they bore me up those steep slopes 
 with never a halt, zigzagging in the proper style of 
 mountain transport. In less than an hour we had 
 topped the ridge, and the plateau was before me. 
 
 It looked very homelike and gracious, rolling 
 in gentle undulations to the western horizon, with 
 clumps of wood in its hollows. Far away I saw 
 smoke rising from what should be the village of 
 the Iron Kranz. It was the country of my own 
 people, and my captors behoved to go cautiously. 
 They were old hands at veld-craft, and it was 
 wonderful the way in which they kept out of sight 
 even on the bare ridges. Arcoll could have taught 
 them nothing in the art of scouting. At an in-

 credible pace they hurried me along, now in a 
 meadow by a stream side, now through a patch 
 of forest, and now skirting a green shoulder of 
 hill. 
 
 Once they clapped down suddenly, and crawled 
 into the lee of some thick bracken. Then very 
 quietly they tied my hands and feet, and, not 
 ungently, wound a dirty length of cotton over my 
 mouth. Colin was meantime held tight and 
 muzzled with a kind of bag strapped over his head. 
 To get this over his snapping jaws took the whole 
 strength of the party. I guessed that we were 
 nearing the highroad which runs from the plateau 
 down the Great Letaba valley to the mining town- 
 ship of Wesselsburg, away out on the plain. The 
 police patrols must be out on this road, and there 
 was risk in crossing. Sure enough I seemed to 
 catch a jingle of bridles as if from some company 
 of men riding in haste. 
 
 We lay still for a little till the scouts came back 
 and reported the coast clear. Then we made a 
 dart for the road, crossed it, and got into cover on 
 the other side, where the ground sloped down to 
 the Letaba glen. I noticed in crossing that the 
 dust of the highway was thick with the marks of

 254 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 shod horses. I was very near and yet very far 
 from my own people. 
 
 Once in the rocky gorge of the Letaba we 
 advanced with less care. We scrambled up a 
 steep side gorge and came on to the small plateau 
 from which the Cloud Mountains rise. After that 
 I was so tired that I drowsed away, heedless of the 
 bumping of the litter. We went up and up, and 
 when I next opened my eyes we had gone through 
 a pass into a hollow of the hills. There was a flat 
 space a mile or two square, and all round it stern 
 black ramparts of rock. This must be Inanda's 
 Kraal, a strong place if ever one existed, for a few 
 men could defend all the approaches. Considering 
 that I had warned Arcoll of this rendezvous, I 
 marvelled that no attempt had been made to hold 
 the entrance. The place was impregnable unless 
 guns were brought up to the heights. I remember 
 thinking of a story I had heard — how in the war 
 Beyers took his guns into the Wolkberg, and 
 thereby saved them from our troops. Could 
 Arcoll be meditating the same exploit ? 
 
 Suddenly I heard the sound of loud voices, and my 
 litter was dropped roughly on the ground. I woke 
 to clear consciousness in the midst of pandemonium.

 Chapter XVI. 
 
 INANDA'S KRAAL. 
 
 '' I "'HE vow was at an end. In place of the 
 silent army of yesterday a mob of maddened 
 savages surged around me. They were chanting 
 a wild song, and brandishing spears and rifles to 
 its accompaniment. From their bloodshot eyes 
 stared the lust of blood, the fury of conquest, and 
 all the aboriginal passions on which Laputa had 
 laid his spell. In my mind ran a fragment from 
 Laputa's prayer in the cave about the "Terrible 
 Ones." Machudi's men — stout fellows, they held 
 their ground as long as they could — were swept 
 out of the way, and the wave of black savagery 
 seemed to close over my head. 
 
 I thought my last moment had come. Certainly 
 it had but for Colin. The bag had been taken 
 from his head, and the fellow of Machudi's had 
 dropped the rope round his collar. In a red fury

 256 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 of wrath the dog leaped at my enemies. Though 
 every man of them was fully armed, they fell back, 
 for I have noticed always that Kaffirs are mortally 
 afraid of a white man's dog. Colin had the sense 
 to keep beside me. Growling like a thunderstorm 
 he held the ring around my litter. 
 
 The breathing space would not have lasted long, 
 but it gave me time to get to my feet. My wrists 
 and feet had been unbound long before, and the 
 rest had cured my leg-weariness. I stood up in 
 that fierce circle with the clear knowledge that my 
 life hung by a hair. 
 
 " Take me to Inkulu," I cried. " Dogs and 
 fools, would you despise his orders ? If one hair 
 of my head is hurt, he will flay you alive. Show 
 me the way to him, and clear out of it." 
 
 I daresay there was a break in my voice, for I 
 was dismally frightened, but there must have been 
 sufficient authority to get me a hearing. Machudi's 
 men closed up behind me, and repeated my words 
 with flourishes and gestures. But still the circle 
 held. No man came nearer me, but none moved 
 so as to give me passage. 
 
 Then I screwed up my courage, and did the 
 only thing possible. I walked straight into the

 INANDA'S KRAAL. 257 
 
 circle, knowing well that I was running no light 
 risk. My courage, as I have already explained, is 
 of little use unless I am doing something. I 
 could not endure another minute of sitting still 
 with those fierce eyes on me. 
 
 The circle gave way. Sullenly they made a 
 road for me, closing up behind on my guards, so 
 that Machudi's men were swallowed in the mob. 
 Alone I stalked forward with all that huge yelling 
 crowd behind me. 
 
 I had not far to go. Inanda's Kraal was a 
 cluster of kyas and rondavels, shaped in a half- 
 moon, with a flat space between the houses, where 
 grew a big merula tree. All around was a medley 
 of little fires, with men squatted beside them. 
 Here and there a party had finished their meal, 
 and were swaggering about with a great shouting. 
 The mob into which I had fallen was of this sort, 
 and I saw others within the confines of the camp. 
 But around the merula tree there was a gathering 
 of chiefs, if I could judge by the comparative quiet 
 and dignity of the men, who sat In rows on the 
 ground. A few were standing, and among them I 
 caught sight of Laputa's tall figure. I strode to- 
 wards It, wondering if the chiefs would let me pass.

 258 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 The hubbub of my volunteer attendants brought 
 the eyes of the company round to me. In a second 
 it seemed every man was on his feet. I could 
 only pray that Laputa would get to me before his 
 friends had time to spear me. I remember I fixed 
 my eyes on a spur of hill beyond the kraal, and 
 walked on with the best resolution I could find. 
 Already 1 felt in my breast some of the long thin 
 assegais of Umbooni's men. 
 
 But Laputa did not intend that I should be 
 butchered. A word from him brought his com- 
 pany into order, and the next thing I knew I was 
 facing him, where he stood in front of the biggest 
 kya with Henriques beside him, and some of the 
 northern indunas. Henriques looked ghastly in 
 the clear morning light, and he had a linen rag 
 bound round his head and jaw, as if he suffered 
 from toothache. His face was more livid, his 
 eyes more bloodshot, and at the sight of me his 
 hand went to his belt, and his teeth snapped. But 
 he held his peace, and it was Laputa who spoke. 
 He looked straight through me, and addressed 
 Machudi's men, 
 
 " You have brought back the prisoner. That is 
 well, and your service will be remembered. Go

 INANDA'S KRAAL. 259 
 
 to 'Mpefu's camp on the hill there, and you will 
 be given food." 
 
 The men departed, and with them fell away the 
 crowd which had followed me. I was left, very 
 giddy and dazed, to confront Laputa and his 
 chiefs. The whole scene was swimming before 
 my eyes. I remember there was a clucking of 
 hens from somewhere behind the kraal, which 
 called up ridiculous memories. I was trying to 
 remember the plan I had made in Machudi's glen. 
 I kept saying to myself like a parrot : " The army 
 cannot know about the jewels. Laputa must keep 
 his loss secret. I can get my life from him if 
 I offer to give them back." It had sounded a 
 good scheme three hours before, but with the 
 man's hard face before me, it seemed a frail peg to 
 hang my fate on. 
 
 Laputa's eye fell on me, a clear searching eye 
 with a question in it. 
 
 There was something he was trying to say to 
 me which he dared not put into words. I guessed 
 what the something was, for I saw his glance run 
 over my shirt and my empty pockets. 
 
 " You have made little of your treachery," he 
 said. " Fool, did you think to escape me ? I

 26o PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 could bring you back from the ends of the 
 earth." 
 
 " There was no treachery," I replied. " Do you 
 blame a prisoner for trying to escape ? When 
 shooting began I found myself free, and I took 
 the road for home. Ask Machudi's men and they 
 will tell you that I came quietly with them, when 
 I saw that the game was up." 
 
 He shrugged his shoulders. " It matters very 
 little what you did. You are here now. — Tie him 
 up and put him in my kya," he said to the body- 
 guard. " I have something to say to him before 
 he dies." 
 
 As the men laid hands on me, I saw the exult- 
 ant grin on Henriques' face. It was more than I 
 could endure. 
 
 "Stop," I said. "You talk of traitors, Mr. 
 Laputa. There is the biggest and blackest at 
 your elbow. That man sent word to Arcoll about 
 your crossing at Dupree's Drift. At our outspan 
 at noon yesterday he came to me and offered me 
 my liberty if I would help him. He told me he 
 was a spy, and I flung his offer in his face. It 
 was he who shot the Keeper by the river side, 
 and would have stolen the Snake if I had not

 INANDA'S KRAAL. 261 
 
 broken his head. You call me a traitor, and 
 you let that thing live, though he has killed your 
 priest and betrayed your plans. Kill me if you 
 like, but by God let him die first." 
 
 I do not know how the others took the revela.- 
 tion, for my eyes were only for the Portugoosa 
 He made a step towards me, his hands twitching 
 by his sides. 
 
 " You lie," he screamed in that queer broken 
 voice which much fever gives. " It was this Eng- 
 lish hound that killed the Keeper, and felled me 
 when I tried to save him. The man who insults 
 my honour is dead." And he plucked from his 
 belt a pistol. 
 
 A good shot does not miss at two yards. I was 
 never nearer my end than in that fraction of time 
 while the weapon came up to the aim. It was 
 scarcely a second, but it was enough for Colin. 
 The dog had kept my side, and had stood docilely 
 by me while Laputa spoke. The truth is, he must 
 have been as tired as 1 was. As the Kaffirs 
 approached to lay hands on me he had growled men- 
 acingly, but when I spoke again he had stopped. 
 Henriques' voice had convinced him of a more 
 urgent danger, and so soon as the trigger hand of

 262 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 the Portugoose rose, the dog sprang. The bullet 
 went wide, and the next moment dog and man 
 were struggling on the ground. 
 
 A dozen hands held me from going to Colin's 
 aid, but oddly enough no one stepped forward to 
 help Henriques. The ruffian kept his head, and 
 though the dog's teeth were in his shoulder, he 
 managed to get his right hand free. I saw what 
 would happen, and yelled madly in my apprehen- 
 sion. The yellow wrist curved, and the pistol 
 barrel was pressed below the dog's shoulder. 
 Thrice he fired, the grip relaxed, and Colin 
 rolled over limply, fragments of shirt still hanging 
 from his jaw. The Portugoose rose slowly with 
 his hand to his head, and a thin stream of blood 
 dripping from his shoulder. 
 
 As I saw the faithful eyes glazing in death, and 
 knew that I had lost the best of all comrades, I 
 went clean berserk mad. The cluster of men 
 round me, who had been staring open-eyed at the 
 fight, were swept aside like reeds. I went straight 
 for the Portugoose, determined that, pistol or no 
 pistol, 1 would serve him as he had served my 
 dog. 
 
 For my years I was a well-set-up lad, long in

 the arms and deep in the chest. But I had not yet 
 come to my full strength, and in any case I could 
 not hope to fight the whole of Laputa's army. I 
 was flung back and forwards like a shuttlecock. 
 They played some kind of game with me, and I 
 could hear the idiotic Kaffir laughter. It was 
 blind man's bufi^, so far as I was concerned, for I 
 was blind with fury. I struck out wildly left and 
 right, beating the air often, but sometimes getting 
 a solid blow on hard black flesh. I was soundly 
 beaten myself, pricked with spears, and made to 
 caper for savage sport. Suddenly I saw Laputa 
 before me, and hurled myself madly at his chest. 
 Some one gave me a clout on the head, and my 
 senses fled. 
 
 When I came to myself, I was lying on a 
 heap of mealie-stalks in a dark room. I had a 
 desperate headache, and a horrid nausea, which 
 made me fall back as soon as I tried to raise 
 myself. 
 
 A voice came out of the darkness as I stirred — 
 a voice speaking English. 
 
 " Are you awake, Mr. Storekeeper .? " 
 
 The voice was Laputa's, but I could not see

 264 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 him. The room was pitch dark, except for a long 
 ray of sunlight on the floor. 
 
 "I'm awake," I said. "What do you want 
 with me ? " 
 
 Some one stepped out of the gloom and sat 
 down near me. A naked black foot broke the 
 belt of light on the floor. 
 
 " For God's sake get me a drink," I murmured. 
 
 The figure rose and fetched a pannikin of water 
 from a pail. I could hear the cool trickle of the 
 drops on the metal. A hand put the dish to my 
 mouth, and I drank water with a strong dash of 
 spirits. This brought back my nausea, and I 
 collapsed on the mealie-stalks till the fit passed. 
 
 Again the voice spoke, this time from close at 
 hand. 
 
 " You are paying the penalty of being a fool, 
 Mr. Storekeeper. You are young to die, but 
 folly is common in youth. In an hour you will 
 regret that you did not listen to my advice at 
 Umvelos'." 
 
 I clawed at my wits and strove to realize what 
 he was saying. He spoke of death within an 
 hour. If it only came sharp and sudden, I did 
 not mind greatly. The plan I had made had

 INANDA'S KRAAL. 265 
 
 slipped utterly out of my mind. My body was 
 so wretched, that I asked only for rest. I was 
 very lightheaded and foolish at that moment. 
 
 " Kill me if you like," I whispered. " Some 
 day you will pay dearly for it all. But for God's 
 sake go away and leave me alone." 
 
 Laputa laughed. It was a horrid sound in the 
 darkness. 
 
 " You are brave, Mr. Storekeeper, but I have 
 seen a brave man's courage ebb very fast when 
 he saw the death which I have arranged for you. 
 Would you like to hear something of it by way 
 of preparation .'' " 
 
 In a low gentle voice he began to tell me mys- 
 teries of awful cruelty. At first I scarcely heard 
 him, but as he went on my brain seemed to wake 
 from its lethargy. I listened with freezing blood. 
 Not in my wildest nightmares had I imagined such 
 a fate. Then in despite of myself a cry broke 
 from me. 
 
 " It interests you } " Laputa asked. " I could 
 tell you more, but something must be left to the 
 fancy. Yours should be an active one," and his 
 hand gripped my shaking wrist and felt my pulse. 
 
 " Henriques will see that the truth does not fall

 266 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 short of my forecast," he went on. " For I have 
 appointed Henriques your executioner." 
 
 The name brought my senses back to me, 
 
 "Kill me," I said, "but for God's sake kill 
 Henriques too. If you did justice you would let 
 me go and roast the Portugoose alive. But for me 
 the Snake would be over the Lebombo by this 
 time in Henriques' pocket." 
 
 " But it is not, my friend. It was stolen by a 
 storekeeper, who will shortly be wishing he had 
 died in his mother's womb." 
 
 My plan was slowly coming back to me. 
 
 " If you value Prester John's collar, you will 
 save my life. What will your rising be without 
 the Snake ? Would they follow you a yard if 
 they suspected you had lost it ? " 
 
 " So you would threaten me," Laputa said very 
 gently. Then in a burst of wrath he shouted, 
 " They will follow me to hell for my own sake. 
 Imbecile, do you think my power is built on a 
 trinket ? When you are in your grave, I will 
 be ruling a hundred millions from the proudest 
 throne on earth." 
 
 He sprang to his feet, and pulled back a shutter 
 of the window, letting a flood of light into the hut.

 INANDA'S KRAAL. 267 
 
 In that liQ^ht I saw that he had in his hands the 
 ivory box which had contained the collar. 
 
 " I will carry the casket through the wars," he 
 cried, " and if I choose never to open it, who will 
 gainsay me ? You besotted fool, to think that 
 any theft of yours could hinder my destiny ! " 
 
 He was the blustering savage again, and I pre- 
 ferred him in the part. All that he said might be 
 true, but I thought I could detect in his voice 
 a keen regret, and in his air a touch of disquiet. 
 The man was a fanatic, and like all fanatics had 
 his superstitions. 
 
 " Yes," I said, "but when you mount the throne 
 you speak of, it would be a pity not to have the 
 rubies on your neck after all your talk in the 
 
 cave." 
 
 I thought he would have throttled me. He 
 glowered down at me with murder In his eyes. 
 Then he dashed the casket on the floor with such 
 violence that it broke into fragments. 
 
 " Give me back the Ndhlondhlo," he cried, 
 like a petted child. " Give me back the collar 
 of John." 
 
 This was the moment I had been waiting for. 
 
 " Now see here, Mr. Laputa," I said. " 1 am

 268 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 going to talk business. Before you started this 
 rising, you were a civilized man with a good 
 education. Well, just remember that education 
 for a minute, and look at the matter in a sensible 
 light. I'm not like the Portugoose. I don't want 
 to steal your rubies. 1 swear to God that what I 
 have told you is true. Henriques killed the 
 priest, and would have bagged the jewels if I had 
 not laid him out. I ran away because I was 
 going to be killed to-day, and I took the collar to 
 keep it out of Henriques' hands. I tell you 
 I would never have shot the old man myself. 
 Very well, what happened ? Your men overtook 
 me, and I had no choice but to surrender. Before 
 they reached me, I hid the collar in a place I know 
 of. Now, 1 am going to make you a fair and 
 square business proposition. You may be able to 
 get on without the Snake, but I can see you 
 want it back. I am in a tight place and want 
 nothing so much as my life. I offer to trade with 
 you. Give me my life, and I will take you to the 
 place and put the jewels in your hand. Otherwise 
 you may kill me, but you will never see the collar 
 of John again." 
 
 I still think that was a pretty bold speech for

## p. 269 (#275) ############################################


 
 INANDA'S KRAAL. 269 
 
 a man to make in a predicament like mine. But 
 it had its effect. Laputa ceased to be the barbarian 
 king, and talked like a civilized man. 
 
 " That is, as you call it, a business proposition. 
 But supposing I refuse it .'' Supposing 1 take 
 measures here — in this kraal — to make you speak, 
 and then send for the jewels." 
 
 " There are several objections," I said, quite 
 cheerfully, for I felt that I was gaining ground. 
 " One is that I could not explain to any mortal 
 soul how to find the collar. 1 know where it is, 
 but I could not impart the knowledge. Another 
 is that the country between here and Machudi's 
 is not very healthy for your people. Arcoll's men 
 are all over it, and you cannot have a collection of 
 search parties rummaging about in the glen for 
 long. Last and most important, if you send any 
 one for the jewels, you confess their loss. No, 
 Mr. Laputa, if you want them back, you must go 
 yourself and take me with you." 
 
 He stood silent for a little, with his brows knit in 
 thought. Then he opened the door and went out. 
 I guessed that he had gone to discover from his 
 scouts the state of the country between Inanda's 
 Kraal and Machudi's glen. Hope had come back

 270 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 to me, and I sat among the mealie-stalks trying to 
 plan the future. If he made a bargain, I believed 
 he would keep it. Once set free at the head of 
 Machudi's, I should be within an hour or two of 
 Arcoll's posts. So far, I had done nothing for the 
 cause. My message had been made useless by 
 Henriques' treachery, and I had stolen the Snake 
 only to restore it. But if I got off with my life, 
 there would be work for me to do in the Arma- 
 geddon which I saw approaching. Should I escape, 
 I wondered. What would hinder Laputa from 
 setting his men to follow me, and seize me before 
 I could get into safety .'' My only chance was that 
 Arcoll might have been busy this day, and the 
 countryside too full of his men to let Laputa's 
 Kaffirs through. But if this was so, Laputa and 
 I should be stopped, and then Laputa would cer- 
 tainly kill me. I wished — and yet I did not wish 
 — that Arcoll should hold all approaches. As I 
 reflected, my first exhilaration died away. The 
 scales were still heavily weighted against me. 
 
 Laputa returned, closing the door behind him. 
 
 '* I will bargain with you on my own terms. 
 You shall have your life, and in return you will 
 take me to the place where you hid the collar, and

 put it into my hands. I will ride there, and you 
 will run beside me, tied to my saddle. If we are 
 in danger from the white men, I will shoot you 
 dead. Do you accept .'' " 
 
 " Yes," I said, scrambling to my feet, and rue- 
 fully testing my shaky legs. " But if you want 
 me to get to Machudi's you must go slowly, for 
 1 am nearly foundered." 
 
 Then he brought out a Bible, and made me 
 swear on it that I would do as I promised. 
 
 " Swear to me in turn," 1 said, " that you will 
 give me my life if I restore the jewels." 
 
 He swore, kissing the book like a witness in 
 a police-court. 1 had forgotten that the man 
 called himself a Christian. 
 
 " One thing more I ask," I said. " 1 want my 
 dog decently buried." 
 
 " That has been already done," was the reply. 
 " He was a brave animal, and my people honour 
 bravery."

 TV/TY eyes were bandaged tight, and a thong was 
 "^ run round my right wrist and tied to 
 
 Laputa's saddle-bow. I felt the glare of the after- 
 noon sun on my head, and my shins were continu- 
 ally barked by stones and trees ; but these were 
 my only tidings of the outer world. By the 
 sound of his paces Laputa was riding the schimmel^ 
 and if any one thinks it easy to go blindfold by 
 a horse's side I hope he will soon have the experi- 
 ence. In the darkness I could not tell the speed 
 of the beast. When I ran I overshot it and was 
 tugged back ; when I walked my wrist was dis- 
 located with the tugs forward. 
 
 For an hour or more I suffered this breakneck 
 treatment. We were descending. Often I could 
 hear the noise of falling streams, and once we 
 splashed through a mountain ford. Laputa was

 taking no risks, for he clearly had in mind the 
 possibility of some accident which would set me 
 free, and he had no desire to have me guiding 
 Arcoll to his camp. 
 
 But as I stumbled and sprawled down these 
 rocky tracks I was not thinking of Laputa's plans. 
 My whole soul was filled with regret for Colin, 
 and rage against his murderer. After my first 
 mad rush I had not thought about my dog. He 
 was dead, but so would I be in an hour or two, 
 and there was no cause to lament him. But at 
 the first revival of hope my grief had returned. 
 As they bandaged my eyes I was wishing that they 
 would let me see his grave. As I followed beside 
 Laputa I told myself that if ever 1 got free, when 
 the war was over I would go to Inanda's Kraal, 
 find the grave, and put a tombstone over it in 
 memory of the dog that saved my life. I would 
 also write that the man who shot him was killed 
 on such and such a day at such and such a place 
 by Colin's master. I wondered why Laputa had 
 not the wits to see the Portugoose's treachery and 
 to let me fight him. I did not care what were the 
 weapons — knives or guns, or naked fists — I would 
 certainly kill him, and afterwards the Kaffirs could

 do as they pleased with me. Hot tears of rage 
 and weakness wet the bandage on my eyes, and 
 the sobs which came from me were not only those 
 of weariness. 
 
 At last we halted. Laputa got down and took 
 off the bandage, and I found myself in one of the 
 hill-meadows which lie among the foothills of the 
 Wolkberg. The glare blinded me, and for a 
 little I could only see the marigolds growing at 
 my feet. Then I had a glimpse of the deep gorge 
 of the Great Letaba below me, and far to the east 
 the flats running out to the hazy blue line of the 
 Lebombo hills. Laputa let me sit on the ground 
 for a minute or two to get my breath and rest my 
 feet. " That was a rough road," he said. " You 
 can take it easier now, for I have no wish to carry 
 you." He patted the schimmelj and the beautiful 
 creature turned his mild eyes on the pair of us. 
 I wondered if he recognized his rider of two nights 
 ago. 
 
 I had seen Laputa as the Christian minister, as 
 the priest and king in the cave, as the leader of 
 an army at Dupree's Drift, and at the kraal we had 
 left as the savage with all self-control flung to the 
 winds. I was to see this amazing man in a

 further part. For he now became a friendly and 
 rational companion. He kept his horse at an easy 
 walk, and talked to me as if we were two friends 
 out for a trip together. Perhaps he had talked 
 thus to Arcoll, the half-caste who drove his Cape- 
 cart. 
 
 The wooded bluff above Machudi's glen showed 
 far in front. He told me the story of the Machudi 
 war, which I knew already, but he told it as a 
 saga. There had been a stratagem by which one 
 of the Boer leaders — a Grobelaar, I think — got 
 some of his men into the enemy's camp by hiding 
 them in a captured forage wagon. 
 
 " Like the Trojan horse," I said involuntarily. 
 
 " Yes," said my companion, " the same old 
 device," and to my amazement he quoted some 
 lines of Virgil. 
 
 " Do you understand Latin ? " he asked. 
 
 I told him that I had some slight knowledge of 
 the tongue, acquired at the university of Edin- 
 burgh. Laputa nodded. He mentioned the name 
 of a professor, and commented on his scholarship. 
 
 " O man 1 " I cried, " what in God's name are 
 you doing in this business ? You that are educated 
 and have seen the world, what makes you try to

 276 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 put the clock back ? You want to wipe out the 
 civilization of a thousand years, and turn us all 
 into savages. It's the more shame to you when 
 you know better." 
 
 " You misunderstand me," he said quietly. " It 
 is because I have sucked civilization dry that I 
 know the bitterness of the fruit. I want a simpler 
 and better world, and I want that world for my 
 own people. I am a Christian, and will you tell 
 me that your civilization pays much attention to 
 Christ .'' You call yourself a patriot ^ Will you 
 not give me leave to be a patriot in turn ^ " 
 
 " If you are a Christian, what sort of Christianity 
 is it to deluge the land with blood ? " 
 
 " The best," he said. " The house must be 
 swept and garnished before the man of the house 
 can dwell in it. You have read history. Such a 
 purging has descended on the Church at many 
 times, and the world has awakened to a new hope. 
 It is the same in all religions. The temples grow 
 tawdry and foul and must be cleansed, and, let me 
 remind you, the cleanser has always come out of 
 the desert." 
 
 I had no answer, being too weak and forlorn to 
 think. But I fastened on his patriotic plea.

 " Where are the patriots in your following ? 
 They are all red Kaffirs crying for blood and 
 plunder. Supposing you were Oliver Cromwell 
 you could make nothing out of such a crew." 
 
 " They are my people," he said simply. 
 
 By this time we had forded the Great Letaba, 
 and were makin|ftour way through the clumps of 
 forest to the crown of the plateau. I noticed that 
 Laputa kept well in cover, preferring the tangle 
 of wooded undergrowth to the open spaces of the 
 water-meadows. As he talked, his wary eyes were 
 keeping a sharp look-out over the landscape. I 
 thrilled with the thought that my own folk were 
 near at hand. 
 
 Once Laputa checked me with his hand as 1 
 was going to speak, and in silence we crossed the 
 kloof of a little stream. After that we struck a 
 long strip of forest, and he slackened his watch. 
 
 " If you fight for a great cause," I said, " why 
 do you let a miscreant like Henriques have a hand 
 in it .'' You must know that the man's only in- 
 terest in you is the chance of loot. I am for 
 you against Henriques, and 1 tell you plain that 
 if you don't break the snake's back it will sting 
 you."

## p. 278 (#284) ############################################


 
 278 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 Laputa looked at me with an odd, meditative 
 look. 
 
 "You misunderstand again, Mr. Storekeeper. 
 The Portuguese is what you call a * mean white.' 
 His only safety is among us. I am campaigner 
 enough to know that an enemy, who has a burn- 
 ing grievance against my other enemies, is a good 
 ally. You are too hard on Henriques. You and 
 your friends have treated him as a Kaffir, and a 
 Kaffir he is in everything but Kaffir virtues. What 
 makes you so anxious that Henriques should not 
 betray me ? " 
 
 "I'm not a mean white," I said, "and I will 
 speak the truth, I hope, in God's name, to see 
 you smashed ; but I want it done by honest men, 
 and not by a yellow devil who has murdered my 
 dog and my friends. Sooner or later you will 
 find him out ; and if he escapes you, and there's 
 any justice in heaven, he won't escape me." 
 
 " Brave words," said Laputa, with a laugh, and 
 then in one second he became rigid in the saddle. 
 We had crossed a patch of meadow and entered a 
 wood, beyond which ran the highway. I fancy he 
 was out in his reckoning, and did not think the 
 road so near. At any rate, after a moment he

 caught the sound of horses, and I caught it too. 
 The wood was thin, and there was no room for 
 retreat, while to recross the meadow would bring 
 us clean into the open. He jumped from his 
 horse, untied with amazing quickness the rope 
 halter from its neck, and started to gag me by- 
 winding the thing round my jaw. 
 
 I had no time to protest that I would keep 
 faith, and my right hand was tethered to his 
 pommel. In the grip of these great arms I was 
 helpless, and in a trice was standing dumb as a 
 lamp-post ; while Laputa, his left arm round both 
 of mine, and his right hand over the schimmeFs 
 eyes, strained his ears like a sable antelope who has 
 scented danger. 
 
 There was never a more brutal gagging. The 
 rope crushed my nose and drove my lips down 
 on my teeth, besides gripping my throat so that I 
 could scarcely breathe. The pain was so great 
 that I became sick, and would have fallen but 
 for Laputa. Happily I managed to get my teeth 
 apart, so that one coil slipped between, and eased 
 the pain of the jaws. But the rest was bad enough 
 to make me bite frantically on the tow, and I think 
 in a little my sharp front teeth would have severed

 it. All this discomfort prevented me seeing what 
 happened. The wood, as I have said, was thin, 
 and through the screen of leaves I had a confused 
 impression of men and horses passing interminably. 
 There can only have been a score at the most ; 
 but the moments drag if a cord is gripping your 
 throat. When Laputa at length untied me, I had 
 another fit of nausea, and leaned helplessly against 
 a tree. 
 
 Laputa listened till the sound of the horses had 
 died away ; then silently we stole to the edge of 
 the road, across, and into the thicker evergreen 
 bush on the far side. At a pace which forced me 
 to run hard, we climbed a steepish slope, till ahead 
 of us we saw the bald green crown of the meadow- 
 land. I noticed that his face had grown dark 
 and sullen again. He was in an enemy's country, 
 and had the air of the hunted instead of the 
 hunter. When I stopped he glowered at me, 
 and once, when I was all but overcome with 
 fatigue, he lifted his hand in a threat. Had he 
 carried a sjambok, it would have fallen on my 
 back. 
 
 If he was nervous, so was I. The fact that I 
 was out of the Kaffir country and in the land of

 my own folk was a kind of qualified liberty. At 
 any moment, I felt, Providence might intervene 
 to set me free. It was in the bond that Laputa 
 should shoot me if we were attacked ; but a pistol 
 might miss. As far as my shaken wits would let 
 me, I began to forecast the future. Once he got 
 the jewels my side of the bargain was complete. 
 He had promised me my life, but there had been 
 nothing said about my liberty ; and I felt assured 
 that Laputa would never allow one who had seen 
 so much to get off to ArcoU with his tidings. But 
 back to that unhallowed kraal I was resolved I 
 would not go. He was armed, and I was help- 
 less ; he was strong, and I was dizzy with weak- 
 ness ; he was mounted, and I was on foot : it 
 seemed a poor hope that I should get away. 
 There was little chance from a wandering patrol, 
 for I knew if we were followed I should have a 
 bullet in my head, while Laputa got off on the 
 schimmel. I must wait and bide events. At the 
 worst, a clean shot on the hillside in a race for life 
 was better than the unknown mysteries of the 
 kraal. I prayed earnestly to God to show me His 
 mercy, for if ever man was sore bested by the 
 heathen it was I.

 282 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 To my surprise, Laputa chose to show himself 
 on the green hill-shoulder. He looked towards 
 the Wolkberg and raised his hands. It must have 
 been some signal. I cast my eyes back on the 
 road we had come, and I thought I saw some 
 figures a mile back, on the edge of the Letaba 
 gorge. Laputa was making sure of my return. 
 
 By this time it was about four in the afternoon, 
 and as heavenly weather as the heart of man could 
 wish. The meadows were full of aromatic herbs, 
 which, as we crushed them, sent up a delicate 
 odour. The little pools and shallows of the burns 
 were as clear as a Lothian trout-stream. We were 
 now going at a good pace, and I found that my 
 earlier weariness was growing less. I was being 
 keyed up for some great crisis, for in my case the 
 spirit acts direct on the body, and fatigue grows 
 and ebbs with hope. I knew that my strength 
 was not far from breaking-point ; but I knew also 
 that so long as a chance was left me I should have 
 enough for a stroke. 
 
 Before I realized where we were we had rounded 
 the hill, and were looking down on the green cup 
 of the upper Machudi's glen. Far down, I remem- 
 ber, where the trees began, there was a cloud of

 smoke. Some Kaffir — or maybe Arcoll — had fired 
 the forest. The smoke was drifting away under a 
 light west wind over the far plains, so that they 
 were seen through a haze of opal. 
 
 Laputa bade me take the lead. I saw quite 
 clear the red kloof on the far side, where the collar 
 was hid. To get there we might have ridden 
 straight into the cup, but a providential instinct 
 made me circle round the top till we were on the 
 lip of the ravine. This was the road some of 
 Machudi's men had taken, and unthinkingly I 
 followed them. Twenty minutes' riding brought 
 us to the place, and all the while I had no kind 
 of plan of escape. I was in the hands of my 
 Maker, watching, like the Jews of old, for a sign. 
 
 Laputa dismounted and looked down into the 
 gorge. 
 
 "There is no road there," I said. "We must 
 go down to the foot and come up the stream-side. 
 It would be better to leave your horse here." 
 
 He started down the cliff, which from above 
 looks a sheer precipice. Then he seemed to agree 
 with me, took the rope from the schimmeV s neck, 
 and knee-haltered his beast. And at that moment 
 I had an inspiration.

 284 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 With my wrist-rope in his hand, he preceded 
 me down the hill till we got to the red screes at 
 the foot of the kloof. Then, under my guidance, 
 we turned up into the darkness of the gorge. As 
 we entered I looked back, and saw figures coming 
 over the edge of the green cup — Laputa's men, 
 I guessed. What 1 had to do must be done 
 quickly. 
 
 We climbed up the burn, over the succession 
 of little cataracts, till we came to the flat space of 
 shingle and the long pool where I had been taken 
 that morning. The ashes of the fire which 
 Machudi's men had made were plain on the rock. 
 After that I had to climb a waterfall to get to the 
 rock pool where I had bestowed the rubies. 
 
 " You must take off this thong," I said. " I 
 must climb to get the collar. Cover me with a 
 pistol if you like. I won't be out of sight." 
 
 Laputa undid the thong and set me free. From 
 his belt he took a pistol, cocked it, and held it over 
 his left hand. I had seen this way of shooting 
 adopted by indifferent shots, and it gave me a 
 wild hope that he might not be much of a marks- 
 man. 
 
 It did not take me long to find the pool, close

 against the blackened stump of a tree-fern. I 
 thrust in my hand and gathered up the jewels 
 from the cool sand. They came out glowing 
 like living fires, and for a moment I thrilled with 
 a sense of reverence. Surely these were no 
 common stones which held in them the very 
 heart of hell. Clutching them tightly, I climbed 
 down to Laputa. 
 
 At the sight of the great Snake he gave a cry 
 of rapture. Tearing it from me, he held it at 
 arm's length, his face lit with a passionate joy. 
 He kissed it, he raised it to the sky ; nay, he 
 was on his knees before it. Once more he was 
 the savage transported in the presence of his fetich. 
 He turned to me with burning eyes. 
 
 " Down on your knees," he cried, " and rever- 
 ence the Ndhlondhlo. Down, you impious dog, 
 and seek pardon for your sacrilege." 
 
 " I won't," I said. " I won't bow to any heathen 
 idol." 
 
 He pointed his pistol at me. 
 
 " In a second I shoot where your head is now. 
 Down, you fool, or perish." 
 
 " You promised me my life," I said stubbornly, 
 though Heaven knows why I chose to act thus.

 286 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 He dropped the pistol and flung himself on me. 
 I was helpless as a baby in his hands. He forced 
 me to the ground and rolled my face in the sand ; 
 then he pulled me to my feet and tossed me 
 backward, till I almost staggered into the pool. 
 I saved myself, and staggered instead into the 
 shallow at the foot of it, close under the ledge 
 of the precipice. 
 
 That morning, when Machudi's men were cook- 
 ing breakfast, I had figured out a route up the 
 cliff. This route was now my hope of escape. 
 Laputa had dropped his pistol, and the collar had 
 plunged him in an ecstasy of worship. Now, if 
 ever, was my time. I must get on the shelf which 
 ran sideways up the cliff, and then scramble for 
 dear life. 
 
 1 pretended to be dazed and terrified. 
 
 " You promised me my life," I whimpered. 
 
 " Your life," he cried. " Yes, you shall have 
 your life ; and before long you will pray for 
 death." 
 
 "But I saved the Collar," I pleaded. " Hen- 
 riques would have stolen it. I brought it safe 
 here, and now you have got it." 
 
 Meantime I was. pulling myself up on the shelf.

 and loosening with one hand a boulder which over- 
 hung the pool. 
 
 " You have been repaid," he said savagely. 
 " You will not die." 
 
 " But my life is no use without liberty," I 
 said, working at the boulder till it lay loose in 
 its niche. 
 
 He did not answer, being intent on examining 
 the Collar to see if it had suffered any harm. 
 
 *' I hope it isn't scratched," I said. " Henriques 
 trod on it when I hit him." 
 
 Laputa peered at the gems like a mother at a 
 child who has had a fall. I saw my chance and 
 took it. With a great heave I pulled the boulder 
 down into the pool. It made a prodigious splash, 
 sending a shower of spray over Laputa and the 
 Collar, In cover of it I raced up the shelf, strain- 
 ing for the shelter of the juniper tree. 
 
 A shot rang out and struck the rock above me. 
 A second later I had reached the tree and was 
 scrambling up the crack beyond it. 
 
 Laputa did not fire again. He may have dis- 
 trusted his shooting, or seen a better way of it. 
 He dashed through the stream and ran up the 
 shelf like a klipspringer after me. I felt rather

 288 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 than saw what was happening, and with my heart 
 in my mouth I gathered my dregs of energy for 
 the last struggle. 
 
 You know the nightmare when you are pursued 
 by some awful terror, and, though sick with fear, 
 your legs have a strange numbness, and you cannot 
 drag them in obedience to the will. Such was my 
 feeling in the crack above the juniper tree. In 
 truth, 1 had passed the bounds of my endurance. 
 Last night I had walked fifty miles, and all day 
 I had borne the torments of a dreadful suspense. 
 I had been bound and gagged and beaten till the 
 force was out of my limbs. Also, and above all, 
 I had had little food, and I was dizzy with want 
 of sleep. My feet seemed leaden, my hands had 
 no more grip than putty. I do not know how I 
 escaped falling into the pool, for my head was 
 singing and my heart thumping in my throat. I 
 seemed to feel Laputa's great hand every second 
 clawing at my heels. 
 
 I had reason for my fears. He had entered 
 the crack long before I had reached the top, and 
 his progress was twice as fast as mine. When I 
 emerged on the topmost shelf he was scarcely a 
 yard behind me. But an overhang checked his

 bulky figure and gave me a few seconds* grace. 
 I needed it all, for these last steps on the shelf 
 were the totterings of an old man. Only a des- 
 perate resolution and an extreme terror made me 
 drag one foot after the other. Blindly I staggered 
 on to the top of the ravine, and saw before me 
 the schimmel grazing in the light of the westering 
 sun. 
 
 I forced myself into a sort of drunken run, and 
 crawled into the saddle. Behind me, as I turned, 
 I could see Laputa's shoulders rising over the edge. 
 I had no knife to cut the knee-halter, and the horse 
 could not stir. 
 
 Then the miracle happened. When the rope 
 had gagged me, my teeth must have nearly severed 
 it at one place, and this Laputa had not noticed 
 when he used it as a knee-halter. The shock of 
 my entering the saddle made the schimmel fling up 
 his head violently, and the rope snapped. I could 
 not find the stirrups, but I dug my heels into his 
 sides, and he leaped forward. 
 
 At the same moment Laputa began to shoot. 
 
 It was a foolish move, for he might have caught 
 
 me by running, since I had neither spurs nor whip, 
 
 and the horse was hampered by the loose end of

 rope at his knee. In any case, being an indifferent 
 shot, he should have aimed at the schimmel^ not at 
 me ; but I suppose he wished to save his charger. 
 One bullet sang past my head ; a second did my 
 business for me. It passed over my shoulder, as I 
 lay low in the saddle, and grazed the beast's right 
 ear The pain maddened him, and, rope-end and 
 all, he plunged into a wild gallop. Other shots 
 came, but they fell far short. I saw dimly a native 
 or two — the men who had followed us— rush to 
 intercept me, and I think a spear was flung. But 
 m a flash we were past them, and their cries faded 
 behind me. I found the bridle, reached for the 
 stirrups, and galloped straight for the sunset and 
 for freedom.

 T HAD long passed the limit of my strength. 
 Only constant fear and wild alternations of 
 hope had kept me going so long, and now that I 
 was safe I became light-headed in earnest. The 
 wonder is that I did not fall off. Happily the 
 horse was good and the ground easy, for I was 
 powerless to do any guiding. I simply sat on his 
 back In a silly glow of comfort, keeping a line for 
 the dying sun, which I saw in a nick of the Iron 
 Crown Mountain. A sort of childish happiness 
 possessed me. After three days of imminent peril, 
 to be free was to be in fairyland. To be swishing 
 through the long bracken or plunging among the 
 breast-high flowers of the meadowland, in a world 
 of essential lights and fragrances, seemed scarcely 
 part of mortal experience. Remember that I was

 little more than a lad, and that I had faced death 
 so often of late that my mind was all adrift. To 
 be able to hope once more, nay, to be allowed 
 to cease both from hope and fear, was like a 
 deep and happy opiate to my senses. Spent 
 and frail as I was, my soul swam in blessed waters 
 of ease. 
 
 The mood did not last long. I came back to 
 earth with a shock, as the sch'immel stumbled at 
 the crossing of a stream. 1 saw that the darkness 
 was fast falling, and with the sight panic returned 
 to me. Behind me I seemed to hear the sound 
 of pursuit. The noise was in my ears, but when 
 I turned it ceased, and I saw only the dusky 
 shoulders of hills. 
 
 I tried to remember what Arcoll had told me 
 about his headquarters, but my memory was wiped 
 clean. I thought they were on or near the high- 
 way, but I could not remember where the highway 
 was. Besides, he was close to the enemy, and I 
 wanted to get back into the towns, far away from 
 the battle-line. If I rode west I must come in 
 time to villages, where I could hide myself. 
 These were unworthy thoughts, but my excuse 
 must be my tattered nerves. When a man comes

 out of great danger, he is apt to be a little deaf to 
 the call of duty. 
 
 Suddenly I became ashamed. God had pre- 
 served me from deadly perils, but not that I 
 might cower in some shelter. I had a mission 
 as clear as Laputa's. For the first time I became 
 conscious to what a little thing I owed my salva- 
 tion. That matter of the broken halter was like 
 the finger of Divine Providence. I had been 
 saved for a purpose, and unless I fulfilled that 
 purpose 1 should again be lost. I was always 
 a fatalist, and in that hour of strained body and 
 soul I became something of a mystic. My panic 
 ceased, my lethargy departed, and a more manly 
 resolution took their place. I gripped the schimmel 
 by the head and turned him due left. Now I 
 remembered where the highroad ran, and I 
 remembered something else. 
 
 For it was borne in on me that Laputa had 
 fallen into my hands. Without any subtle pur- 
 pose I had played a master game. He was cut 
 off from his people, without a horse, on the wrong 
 side of the highroad which Arcoll's men patrolled. 
 Without him the rising would crumble. There 
 might be war, even desperate war, but we should

 294 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 fight against a leaderless foe. If he could only be 
 shepherded to the north, his game was over, and 
 at our leisure we could mop up the scattered 
 concentrations. 
 
 I was now as eager to get back into danger as 
 I had been to get into safety. ArcoU must be 
 found and warned, and that at once, or Laputa 
 would slip over to Inanda's Kraal under cover of 
 dark. It was a matter of minutes, and on these 
 minutes depended the lives of thousands. It was 
 also a matter of ebbing strength, for with my 
 return to common sense I saw very clearly how 
 near my capital was spent. If I could reach the 
 highroad, find Arcoll or Arcoll's men, and give 
 them my news, I would do my countrymen a 
 service such as no man in Africa could render. 
 But I felt my head swimming, I was swaying 
 crazily in the saddle, and my hands had scarcely 
 the force of a child's. I could only lie limply on 
 the horse's back, clutching at his mane with trem- 
 bling fingers. I remember that my head was full 
 of a text from the Psalms about not putting one's 
 trust in horses. I prayed that this one horse 
 might be an exception, for he carried more than 
 Caesar and his fortunes.

 My mind is a blank about these last minutes. 
 In less than an hour after my escape 1 struck the 
 highway, but it was an hour which in the retro- 
 spect unrolls itself into unquiet years. I was 
 dimly conscious of scrambling through a ditch 
 and coming to a ghostly white road. The schimmel 
 swung to the right, and the next I knew some one 
 had taken my bridle and was speaking to me. 
 
 At first I thought it was Laputa and screamed. 
 Then I must have tottered in the saddle, for I felt 
 an arm slip round my middle. The rider un- 
 corked a bottle with his teeth and forced some 
 brandy down my throat. I choked and coughed, 
 and then looked up to see a white policeman 
 staring at me. I knew the police by the green 
 shoulder-straps. 
 
 " ArcoU," I managed to croak. " For God's 
 sake take me to Arcoll." 
 
 The man whistled shrilly on his fingers, and 
 a second rider came cantering down the road. As 
 he came up I recognized his face, but could not 
 put a name to It. 
 
 " Losh, it's the lad Crawfurd," I heard a voice 
 say. " Crawfurd, man, d'ye no mind me at 
 Louren^o Marques ^ Aitken ? "

 296 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 The Scotch tongue worked a spell with me. It 
 cleared my wits and opened the gates of my past 
 life. At last I knew I was among my own folk. 
 
 " I must see Arcoll. I have news for him — 
 tremendous news. O man, take me to Arcoll and 
 ask me no questions. Where is he ? Where 
 is he ^ " 
 
 "As it happens, he's about two hundred yards 
 off," Aitken said. " That light ye see at the top 
 of the brae is his camp." 
 
 They helped me up the road, a man on each 
 side of me, for I could never have kept in the 
 saddle without their support. My message to 
 Arcoll kept humming in my head as I tried to 
 put It into words, for I had a horrid fear that 
 my wits would fail me and I should be dumb 
 when the time came. Also I was In a fever of 
 haste. Every minute I wasted Increased Laputa's 
 chance of getting back to the kraal. He had men 
 with him every bit as skilful as Arcoll's trackers. 
 Unless Arcoll had a big force and the best horses 
 there was no hope. Often In looking back at this 
 hour I have marvelled at the strangeness of my 
 behaviour. Here was I just set free from the 
 certainty of a hideous death, and yet I had lost

 I PUT MY TRUST IN A HORSE. 297 
 
 all joy in my security. I was more fevered at 
 the thought of Laputa's escape than I had been 
 at the prospect of David Crawfurd's end. 
 
 The next thing I knew I was being lifted off 
 the schimmel by what seemed to me a thousand 
 hands. Then came a glow of light, a great moon, 
 in the centre of which I stood blinking. I was 
 forced to sit down on a bed, while some one gave 
 me a cup of hot tea, far more reviving than any 
 spirits. I became conscious that some one was 
 holding my hands, and speaking very slowly and 
 gently. 
 
 "Davie," the voice said, "youVe back among 
 friends, my lad. Tell me, where have you 
 been ? " 
 
 "I want Arcoll," I moaned. "Where is Ratit- 
 swan ? " There were tears of weakness running 
 down my cheeks. 
 
 "Arcoll is here," said the voice ; " he is holding 
 your hands, Davie. Quiet, lad, quiet. Your 
 troubles are all over now." 
 
 I made a great effort, found the eyes to which 
 the voice belonged, and spoke to them, 
 
 " Listen. I stole the collar of Prester John at 
 Dupree's Drift. I was caught in the Berg and

 taken to the kraal — I forget its name — but I had 
 hid the rubies." 
 
 "Yes," the voice said, "you hid the rubies, — 
 and then ? " 
 
 " Inkulu wanted them back, so 1 made a deal 
 with him. 1 took him to Machudi's and gave 
 him the collar, and then he fired at me and I 
 climbed and climbed ... I climbed on a horse," 
 I concluded childishly. 
 
 I heard the voice say " Yes ? " again inquiringly, 
 but my mind ran off at a tangent. 
 
 " Beyers took guns up into the Wolkberg," I 
 cried shrilly. " Why the devil don't you do the 
 same ? You have the whole Kaffir army in a trap." 
 
 I saw a smiling face before me. 
 
 " Good lad. Colles told me you weren't want- 
 ing in intelligence. What if we have done that 
 very thing, Davie .'' " 
 
 But I was not listening. 1 was trying to 
 remember the thing I most wanted to say, and 
 that was not about Beyers and his guns. Those 
 were nightmare minutes. A speaker who has lost 
 the thread of his discourse, a soldier who with a 
 bayonet at his throat has forgotten the password 
 — I felt like them, and worse. And to crown

 all I felt my faintness coming back, and my head 
 dropping with heaviness. I was in a torment of 
 impotence. 
 
 Arcoll, still holding my hands, brought his face 
 close to mine, so that his clear eyes mastered and 
 constrained me. 
 
 " Look at me, Davie," I heard him say. "You 
 have something to tell me, and it is very important. 
 It is about Laputa, isn't it ? Think, man. You 
 took him to Machudi's and gave him the collar. 
 He has gone back with it to Inanda's Kraal. Very 
 well, my guns will hold him there." 
 
 I shook my head. " You can't. You may 
 split the army, but you can't hold Laputa. He 
 will be over the Olifants before you fire a shot." 
 
 "We will hunt him down before he crosses. 
 And if not, we will catch him at the railway." 
 
 " For God's sake, hurry then," I cried. " In 
 an hour he will be over it and back in the kraal." 
 
 " But the river is a long way." 
 
 " River ? " I repeated hazily. " What river ? 
 The Letaba is not the place. It is the road 
 I mean." 
 
 Arcoll's hands closed firmly on my wrists. 
 
 "You left Laputa at Machudi's and rode here

 without stopping. That would take you an hour. 
 Had Laputa a horse ? " 
 
 "Yes; but I took it," I stammered. "You 
 can see it behind me." 
 
 Arcoll dropped my hands and stood up straight. 
 
 " By God, we've got him ! " he said, and he 
 spoke to his companions. A man turned and ran 
 out of the tent. 
 
 Then I remembered what I wanted to say. 1 
 struggled from the bed and put my hands on 
 his shoulders. 
 
 " Laputa is our side of the highroad. Cut him 
 off from his men, and drive him north — north — 
 away up to the Rooirand. Never mind the Wolk- 
 berg and the guns, for they can wait. 1 tell you 
 Laputa is the Rising, and he has the collar. With- 
 out him you can mop up the Kaffirs at your 
 leisure. Line the highroad with every man you 
 have, for he must cross it or perish. Oh, hurry, 
 man, hurry ; never mind me. We're saved if we 
 can chivy Laputa till morning. Quick, or I'll 
 have to go myself." 
 
 The tent emptied, and I lay back on the bed 
 with a dim feeling that my duty was done and 
 1 could rest. Henceforth the affair was in stronger

 hands than mine. I was so weak that I could not 
 lift my legs up to the bed, but sprawled half on 
 and half off. 
 
 Utter exhaustion defeats sleep. I was in a fever j 
 and my eyes would not close. 1 lay and drowsed 
 while it seemed to me that the outside world was 
 full of men and horses. I heard voices and the 
 sound of hoofs and the jingle of bridles, but 
 above all I heard the solid tramp of an army. 
 The whole earth seemed to be full of war. Before 
 my mind was spread the ribbon of the great high- 
 way. I saw it run white through the meadows 
 of the plateau, then in a dark corkscrew down 
 the glen of the Letaba, then white again through 
 the vast moonlit bush of the plains, till the 
 shanties of Wesselsburg rose at the end of it. It 
 seemed to me to be less a road than a rampart, 
 built of shining marble, the Great Wall of Africa. 
 I saw Laputa come out of the shadows and try 
 to climb it, and always there was the sound of 
 a rifle-breech clicking, a summons, and a flight. 
 I began to take a keen interest in the game. Down 
 in the bush were the dark figures of the hunted, 
 and on the white wall were my own people — horse, 
 foot, and artillery, the squadrons of our defence.

 What a general Arcoll was, and how great a matter 
 had David Crawfurd kindled ! 
 
 A man came in — I suppose a doctor. He took 
 off my leggings and boots, cutting them from my 
 bleeding feet, but I knew no pain. He felt my 
 pulse and listened to my heart. Then he washed 
 my face and gave me a bowl of hot milk. There 
 must have been a drug in the milk, for I had 
 scarcely drunk it before a tide of sleep seemed 
 to flow over my brain. The white rampart faded 
 from my eyes and I slept.

 Chapter XIX. 
 ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING. 
 
 TXTHILE I lay in a drugged slumber great 
 things were happening. What I have to 
 tell is no experience of my own, but the story as 
 I pieced it together afterwards from talks with 
 Arcoll and Aitken. The history of the Rising has 
 been compiled. As 1 write I see before me on 
 the shelves two neat blue volumes in which Mr. 
 Alexander Upton, sometime correspondent of the 
 Times, has told for the edification of posterity the 
 tale of the war between the Plains and the Plateau. 
 To him the Kaffir hero is Umbooni, a half-witted 
 ruffian, whom we afterwards caught and hanged. 
 He mentions Laputa only in a footnote as a 
 renegade Christian who had something to do 
 with fomenting discontent. He considers that 
 the word " Inkulu," which he often heard, was 
 a Zulu name for God. Mr. Upton is a pic-

 turesque historian, but he knew nothing of the 
 most romantic incident of all. This is the tale 
 of the midnight shepherding of the " heir of John " 
 by Arcoll and his irregulars. 
 
 At Bruderstroom, where I was lying unconscious, 
 there were two hundred men of the police ; sixty- 
 three Basuto scouts under a man called Stephen, 
 who was half native in blood and wholly native 
 in habits ; and three commandoes of the farmers, 
 each about forty strong. The commandoes were 
 really companies of the North Transvaal volunteers, 
 but the old name had been kept and something of 
 the old loose organization. There were also two 
 four-gun batteries of volunteer artillery, but these 
 were out on the western skirts of the Wolkberg 
 following Beyers's historic precedent. Several com- 
 panies of regulars were on their way from Pietersdorp, 
 but they did not arrive till the next day. When 
 they came they went to the Wolkberg to join 
 the artillery. Along the Berg at strategic points 
 were pickets of police with native trackers, and 
 at Blaauwildebeestefontein there was a strong 
 force with two field guns, for there was some fear 
 of a second Kaffir army marching by that place 
 to Inanda's Kraal. At Wesselsburg out on the

 ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING. 305 
 
 plain there was a biggish police patrol, and a 
 system of small patrols along the road, with a fair 
 number of Basuto scouts. But the road was 
 picketed, not held ; for Arcoll's patrols were only 
 a branch of his Intelligence Department. It was 
 perfectly easy, as I had found myself, to slip 
 across in a gap of the pickets. 
 
 Laputa would be in a hurry, and therefore he 
 would try to cross at the nearest point. Hence 
 it was Arcoll's first business to hold the line 
 between the defile of the Letaba and the camp 
 at Bruderstroom, A detachment of the police who 
 were well mounted galloped at racing speed for 
 the defile, and behind them the rest lined out 
 along the road. The farmers took a line at right 
 angles to the road, so as to prevent an escape on 
 the western flank. The Basutos were sent into 
 the woods as a sort of advanced post to bring 
 tidings of any movement there. Finally a body 
 of police with native runners at their stirrups rode 
 on to the drift where the road crosses the Letaba. 
 The place is called Main Drift, and you will find 
 It on the map. The natives were first of all to 
 locate Laputa, and prevent him getting out on 
 the south side of the triangle of hill and wood

 3o6 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 between Machudi's, the road, and the Letaba. If 
 he failed there, he must try to ford the Letaba 
 below the drift, and cross the road between the 
 drift and Wesselsburg. Now Arcoll had not men 
 enough to watch the whole line, and therefore 
 if Laputa were once driven below the drift, he 
 might shift his men further down the road. Con- 
 sequently it was of the first importance to locate 
 Laputa's whereabouts, and for this purpose the 
 native trackers were sent forward. There was 
 just a chance of capturing him, but Arcoll knew 
 too well his amazing veld-craft and great strength 
 of body to build much hope on that. 
 
 We were none too soon. The advance men 
 of the police rode into one of the Kaffirs from 
 Inanda's Kraal, whom Laputa had sent forward 
 to see if the way was clear. In two minutes 
 more he would have been across and out of our 
 power, for we had no chance of overtaking him 
 in the woody ravines of the Letaba. The Kaffir, 
 when he saw us, dived back into the grass on 
 the north side of the road, which made it clear 
 that Laputa was still there. 
 
 After that nothing happened for a little. The 
 police reached their drift, and all the road west of

 ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING. 307 
 
 that point was strongly held. The flanking com- 
 mandoes joined hands with one of the police posts 
 further north and moved slowly to the scarp of the 
 Berg. They saw nobody ; from which ArcoU could 
 deduce that his man had gone down the Berg into 
 the forests. 
 
 Had the Basutos been any good at woodcraft 
 we should have had better intelligence. But living 
 in a bare mountain country they are apt to find 
 themselves puzzled in a forest. The best men 
 among the trackers were some renegades of 
 'Mpefu, who sent back word by some device 
 known only to Arcoll that five Kaffirs were in the 
 woods a mile north of Main Drift. By this time 
 it was after ten o'clock, and the moon was rising. 
 The five men separated soon after, and the reports 
 became confused. Then Laputa, as the biggest 
 of the five, was located on the banks of the Great 
 Letaba about two miles below Main Drift. 
 
 The question was as to his crossing. Arcoll 
 had assumed that he would swim the river and try 
 to get over the road between Main Drift and 
 Wesselsburg. But in this assumption he under- 
 rated the shrewdness of his opponent. Laputa 
 knew perfectly well that we had not enough men

 3o8 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 to patrol the whole countryside, but that the river 
 enabled us to divide the land into two sections 
 and concentrate strongly on one or the other. 
 Accordingly he left the Great Letaba unforded, 
 and resolved to make a long circuit back to the 
 Berg. One of his Kaffirs swam the river, and 
 when word of this was brought Arcoll began to 
 withdraw his posts further down the road. But as 
 the men were changing 'Mpefu's fellows got 
 wind of Laputa's turn to the left, and in great 
 haste Arcoll countermanded the move and waited 
 in deep perplexity at Main Drift. 
 
 The salvation of his scheme were the farmers on 
 the scarp of the Berg. They lit fires and gave 
 Laputa the notion of a great army. Instead of 
 going up the glen of Machudi or the Letsitela 
 he bore away to the north for the valley of the 
 Klein Letaba. The pace at which he moved 
 must have been amazing. He had a great 
 physique, hard as nails from long travelling, and 
 in his own eyes he had an empire at stake. When 
 I look at the map and see the journey which 
 with vast fatigue I completed from Dupree's 
 Drift to Machudi's, and then look at the huge 
 spaces of country over which Laputa's legs took

 him on that night, I am lost in admiration of 
 the man. 
 
 About midnight he must have crossed the 
 Letsitela. Here he made a grave blunder. If he 
 had tried the Berg by one of the faces he might 
 have got on to the plateau and been at Inanda's 
 Kraal by the dawning. But he over-estimated the 
 size of the commandoes, and held on to the north 
 where he thought there would be no defence. 
 About one o'clock Arcoll, tired of inaction and 
 conscious that he had misread Laputa's tactics, re- 
 solved on a bold stroke. He sent half his police 
 to the Berg to reinforce the commandoes, bidding 
 them get into touch with the post at Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein. 
 
 A little after two o'clock a diversion occurred. 
 Henriques succeeded in crossing the road three 
 miles east of Main Drift. He had probably left 
 the kraal early in the night and had tried to cross 
 further west, but had been deterred by the patrols. 
 East of Main Drift, where the police were fewer, he 
 succeeded ; but he had not gone far till he was dis- 
 covered by the Basuto scouts. The find was 
 reported to Arcoll, who guessed at once who 
 this traveller was. He dared not send out any

 3IO PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 of his white men, but he bade a party of the scouts 
 follow the Portugoose's trail. They shadowed 
 him to Dupree's Drift, where he crossed the 
 Letaba. There he lay down by the roadside to 
 sleep, while they kept him company. A hard 
 fellow Henriques was, for he could slumber peace- 
 fully on the very scene of his murder. 
 
 Dawn found Laputa at the head of the Klein 
 Letaba glen, not far from 'Mpefu's kraal. He 
 got food at a hut, and set off at once up the 
 wooded hill above it, which is a promontory of the 
 plateau. By this time he must have been weary, or 
 he would not have blundered as he did right into 
 a post of the farmers. He was within an ace of 
 capture, and to save himself was forced back from 
 the scarp. He seems, to judge from reports, to 
 have gone a little way south in the thicker timber, 
 and then to have turned north again in the direction 
 of Blaauwildebeestefontein. After that his move- 
 ments are obscure. He was seen on the Klein 
 Labongo, but the sight of the post at Blaauwilde- 
 beestefontein must have convinced him that a 
 korhaan could not escape that way. The next we 
 heard of him was that he had joined Henriques. 
 
 After daybreak Arcoll, having got his reports from

 ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING. 311 
 
 the plateau, and knowing roughly the direction in 
 which Laputa was shaping, decided to advance his 
 lines. The farmers, reinforced by three more 
 commandoes from the Pietersdorp district, still 
 held the plateau, but the police were now on the 
 line of the Great Letaba. It was Arcoll's plan to 
 hold that river and the long neck of land between 
 it and the Labongo. His force was hourly in- 
 creasing, and his mounted men would be able 
 to prevent any escape on the flank to the east of 
 Wesselsburg. 
 
 So it happened that while Laputa was being 
 driven east from the Berg, Henriques was travel- 
 ling north, and their lines intersected. I should 
 like to have seen the meeting. It must have told 
 Laputa what had always been in the Portugoose's 
 heart. Henriques, I fancy, was making for the 
 cave in the Rooirand. Laputa, so far as I can 
 guess at his mind, had a plan for getting over 
 the Portuguese border, fetching a wide circuit, and 
 joining his men at any of the concentrations be- 
 tween there and Amsterdam. 
 
 The two were seen at midday going down the 
 road which leads from Blaauwildebeestefontein to 
 the Lebombo. Then they struck Arcoll's new

 312 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 front, which stretched from the Letaba to the 
 Labongo. This drove them north again, and 
 forced them to swim the latter stream. From 
 there to the eastern extremity of the Rooirand, 
 which is the Portuguese frontier, the country is 
 open and rolling, with a thin light scrub in the 
 hollows. It was bad cover for the fugitives, as 
 they found to their cost. For ArcoU had pur- 
 posely turned his police into a flying column. 
 They no longer held a line ; they scoured a 
 country. Only Laputa's incomparable veld-craft 
 and great bodily strength prevented the two from 
 being caught in half an hour. They doubled back, 
 swam the Labongo again, and got into the thick 
 bush on the north side of the Blaauwildebeeste- 
 fontein road. The Basuto scouts were magnificent 
 in the open, but in the cover they were again at 
 fault. Laputa and Henriques fairly baffled them, 
 so that the pursuit turned to the west in the 
 belief that the fugitives had made for Majinje's 
 kraal. In reality they had recrossed the Labongo 
 and were making for Umvelos'. 
 
 All this I heard afterwards, but in the meantime 
 I lay in Arcoll's tent in deep unconsciousness.

 ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING. 313 
 
 While my enemies were being chased like par- 
 tridges, 1 was reaping the fruits of four days' toil 
 and terror. The hunters had become the hunted, 
 the wheel had come full circle, and the woes of 
 David Crawfurd were being abundantly avenged. 
 
 I slept till midday of the next day. When I 
 awoke the hot noontide sun had made the tent like 
 an oven. I felt better, but very stiff and sore, and 
 I had a most ungovernable thirst. There was a 
 pail of water with a tin pannikin beside the tent 
 pole, and out of this I drank repeated draughts. 
 Then I lay down again, for I was still very weary. 
 
 But my second sleep was not like my first. It 
 was haunted by wild nightmares. No sooner had 
 I closed my eyes than I began to live and move in 
 a fantastic world. The whole bush of the plains 
 lay before me, and I watched it as if from some 
 view-point in the clouds. It was midday, and the 
 sandy patches shimmered under a haze of heat. I 
 saw odd little movements in the bush — a buck's 
 head raised, a paauw stalking solemnly in the long 
 grass, a big crocodile rolling off a mudbank in the 
 river. And then I saw quite clearly Laputa's 
 figure going east. 
 
 In my sleep I did not think about Arcoll's

 314 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 manoeuvres. My mind was wholly set upon Laputa. 
 He was walking wearily, yet at a good pace, and 
 his head was always turning, like a wild creature 
 snuffing the wind. There was something with 
 him, a shapeless shadow, which I could not see 
 clearly. His neck was bare, but I knew well that 
 the collar was in his pouch. 
 
 He stopped, turned west, and I lost him. The 
 bush world for a space was quite silent, and I 
 watched it eagerly as an aeronaut would watch the 
 ground for a descent. For a long time I could 
 see nothing. Then in a wood near a river there 
 seemed to be a rustling. Some guinea-fowl flew 
 up as if startled, and a stembok scurried out. I 
 knew that Laputa must be there. 
 
 Then, as I looked at the river, I saw a head 
 swimming. Nay, I saw two, one some distance 
 behind the other. The first man landed on the 
 far bank, and I recognized Laputa. The second 
 was a slight short figure, and I knew it was Hen- 
 riques. 
 
 I remember feeling very glad that these two 
 had come together. It was certain now that Hen- 
 riques would not escape. Either Laputa would 
 find out the truth and kill him, or I would come

 ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING, 315 
 
 up with him and have my revenge. In any case 
 he was outside the Kaffir pale, adventuring on 
 his own. 
 
 I watched the two till they halted near a ruined 
 building. Surely this was the store I had built at 
 Umvelos'. The thought gave me a horrid sur- 
 prise. Laputa and Henriques were on their way 
 to the Rooirand ! 
 
 I woke with a start to find my forehead damp 
 with sweat. There was some fever on me, I 
 think, for my teeth were chattering. Very clear 
 in my mind was the disquieting thought that 
 Laputa and Henriques would soon be in the cave. 
 
 One of two things must happen — either Hen- 
 riques would kill Laputa, get the collar of rubies, 
 and be in the wilds of Mozambique before I could 
 come up with his trail ; or Laputa would outwit 
 him, and have the handling himself of the treasure 
 of gold and diamonds which had been laid up for 
 the rising. If he thought there was a risk of de- 
 feat, I knew he would send my gems to the bottom 
 of the Labongo, and all my weary work would go 
 for nothing. I had forgotten all about patriotism. 
 In that hour the fate of the country was nothings

 to me, and I got no satisfaction from the thought 
 that Laputa was severed from his army. My one 
 idea was that the treasure would be lost, the treas- 
 ure for which I had risked my life. 
 
 There is a kind of courage which springs from 
 bitter anger and disappointment. I had thought 
 that I had bankrupted my spirit, but I found that 
 there was a new passion in me to which my past 
 sufferings taught no lesson. My uneasiness would 
 not let me rest a moment longer. I rose to my 
 feet, holding on by the bed, and staggered to the 
 tent pole. I was weak, but not so very weak that I 
 could not make one last effort. It maddened me 
 that I should have done so much and yet fail at 
 the end. 
 
 From a nail on the tent pole hung a fragment 
 of looking-glass which Arcoll used for shaving. I 
 caught a glimpse of my face in it, white and hag- 
 gard, and lined with blue bags below the eyes. 
 The doctor the night before had sponged it, but 
 he had not got rid of all the 'stains of travel. In 
 particular there wa:s a faint splash of blood on the 
 left temple. I remembered that this was what I 
 had got from the basin of goat's blood that night 
 in the cave.

 ARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING. 317 
 
 1 think that the sight of that splash determined 
 me. Whether I willed it or not, I was sealed of 
 Laputa's men. I must play the game to the finish, 
 or never again know peace of mind on earth. 
 These last four days had made me very old. 
 
 I found a pair of Arcoll's boots, roomy with 
 much wearing, into which I thrust my bruised feet. 
 Then I crawled to the door, and shouted for a boy 
 to bring my horse. A Basuto appeared, and, awed 
 by my appearance, went off in a hurry to see to 
 the schimmel. It was late afternoon, about the 
 same time of day as had yesterday seen me escap- 
 ing from Machudi's. The Bruderstroom camp was 
 empty, though sentinels were posted at the ap- 
 proaches. 1 beckoned the only white man I saw, 
 and asked where Arcoll was. He told me that he 
 had no news, but added that the patrols were still 
 on the road as far as Wesselsburg. From this I 
 gathered that Arcoll must have gone far out into 
 the bush in his chase. I did not want to see him ; 
 above all, I did not want him to find Laputa. It 
 was my private business that I rode on, and I 
 asked for no allies. 
 
 Somebody brought me a cup of thick coffee,

 which I could not drink, and helped me into the 
 saddle. The schimmel was fresh, and kicked freely 
 as I cantered off the grass into the dust of the 
 highroad. The whole world, I remember, was 
 still and golden in the sunset.

 Chapter XX. 
 
 MY LAST SIGHT OF THE REVEREND 
 JOHN LAPUTA. 
 
 TT was dark before 1 got into the gorge of the 
 Letaba. I passed many patrols, but few 
 spoke to me, and none tried to stop me. Some 
 may have known me, but I think it was my face 
 and figure which tied their tongues, I must have 
 been pale as death, with tangled hair and fever 
 burning in my eyes. Also on my left temple was 
 the splash of blood. 
 
 At Main Drift I found a big body of police 
 holding the ford. I splashed through and stum- 
 bled into one of their camp-fires. A man ques- 
 tioned me, and told me that ArcoU had got his 
 quarry. " He's dead, they say. They shot him 
 out on the hills when he was making for the Lim- 
 popo." But I knew that this was not true. It was 
 burned on my mind that Laputa was alive, nay^

 320 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 was waiting for me, and that it was God's will 
 that we should meet in the cave. 
 
 A little later I struck the track of the Kaffirs' 
 march. There was a broad, trampled way through 
 the bush, and I followed it, for it led to Dupree's 
 Drift. All " this time I was urging the schimmel 
 with all the vigour I had left in me. I had quite 
 lost any remnant of fear. There were no terrors 
 left for me either from Nature or man. At 
 Dupree's Drift I rode the ford without a thought 
 of crocodiles. I looked placidly at the spot where 
 Henriques had slain the Keeper and I had stolen 
 the rubies. There was no interest or imagination 
 lingering in my dull brain. My nerves had sud- 
 denly become things of stolid, untempered iron. 
 Each landmark I passed was noted down as one 
 step nearer to my object. At Umvelos' I had 
 not the leisure to do more than glance at the shell 
 which I had built. I think I had forgotten all 
 about that night when I lay in the cellar and heard 
 Laputa's plans. Indeed my doings of the past 
 days were all hazy and trivial in my mind. I only 
 saw one sight clearly — two men, one tall and black, 
 the other little and sallow, slowly creeping nearer 
 to the Rooirand, and myself, a midget on a horse,

 MY LAST SIGHT OF LAPUTA. 321 
 
 spurring far behind through the bush on their 
 trail. I saw the picture as continuously and clearly 
 as if I had been looking at a scene on the stage. 
 There was only one change in the setting ; the 
 three figures seemed to be gradually closing 
 together. 
 
 I had no exhilaration in my quest. I do not 
 think I had even much hope, for something had 
 gone numb and cold in me and killed my youth. 
 I told myself that treasure-hunting was an enter- 
 prise accursed of God, and that I should most 
 likely die. That Laputa and Henriques would 
 die I was fully certain. The three of us would 
 leave our bones to bleach among the diamonds, 
 and In a little the Prester's collar would glow amid 
 a little heap of human dust. 1 was quite con- 
 vinced of all this, and quite apathetic. It really 
 did not matter so long as I came up with Laputa 
 and Henriques, and settled scores with them. 
 That mattered everything in the world, for it was 
 my destiny. 
 
 I had no means of knowing how long 1 took, 
 but it was after midnight before I passed Umvelos', 
 and ere I got to the Roolrand there was a flutter- 
 ing of dawn in the east. I must have passed east

 of Arcoll's men, who were driving the bush to- 
 wards Majinje's. I had ridden the night down, 
 and did not feel so very tired. My horse was 
 stumbling, but my own limbs scarcely pained me. 
 To be sure I was stiff and nerveless as if hewn out 
 of wood, but I had been as bad when I left Bruder- 
 stroom, I felt as if I could go on riding to the 
 end of the world. 
 
 At the brink of the bush I dismounted and 
 turned the schimmel loose. I had brought no 
 halter, and I left him to graze and roll. The 
 light was sufficient to let me see the great rock 
 face rising in a tower of dim purple. The sky was 
 still picked out with stars, but the moon had long 
 gone down, and the east was flushing, I marched 
 up the path to the cave, very different from the 
 timid being who had walked the same road three 
 nights before. Then my terrors were all to come : 
 now I had conquered terror and seen the other 
 side of fear. I was centuries older. 
 
 But beside the path lay something which made 
 me pause. It was a dead body, and the head was 
 turned away from me. I did not need to see the 
 face to know who it was. There had been only two 
 men in my vision, and one of them was immortal.

## p. 323 (#329) ############################################


 
 MY LAST SIGHT OF LAPUTA. 323 
 
 I stopped and turned the body over. There 
 was no joy in my heart, none of the lust of satisfied 
 vengeance or slaked hate. I had forgotten about 
 the killing of my dog and all the rest of Henriques' 
 doings. It was only with curiosity that I looked 
 down on the dead face, swollen and livid in the 
 first light of morning. 
 
 The man had been strangled. His neck, as we 
 say in Scotland, was " thrawn," and that was why 
 he had lain on his back yet with his face turned 
 away from me. He had been dead probably since 
 before midnight. I looked closer, and saw that 
 there was blood on his shirt and hands, but no 
 wound. It was not his blood, but some other's. 
 Then a few feet off on the path I found a pistol 
 with two chambers empty. 
 
 What had happened was very plain. Henriques 
 had tried to shoot Laputa at the entrance of the 
 cave for the sake of the collar and the treasure 
 within. He had wounded him — gravely, I 
 thought, to judge from the amount of blood — but 
 the quickness and marksmanship of the Portuguese 
 had not availed to save his life from those terrible 
 hands. After two shots Laputa had got hold of 
 him and choked his life out as easily as a man

 324 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 twists a partridge's neck. Then he had gone into 
 the cave. 
 
 I saw the marks of blood on the road, and 
 hastened on. Laputa had been hours in the cave, 
 enough to work havoc with the treasure. He was 
 wounded, too, and desperate. Probably he had 
 come to the Rooirand looking for sanctuary and 
 rest for a day or two, but if Henriques had shot 
 straight he might find a safer sanctuary and a 
 longer rest. For the third time in my life I 
 pushed up the gully between the straight high 
 walls of rock, and heard from the heart of the hills 
 the thunder of the imprisoned river. 
 
 There was only the faintest gleam of light in 
 the cleft, but it sufficed to show me that the way to 
 the cave was open. The hidden turnstile in the 
 right wall stood ajar ; I entered, and carelessly 
 swung it behind me. The gates clashed into place 
 with a finality which told me that they were firmly 
 shut. I did not know the secret of them, so how 
 should I get out again ^ 
 
 These things troubled me less than the fact that 
 I had no light at all now. I had to go on my 
 knees to ascend the stair, and I could feel that the 
 steps were wet. It must be Laputa's blood.

## p. 325 (#331) ############################################


 
 MY LAST SIGHT OF LAPUTA. 325 
 
 Next I was out on the gallery which skirted the 
 chasm. The sky above me was growing pale with 
 dawn, and far below the tossing waters were 
 fretted with light. A light fragrant wind was 
 blowing on the hills, and a breath of it came down 
 the funnel. I saw that my hands were all bloody 
 with the stains on the steps, and I rubbed them on 
 the rock to clean them. Without a tremor I 
 crossed the stone slab over the gorge, and plunged 
 into the dark alley which led to the inner 
 chamber. 
 
 As before, there was a light in front of me, but 
 this time it was a pin-point and not the glare of 
 many torches. I felt my way carefully by the 
 walls of the passage, though I did not really 
 fear anything. It was by the stopping of these 
 lateral walls that I knew 1 was in the cave, for the 
 place had only one single speck of light. The 
 falling wall of water stood out grey green and 
 ghostly on the left, and I noticed that higher up 
 it was lit as if from the open air. There must be 
 a great funnel in the hillside in that direction. I 
 walked a few paces, and then I made out that the 
 spark in front was a lantern. 
 
 My eyes were getting used to the half-light, and

## p. 326 (#332) ############################################


 
 326 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 I saw what was beside the lantern. Laputa knelt 
 on the ashes of the fire which the Keeper had 
 kindled three days before. He knelt before, and 
 half leaned on, a rude altar of stone. The lantern 
 stood by him on the floor, and its faint circle lit 
 something which I was not unprepared for. Blood 
 was welling from his side, and spreading in a dark 
 pool over the ashes. 
 
 I had no fear, only a great pity — pity for 
 lost romance, for vain endeavour, for fruitless 
 courage. " Greeting, Inkulu ! " I said in Kaffir, as 
 if I had been one of his indunas. 
 
 He turned his head and slowly and painfully 
 rose to his feet. The place, it was clear, was lit 
 from without, and the daylight was growing. The 
 wall of the river had become a sheet of jewels, 
 passing from pellucid diamond above to trans- 
 lucent emerald below. A dusky twilight sought 
 out the extreme corners of the cave. Laputa's tall 
 figure stood swaying above the white ashes, his 
 hand pressed to his side. 
 
 " Who is it ? " he said, looking at me with blind 
 eyes. 
 
 " It is the storekeeper from Umvelos'," I 
 answered.

## p. 327 (#333) ############################################


 
 MY LAST SIGHT OF LAPUTA. 327 
 
 " The storekeeper of Umvelos'," he repeated. 
 " God has used the weak things of the world to 
 confound the strong. A king dies because a 
 pedlar is troublesome. What do they call you, 
 man ? You deserve to be remembered." 
 
 I told him " David Crawfurd." 
 
 " Crawfurd," he repeated, "you have been the 
 little reef on which a great vessel has foundered. 
 You stole the collar and cut me off from my 
 people, and then when I was weary the Portuguese 
 killed me." 
 
 ** No," I cried, " it was not me. You trusted 
 Henriques, and you got your fingers on his neck 
 too late. Don't say I didn't warn you." 
 
 " You warned me, and I will repay you. I 
 will make you rich, Crawfurd. You are a trader, 
 and want money. I am a king, and want a throne. 
 But 1 am dying, and there will be no more kings 
 in Africa." 
 
 The mention of riches did not thrill me as I 
 had expected, but the last words awakened a wild 
 regret. I was hypnotized by the man. To see 
 him going out was like seeing the fall of a great 
 mountain. 
 
 He stretched himself, gasping, and in the grow-

 ing light I could see how broken he was. His 
 cheeks were falling in, and his sombre eyes had 
 shrunk back in their sockets. He seemed an old 
 worn man standing there among the ashes, while 
 the blood, which he made no effort to staunch, 
 trickled down his side till it dripped on the floor. 
 He had ceased to be the Kaffir king, or the 
 Christian minister, or indeed any one of his former 
 parts. Death was stripping him to his elements, 
 and the man Laputa stood out beyond and above 
 the characters he had played, something strange, 
 and great, and moving, and terrible. 
 
 "We met for the first time three days ago," he 
 said, " and now you will be the last to see the 
 Inkulu." 
 
 " Umvelos' was not our first meeting," said I. 
 " Do you mind the Sabbath eight years since when 
 you preached in the Free Kirk at Kirkcaple ? I 
 was the boy you chased from the shore, and I 
 flung the stone that blacked your eye. Besides I 
 came out from England with you and Henriques, 
 and I was in the boat which took you from Durban 
 to Delagoa Bay. You and I have been long 
 acquaint, Mr. Laputa." #¦ 
 
 " It is the hand of God," he said solemnly.

## p. 329 (#335) ############################################


 
 MY LAST SIGHT OF LAPUTA. 329 
 
 " Your fate has been twisted with mine, and now 
 you will die with me." 
 
 I did not understand this talk about dying. 1 
 was not mortally wounded like him, and I did not 
 think Laputa had the strength to kill me even if 
 he wished. But my mind was so impassive that I 
 scarcely regarded his words. 
 
 " I will make you rich," he cried. " Crawfurd, 
 the storekeeper, will be the richest man in Africa. 
 We are scattered, and our wealth is another's. He 
 shall have the gold and the diamonds — all but the 
 Collar, which goes with me." 
 
 He staggered into a dark recess, one of many in 
 the cave, and I followed him. There were boxes 
 there, tea chests, cartridge cases, and old brass- 
 ribbed Portuguese coffers. Laputa had keys at 
 his belt, and unlocked them, his fingers fumbling 
 with weakness. I peered in and saw gold coin 
 and little bao^s of stones. 
 
 " Money and diamonds," he cried. " Once it 
 was the war chest of a king, and now it will be the 
 hoard of a trader. No, by the Lord ! The 
 trader's place is with the Terrible Ones." An arm 
 shot out, and my shoulder was fiercely gripped. 
 
 " You stole my horse. That is why I am

 330 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 dying. But for you I and my army would be 
 over the Olifants. I am going to kill you, Craw- 
 furd," and his fingers closed in to my shoulder 
 blades. 
 
 Still I was unperturbed. " No, you are not. 
 You cannot. You have tried to and failed. So 
 did Henriques, and he is lying dead outside. I 
 am in God's keeping, and cannot die before my 
 time." 
 
 I do not know if he heard me, but at any 
 rate the murderous fit passed. His hand fell to 
 his side and his great figure tottered out into the 
 cave. He seemed to be making for the river, but 
 he turned and went through the door I had 
 entered by. I heard him slipping in the passage, 
 and then there was a minute of silence. 
 
 Suddenly there came a grinding sound, followed 
 by the kind of muffled splash which a stone makes 
 when it falls into a deep well. 1 thought Laputa 
 had fallen into the chasm, but when I reached the 
 door his swaying figure was coming out of the 
 corridor. Then I knew what he had done. He 
 had used the remnant of his giant strength to 
 break down the bridge of stone across the gorge, 
 and so cut off my retreat.

## p. 331 (#337) ############################################


 
 MY LAST SIGHT OF LAPUTA. 331 
 
 I really did not care. Even if I had got over 
 the bridge I should probably have been foiled by 
 the shut turnstile. I had quite forgotten the 
 meaning of fear of death. 
 
 1 found myself giving my arm to the man who 
 had tried to destroy me. 
 
 " I have laid up for you treasure in heaven," 
 he said. " Your earthly treasure is in the boxes, 
 but soon you will be seeking incorruptible jewels 
 in the deep deep water. It is cool and quiet down 
 there, and you forget the hunger and pain." 
 
 The man was getting very near his end. The 
 madness of despair came back to him, and he 
 flung himself among the ashes. 
 
 " We are going to die together, Crawfurd," he 
 said. " God has twined our threads, and there 
 will be only one cutting. Tell me what has 
 become of my army." 
 
 "Arcoll has guns on the Wolkberg," I said. 
 " They must submit or perish." 
 
 " I have other armies . . . No, no, they are noth- 
 ing. They will all wander and blunder and fight 
 and be beaten. There is no leader anywhere . . . 
 And I am dying." 
 
 There was no gainsaying the signs of death. I

 asked him if he would like water, but he made no 
 answen His eyes were fixed on vacancy, and I 
 thought I could realize something of the bitterness 
 of that great regret. For myself I was as cold as 
 a stone. I had no exultation of triumph, still less 
 any fear of my own fate. I stood silent, the half- 
 remorseful spectator of a fall like the fall of 
 Lucifer. 
 
 " I would have taught the world wisdom." 
 Laputa was speaking English in a strange, thin, 
 abstracted voice. " There would have been no 
 king like me since Charlemagne," and he strayed 
 into Latin, which I have been told since was an 
 adaptation of the Epitaph of Charles the Great. 
 '¦'¦ Sub hoc conditorio^'' he crooned, '•^ sitmn est corpus 
 JoanniSj magni et orthodoxi Imperatoris^ qui imperium 
 Africanum nohtliter ampliavit^ et multos per annos 
 mundum feliciter rexitT* He must have chosen 
 this epitaph long ago. 
 
 He lay for a few seconds with his head on his 
 arms, his breast heaving with agony. 
 
 " No one will come after me. My race is 
 
 * " Under this stone is laid the body of John, tlie great and orthodox 
 Emperor, wlio nobly enlarged the African realm, and for many years

 doomed, and in a little they will have forgotten my 
 name. 1 alone could have saved them. Now 
 they go the way of the rest, and the warriors of 
 John become drudges and slaves." 
 
 Something clicked in his throat, he gasped and 
 fell forward, and I thought he was dead. Then 
 he struggled as if to rise. I ran to him, and with 
 all my strength aided him to his feet. 
 
 " Unarm, Eros," he cried. " The long day's 
 task is done." With the strange power of a 
 dying man he tore off his leopard-skin and belt till 
 he stood stark as on the night when he had been 
 crowned. From his pouch he took the Prester's 
 Collar. Then he staggered to the brink of the 
 chasm where the wall of green water dropped into 
 the dark depth below. 
 
 I watched, fascinated, as with the weak hands of 
 a child he twined the rubies round his neck and 
 joined the clasp. Then with a last effort he stood 
 straight up on the brink, his eyes raised to the 
 belt of daylight from which the water fell. The 
 light caught the great gems and called fires from 
 them, the flames of the funeral pyre of a king. 
 
 Once more his voice, restored for a moment to 
 its old vigour, rang out through the cave above

 334 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 the din of the cascade. His words were those 
 which the Keeper had used three nights before. 
 With his hands held high and the Collar burning 
 on his neck he cried, " The Snake returns to the 
 House of its Birth." 
 
 " Come," he cried to me. " The Heir of John 
 is going home." 
 
 Then he leapt into the gulf. There was no 
 sound of falling, so great was the rush of water. 
 He must have been whirled into the open below 
 where the bridge used to be, and then swept into 
 the underground deeps, where the Labongo drowses 
 for fifty miles. Far from human quest he sleeps 
 his last sleep, and perchance on a fragment of 
 bone washed into a crevice of rock there may hang 
 the jewels that once gleamed in Sheba's hair.

 Chapter XXI. 
 
 I CLIMB THE CRAGS A SECOND TIME. 
 
 T REMEMBER that I looked over the brink 
 into the yeasty abyss with a mind hovering 
 between perplexity and tears. I wanted to sit 
 down and cry — why, I did not know, except that 
 some great thing had happened. My brain was 
 quite clear as to my own position. I was shut in 
 in this place, with no chance of escape and with no 
 food. In a little I must die of starvation, or go 
 mad and throw myself after Laputa. And yet I 
 did not care a rush. My nerves had been tried 
 too greatly in the past week. Now I was coma- 
 tose, and beyond hoping or fearing. 
 
 I sat for a long time watching the light play on 
 the fretted sheet of water and wondering where 
 Laputa's body had gone. I shivered and wished 
 he had not left me alone, for the darkness would 
 come in time and I had no matches. After a little

## p. 336 (#342) ############################################


 
 336 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 I got tired of doing nothing, and went groping 
 among the treasure chests. One or two were full 
 of coin — British sovereigns, Kruger sovereigns. 
 Napoleons, Spanish and Portuguese gold pieces, 
 and many older coins ranging back to the middle 
 a^es and even to the ancients. In one handful there 
 was a splendid gold stater, and in another a piece of 
 Antoninus Pius. The treasure had been collected 
 for many years in many places, contributions of 
 chiefs from ancient hoards as well as the cash 
 received from I.D.B. I untied one or two of the 
 little bags of stones and poured the contents into 
 my hands. Most of the diamonds were small, such 
 as a labourer might secrete on his person. The 
 larger ones — and some were very large — were as 
 a rule discoloured, looking more like big cairn- 
 gorms. But one or two bags had big stones 
 which even my inexperienced eye told me were of 
 the purest water. There must be some new pipe, 
 1 thoup-ht, for these could not have been stolen 
 from any known mine. 
 
 After that I sat on the floor again and looked 
 at the v/ater. It exercised a mesmeric influence 
 on me, soothing all care. I was quite happy to 
 wait for death, for death had no meaning to me.

## p. 337 (#343) ############################################


 
 I CLIMB THE CRAGS AGAIN. 337 
 
 My hate and fury were both lulled into a trance, 
 since the passive is the next stage to the over- 
 wrought. 
 
 It must have been full day outside now, for the 
 funnel was bright with sunshine, and even the dim 
 cave caught a reflected radiance. As I watched the 
 river I saw a bird flash downward, skimming the 
 water. It turned into the cave and fluttered 
 among its dark recesses. I heard its wings beating 
 the roof as it sought wildly for an outlet. It 
 dashed into the spray of the cataract and escaped 
 again into the cave. For maybe twenty minutes it 
 fluttered, till at last it found the way it had 
 entered by. With a dart it sped up the funnel of 
 rock into light and freedom. 
 
 I had begun to watch the bird in idle lassitude, 
 I ended in keen excitement. The sight of it 
 seemed to take a film from my eyes. I realized 
 the zest of liberty, the passion of life again. I 
 felt that beyond this dim underworld there was 
 the great joyous earth, and I longed for it. I 
 wanted to live now. My memory cleared, and I 
 remembered all that had befallen me during the 
 last few days. I had played the chief part in the 
 whole business, and I had won. Laputa was dead

 338 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 and the treasure was mine, while ArcoU was crush- 
 ing the Rising at his ease. I had only to be free 
 again to be famous and rich. My hopes had re- 
 turned, but with them came my fears. What if I 
 could not escape ^ I must perish miserably by 
 degrees, shut in the heart of a hill, though my 
 friends were out for rescue. In place of my 
 former lethargy I was now in a fever of unrest. 
 
 My first care was to explore the way I had 
 come. I ran down the passage to the chasm which 
 the slab of stone had spanned. I had been right 
 in my guess, for the thing was gone. Laputa was 
 in truth a Titan, who in the article of death could 
 break down a bridge which would have taken 
 any three men an hour to shift. The gorge was 
 about seven yards wide, too far to risk a jump, 
 and the cliff fell sheer and smooth to the im- 
 prisoned waters two hundred feet below. There 
 was no chance of circuiting it, for the wall was as 
 smooth as if it had been chiselled. The hand of 
 man had been at work to make the sanctuary 
 inviolable. 
 
 It occurred to me that sooner or later Arcoll 
 would track Laputa to this place. He would find 
 the bloodstains in the gully, but the turnstile

 I CLIMB THE CRAGS AGAIN. 339 
 
 would be shut and he would never find the trick 
 of it. Nor could he have any Kaffirs with him 
 who knew the secret of the Place of the Snake. 
 Still if Arcoll knew I was inside he would find 
 some way to get to me even though he had to 
 dynamite the curtain of rock. I shouted, but 
 my voice seemed to be drowned in the roar of 
 the water. It made but a fresh chord in the 
 wild orchestra, and I gave up hopes in that 
 direction. 
 
 Very dolefully I returned to the cave. I was 
 about to share the experience of all treasure- 
 hunters — to be left with jewels galore and not 
 a bite to sustain life. The thing was too common- 
 place to be endured. I grew angry, and declined 
 so obvious a fate. " Ek sal'n plan maak," I 
 told myself in the old Dutchman's words. I 
 had come through worse dangers, and a way I 
 should find. To starve in the cave was no ending 
 for David Crawfurd. Far better to join Laputa 
 in the depths in a manly hazard for liberty. 
 
 My obstinacy and irritation cheered me. What 
 had become of the lack-lustre young fool who had 
 mooned here a few minutes back ? Now I was 
 as tense and strung for effort as the day I had

 ridden from Blaauwildebeestefontein to Umvelos'. 
 I felt like a runner in the last lap of a race. For 
 four days 1 had lived in the midst of terror 
 and darkness. Daylight was only a few steps 
 ahead, daylight and youth restored and a new 
 world. 
 
 There were only two outlets from that cave — 
 the way I had come, and the way the river came. 
 The first was closed, the second a sheer staring 
 impossibility. I had been into every niche and 
 cranny, and there was no sign of a passage. I sat 
 down on the floor and looked at the wall of water. 
 It fell, as I have already explained, in a solid sheet, 
 which made up the whole of the wall of the cave. 
 Higher than the roof of the cave 1 could not see 
 what happened, except that it must be the open air, 
 for the sun was shining on it. The water was 
 about three yards distant from the edge of the 
 cave's floor, but it seemed to me that high up, 
 level with the roof, this distance decreased to little 
 more than a foot. 
 
 1 could not see what the walls of the cave were 
 like, but they looked smooth and difficult. Sup- 
 posing 1 managed to climb up to the level of the 
 roof close to the water, how on earth was I to get

 outside on to the wall of the ravine ? I knew from 
 my old days of rock-climbing what a complete 
 obstacle the overhang of a cave is. 
 
 While I looked, however, I saw a thing which I 
 had not noticed before. On the left side of the 
 fall the water sluiced down in a sheet to the 
 extreme edge of the cave, almost sprinkling the 
 floor with water. But on the right side the force 
 of water was obviously weaker, and a little short 
 of the level of the cave roof there was a spike of 
 rock which slightly broke the fall. The spike was 
 covered, but the covering was shallow, for the 
 current flowed from it in a rose-shaped spray. If a 
 man could get to that spike and could get a foot on 
 it without being swept down, it might be possible 
 — just possible — to do something with the wall of 
 the chasm above the cave. Of course I knew 
 nothing about the nature of that wall. It might 
 be as smooth as a polished pillar. 
 
 The result of these cogitations was that I 
 decided to prospect the right wall of the cave close 
 to the waterfall. But first I went rummag-ino- in 
 the back part to see if I could find anything to 
 assist me. In one corner there was a rude cup- 
 board with some stone and metal vessels. Here,

 too, were the few domestic utensils of the dead 
 Keeper. In another were several locked coffers 
 on which 1 could make no impression. There 
 were the treasure-chests too, but they held nothing 
 save treasure, and gold and diamonds were no 
 manner of use to me. Other odds and ends 
 I found — spears, a few skins, and a broken and 
 notched axe. I took the axe in case there might 
 be cutting to do. 
 
 Then at the back of a bin my hand struck 
 something which brought the blood to my face. 
 It was a rope, an old one, but still in fair condition 
 and forty or fifty feet long. I dragged it out into 
 the light and straightened its kinks. With this 
 something could be done, assuming I could cut 
 my way to the level of the roof. 
 
 I began the climb in my bare feet, and at the 
 beginning it was very bad. Except on the very 
 edge of the abyss there was scarcely a handhold. 
 Possibly in floods the waters may have swept the 
 wall in a curve, smoothing down the inner part 
 and leaving the outer to its natural roughness. 
 There was one place where I had to hang on by 
 a very narrow crack while 1 scraped with the axe 
 a hollow for my right foot. And then about

 I CLIMB THE CRAGS AGAIN. 343 
 
 twelve feet from the ground I struck the first of 
 the iron pegs. 
 
 To this day I cannot think what these pegs 
 were for. They were old square-headed things 
 which had seen the wear of centuries. They 
 cannot have been meant to assist a climber, for the 
 dwellers of the cave had clearly never contem- 
 plated this means of egress. Perhaps they had 
 been used for some kind of ceremonial curtain 
 in a dim past. They were rusty and frail, and 
 one of them came away in my hand, but for all 
 that they marvellously assisted my ascent. 
 
 I had been climbing slowly, doggedly and care- 
 fully, my mind wholly occupied with the task ; 
 and almost before I knew I found my head close 
 under the roof of the cave. Ic was necessary now 
 to move towards the river, and the task seemed 
 impossible. I could see no footholds, save two 
 frail pegs, and in the corner between the wall and 
 the roof was a rough arch too wide for my body to 
 jam itself in. Just below the level of the roof — 
 say two feet — I saw l' e submerged spike of rock. 
 The waters raged around it, and could not have 
 been more than an inch deep on the top. If I 
 could only get my foot on that I believed I could

 344 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 avoid being swept down and stand up and reach 
 for the wall above the cave. 
 
 But how to get to it ? It was no good delaying, 
 for my frail holds might give at any moment. In 
 any case I would have the moral security of the 
 rope, so I passed it through a fairly staunch pin 
 close to the roof, which had an upward tilt that 
 almost made a ring of it. One end of the rope 
 was round my body, the other was loose in my 
 hand, and I paid it out as I moved. Moral 
 support is something. Very gingerly I crawled 
 like a fly along the wall, my fingers now clutching 
 at a tiny knob, now clawing at a crack which did 
 little more than hold my nails. It was all hope- 
 less insanity, and yet somehow I did it. The 
 rope and the nearness of the roof gave me con- 
 fidence and balance. 
 
 Then the holds ceased altogether a couple of 
 yards from the water. I saw my spike of rock 
 a trifle below me. There was nothing for it but 
 to risk all on a jump. I drew the rope out of the 
 hitch, twined the slack round my waist, and leaped 
 for the spike. 
 
 It was like throwing oneself on a line of spears. 
 The solid wall of water hurled me back and down.

 I CLIMB THE CRAGS AGAIN. 345 
 
 but as I fell my arms closed on the spike. There 
 I hung while my feet were tow^ed outwards by the 
 volume of the stream as if they had been dead 
 leaves. I was half-stunned by the shock of the 
 drip on my head, but I kept my wits, and pres- 
 ently got my face outside the falling sheet and 
 breathed. 
 
 To get to my feet and stand on the spike while 
 all the fury of water was plucking at me was 
 the hardest physical effort I have ever made. It 
 had to be done very circumspectly, for a slip 
 would send me into the abyss. If I moved an 
 arm or leg an inch too near the terrible dropping 
 wall I knew I should be plucked from my hold. 
 I got my knees on the outer face of the spike, 
 so that all my body was removed as far as possible 
 from the impact of the water. Then I began to 
 pull myself slowly up. 
 
 I could not do it. If I got my feet on the 
 rock the effort would bring me too far Into the 
 water, and that meant destruction. I saw this 
 clearly in a second while my wrists were cracking 
 with the strain. But if I had a wall behind me 
 I could reach back with one hand and get what 
 we call in Scotland a " stell." I knew there was

 346 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 a wall, but how far I could not judge. The 
 perpetual hammering of the stream had confused 
 my wits. 
 
 It was a liorrible moment, but I had to risk it. 
 I knew that if the wall was too far back I should 
 fall, for I had to let my weight go till my hand 
 fell on it. Delay would do no good, so with 
 a prayer I flung my right hand back, while my left 
 hand clutched the spike. 
 
 1 found the wall — it was only a foot or two 
 beyond my reach. With a heave 1 had my foot 
 on the spike, and turning, had both hands on the 
 opposite wall. There I stood, straddling like a 
 Colossus over a waste of white waters, with the 
 cave floor far below me in the gloom, and my 
 discarded axe lying close to a splash of Laputa's 
 blood. 
 
 The spectacle made me giddy, and I had to 
 move on or fall. The wall was not quite perpen- 
 dicular, but as far as I could see a slope of about 
 sixty degrees. It was ribbed and terraced pretty 
 fully, but I could see no ledge within reach which 
 off^ered standing room. Once more 1 tried the 
 moral support of the rope, and as well as I could 
 dropped a noose on the spike which might hold

 I CLIMB THE CRAGS AGAIN. 347 
 
 me if I fell. Then I boldly embarked on a hand 
 traverse, pulling myself along a little ledge till I 
 was right in the angle of the fall. Here, happily, 
 the water was shallower and less violent, and with 
 my legs up to the knees in foam I managed to 
 scramble into a kind of corner. Now at last I 
 was on the wall of the gully, and above the cave. 
 I had achieved by amazing luck one of the most 
 difficult of all mountaineering operations. I had 
 got out of a cave to the wall above. 
 
 My troubles were by no means over, for I found 
 the cliff most difficult to climb. The great rush 
 of the stream dizzied my brain, the spray made 
 the rock damp, and the slope steepened as I 
 advanced. At one overhang my shoulder was 
 almost in the water again. All this time I was 
 climbing doggedly, with terror somewhere in my 
 soul, and hope lighting but a feeble lamp. I was 
 very distrustful of my body, for I knew that at 
 any moment my weakness might return. The 
 fever of three days of peril and stress is not allayed 
 by one night's rest. 
 
 By this time I was high enough to see that the 
 river came out of the ground about fifty feet short 
 of the lip of the gully, and some ten feet beyond

 348 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 where I stood. Above the hole whence the waters 
 issued was a loose slope of slabs and screes. It 
 looked an ugly place, but there I must go, for the 
 rock-wall I was on was getting unclimbable. 
 
 I turned the corner a foot or two above the water, 
 and stood on a slope of about fifty degrees, running 
 from the parapet of stone to a line beyond which 
 blue sky appeared. The first step I took the 
 place began to move. A boulder crashed into the 
 fall, and tore down into the abyss with a shattering 
 thunder. I lay flat and clutched desperately at 
 every hold, but I had loosened an avalanche of 
 earth, and not till my feet were sprayed by the 
 water did I get a grip of firm rock and check my 
 descent. All this frightened me horribly with the 
 kind of despairing angry fear which I had suffered 
 at Bruderstroom, when I dreamed that the treasure 
 was lost. I could not bear the notion of death 
 when I had won so far. 
 
 After that I advanced, not by steps, but by 
 inches. I felt more poised and pinnacled in the 
 void than when 1 had stood on the spike of rock, 
 for I had a substantial hold neither for foot nor 
 hand. It seemed weeks before I made any pro- 
 gress away from the lip of the waterhole. I dared

 I CLIMB THE CRAGS AGAIN. 349 
 
 not look down, but kept my eyes on the slope 
 before me, searching for any patch of ground which 
 promised stability. Once I found a scrog of 
 iuniper with firm roots, and this gave me a great 
 lift. A little further, however, I lit on a bank of 
 screes which slipped with me to the right, and I 
 lost most of the ground the bush had gained me. 
 My whole being, I remember, was filled with a 
 devouring passion to be quit of this gully and all 
 that was in it. 
 
 Then, not suddenly as in romances, but after 
 hard striving and hope long deferred, I found my- 
 self on a firm outcrop of weathered stone. In 
 three strides I was on the edge of the plateau. 
 Then I began to run, and at the same time to lose 
 the power of running. I cast one look behind me, 
 and saw a deep cleft of darkness out of which I 
 had climbed. Down in the cave it had seemed 
 light enough, but in the clear sunshine of the top 
 the gorge looked a very pit of shade. For the 
 first and last time in my life I had vertigo. Fear 
 of falling back, and a mad craze to do it, made me 
 acutely sick. I managed to stumble a few steps 
 forward on the mountain turf, and then flung my- 
 self on my face.

 When I raised my head I was amazed to find 
 it still early morning. The dew was yet on the 
 grass, and the sun was not far up the sky. I had 
 thought that my entry into the cave, my time in 
 it, and my escape had taken many hours, whereas 
 at the most they had occupied two. It was little 
 more than dawn, such a dawn as walks only on 
 the hilltops. Before me was the shallow vale with 
 its bracken and sweet grass, and the shining links 
 of the stream, and the loch still grey in the shadow 
 of the beleaguering hills. Here was a fresh, clean 
 land, a land for homesteads and orchards and 
 children. All of a sudden I realized that at last I 
 had come out of savagery. 
 
 The burden of the past days slipped from my 
 shoulders. 1 felt young again, and cheerful and 
 brave. Behind me was the black night, and the 
 horrid secrets of darkness. Before me was my 
 own country, for that loch and that bracken might 
 have been on a Scotch moor. The fresh scent of 
 the air and the whole morning mystery put song 
 into my blood. I remembered that I was not yet 
 twenty. 
 
 My first care was to kneel there among the 
 bracken and give thanks to my Maker, who in

 very truth had shown me " His goodness in the 
 land of the living." 
 
 After a little I went back to the edge of the cliff. 
 There where the road came out of the bush was 
 the body of Henriques, lying scrawled on the 
 sand, with two dismounted riders looking hard 
 at it. I gave a great shout, for in the men I 
 recognized Aitken and the schoolmaster Wardlaw.

 T MUST now take up some of the ragged ends 
 which I have left behhid me. It is not my 
 task, as I have said, to write the history of the 
 great Rising. That has been done by abler men, 
 who were at the centre of the business, and had 
 some knowledge of strategy and tactics ; whereas 
 I was only a raw lad who was privileged by fate to 
 see the start. If I could, I would fain make an epic 
 of it, and show how the Plains found at all points 
 the Plateau guarded, how wits overcame numbers, 
 and at every pass which the natives tried the great 
 guns spoke and the tide rolled back. Yet I fear 
 it would be an epic without a hero. There was 
 no leader left when Laputa had gone. There were 
 months of guerrilla fighting, and then months of 
 reprisals, when chief after chief was hunted down

 and brought to trial. Then the amnesty came and 
 
 a clean sheet, and white Africa drew breath again 
 
 with certain grave reflections left in her head. On 
 
 the whole I am not sorry that the history is no 
 
 business of mine. Romance died with " the heir 
 
 of John," and the crusade became a sorry mutiny. 
 
 I can fancy how differently Laputa would have 
 
 managed it all had he lived ; how swift and sudden 
 
 his plans would have been ; how under him the 
 
 fighting would not have been in the mountain 
 
 glens, but far in the high-veld among the dorps 
 
 and townships. With the Inkulu alive we warred 
 
 against odds ; with the Inkulu dead the balance 
 
 sank heavily in our favour. I leave to others the 
 
 marches and strategy of the thing, and hasten to 
 
 clear up the obscure parts in my own fortunes. 
 
 Arcoll received my message from Umvelos' by 
 
 Colin, or rather Wardlaw received it and sent it on 
 
 to the post on the Berg where the leader had 
 
 gone. Close on its heels came the message from 
 
 Henriques by a Shangaan in his pay. It must 
 
 have been sent off before the Portugoose got to the 
 
 Rooirand, from which it would appear that he 
 
 had his own men in the bush near the store, and 
 
 that I was lucky to get off as I did. Arcoll might

 have disregarded Henriques' news as a trap if it 
 had come alone, but my corroboration impressed 
 and perplexed him. He began to credit the 
 Portugoose with treachery, but he had no in- 
 clination to act on his message, since it conflicted 
 with his plans. He knew that Laputa must come 
 into the Berg sooner or later, and he had resolved 
 that his strategy must be to await him there. But 
 there was the question of my life. He had every 
 reason to believe that I was in the greatest danger, 
 and he felt a certain responsibility for my fate. 
 With the few men at his disposal he could not 
 hope to hold up the great Kaffir army, but there 
 was a chance that he might by a bold stand effect 
 my rescue. Henriques had told him of the vow, 
 and had told him that Laputa would ride in the 
 centre of the force. A body of men well posted 
 at Dupree's Drift might split the army at the 
 crossing, and under cover of the fire I might 
 swim the river and join my friends. Still relying 
 on the vow it might be possible for well-mounted 
 men to evade capture. Accordingly he called for 
 volunteers, and sent oif one of his Kaffirs to warn 
 me of his design. He led his men in person, and 
 of his doings the reader already knows the tale.

## p. 355 (#361) ############################################


 
 A PERIL AND A SALVATION. 255 
 
 But though the crossing was flung Into con- 
 fusion, and the rear of the army was compelled 
 to follow the northerly bank of the Letaba, there 
 was no sign of me anywhere. ArcoU searched the 
 river-banks, and crossed the drift to where the 
 old Keeper was lying dead. He then concluded 
 that I had been murdered early in the march, and 
 his Kaffir, who might have given him news of me, 
 was carried up the stream in the tide of the dis- 
 orderly army. Therefore, he and his men rode 
 back with all haste to the Berg by way of Main 
 Drift, and reached Bruderstroom before Laputa 
 had crossed the highway. 
 
 My Information about Inanda's Kraal decided 
 Arcoll's next move. Like me he remembered 
 Beyers's performance, and resolved to repeat it. He 
 had no hope of catching Laputa, but he thought 
 that he might hold up the bulk of his force if he got 
 guns on the ridge above the kraal. A message 
 had already been sent for guns, and the first to 
 arrive got to Bruderstroom about the hour when 
 I was being taken by Machudi's men in the kloof. 
 The ceremony of the purification prevented Laputa 
 from keeping a good look-out, and the result was 
 that a way was made for the guns on the north-

 western corner of the rampart of rock. It was the 
 way which Beyers had taken, and indeed the enter- 
 prise was directed by one of Beyers's old command- 
 ants. All that day the work continued, while 
 Laputa and I were travelling to Machudi's. Then 
 came the evening when I staggered into camp and 
 told my news. Arcoll, who alone knew how vital 
 Laputa was to the success of the insurrection, im- 
 mediately decided to suspend all other operations 
 and devote himself to shepherding the leader away 
 from his army. How the scheme succeeded and 
 what befell Laputa the reader has already been told. 
 Aitken and Wardlaw, when I descended from 
 the cliffs, took me straight to Blaauwildebeeste- 
 fontein. I was like a man who is recovering from 
 bad fever, cured, but weak and foolish, and it was 
 a slow journey which I made to Umvelos', riding 
 on Aitken's pony. At Umvelos' we found a 
 picket who had captured the schimmel by the road- 
 side. That wise beast, when I turned him loose at 
 the entrance to the cave, had trotted quietly back 
 the way he had come. At Umvelos' Aitken left 
 me, and next day, with Wardlaw as companion, I 
 rode up the glen of the Klein Labongo, and came 
 In the afternoon to my old home. The store was

 empty, for Japp some days before had gone off 
 post-haste to Pietersdorp ; but there was Zeeta 
 cleaning up the place as if war had never been 
 heard of. I slept the night there, and in the 
 morning found myself so much recovered that 
 I was eager to get away. I wanted to see Arcoll 
 about many things, but mainly about the treasure 
 in the cave. 
 
 It was an easy journey to Bruderstroom through 
 the meadows of the plateau. The farmers' com- 
 mandoes had been recalled, but the ashes of their 
 camp fires were still grey among the bracken. I 
 fell in with a police patrol and was taken by them 
 to a spot on the Upper Letaba, some miles west of 
 the camp, where we found Arcoll at late breakfast. 
 I had resolved to take him into my confidence, 
 so I told him the full tale of my night's adven- 
 ture. He was very severe with me, I remember, 
 for my daft -like ride, but his severity relaxed 
 before I had done with my story. 
 
 The telling brought back the scene to me, and I 
 shivered at the picture of the cave with the morn- 
 ing breaking through the veil of water and Laputa 
 in his death throes. Arcoll did not speak for some 
 time.

 358 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 " So he is dead," he said at last, half whispering 
 to himself. " Well, he was a king, and died like a 
 king. Our job now is simple, for there is none of 
 his breed left in Africa." 
 
 Then I told him of the treasure. 
 
 "It belongs to you, Davie," he said, "and we 
 must see that you get it. This is going to be 
 a long war, but if we survive to the end you will 
 be a rich man." 
 
 " But in the meantime ? " I asked. " Supposing 
 other Kaffirs hear of it, and come back and make a 
 bridge over the gorge ^ They may be doing it 
 
 now." 
 
 " I'll put a guard on it," he said, jumping up 
 briskly. "It's maybe not a soldier's job, but 
 you've saved this country, Davie, and I'm going to 
 make sure that you have your reward." 
 
 After that I went with Arcoll to Inanda's Kraal. 
 I am not going to tell the story of that per- 
 formance, for it occupies no less than two chapters 
 in Mr. Upton's book. He makes one or two 
 blunders, for he spells my name with an "o," 
 and he says we walked out of the camp on our 
 perilous mission "with faces white and set as a

 Crusader's." That is certainly not true, for in the 
 first place nobody saw us go who could judge how 
 we looked, and in the second place we were both 
 smoking and feeling quite cheerful. At home they 
 made a great fuss about it, and started a newspaper 
 cry about the Victoria Cross, but the danger was 
 not so terrible after all, and in any case it was 
 nothing to what I had been through in the past 
 week. 
 
 I take credit to myself for suggesting the idea. 
 By this time we had the army in the kraal at our 
 mercy. Laputa not having returned, they had no 
 plans. It had been the original intention to start 
 for the Olifants on the following day, so there was 
 a scanty supply of food. Besides, there were the 
 makings of a pretty quarrel between Umbooni and 
 some of the north-country chiefs, and I verily be- 
 lieve that if we had held them tight there for a week 
 they would have destroyed each other in faction 
 fights. In any case in a little they would have 
 grown desperate and tried to rush the approaches 
 on the north and south. Then we must either have 
 used the guns on them, which would have meant 
 a great slaughter, or let them go to do mischief 
 elsewhere. Arcoll was a merciful man who had

 36o PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 no love for butchery ; besides, he was a statesman 
 with an eye to the future of the country after the 
 war. But it was his duty to isolate Laputa's army, 
 and at all costs it must be prevented from joining 
 any of the concentrations in the south. 
 
 Then I proposed to him to do as Rhodes did 
 in the Matoppos, and go and talk to them. By 
 this time, I argued, the influence of Laputa must 
 have sunk, and the fervour of the purification be 
 half-forgotten. The army had little food and no 
 leader. The rank and file had never been fan- 
 atical, and the chiefs and indunas must now be 
 inclined to sober reflections. But once blood was 
 shed the lust of blood would possess them. Our 
 only chance was to strike when their minds were 
 perplexed and undecided. 
 
 Arcoll did all the arranging. He had a message 
 sent to the chiefs inviting them to an indaba, and 
 presently word was brought back that an indaba 
 was called for the next day at noon. That same 
 night we heard that Umbooni and about twenty of 
 his men had managed to evade our ring of scouts 
 and got clear away to the south. This was all to 
 our advantage, as it removed from the coming 
 indaba the most irreconcilable of the chiefs.

## p. 361 (#367) ############################################


 
 A PERIL AND A SALVATION. 361 
 
 That indaba was a queer business. ArcoU and 
 I left our escort at the foot of a ravine, and entered 
 the kraal by the same road as I had left it. It was 
 a very bright, hot winter's day, and try as I might, 
 I could not bring myself to think of any danger. 
 I believe that in this way most temerarious deeds 
 are done ; the doer has become insensible to 
 danger, and his imagination is clouded with some 
 engrossing purpose. The first sentries received 
 us gloomily enough, and closed behind us as they 
 had done when Machudi's men haled me thither. 
 Then the job became eerie, for we had to walk 
 across a green flat with thousands of eyes watching 
 us. By-and-by we came to the merula tree oppo- 
 site the kyas, and there we found a ring of chiefs, 
 sitting with cocked rifles on their knees. 
 
 We were armed with pistols, and the first thing 
 Arcoll did was to hand them to one of the chiefs. 
 
 "We come in peace," he said. "We give you 
 our lives." 
 
 Then the indaba began, Arcoll leading off*. It was 
 a fine speech he made, one of the finest I have ever 
 listened to. He asked them what their grievances 
 were ; he told them how mighty was the power of 
 the white man ; he promised that what was unjust

 should be remedied, if only they would speak 
 honestly and peacefully ; he harped on their old 
 legends and songs, claiming for the king of England 
 the right of their old monarchs. It was a fine 
 speech, and yet I saw that it did not convince 
 them. They listened moodily, if attentively, and 
 at the end there was a blank silence. 
 
 ArcoU turned to me. " For God's sake, Davie," 
 he said, "talk to them about Laputa. It's our 
 only chance." 
 
 I had never tried speaking before, and though I 
 talked their tongue I had not ArcoU's gift of it. 
 But I felt that a great cause was at stake, and I 
 spoke up as best I could. 
 
 I began by saying that Inkulu had been my 
 friend, and that at Umvelos' before the rising he 
 had tried to save my life. At the mention of the 
 lame I saw eyes brighten. At last the audience 
 was hanging on my words. 
 
 I told them of Henriques and his treachery. I 
 told them frankly and fairly of the doings at 
 Dupree's Drift. I made no secret of the part I 
 played. " I was fighting for my life," I said. 
 "Any man of you who is a man would have 
 done the like."

 A PERIL AND A SALVATION. 363 
 
 Then I told them of my last ride, and the sight 
 I saw at the foot of the Rooirand. I drew a pic- 
 ture of Henriques lying dead with a broken neck, 
 and the Inkulu, wounded to death, creeping into 
 the cave. 
 
 In moments of extremity I suppose every man 
 becomes an orator. In that hour and place I dis- 
 covered gifts I had never dreamed of. Arcoll told 
 me afterwards that I had spoken like a man in- 
 spired, and by a fortunate chance had hit upon the 
 only way to move my hearers. I told of that last 
 scene in the cave, when Laputa had broken down 
 the bridge, and had spoken his dying words — that 
 he was the last king in Africa, and that without 
 him the rising was at an end. Then I told of his 
 leap into the river, and a great sigh went up from 
 the ranks about me. 
 
 "You see me here," I said, "by the grace of 
 God. I found a way up the fall and the cliffs 
 which no man has ever travelled before or will 
 travel again. Your king is dead. He was a great 
 king, as I who stand here bear witness, and you 
 will never more see his like. His last words were 
 that the Rising was over. Respect that word, my 
 brothers. We come to you not in war but in

 peace, to offer a free pardon, and the redress of 
 your wrongs. If you fight you fight with the cer- 
 tainty of failure, and against the wish of the heir 
 of John. I have come here at the risk of my life 
 to tell you his commands. His spirit approves 
 my mission. Think well before you defy the 
 mandate of the Snake, and risk the vengeance of 
 the Terrible Ones." 
 
 After that I knew that we had won. The chiefs 
 talked among themselves in low whispers, casting 
 strange looks at me. Then the greatest of them 
 advanced and laid his rifle at my feet. 
 
 "We believe the word of a brave man," he 
 said. "We accept the mandate of the Snake." 
 
 Arcoll now took command. He arranged for 
 the disarmament bit by bit, companies of men 
 being marched off from Inanda's Kraal to stations 
 on the plateau where their arms were collected by 
 our troops, and food provided for them. For the 
 full history I refer the reader to Mr. Upton's 
 work. It took many days, and taxed all our re- 
 sources, but by the end of a week we had the 
 whole of Laputa's army in separate stations, under 
 guard, disarmed, and awaiting repatriation. 
 
 Then Arcoll went south to the war which was

 to rage around the Swaziland and Zululand borders 
 for many months, while to Aitken and myself was 
 entrusted the work of settlement. We had In- 
 adequate troops at our command, and but for our 
 prestige and the weight of Laputa's dead hand 
 there might any moment have been a tragedy. 
 The task took months, for many of the levies 
 came from the far north, and the job of feeding 
 troops on a long journey was difficult enough in 
 the winter season when the energies of the country 
 were occupied with the fighting in the south. Yet 
 it was an experience for which I shall ever be grate- 
 ful, for it turned me from a rash boy into a serious 
 man. I knew then the meaning of the white 
 man's duty. He has to take all risks, recking 
 nothing of his life or his fortunes, and well con- 
 tent to find his reward in the fulfilment of his 
 task. That is the difference between white and 
 black, the gift of responsibility, the power of being 
 in a little way a king ; and so long as we know 
 this and practise it, we will rule not in Africa alone 
 but wherever there are dark men who live only 
 for the day and their own bellies. Moreover 
 the work made me pitiful and kindly. I learned 
 much of the untold grievances of the natives, and

 saw something of their strange, twisted reasoning. 
 Before we had got Laputa's army back to their 
 kraals, with food enough to tide them over the 
 spring sowing, Aitken and I had got sounder 
 policy in our heads than you will find in the towns, 
 where men sit in offices and see the world through 
 a mist of papers. 
 
 By this time peace was at hand, and I went back 
 to Inanda's Kraal to look for Colin's grave. It 
 was not a difficult quest, for on the sward in front 
 of the merula tree they had buried him. I found 
 a mason in the Iron Kranz village, and from the 
 excellent red stone of the neighbourhood was 
 hewn a square slab with an inscription. It ran 
 thus : " Here lies buried the dog Colin, who was 
 killed in defending D. Crawfurd, his master. To 
 him it was mainly due that the Kaffir Rising 
 failed." I leave those who have read my tale to 
 see the justice of the words.

 TX 7"E got at the treasure by blowing open the 
 turnstile. It was easy enough to trace the 
 spot in the rock where it stood, but the most 
 patient search did not reveal its secret. Accord- 
 ingly we had recourse to dynamite, and soon laid 
 bare the stone steps, and ascended to the gallery. 
 The chasm was bridged with planks, and Arcoll 
 and I crossed alone. The cave was as I had left 
 it. The bloodstains on the floor had grown dark 
 with time, but the ashes of the sacramental fire 
 were still there to remind me of the drama I had 
 borne a part in. When I looked at the way I 
 had escaped my brain grew dizzy at the thought 
 of it. I do not think that all the gold on earth 
 would have driven me a second time to that awful 
 escalade. As for Arcoll, he could not see its 
 possibility at all.

 " Only a madman could have done it/' he said, 
 blinking his eyes at the green linn. " Indeed, 
 Davie, I think for about four days you were as 
 mad as they make. It was a fortunate thing, for 
 your madness saved the country." 
 
 With some labour we got the treasure down to 
 the path, and took it under a strong guard to 
 Pietersdorp. The Government were busy with the 
 settling up after the war, and it took many weeks 
 to have our business disposed of. At first things 
 looked badly for me. The Attorney-General set 
 up a claim to the whole as spoils of war, since, 
 he argued, it was the war-chest of the enemy we 
 had conquered. I do not know how the matter 
 would have gone on legal grounds, though I was 
 advised by my lawyers that the claim was a bad 
 one. But the part I had played in the whole 
 business, more especially in the visit to Inanda's 
 Kraal, had made me a kind of popular hero, and 
 the Government thought better of their first 
 attitude. Besides, Arcoll had great influence, and 
 the whole story of my doings, which was told 
 privately by him to some of the members of 
 the Government, disposed thrm to be generous. 
 Accordingly they agreed to treat the contents of

 the cave as ordinary treasure trove, of which, by 
 the law, one half went to the discoverer and one 
 half to the Crown. 
 
 This was well enough so far as the gold was 
 concerned, but another difficulty arose about the 
 diamonds ; for a large part of these had obviously 
 been stolen by labourers from the mines, and the 
 mining people laid claim to them as stolen goods. 
 I was advised not to dispute this claim, and con- 
 sequently we had a great sorting-out of the stones 
 in the presence of the experts of the different mines. 
 In the end it turned out that identification was not 
 an easy matter, for the experts quarrelled furiously 
 among themselves. A compromise was at last 
 come to, and a division made ; and then the 
 diamond companies behaved very handsomely, 
 voting me a substantial sum in recognition of my 
 services in recovering their property. What with 
 this and with my half share of the gold and my 
 share of the unclaimed stones, I found that 1 had 
 a very considerable fortune. The whole of my 
 stones I sold to De Beers, for if I had placed 
 them on the open market 1 should have upset 
 the delicate equipoise ")f diamond values. When 
 I came finally to cast up my accounts, I found that

## p. 370 (#376) ############################################


 
 370 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 I had secured a fortune of a trifle over a quarter 
 of a million pounds. 
 
 The wealth did not dazzle so much as it 
 solemnized me. I had no impulse to spend any 
 part of it in a riot of folly. It had come to me 
 like fairy gold out of the void ; it had been 
 bought with men's blood, almost with my own. 
 I wanted to get away to a quiet place and think, 
 for of late my life had been too crowded with 
 drama, and there comes a satiety of action as well 
 as of idleness. Above all things I wanted to get 
 home. They gave me a great send-off, and sang 
 songs, and good fellows shook my hand till it 
 ached. The papers were full of me, and there 
 was a banquet and speeches. But I could not 
 relish this glory as 1 ought, for I was like a boy 
 thrown violently out of his bearings. 
 
 Not till I was nearing Cape Town in the train 
 did I recover my equanimity. The burden of the 
 past seemed to slip from me suddenly as on the 
 morning when I had climbed the linn. I saw my 
 life all lying before me ; and already I had won 
 success. I thought of my return to my own 
 country, my first sight of the grey shores of Fife, 
 my visit to Kirkcaple, my meeting with my mother.

## p. 371 (#377) ############################################


 
 MY UNCLE'S GIFT MULTIPLIED. 371 
 
 I was a rich man now who could choose his career, 
 and my mother need never again want for comfort. 
 My money seemed pleasant to me, for if men won 
 theirs by brains or industry, I had won mine by 
 sterner methods, for I had staked against it my 
 life. I sat alone in the railway carriage and cried 
 with pure thankfulness.. These were comforting 
 tears, for they brought me back to my old common- 
 place self. 
 
 My last memory of Africa is my meeting 
 with Tam Dyke. I caught sight of him in the 
 streets of Cape Town, and running after him, 
 clapped him on the shoulder. He stared at me 
 as if he had seen a ghost. 
 
 " Is it yourself, Davie ? " he cried. " I never 
 looked to see you again in this world. I do 
 nothing but read about you in the papers. What 
 for did ye not send for me ? Here have I been 
 knocking about inside a ship and you have been 
 getting famous. They tell me you're a million- 
 aire, too." 
 
 I had Tam to dinner at my hotel, and later, 
 sitting smoking on the terrace and watching the 
 flying-ants among the aloes, I told him the better 
 part of the story I have here written down.

## p. 372 (#378) ############################################


 
 372 PRESTER JOHN. 
 
 " Man, Davie," he said at the end, " you've had 
 a tremendous time. Here are you not eighteen 
 months away from home, and you're going back 
 with a fortune. What will you do with it ? " 
 
 I told him that I proposed, to begin with, to 
 finish my education at Edinburgh College. At 
 this he roared with laughter. 
 
 "That's a dull ending, anyway. It's me that 
 should have the money, for I'm full of imagina- 
 tion. You were aye a prosaic body, Davie." 
 
 " Maybe I am," I said ; " but I am very sure 
 of one thing. If I hadn't been a prosaic body, 
 I wouldn't be sitting here to-night." 
 
 Two years later Aitken found the diamond 
 pipe, which he had always believed lay in the 
 mountains. Some of the stones in the cave, 
 being unlike any ordinary African diamonds, 
 confirmed his suspicions and set him on the 
 track. A Kai^r tribe to the north-east of the 
 Rooirand had known of it, but they had never 
 worked it, but only collected the overspill. The 
 closing down of one of the chief existing mines 
 had created a shortage of diamonds in the 
 world's markets, and once again the position

 was the same as when KImberley began. Ac- 
 cordingly he made a great fortune, and to-day 
 the Aitken Proprietary Mine is one of the most 
 famous in the country. But Aitken did more 
 than mine diamonds, for he had not forgotten the 
 lesson we had learned together In the work of 
 resettlement. He laid down a big fund for the 
 education and amelioration of the native races, 
 and the first fruit of it was the establishment at 
 Blaauwildebeestefontein itself of a great native 
 training college. It was no factory for making 
 missionaries and black teachers, but an institution 
 for giving the Kaffirs the kind of training which 
 fits them to be good citizens of the state. There 
 you will find every kind of technical workshop, 
 and the finest experimental farms, where the blacks 
 are taught modern agriculture. They have proved 
 themselves apt pupils, and to-day you will see in 
 the glens of the Berg and in the plains Kaffir 
 tillage which is as scientific as any in Africa. 
 They have created a huge export trade in tobacco 
 and fruit ; the cotton promises well ; and there 
 is talk of a new fibre which will do wonders. 
 Also along the river bottoms the india-rubber 
 business is prospering.

 There are playing-fields and baths and reading- 
 rooms and libraries just as in a school at home. 
 In front of the great hall of the college a statue 
 stands, the figure of a black man shading his eyes 
 with his hands and looking far over the plains to 
 the Rooirand. On the pedestal it is lettered 
 " Prester John," but the face is the face of Laputa. 
 So the last of the kings of Africa does not lack his 
 monument. 
 
 Of this institution Mr. Wardlaw is the head. 
 He writes to me weekly, for I am one of the 
 governors, as well as an old friend, and from 
 a recent letter I take this passage : — 
 
 " I often cast my mind back to the afternoon 
 when you and I sat on the stoep of the school- 
 house, and talked of the Kaffirs and our future. 
 I had about a dozen pupils then, and now I have 
 nearly three thousand ; and in place of a tin-roofed 
 shanty and a yard, I have a whole countryside. 
 You laughed at me for my keenness, Davie, but 
 I've seen it justified. I was never a man of war 
 like you, and so I had to bide at home while 
 you and your like were straightening out the 
 troubles. But when it was all over my job 
 began, for I could do what you couldn't do — I

 was the physician to heal wounds. You mind 
 how nervous I was when I heard the drums beat. 
 I hear them every evening now, for we have made 
 a rule that all the Kaffir farms on the Berg sound 
 a kind of curfew. It reminds me of old times, 
 and tells me that though it is peace nowadays we 
 mean to keep all the manhood in them that they 
 used to exercise in war. It would do your eyes 
 good to see the garden we have made out of the 
 Klein Labongo glen. The place is one big orchard 
 with every kind of tropical fruit in it, and the 
 irrigation dam is as full of fish as it will hold. 
 Out at Umvelos' there is a tobacco-factory, and all 
 round Sikitola's we have square miles of mealie 
 and cotton fields. The loch on the Rooirand is 
 stocked with Lochleven trout, and we have made 
 a bridle-path up to it in a gully east of the one 
 you climbed. You ask about Machudi's. The 
 last time I was there the place was white with 
 sheep, for we have got the edge of the plateau 
 grazed down, and sheep can get the short bite 
 there. We have cleaned up all the kraals, and 
 the chiefs are members of our county council, 
 and are as fond of hearing their own voices as an 
 Aberdeen bailie. It's a queer transformation we

 have wrought, and when 1 sit and smoke my pipe 
 in the evening, and look over the plains and then 
 at the big black statue you and Aitken set up, 
 I thank the Providence that has guided me so far. 
 I hope and trust that, in the Bible words, 'the 
 wilderness and the solitary place are glad for us.' 
 At any rate it will not be my fault if they don't 
 * blossom as the rose.' Come out and visit us 
 soon, man, and see the work you had a hand in 
 starting. . . ." 
 
 I am thinking seriously of taking Wardlaw's 
 advice.

 No work of second-rate quality will

 The novel is to-day the popular form of literary art.

 and by the enormous sales of fiction at popular prices. 
 
 While Reprints of fiction may be purchased for [a

 The author of a New Novel loses his larger audience, 
 the public are denied the privilege of enjoying his 
 latest work, because of the prohibitive price of 4s. 6d.

 In another way both author and public are badly 
 served under the present publishing system. At cer- 
 tain seasons a flood of new novels pours from the press. 
 Selection becomes almost impossible. The good novels 
 are lost among the indifferent and the bad. Good 
 service can be done to literature not only by reducing 
 the price of fiction, but by sifting its quality. 
 
 The number of publishers issuing new fiction is so 
 great, that the entrance of another firm into the field

 reprints of fiction in Library Edition at Sevenpence. 
 The success of Nelson's Library has been due to the 
 careful selection of books, regular publication through- 
 out the whole year, and excellence of manufacture at a 
 low cost, due to perfection of machinery. 
 
 Nelson's Sevenpenny Library represents the best that 
 can be given to the public in the way of Reprints under 
 present manufacturing conditions. 
 
 Nelson's New Novels represent the same standard 
 of careful selection, excellence of production, and lowest 
 possible price applied to New Fiction. 
 
 The list of authors of Nelson's New Novels for 1910 
 includes Anthony Hope, E. F. Benson, H. A. Vachell, 
 H. G. Wells, " Q," G. A. Birmingham, John Masefield, 
 Mrs. W. K. Clifford, J. C. Snaith, John Buchan, and 
 Agnes and Egerton Castle. Arrangements for subse- 
 quent volumes have been made with other authors of 
 equally high standing. 
 
 Nelson's New Novels are of the ordinary " six shilling " 
 size, but are produced with greater care than most of 
 their competitors. They are printed in large, clear 
 type, on a fine white paper. They are strongly bound 
 in green cloth with a white and gold design. They are 
 decorated with a pretty end-paper and a coloured 
 frontispiece. All the volumes are issued in bright 
 wrappers. The books are a happy combination of 
 substantial and artistic qualities. 
 
 The price is the very lowest at which a large New 
 Novel with good material and workmanship, and with 
 an adequate return to author, bookseller, and pub- 
 lisher, can be offered to the public at the present time. 
 
 A new volume is issued regularly every month.

 TDescriptive Notes 
 on the Volumes for 19 lo: — 
 
 SECOND STRING. Anthony Hope. 
 
 This brilliant social comedy contains all the qualities 
 which have given Anthony Hope his unique reputation 
 as a historian of modern life. He introduces us to the 
 society of the little country town of Meriton, the trades- 
 people, the loungers in the inn parlour, the neighbouring 
 farmers and squires, and especially to Harry Belfield, 
 the mirror of fashion in the county and candidate for 
 its representation in Parliament. We see also his 
 former school friend, Andy Hayes, who has returned from 
 lumbering in Canada to make a living at home. The 
 motif of the tale is the unconscious competition of the 
 two friends, of whom Andy is very willing to play 
 " second fiddle," did not character and brains force 
 him to the front. The young squire of Halton is too 
 selfish and capricious to succeed, and in spite of his 
 loyalty to friendship, Andy finds himself driven to 
 take his place both in love and in politics. A host of 
 characters cross the stage, and the scene flits between 
 Meriton and London. The book is so light in touch, so 
 shrewd in its observation, so robust and yet so kindly 
 in its humour, that it must be accorded the highest rank 
 among Anthony Hope's works — which is to say, the 
 first place among modern social comedies. 
 
 FORTUNE. /. C. Snaiih. 
 
 Mr. J. C. Snaith is already known to fame by his 
 historical novels, his admirable cricketing story, his 
 essay in Meredithan subtlety " Brooke of Covenden," 
 and his most successful Victorian comedy " Araminta." 
 In his new novel he breaks ground which has never be- 
 fore been touched by an English novelist. He follows 
 no less a leader than Cervantes. His hero, Sir Richard 
 
 V

 Notes on Nelson s New Novels. 
 
 Pendragon, is Sir John FalstafE grown athletic and 
 courageous, with his imagination fired by much ad- 
 venture in far countries and some converse with the 
 knight of La Mancha. The doings of this monstrous 
 Enghshman are narrated by a young and scandalized 
 Spanish squire, full of all the pedantry of chivalry. Sir 
 Richard is a new type in literature — the Rabelaisian 
 Paladin, whose foes flee not only from his sword but 
 from his Gargantuan laughter. In Mr. Snaith's ro- 
 mance there are many delightful characters — a Spanish 
 lady who dictates to armies, a French prince of the 
 blood who has forsaken his birthright for the highroad. 
 But all are dominated by the immense Sir Richard, 
 who rights wrongs like an unruly Providence, and then 
 rides away. 
 
 THE HISTORY OF MR. POLLY. H. G. Wells. 
 
 If the true aim of romance is to find beauty and 
 laughter and heroism in odd places, then Mr. Wells is 
 a great romantic. His heroes are not knights and ad- 
 venturers, not even members of the quasi-romantic 
 professions, but the ordinary small tradesmen, whom 
 the world has hitherto neglected. The hero of the new 
 book, Mr. Alfred PoUy, is of the same school, but he 
 is nearer Hoopdriver than Kipps. He is in the last 
 resort the master of his fate, and squares himself de- 
 fiantly against the Destinies. Unlike the others, he 
 has a literary sense, and has a strange fantastic culture 
 of his own. Mr. Wells has never written anything 
 more human or more truly humorous than the adven- 
 tures of Mr. Polly as haberdasher's apprentice, haber- 
 dasher, incendiary, and tramp. Mr. Polly discovers 
 the great truth that, however black things may be, 
 there is always a way out for a man if he is bold enough 
 to take it, even though that way leads through fire and 
 revolution. The last part of the book, where the hero 
 discovers his courage, is a kind of saga. We leave him 
 in the end at peace with his own soul, wondering dimly 
 about the hereafter, having proved his manhood, and 
 found his niche in life.

 Notes on Nelson's New Novels. 
 
 DAISY'S AUNT. E. F. Benson. 
 
 It Is Mr, Benson's chief merit that, without losing 
 the lightness of touch which makes good comedy, he 
 keeps a firm hold upon the graver matters which make 
 good fiction. The present book is a tale of conspir- 
 acy — the plot of a beautiful woman to save her young 
 niece from a man whom she regards as a blackguard. 
 None of Mr. Benson's women are more attractive than 
 these two, who fight for long at cross-purposes, and end 
 as all honest natures must, with a truer understanding. 
 
 THE OTHER SIDE. H. A. Vachell. 
 
 In this remarkable book Mr. Vachell leaves the beaten 
 highway of romance, and grapples with the deepest 
 problems of human personality and the unseen. It is 
 a story of a musical genius, in whose soul worldliness 
 conquers spirituality. When he is at the height of his 
 apparent success, there comes an accident, and for a 
 little soul and body seem to separate. On his return 
 to ordinary life he sees the world with other eyes, 
 but his clearness of vision has come too late to save his 
 art. He pays for his earlier folly in artistic impotence. 
 The book is a profound moral allegory, and none the 
 less a brilliant romance. 
 
 SIR GEORGE'S OBJECTION. Mrs, W. K. Clifford. 
 Mrs. CUfEord raises the old problem of heredity, and 
 gives it a very modern and scientific answer. It is the 
 story of a woman who, after her husband's disgrace 
 and death, settles with her only daughter upon the shore 
 of one of the Italian lakes. The girl grows up in 
 ignorance of her family history, but when the in- 
 evitable young man appears complications begin. As 
 it happens. Sir George, the father of the lover, holds 
 the old-fashioned cast-iron doctrine of heredity, and 
 the story shows the conflict between his pedantry and 
 the compulsion of fact. It is a book full of serious in- 
 terest for all readers, and gives us in addition a charm- 
 ing love story.

 LADY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING. " Q. 
 
 Sir Oliver Vyell, a descendant of Oliver Cromwell, 
 is the British Collector of Customs at the port of Boston 
 in the days before the American Revolution. While 
 there he runs his head against New England Puritanism, 
 rescues a poor girl who has been put in the stocks for 
 Sabbath-breaking, carries her off, and has her edu- 
 cated. The story deals with the development of Ruth 
 Josselin from a half -starved castaway to a beautiful 
 and subtle woman. Sir Oliver falls in love with his 
 ward, and she becomes my Lady and the mistress of 
 a great house ; but to the New Englanders she remains 
 a Sabbath-breaker and " Lady-Good-for-No thing." The 
 scene moves to Lisbon, whither Sir Oliver goes on 
 Government service, and there is a wonderful picture 
 of the famous earthquake. The book is a story of an 
 act of folly, and its heavy penalties, and also the 
 record of the growth of two characters — one from 
 atheism to reverence, and the other from a bitter 
 revolt against the world to a wiser philosophy. The 
 tale is original In scheme and setting, and the atmos- 
 phere and thought of another age are brilliantly re- 
 produced. No better historical romance has been 
 written in our times.
