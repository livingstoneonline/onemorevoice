  <h5 style="text-align:center;">A CONVERTED BRAHMIN'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF.</h5>
  <p>My father was a respectable Brahmin, with whom I resided till
    some time after my marriage. During that period I studied the
    Brahminical law, and qualified myself for secular employment.
    When I was about twenty-five years old, I resolved to go on a
    pilgrimage to Benares, accompanied by my family. On my way I
    passed through Nassuck, where my wife and child were carried off by
    cholera. This bereavement affected my mind so much that I gave up
    my intention to go to Benares, and returned to Bombay. However, I
    could not forget the heavy loss I had sustained; and, being at last quite&nbsp; overcome with
    grief, I became melancholy. In this state of mind I
    determined to spend my small earnings in visiting some of the most holy
    places of pilgrimage in Hindustan, in order to obtain perfect righteousness
    and peace. Among others I visited the celebrated places Rameshwar,
    Kari, Prayag, Juggernaut, and Kartik Swamy. On the way to these
    places I suffered severe hardships and privations. Notwithstanding all
    this, I could not obtain that purity of heart and peace of mind which I
    was in search of. Everywhere I could observe nothing but deceit, fraud,
    and hypocrisy, and nothing to convince me of the truth and reality of
    the Hindu religion. On my return from Rameshwar I made the
    acquaintance of Suchitanunda, a famous religious teacher and devotee
    in the city of Goomtoor. He convinced me of the vanity and unprofitableness
    of idol-worship and every thing connected with it, and at the
    same time directed me to worship the only invisible God. Although I
    was now fully persuaded of the truth that there exists but one invisible
    and supreme Being, still I had found no peace in my heart. About this
    time I began to reflect on what I had heard from the Missionaries at
    Mangalore and Bombay concerning the Christian religion. I remembered
    that in the Christian religion was enjoined both the worship of the
    invisible God and the necessity of leading a holy life; but, above all, I
    discovered in it that one great truth, that God became man in Christ
    Jesus to save sinners: further, that He made an atonement for the sins
    of mankind and became their surety, and that, by believing in His name,
    and trusting in His merits, we receive forgiveness of our sins and eternal
    redemption at the hands of God. These truths occurring to my mind
    from time to time, brought me to the resolution to embrace Christianity;
    but as yet I did not reveal my intention to any body. Besides, I felt
    very sorry for having lost so much time and strength and money by
    going on pilgrimage, and determined in my mind henceforth no to
    seek the favour of God by engaging in a vain and fruitless pursuit, but
    to employ the ability and talents which God had given me in some
    lawful occupation, in order to receive further instruction in the Christian
    religion, and apply for baptism. With this object in view I arrived at
    Ahmednuggur; and there, in conversation on the Christian religion with
    several of the converts, my few remaining doubts were removed, and my
    desire of becoming a Christian was confirmed. Being informed that the
    Catechist Ram Krishna, whom I had met at Nassuck ten years ago, was
    at present residing in Junir, I took an introduction to him from one of
    his friends and went thither. I immediately opened my mind to
    him, and applied for baptism. On Friday, the 8th of November 1850, I
    came to live on the Mission premises, and made over to Mr. Meng— my
    sacred string, rosary, and ladle, with the following words—I have given
    up the performance of Brahminical rites, and cast myself at the feet of
    Jesus." Having received fuller instruction about the nature and
    importance of baptism, I was admitted into the Church of Christ by
    Mr. Meng—, on Sunday, the 24th of November 1850, and my prayer to
    God is that I may remain unto the end a living member of His Church.</p>
