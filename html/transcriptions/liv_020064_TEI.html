<p class="p ">The <span class="smallcaps ">Chairman</span> then rose, and taking
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jan Tzatzoe</span> by the hand, addressed him to
the following effect:—In the name of this
large meeting, which represents a body still
greater than itself, extending throughout
this kingdom, nay, I may say, throughout
the world, I am happy in giving you the
right hand of fellowship. I congratulate
you, in their name, on what God has been
pleased by his grace to do for you, and
when you return, you will be accompanied
with our warmest prayers that you may be
upheld, and that you may grow in spiritual
strength even unto the end.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="smallcaps "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Jan Tzatzoe</span></span> then stood forward, and
was received with loud expressions of grateful
joy. He addressed the meeting in the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Dutch</span> language to the following effect, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr.
Read, jun.</span> acting as interpreter:—I am
surprised to see so many people assembled
in the house of God. I am happy to have
the opportunity of seeing those <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Christian</span>
friends who sent out <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Vanderkemp</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr.
Philip</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Read</span>, and all the other Missionaries.
I thank God that you sent out
these devoted men, who came to <span class="country" title="A country.">South
Africa</span> when we were shot with bullets,
and when there was nothing but blood-shed
in that ill-fated country. There was nothing
to be seen but the bullet and assagai, the
bow and the arrow; but the word of God
has continued to this day. You must not
be wearied in well-doing; the work is still
great, and the work must be spread in the<br>
<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg left ">56</span> <span class="seg center caps ">Missionary Magazine</span></span>
world. God might convert the world by
his own power, but he employs instruments
to bring men to himself. You must send
us schoolmasters and Missionaries, elevate
us and do us good, and raise subscriptions
for the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Missionary Society</span>. We cannot
allow you to be at rest till this great work
is finished. When we shall have received
the word of God, and shall be in a condition
to send out that word, we will form Missionary
Societies, and we will send forth
the word of God to others. God is great
who has promised it, and he will extend his
word in the world. God is about to do
away with bloodshed and war, and every
thing that is sinful. War is bad, and other
things have been bad, but good is come out
of evil. Who knows, if these things had not
taken place, whether Missionaries would
ever have gone out to that country? If
we wish to serve God we must expect
persecution; we must expect the wicked to
oppose us; but God will surely finish his
own work. When the word of God came
among us we were like the wild beasts,
we knew nothing! we were so wild that
there was nothing but war and bloodshed.
Every one was against his neighbour; there
was no confidence between man and man,
and each man tried to destroy his brother.
The word of God has turned us; the word
of God has brought peace, has reconciled
one man to another, and in us is fulfilled
that text of scripture, "The wolf shall dwell
with the lamb." I thank the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> nation
for what we have received at their
hands. You are our friends; we are your
children. I am like one of your own children.
I have been brought up under the
laws of <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, and I have enjoyed all the
privileges of your missions. When we signed
the treaty with the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">British</span> Government</span> at
the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Buffalo River</span>, a paper was read, which
told us that we then became the children of
the king of <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, and that we were now
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">British</span> subjects. If we are the children of
<span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, and if one with yourselves, let us
enjoy the privileges of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Britons</span>. Many
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Englishmen</span> in the colonies are bad, but I
will hardly believe that those <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Englishmen</span>
belong to you. You are a different race of
men—they are <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">South Africans</span>—they are
not <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Englishmen</span>. I have now seen the
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> nation. I have travelled a little in
this country: I have met with a friendly reception
wherever I have gone; and I can
say you are now my friends. I know my
friends. Do not forget us. Our eyes are
upon you. You are our parents. You
sent us the word of God. I hope you will
still continue to send out that word. I
would thank you for ever having sent <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr.
Philip</span> to our country. This gentleman
never sleeps in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>; he is always doing
good, he is always protecting us. He is
<br>
<br>
our witness; he is a witness of the state of
the colonies, and he is a witness of what
God has done amongst us. He knows what
we have suffered: he suffered with us. He,
like his Master, went about doing good,
although he was persecuted by man. Every
man who wishes to do good must expect
persecution. Could they destroy him, they
would have done it; but they cannot, for he
is in the hand of God. Very few people in
the world love truth: they love darkness.
Truth brings every thing to light; it reveals
what is hidden. But there are very few
people who will allow that they do not love
the truth. They wish to take justice and
injustice in one hand. Every man knows
what is truth, but he wishes to mix the
truth with falsehood. Some people are
afraid to stand out for the truth; other
people won't stand out for the truth; and
others are ashamed of the truth; truth is
the most important thing in the world. It
is honest. Where there is no truth there
is no true honour. We must all adore the
truth—every man. The word of God is
truth. The word of God tells us to do good;
and the word of God tells us to stand on the
truth. We ought to adhere to the truth, and
to stand by the truth. I will not say more.</p>
<p class="p "><span class="smallcaps "><span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Andries Stoffles</span></span> then rose to address
the meeting. He was received with the
most cordial greetings.</p>
<p class="p ">The <span class="smallcaps ">Chairman</span>, taking him by the hand,
thus addressed him:—In the name of this
meeting, and of the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Society">society</u></span>, I congratulate
you on your arrival in this country; but
above all do I congratulate you on the
great blessing which you received in your
own country, through the instrumentality
of the Missionaries sent by this <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization."><u class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Society">society</u></span>. We
are happy in seeing you as a visible token and
evidence of what the power of God can do,
and his grace perform in the hearts of men.</p>
<p class="p ">The <span class="smallcaps "><span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Christian</span> <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span></span> then addressed
the meeting in the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Dutch</span> language,
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Read</span> acting as interpreter. He spoke
nearly as follows:—God has done great
things for <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>, for which we have
reason to be glad. God has done great
things for me, in that I am permitted to address
you on this occasion. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Vanderkemp</span>
and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Read</span> told us that the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>
nation sent us the word of God. I will not
dwell upon what we were before, but I will
tell you what the Bible has done for us.
There are three gentlemen in this country
who are witnesses to what <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Africans</span> were—
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Philip</span>, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Read</span>, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Campbell</span>.
I wish to tell you what the Bible has done
for <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>. What would have become of
the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span> nation, and every <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">black man</span>
in <span class="country" title="A country.">South Africa</span>, had you kept the word of
God to yourselves? When you received
the word of God you thought of other nations
who had not that word. When the<br>
<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg center caps ">For September, 1836.</span> <span class="seg right ">57</span></span>
Bible came amongst us we were naked; we
lived in caves and on the tops of the mountains;
we had no clothes, we painted our
bodies with red paint. At first we were
surprised to hear the truths of the Bible.
The Bible charmed us out of the caves,
and from the tops of the mountains. The
Bible made us throw away all our old
customs and practices, and we lived among
civilized men. We are tame men now.
Now we know there is a God; now we
know we are accountable creatures before
God. But what was our state before the
Bible came? We knew none of these
things. We knew nothing about heaven.
We knew not who made heaven and earth.
The Bible is the only light for every man
that dwells on the face of the earth. I
thank God, in the name of every <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span>—of
all the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span> in <span class="country" title="A country.">South Africa</span>,
that I have seen the face of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Englishmen</span>. I
have been looking whether a <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span>
found his way to this meeting, but I have
looked in vain: I am the only one. I
have travelled with the Missionaries in
taking the Bible to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bushmen</span>, and other
nations. When the word of God has been
preached, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">bushman</span> has thrown away his
bow and arrows. I have accompanied the
Bible to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span> nation, and when the
Bible spoke, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span> threw away his shield
and all his vain customs. I went to <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Latakoo</span>,
and they threw away all their evil
works, they threw away their assagais, and
became the children of God. The only way
to reconcile man to man is to instruct man
in the truths of the Bible. I say again,
the Bible is the light, and where the Bible
comes, the minds of men are enlightened.
Where the Bible is not, there is nothing
but darkness; it is dangerous, in fact, to
travel through such a nation. Where the
Bible is not, man does not hesitate to kill
his fellow; he never even repents afterwards
of having committed murder. I thank you
to-day: I do nothing but thank you to-day.
Are there any of the old <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Englishmen</span> here
who sent out the word of God? I give
them my thanks : if there are not, I give it
to their children. The Bible is still amongst
us. I will not say much. I have told you that
there are three witnesses who came with me,
and they will speak of things. Your Missionaries,
when they came to us, suffered
with us, and they wept with us, and they
struggled for us, till they obtained for us the
charter of our liberties—the fiftieth ordinance.
(The animation with which the last
clause of this sentence was uttered by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Andries
Stoffles</span>, produced a deep sensation
throughout the whole auditory.) When the
fiftieth ordinance was published, we were
then brought to the light. Then did the
young men begin to learn to write and read.
Through that ordinance we got infant-
schools, and our little infants have been instructed,
<br>
<br>
and they are making progress in
learning. You, the posterity of the old <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Englishmen</span>,
I address you on this occasion; I
am standing on the bones of your ancestors,
and I call upon you, their children, to-day,
to come over and help us. Do you know
what we want? We want schools and
school-masters—we want to be like yourselves.
You see before you two men of two different
nations. You who have put your money into
the plates, but who never saw the fruits of
your labours, I stand here before you as the
fruit of your exertions. I thank you again, in
the name of all the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>, that I have
been permitted to speak one word among
you. But I cannot sit down without thanking
you for having sent <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Philip</span>. We
owe much to <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Philip</span> and to the Missionaries
of this <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Society</span>. What we have, we
received by them; and it is the Missionaries
of your <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Society</span> that have done for us so
many great things. I am to thank you
that you did not keep <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Philip</span> in this
country. You sent him out young, and we
have brought him back old. But he is like
a young man in that country; he goes
about to encourage schools, and to see that
the work of education prospers. When
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Philip</span> first commenced his travels, we
did not see the end of his labours. When
he visited the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bushmen</span>, we did not know
why he visited them. I call upon you in
the name of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>, send over men to
help us. We want infant-schools. I see
that the infant-schools will be the greatest
blessing that has ever been conferred on
<span class="country" title="A country.">South Africa</span>. I will tell you a story about
my little grandchild. The little girl came
to me and said, "Grandpapa, do you know
how to make cloth?" I said to her, "Do
you mean to teach me? I have seen <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">white
men</span>, and I do not know how it is made.
How do you know?" She said, "If you
come over to the schools to-morrow we will
tell you, and we will show you how cloth is
made." I felt rather unwilling, but I went
to the school the next day, and I was quite
surprised when I saw it. I have come to
<span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, and I have no time to stop with
you in this country; for I want to go back
and tell the little children in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> I have
seen every thing you told me of. I hope
you will not be wearied in well-sdoing.
Perhaps some may say, "The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>
have had the word of God a long time; they
can do well for themselves." But no, we
cannot do without you. Consider us as
your children, and we will call you our parents.
I will not say much more, yet I must
tell you of one gentleman in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> to whom
the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Society</span> owes much. There is a gentleman
in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span> who has lately become acquainted
with us. When we first saw that
gentleman, we thought that he was only the
friend of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span>, but we find now
that he is the friend of every man. But<br>
<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<span class="fw "><span class="seg left ">58</span> <span class="seg center caps ">Missionary Magazine</span></span>
this man was quite different to every other
man; for the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentots</span> said, he is our
friend; and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Caffre</span> says, he is my
friend; and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> settler says, he is
my friend; and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Dutch</span> <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">boor</span> says, he is
my friend; so that man is the friend of all
men. The name of that gentleman is <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Fairbairn</span>.
I can compare <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Fairbairn</span> to
nothing else but a man having a pair of
scales in his hands, and he throws the white
man in one scale and the black man in the
other, and he makes them equal. I still
continue to thank you, I thank you for
every good <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Englishman</span> who has left this
country. I have only told you what the
Bible has done for others, but I have not told
you what it has done for my own soul. But
I will not say any thing about myself; the
three men whom I have named will tell you
all about me. There is <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Philip</span>, and
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Campbell</span>, and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Read</span>. When your
first Missionaries, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Vanderkemp</span> and
<span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Read</span>, came to us, and when I heard
the bell ring, I did not know what it was. I
thought the people were going to church to
have a meal together. I heard the minister
preaching. I said, "I suppose he is counting."
I listened, and said, "No, he is not
counting." I came to church again the next
day, when I heard the bell ring. The next
time I came to a place of worship the
preacher spoke of every thing that I had
fone from my childhood. I said to myself,
"This is very strange, surely my cousin
must have gone to the Missionary and told
him all about me." My cousin said, "No,
I never spoke about you to the Missionary.
The Bible is that thing that tells you all
about your own heart." Blessed be God, he
has opened my mind, and I have received
the truths of the Bible, and acknowledge
it to be the word of God. I am so convinced
that the Bible is the word of God,
and of the blessings that we derive from it,
that were there any thing I could do for my
own countrymen, I would do it; but it is
the work of God to do it. My nation is
poor and degraded, but the word of God is
their stay and their hope. The word of God
has brought my nation so far, that if a
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span> young lady and an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>
young lady were walking with their faces
from me, I would take them both to be
<span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> ladies. Do instruct us—I say
again, do instruct us! Do not leave us to
ourselves. Hold us under your arm. We
are coming on; we are improving; we will
soon all be one. The Bible makes all nations
one. The Bible brings wild man and
civilized together. The Bible is our light.
The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Hottentot</span> nation was almost exterminated,
but the Bible has brought the
nations together, and here am I before you.
You have the honour, I claim nothing.
You give us your pence and your farthings,
and here am I; I am yours.
