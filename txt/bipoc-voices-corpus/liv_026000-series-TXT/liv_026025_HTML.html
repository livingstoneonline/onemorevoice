  <h5 style="text-align:center;">DESTRUCTIVE FIRE AT ABBEOKUTA.</h5>
  <p>A<small>BBEOKUTA</small> is subject to frequent fires of a very destructive character.
    The materials of the houses, their light and combustible
    roofs, thatched with grass, help the fire to spread, and it extends
    itself with wonderful rapidity, bidding defiance to the efforts of the
    inhabitants. A fearful conflagration, attended not only by loss of
    property, but of life, occurred in March last, of which our native
    catechist, Mr. T. King, gives us the following description—</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%"><em>March 15, 1853</em>—Of all the fires that have
    occurred in this town,
    that of to-day was the greatest. The rapidity that attended its progress,
    and the destruction of lives and property it occasioned, has no equal
    since the commencement of Abbeokuta, and may God in mercy never
    permit the like to happen any more! That more than two-thirds
    of the town was reduced to ashes, and that the number of houses consumed
    on this occasion was not less than a thousand, is not the opinion of
    certain individuals only, but is the general and concurrent assertion of
    everybody. And to affirm that not fewer than sixty persons perished in
    this calamity is no exaggeration whatever, besides many of whose recovery
    there is little hope. The fire having begun at Toko, near the rock
    Olumo, it consumed great part of that district and Ijemo, till it descended
    the range of Olumo, making a clean sweep of all Iporo, Ilawo Ijeun,
    Owu, Obba, Ika—in short, all the Gbagura, the densely-populated parts
    of the town. This fearful accident commenced about eleven <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>.,
    and
    before three <small>P</small>.<small>M</small>. it had completed its horrible work. A very sharp
    and
    acute harmatan wind, which had been blowing about three days,
    greatly facilitated the progress of the fire. At its commencement,
    all our workmen and girls at Owu, and a great number of people that
    came out of their houses, stood viewing it in great anxiety of mind, hoping
    and praying it might not descend to the other side of the rocks, as all were
    fully convinced that, should that be the case, the calamity would be very
    appalling, and such at last it proved to be. Immediately when the fire
    was seen on the other side of the rocks, all of us instantly quitted the
    spot in confused dispersion, running homeward. The passage through
    the Kobiti, my only way home in this part of the town, became impassable,
    and I was obliged to turn my head to Mr. Crowther—s quarter, the
    wind bearing the flakes so rapidly that the fearful leaps the fire made
    were almost incredible. While it was burning by the late Sodeke—s
    house, on a sudden it was found at Owu hill, the central part of Igbagura.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">After it was all over, Mr. Crowther and I went to see
    the converts, who
    were the sufferers, as well as to ascertain how far the ravages extended.
    With the exception of the iron furnace-house, all the houses on that hill
    by our new Station were burnt up. Had our church and dwelling-house
    been already roofed, they might have unavoidably undergone the same
    fate. After visiting Lara, the elder chief of Owu, and many others, we
    came to Basorun—s house, to ascertain whether the furniture of the brass
    gun in his place had escaped the fire, as it is a public property for protection.
    Fortunately, we found the gun with all its materials quite safe.
    From thence we visited Ogubonna. His house, which I had not the
    least expectation of being in the number, shared the same fate, though
    he did not suffer the loss of property, from having good ceiling.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">Besides those who perished in the attempt to save
    their property,
    there were many who were overtaken in their flight from the danger.
    The Ap—na of Ido, a sick and infirm man, together with about four
    individuals who were trying to lead him away, perished. Others,
    who went to walk in the town, met with their unexpected and unhappy
    fate in some of the narrow lanes and roads, where the
    houses are too closely constructed. Some, having carried their children
    to the river side, and returning to the house to save some property,
    perished in that attempt; and the children, in going back to seek
    for their parents, were either suffocated by the smoke, or overtaken by
    flames. Those who perished in endeavouring to save their orisas or
    idols, as well as their animals, were the most of the number. Of all those
    who died in this calamity, the case of two little children was very affecting.
    The parents happened to be absent from home. The younger one
    sleeping in the house, and natural affection did not allow the other to
    run away without trying to awake her; but, alas! these poor children
    not permitted to see their parents any more in this world. Sad
    case indeed! What a cause for thankfulness to our gracious God, that
    not a life was lost among our converts!</p>
