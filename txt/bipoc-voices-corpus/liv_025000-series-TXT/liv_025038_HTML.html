<p"To my Father, Mr. Gill,</p. <p>“Great is my affection towards you and to your wife and family.
Accept my salutations; blessings be with you from our Lord, the Messiah. Amen and Amen. It is I,
Sadaraka, who now write to you; I, whom you, as one of your own children, fed with the good word
of God. True, indeed, I have grown like the tree, age is upon me, my body is feeble, my eyes are
dim; if one be in the distance I cannot tell who it is, he must be near me before I clearly see
who it is. But, my father, I have spent my strength in the work of God, and it is my desire to
spend what strength I have left in the service of our Lord, yes, even unto death; that I may
observe what you so foten exhorted me to do—to be steadfast unto death. I am still living and
working with my other missionary father here, and he feeds me with the word of God, as you also
fed me; and as he exhorts me, even as you also did. I strive to regard and obey. Upon this I say
no more: that is all here. </p>
<p>”I wish to write you to make known the state of our land, from the time you left us to the
present. This is our state: No trouble has grown upon the land save only a few trifles here
and there, just occasionally. It is the same also with the three churches here; no serious
matter 0or trouble has grown, trifles only have now and then been known. Trouble only grows
among the self-willed. With respect to the majority, it is their desire to live by the word of
God; and our missionary is diligent and zealous as he makes known that true word. The deacons
also, on their part, show the same right spirit. The king and tho governors also, on their
part, show great diligence in maintaining the laws and restricting evils, that troubles may
not grow upon the land.</p>
<p> “The great concern of this old generation is to instruct the new generation, that our young
men may hold fast to the true word of God, that it may be a blessing to themselves and to the
generation that may follow them. You will understand the sorrow of my heart when I tell you
that the fathers of the generation with whom you lived so long have nearly all gone the way of
death; but few are left—only nineteen—shall I tell you their names?</p>
<p> "But with respect to these, my father, you will not forget that the outward man faileth.
Some move only with the staff, some abide in the house, but all hold fast to the word of God
which they have received. Many, as I have said, have gone the way of death; these only remain.
My father, I entreat you not to forget this our land in your prayers; and remember especially
our three churches that God would guard His own people, that His rich blessing may never be
taken away, that the glory of God in His precious Gospel may be the glory ever to overshadow
us, tha Ichabod may never be written for us, but that peace and every blessing may abide with
us for ever and for evermore. Amen. </p>
<p>”My father, it is with a feeble and stammering tongue that I am now able to speak, but it is
my joy to know that the word of the kingdom and the love of Jesus are established in our land.
All dwell in peace by night and by day; we rejoice in this. God forbid that the tares of the
enemy should ever be cast into our hearts, and may God grant that the generation to follow us
may be kept steadfast. I often think how sad it would be if the words of Paul should be
fulfilled in this land, when ‘Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
spirits and doctrines of devils;’ and, when I think of this, I call to mind how Jesus beheld
the city of Jerusalem and wept over it. This however is my consolation, that evil will not
grow unless men forget and forsake the word of God. Let us ever pray that God may keep us,
that His kingdom may grow in this land and all other lands throughout the wide, wide world,
that the power of the devil may be broken, that all evil may be conquered, that the kingdoms
of this world may all become the kingdom of our Lord, even of Jesus Christ, and He shall reign
King of kings and Lord of lords, for ever and for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>”This is all, my father, that I have to say. Blessings be with you. It is I, SADARAKA, who
now write.”
