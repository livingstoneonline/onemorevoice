"Not Far from the Kingdom of God"
[...]
[...] One man wrote to 
Mr. Vaughan in these most touching words:—
I am always very thankful to you for your kind
exertions to save my
soul from eternal ruin. I am not one of those who hold that Baptism is
merely an outward ceremony, and not required for our salvation, yet
such is my weakness that I cannot make up my mind to sacrifice a little
earthly comfort for its sake. I am fully aware that I am pursuing a
wrong course, and that if I wait for a "convenient time" that time
may not come to me at all; but what shall I do? I have been delaying
for a long time to confess openly the Saviour to whom alone I look for
salvation. I need nothing to be convinced that I am doing wrong, and
yet I cannot go up boldly to you to receive Baptism.
