<br>this conflict between the two, may be compared to a chronic <span class="word">di-

<br>for years, till an effective remedy, on the other part, is applied
<br>to its cure. The chronic disease being disturbed in its indolent
<br>state, the patient will more or less feel the painful action
<br>of the physic which will as it may be expected make him
<br>uneasy; the disease, being disturbed in its indolent state may
<br>shift its position, as it is said, is experienced in the gout or
<br>rheumatism, till by perservering applications of the medicine,

<br>now as to durability, it looks down with contempt on our

<br>from the opposite side of the river. Having been thus caught
<br>killed and eaten, their bones and skulls were added to the
<br>trophies in the temple. Our native agents were <span class="word">eyewit-
