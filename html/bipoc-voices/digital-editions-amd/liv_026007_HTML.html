  <h3 class="center">KAREPA, OF TE HAWERA.</h3>
  <p class="center">[...]</p>
  <p>"Karepa adhered to your advice, and when he felt a little unwell he
    moved about, and did some light work. In the early part of October he
    dug around and cleared away the grass from the four young apple-trees,
    saying how glad he was to see the trees of his Minister spring and grow.
    His illness increasing, he said he thought he should not recover. He now
    summoned us all to come close around him, and with much love exhorted
    us, talking energetically"&#8212;as was his custom&#8212;"a long while. He said&#8212;</p>
  <p>'You well know that I have brought you from time to time much
    riches. I have obtained for you muskets, powder, hatchets, knives, blankets,
    shirts, spades, &amp;c. I afterward heard of the new riches, called
    Faith. I sought it. I went to Manawatu&#8212;in those days a long and
    perilous journey, for we were surrounded by enemies: no man travelled
    alone. I saw the few Natives who, it was said, had heard of it; but
    they could not satisfy me. I sought further, but in vain. I afterward
    heard of a White Man, called Hadfield, being at Kapiti, at Otaki, and
    that with him was the spring where I could fill my empty and dry calabash.
    I travelled to his place, to Otaki, but in vain: he was gone&#8212;gone
    away ill. I returned to you, my children, darkminded. Many days
    passed by. The snows fell, they melted, they disappeared: the tree-buds
    expanded, and the intricate, entangled paths of our low forests were again
    passable to the foot of the Native Man. At last we heard of another White
    Man, who was going about over mountains and through forests and swamps,
    giving drink from his calabash to the poor secluded native folk&#8212;to the
    remnants of the tribes of the mighty, of the renowned of former days&#8212;now
    dwelling by twos and by threes among the roots of the big trees of
    the ancient forests, and among the long reeds by the rills in the dells!
    Yes, my grandchildren! my and your ancestors once spread over the
    country, as the koitareke <em>(quail)</em> and kiwi <em>(apteryx)</em> once did; but now
    their descendants are even as the descendants of these birds&#8212;scarce, gone,
    dead, fast hastening to utter extinction! Yes, we heard of that White
    Man: we heard of his going over the high snowy range to Patea, up the
    East Coast, all over the rocks to Turakirae. I sent four of my children
    to Mataikona to meet him.<a href="#note1" id="note1back">*</a> They saw his face&#8212;yes,
    you, you talked
    with him. You brought me a drop of water from his calabash. You told
    me he had said he would come to this far-off islet<a href="#note2"
      id="note2back">†</a> to see me. I rejoiced:
    I disbelieved his coming; but I said, he may. I built the Chapel: we
    waited expecting. You slept at nights. I did not. He came: he
    emerged from the long forest: he stood upon Te Hawera ground. I saw
    him: I shook hands with him: we rubbed noses together. Yes, I saw a
    Missionary's face; I sat in his cloth house [tent]; I tasted his new food;
    I heard him talk <em>Maori</em>. My heart bounded within me; I listened; I
    ate his words. You slept at nights. I did not. Yes, I listened; and he told
    me about God and His Son Jesus Christ, and of peace and reconciliation,
    and of a loving Father's home beyond the stars. And now I, too, drank
    from his calabash, and was refreshed. He gave me a book, as well as
    words. I laid hold of the new riches for me and for you; and we have
    it now. My children, I am old; my teeth are gone, my hair is white,
    the yellow leaf is falling from the <em>t?wai</em> tree:<a href="#note3"
      id="note3back">**</a> I am departing. The
    sun is sinking behind the great western hills: it will soon be night. But
    hear me: do you hold fast the new riches&#8212;the great riches&#8212;the true
    riches. We have had plenty of sin and pain and death; and we have
    been teased by many&#8212;by our neighbours and relatives; but we have the
    true riches. Hold fast the true riches which Karepa sight for, for you.'</p>
  <p>"Here he became faint, and ceased talking. We all wept like little
    children around the bed of the dying old man&#8212;of our father. We were
    few in number, and far from human aid or sympathy. The next day he
    expressed a wish that his only son, Huru, might be sent for. He had
    been several weeks absent, roaming about on the Manawata river. The
    messenger went to the nearest villages on the river, and learned that he
    was nearly a week's journey off, so that he could not be fetched in time
    to see his dying father. In two days the messenger returned, and Karepa,
    when he heard that Huru was not come, and considered that he should
    no more see the face of his only son in this world, was for a time very sad;
    but he soon talked again as before, and left instructions for his son. The
    next day the old Chief said, 'My children, I have been dreaming. I
    last night saw my Minister: he was here, smiling upon me, and praying
    intercessory prayers for me. It is well. It is good. Now I know I
    shall go to the world of spirits. It is well. Hold fast the true riches
    when I am gone. God may be merciful to me a sinner!' He now suffered
    much pain, from which he had scarcely any cessation until death relieved
    him. He prayed much and often, under the trees on the edge of the
    wood, going&#8212;in his pain&#8212;from place to place. His prayers, in his exigency,
    were those he had got by heart&#8212;the Collects for Ash-Wednesday,
    the second Sunday in Advent, the second and fourth Sundays in Lent,
    and the first in Communion Service, and the Lord's Prayer. He also
    well knew the daily Collects of Morning and Evening Prayer, with the
    Confession, and Chrysostom's, and St. Paul's Benedictory Prayer: these,
    with the third chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel, the old man always used
    whenever he was obliged to stay away from his Chapel, or to act as Minister.
    His constant prayer was, however, that of the publican, 'God be merciful
    to me a sinner!' He said he should like to see your face once more;
    and straitly charged us to tell you, that, though his body is dead, his
    love for his Minister still lives: this he often repeated. On Sunday, the
    4th of November, while we, the few inhabitants of the village, were at
    School in our little Chapel, Leah, Mikaera's wife"&#8212;who had remained as
    a friend with Azubaha, Caleb's aged wife&#8212;"came running to the Chapel
    to say he was gone! We concluded our School abruptly, and went over
    to the edge of the wood, where the body was: the soul had fled away to
    Jesus' city to dwell with Him. With much grief we paid the last rites.
    In less than a fortnight after, Caleb's only brother, Seth, also an aged
    man, who was in perfect health at this time, had also died; and now, O
    our father! your eyes behold the remnant!"</p>
