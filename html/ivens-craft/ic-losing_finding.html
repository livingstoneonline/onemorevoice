						<p>William Ivens Craft may or may not have joined his family in their efforts at starting a revolutionary co-operative school, as we find only traces of his life throughout the turbulent years he spent in the former slave states. By the start of the 1880s, William Ivens decided to set out on his own, as his parents and siblings faced a new set of challenges from their former friends and co-abolitionists.</p>

						<p>A lack of paper trail makes it difficult to determine whether William Ivens ever joined his family at their home in Georgia. However, one piece of evidence hints that he spent some time in Savannah in 1876. In a letter written later in his life, William Ivens mentions that he was “suffering from my old complaint, rheumatism, superinduced by an attack of Yellow Fever I contracted in 1876 in America” (Craft 1882d). It is likely that William Ivens caught the disease when it erupted viciously in Savannah in August of 1876, killing upwards of one thousand people, infecting thousands more, and forcing even more to flee the city (Georgia Historical Society n.d.).</p>

This is one of 7 images published by this project, all of which exhibit the same material characteristics due to coming from a single album held by the Avery Research Center. This photo of Charles Estlin Philips Craft, William Ivens' eldest brother and the firstborn of the Craft children, as a young man likely depicts him as he looked when he worked with his brothers for the Post Office Rail Service.</p>

						<p>By 1877, the recovering William Ivens had made his way to Florida, where he was reunited with his brother, Charles. The Post Office Rail Services employed William Ivens and Charles in 1877, 1878, and 1879, and they worked as Route Agents between Savannah, Georgia, and Live Oak, Florida, and then later between Savannah and Jacksonville. The brothers made a salary between $900 and $1,000 each year (approximately $26,000 to $29,000 in 2024) (US Department of the Interior 1877, 422; 1879, 33).</p>

No known copyright or restrictions. Though documents and books published by the federal government may seem dry, these records offer critical insights that help researchers reconstruct the lives of people such as William Ivens Craft and his brothers.</p>

						<p>Working for the <a aria-label="External Link" href="https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/in-the-line-of-duty/braving-the-rails">Post Office railways</a> required both skill and nerve. William Ivens and his brother were expected to sort mail on the moving trains and found themselves at risk of train robberies as well as dangerous accidents. The job carried status, however, as indicated by the appearance of the brothers’ names in city directory lists of federal agents. William Ivens and Charles were noted in the 1879 Savannah Directory, as well as the 1880 Savannah Directory, as “Route Agents” for the Railway Mail Service. In 1880, they lived together on the corner of Broughton and Lincoln streets in Savannah, in the rear apartment. Interestingly, Charles’ name was followed by a “<em>c</em>,” marking his race, while no similar marker of race accompanied William Ivens’ name. This bureaucratic inconsistency points to the fungible and fabricated nature of race in the United States – despite its very real material consequences.</p>

Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs: Photography Collection, New York Public Library, New York City, United States. Public domain. A view of Bay Street, Jacksonville, Florida, around 1870 – 1880, where William Ivens craft was enumerated in the 1880 census. This stretch of Bay Street may have been familiar to William Ivens and his brother, Charles, during their stays in Jacksonville at the boarding house of Thomas Baxter, located at 167 Bay Street.</p>

						<p>Working the line from Georgia to Florida, the brothers spent time in the sunshine state. In 1880, they appeared in the US census living in Jacksonville. They boarded with a man named Thomas Baxter. Baxter, whom the US census noted was a mixed-race man, was born in North Carolina around 1850. He worked as a merchant and ran a boarding house at 167 Bay Street. Staying with Baxter and the Craft brothers were three Cuban-born men, and a mixed-race woman named Susan Cranshaw (“1880 US Federal Census” 1880).</p>

						<p>The Craft brothers found themselves among similarly interesting and influential people at their boarding house in Jacksonville. They lived with Thomas Baxter, who helped organize the Athletic Base Ball Club in Jacksonville, a team that participated in the segregated Negro League. Baxter, along with a man named M. J. Christopher, started the club in the 1870s and by 1886 it had joined the League of Southern Colored Base Ballists (Brunson 2019, 50).</p>

E. B. (William Edward Burghardt), 1868-1963. Du Bois albums of photographs of African Americans in Georgia exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900. LOT 11930, no. 337, Library of Congress, Washington, United States. No known restrictions on publication. During his stints in Jacksonville while working for the railroad, William Ivens stayed with baseballer Thomas Baxter. It is unclear whether William Ivens glimpsed the world of the famous Negro League, but it seems likely he at least heard about it while staying with one of the team organizers. One wonders what this young man from London thought of baseball – might he have ever played catch with Baxter?</p>

						<p>Although William Ivens became chummy with baseballers and seems to have had a stable income, he nonetheless decided to return to his home – London. What immediately prompted William Ivens to leave both America and his family to return to England remains one of the biggest questions of this story.</p>

						<p>It is not difficult to imagine, however, that William Ivens Craft was deeply jarred by the racism and difficulties his politically and economically prominent family faced. The Crafts were not merely trying to get by in the war-torn South. Rather, they aimed to uplift those around them and dared to dream a future of freedom, autonomy, and education for Black Americans – while white supremacists violently attempted to reclaim the American South. As William Ivens later expressed in a letter, “there is still an undercurrent of feeling pervading throughout the U.S. against a ‘man of colour’” (Craft 1881b).</p>

						<p>Despite – or perhaps because of – the Craft family’s political visibility and hard work among rural African American communities in Georgia, the Crafts became targets of scrutiny. In 1876, a Boston newspaper alleged that instead of investing the funds he had raised into the school, William Craft lived “on the money he collects… applying it to his own use.” The article asked “Where is his school? Who attends it?” and elicited a response from the Crafts. “Come now, Crafts, and tell us all about it” (Anonymous 1876a). William responded by bringing a libel suit against the Boston firm Naylor and Co., which proved unsuccessful.</p>

							<p class="caption-text">Anonymous, “An Award in Libel Case,” <em>New York Times</em> 27, no. 8375 (July 16, 1878): 1. No known restrictions on publication. The Crafts’ libel suit received great attention from the media. Although they ultimately lost the case as well as status in the eyes of their white former collaborators, much of what we now know about the co-operative school comes from these court proceedings and testimonies, which newspaper editors printed daily.</p>

						<p>During the trial, scholar Barbara McCaskill (2015, 84) points out, “the Crafts’ former sponsors […] helped derail William and Ellen’s southern scheme and muddy William’s character.” These former abolitionists smeared William Ivens’ character as well. It was during the trials – which drew much public attention – that Wendell Phillips recounted his alleged run-in with William Ivens in D.C. William Ivens did not appear as a witness and was thus unable to defend himself from such slander. Forced to pay court costs and half of the referees’ charges, which amounted to $1,000 in 1878 (some $30,000 in 2023), the expense of the lawsuit forced the Crafts to close Woodville school around 1880 (Fradin and Fradin 2006, 92).</p>
