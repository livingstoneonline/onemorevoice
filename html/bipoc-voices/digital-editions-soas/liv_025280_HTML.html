  <h4 style="text-align:center">A LETTER FROM ROBERT MASHABA.</h4>
  <p>READERS of the NOTICES who have followed our missionary history, will not have forgotten the
    story of the Rev. Robert Mashaba, who, long years ago, was deported by the Portuguese Government
    from Delagoa Bay for supposed complicity in political intrigues, and until last year was a
    prisoner in the Cape Verde Islands. Many were the prayers offered for his release, many the
    messages of cheer sent to him in his exile; and last year, through the good offices of
    Ambassadors in London and Lisbon, he was at length released and permitted to return to South
    Africa, though not to Delagoa Bay. He is now stationed at Johannesburg, whence he writes a
    letter which we print in all the simplicity of his own touching language. </p>
  <p>DEAR SIR,&#8212;Now that I am somewhat settled, I beg to offer, through the medium of your valuable
    and far-read periodical, my hearty thanks to all the Christendom. It may seem strange that I
    have not done this before then; it happened so not through unmindfulness and ungratefulness, but
    having done a part of this necessary obligation, I thought it better to delay this until I was
    more settled.</p>
  <p>During all the time I was in exile in the Isle of Fogo, in the Cape Verde Archipelago, I have
    experienced how strong are the bonds of brotherhood in Christ, for there are brethren who not
    only did pray, but worked almost to self-sacrifice for my release, approaching the authorities,
    providing for my needs and for all my general comfort.</p>
  <p>It would be useless for me to attempt to give a list of sympathisers and those who took special
    interest in my case, in a brief letter like this. Let it suffice to say, besides my Methodist
    fathers and brethren, I had a host of outside friends and sympathisers.</p>
  <p>May I, now, in conclusion, beg these brethren not to discontinue their prayers&#8212;not now for my
    release, although it is quite true that I am still in exile, for I am not allowed to go back to
    my country&#8212;but for those who are still in the bonds of sin.</p>
  <p>The Transvaal is not an easy field to work in; surrounded by difficulties and temptations, it
    wants a man supported by Christian prayer. In Johannesburg one of the greatest difficulties is
    that of the languages. Fancy a preacher using three languages every time that he is in the
    pulpit! All preaching, singing, and praying, must be done in three languages through
    interpreters, and it is not so easy to get good interpreters in all these languages. You don't
    have such polyglot yonder! have you? In anticipation, I thank you for inserting the above.</p>
  <p style="text-align:right">Your obedient servant,</p>
  <p style="text-align:right">ROBERT N. MASHABA.</p>
