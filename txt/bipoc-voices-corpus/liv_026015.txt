LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE FROM THE BEREAVED FLOCKOF THE LATE REV.
J.J. WEITBRECHT.
[...]
Burdwan Mission, March 10, 1852.
DEAR CHRISTIAN FRIENDS&#8212;With deep regret and
unspeakable sorrow
we now announce the death of our faithful, honourable, and beloved
minister and friend, Mr. Weitbrecht, who forsook his sweet native country,
dear relatives, and kind friends, and spent many years amongst us,
in order to preach the blessed Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ in this benighted heathen land of ours. He, in order to hold a
Missionary Conference in Calcutta, left us in a strong, lively, and healthy
frame of body, sincerely hoping to return within a few days; and we ourselves
hoped so too, for we never expected or thought he would leave us
for the next world so soon. But, alas! a few days after, we heard, to our
great grief and surprise, that he had slept in his dear Saviour Christ, whom
he loved so much in this life. Ah, dear friends! you cannot, we think,
conceive what deep sorrow and heartrending anguish we felt when this
melancholy and mournful intelligence reached us. There was a general
weeping and a long lamentation in the whole Christian village for this
kind, generous, and sympathizing pastor and friend. It has, indeed,
been well for him that he has gone to his beloved Saviour, for he is now
in perfect joy and happiness. But it is a great loss to us, who will
scarcely, or perhaps never, get another such kind and feeling master and
minister as Mr. Weitbrecht was; for having continued with him, some
seventeen years, some twelve years, and others eight or nine years, we can
all well testify his Christian character. Though we repeatedly offended
and grieved him by our misbehaviour, he never reproved or punished
us but with paternal affection and love. He behaved so properly towards
every person, that we gave him among ourselves the name of physiognomist,
or knower of characters.
What shall we say about his love to his fellow-creatures? If any
were taken ill at any time, he would kindly carry him medicine, against
all difficulties and inconveniences. Oh, how often did we see him go in
the rain, under the burning sun, and at twelve in the night, to administer
physic to the sick folk! When any one fell into any distress or misery,
he assisted him in his usual kindness and benevolence.
As to his manner of preaching, and his conduct as a Christian pastor,
we cannot describe them in words. The words he used in his discourses
would strike and pierce into the hearts of hearers like a winged arrow.
This we all know from our personal experience, and shall never forget.
God grant, in His infinite mercy and ineffable bounty, that we may
receive another such qualified and worthy pastor to take care of His
tender flock.
His humility during the past two years filled every body with
wonder. We frequently said to one another, "Our Sahib has now
humbled himself to the dust: nothing fierce can now be seen in him.
Ah! this is truly the character of a really converted and renewed soul."
When we look at the poor orphan children we feel very sorry. Who
will so kindly support them as he did? Many of them say, with a hearty
sob, "Why did not two or three of us die instead of our dear benefactor,
who, if he remained alive, would tenderly beg and raise subscriptions
for our maintenance? Still, God has mercifully left us a patroness and
friend in Mrs. Weitbrecht, who is also very kind and affectionate, and
she will surely do much good to the Mission."
Besides, the heathen that dwell around us are also shedding tears for
our late pastor's kind treatment and love, because, when they were unjustly
oppressed by police people, Mr. Weitbrecht would, notwithstanding
they are idolaters, deliver them from their distress by threatening the
annoyers. Thus they were so much attached to him.
He preached this year to the heathen as diligently and as zealously as
ever. He went through jungles, towns, and villages, carrying the healing
balm to the sick and dead in sin and trespasses. When discoursing,
either with the Hindus or Mohammedans, he frequently took his passage
for his subject, viz. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath
anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal
the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering
of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach
the acceptable year of the Lord"&#8212;Luke iv. 18, 19&#8212;and told them that,
if they were not prepared and sanctified before death, they should
never enter into heaven.
On Sunday evening, the 29th of February, he delivered a beautiful
sermon to a vast congregation in Calcutta. His text was almost the last
verse of the last chapter of the Book of the Revelation, namely, "Surely
I come quickly; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." Rev. xxxii. 20.
After returning home he was taken with cholera morbus, and, in spite of
all cares, troubles, prayers, and tears on the part of his beloved wife and
other kind friends, he was summoned away, after an illness of ten hours,
by his ever-faithful and blessed Lord Jesus Christ, to live and reign with
Him for eternity.
Thus you see, dear friends, that till his death our valuable minister
continued faithful to Him who shed His precious blood for him on the
cross. Now, let us conclude by warmly requesting you all to assist us,
who are in every way helpless and miserable, with your incessant prayers
to Him who is the Giver of every good and perfect gift, and who is
really able to heal the wound He has made, to favour us with a kind,
worthy, and bounteous pastor, such as we have just lost, according to His
wise and holy will.
With best regards and most sincere wishes for your welfare, both in
this world and in the next,
We remain, your's truly,
