  <p>MY DEAR FRIENDS, ï¿½I, Tooloosee, your affectionate friend, send you many salams. By the favour
    of God I attend the Mission school at Bellary supported by you, and endeavour to learn my
    lessons well. I read the Word of God daily, and every Sabbath morning I repeat my lessons for
    the week. I also give up my lessons to dear Mrs. Wardlaw at her house. She is very kind to me
    and to all my school-fellows. My father and mother are exceedingly delighted to find that I am
    making progress in my learning. I am a poor girl; therefore I beg you will look with pity on me,
    and favour me with your support. Luke xviii, 13: "God be merciful to me a sinner." With many
    salams,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">Yours affectionately,<br>
    TOOLOOSEE</p>
