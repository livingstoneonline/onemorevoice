  <p>"We do not want you to receive what we offer on our mere word. We
    have tried the power of this medicine for the sin of the world, and, having
    found it effectual to ourselves, offer it to you. Look at me. I was formerly
    a great liar, and was always deceiving and telling lies in my trade.
    I was also little conscious that in doing so I was committing great sin.
    This word came to me. As I received it, and understood it, I learned to
    hate lying. Still, I did not at once abandon it, as the habit was so
    strong. But as I learned still more and more, and prayed more and
    more, and knew the death of Christ for sin more and more thoroughly,
    I was enabled to leave off the sin. I do not say that I am yet free from
    the sin; but this I say, that if I lie I sincerely repent of it, and am made
    very unhappy till I have obtained pardon. And so, likewise, with other
    sins. I do not say that I am perfect; but I do say that I have actually
    left off those sins which formerly I practised, so that if I were to do what
    is sinful I should be rendered miserable.</p>
  <p>"Now, I never learned purity from reading about Krishna's wicked
    conduct, as recorded in the Shasters. I never learned to hate any sin,
    from all my knowledge of the gods of India, but from this word. The
    word of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of sinners, who died for us, I have
    learned, and hope to go on learning till I shall be taken away from sin
    altogether."</p>
