<p>The following is the reply of David Taiwanga [To Chief Reweti Maika, on his request for a church bell; see Maika, Reweti, "To the Elders of the Curch"], one of the oldest
of the Christian Natives in New Zealand—

<p>It was in this year of Jubilee that your Letter came to our Minister, 
Mr. Davis. He is wise in looking into our sins, and in proclaiming to 
us the Word of God. Mr. Marsden was the first messenger to us wicked 
people of New Zealand: the second messengers were Mr. Williams and 
Mr. Davis: these are the elders of the Church in this country. The 
desire of my heart with regard to your words is, that I may seriously 
consider them in my mind: the consideration must be an inward one. 
And I pray to the Father to help me—to give me earnestness in prayer to 
Him, and the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. I rejoice at your words, 
which come, through you, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who is 
the director of all things in heaven and earth. You are the sanctified 
people of that God. Jehovah has chosen you to devise means whereby 
His Word may be disseminated. My heart's desire is, to bow down and 
cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner," a sinful man. O God, Thou hast 
seen, Thou knowest my ignorance, nor are my sins hid from Thee! 
"Search me, and see if there be any wicked way in me." I will smite 
upon my breast and say, "God be merciful to me a sinner." Yes, you 
shall behold me, and I shall behold you, at the last day, although some 
are living in the north, south, east, and west.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">From your loving Friend,<br>
D<small>AVID</small> T<small>AIWANGA</small>.</p></div>
