<h5 style="text-align: center;">THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF POONAPUN, A HEATHEN, BAPTIZED ON FEBRUARY 17, 1850, BY THE NAME OF NATHANIEL.</h5>

<p>"I was born at Madras in 1833, of heathen parents, and from my infancy was brought up in the superstitions and follies of idolatry. I followed the vain customs and manners of my fellow-idolaters, and wholly gave myself up to the pleasures of this sinful world, and was quite indifferent to the consequences of such a course till 1848; when God, who is rich in mercy, had compassion on me, and, though I was ignorant of Him, yet, by His kind providence, so ordered that I should be employed as a <em>maty</em> in the service of the Rev. Mr. Wardlaw, when I was led to read the blessed gospel, and attend the services of the sanctuary, and in course of time felt in some measure impressed as to the truth of Christianity, and the folly and sin of idolatry. About this time, through temptation, I fell into sin; and, after some time elapsed, I was united in matrimony to a young woman connected with the church and congregation assembling at the Mission Chapel. After my marriage, I entered into the employ of a pious doctor, located in the cantonment, and attended the Tamil services held at the Rev. J. Shrieves' house, and was instructed at my house by Lazarus, catechist; when I was led deeply to feel and lament my lost and miserable condition, and my need of salvation: consequently, I went to Mr. Shrieves, and was duly instructed from time to time in the doctrines and precepts of the gospel; and, having cast myself at the foot of the cross, and sought the mercy of the Lord with weeping and supplication, I obtained peace and joy, and on February 17, 1850, before the church and congregation, I was questioned relative to my knowledge and experience by the Rev. J. Shrieves, and baptized in the name of the Triune Jehovah, and admitted into church-fellowship. May the Lord enable me to glorify Him by a consistent walk and conversation to the end of my life! to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."</p>
