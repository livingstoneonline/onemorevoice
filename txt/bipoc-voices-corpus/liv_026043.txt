  Gleanings from Recent Letters.
  
  [...]
  A Conversation with Yoruba Market Women.
  From a journal recently received from the Rev. James White, Native Pastor at Otta, in the
    Yoruba Country, we extract the following. The concluding sentence is a striking illustration of
    John iv. 34:&#8212;
  
    Nov. 20th, 1873&#8212;To-day I went out, and,
      calling at a market-place
      where a few women were vending their articles, I walked up to them,
      and, having saluted them, I accused them of hatred against God, and
      grounded my charge on the fact of their obstinate refusal to enter into
      the House of God. Unwilling to admit so grave a charge they denied it,
      and declared that, far from hating God, they served Him according to the
      manner laid down by their ancestors. I asked them, "Which is right in
      paying homage to a king or chief: to go to his house, or to sit at home?"
      "The former is right," they replied. "If, then, you wish to serve God,"
      I replied, "go to the house that is called by His name, and upon the
      day set apart for that purpose. As regards the manner of the worship
      of our forefathers, our forefathers have erred; and this," I said, "I
      could prove to them." I then asked, "To get the best and purest water,
      where should we go&#8212;to the fountain-head, or the running stream, which
      is made foul and turbid by the crossing and re-crossing of many individuals?" "To the
      fountain-head," they said. "If, then," continued I,
      "you wish to know whether idolatry&#8212;the religion of our forefathers&#8212;
      is right or wrong, let us go back to the fountain-head. You will agree
      with me that all your idols were originally human beings, who, having ac-
      quired a great fame during their lifetime, either by their valour or other
      merits, were deified after their death." "Yes," they said. "Again, your
      fathers and mothers are worshipped as gods after their death." "Yes,"
      they answered. "The worship of your fathers, then, or of the idols made
      to represent them, could not have existed before anything like death is
      known." They admitted this statement. "The tradition of our forefathers say (and it is consonant
      with what the Word of God declares),
      that the whole world originated from one man and one woman, who were
      not born as other earthly parents, but made by God." They answered in
      the affirmative. "Having known no other parent than God, whom did
      they serve and worship?" "God," they replied. "But that God," I continued, "has never since been
      dead, neither can He nor will He ever die."
      "True," they said. "Do you see, then, that the worship of the one
      true God, which we come to teach, is the very same which existed at the
      beginning of the world, and that it is prior to the worship of idols, which
      commenced after men began to die?" "Yes," replied they, but rather
      coolly. "I have led you to the very fountain," I said, "and shown you
      that the worship of the one true God, the Creator of all things, is
      the religion which existed at the beginning of the world; and if that be
      the fountain-head, then none but those who draw water from the fountain
      have the purest water, and no other religion but the worship of the one
      true God is right. Other systems, therefore, must be wrong. All who
      worship idols are only drawing water from a foul and turbid stream
      occasioned by the depravity of the human race."
    Convinced of the force of my argument, but not
      willing to give in,
      they all raised up loud acclamations as if to confound me&#8212;one saying
      one thing, and another another thing. Some said they would have
      become Christians were we not subject to death as well as they, but
      since none is exempted from death, they would prefer remaining in their
      own religion.
    I took no breakfast before leaving home, not having
      made up my mind
      to remain out so long; but the whole of the time that I was engaged in
      discussion with these people, I felt no pinch of hunger whatever&#8212;I felt
      it such a pleasure and delight to be able to make manifest to them the
      hidden things of God.
