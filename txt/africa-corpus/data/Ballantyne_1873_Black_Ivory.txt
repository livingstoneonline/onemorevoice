MAIN
PREFACE.
In writing this book, my aim has been to give a
true picture in outline of the Slave-Trade as it exists
at the present time on the east coast of Africa.
In order to this, I have selected from the most
trustworthy sources what I believe to be the most
telling points of " the trade," and have woven these
together into a tale, the warp of which is composed
of thick cords of fact; the woof of slight lines of
fiction, just sufficient to hold the fabric together.
Exaggeration has easily been avoided, because—as
Dr. Livingstone says in regard to the slave-trade-
"exaggeration is impossible."
If the reader's taste should be offended by find-
ing the tragic and comic elements in too close
proximity, I trust that he will bear in remembrance
that "such is life," and that the writer who would
be true to life must follow, not lead, nature.
I have to acknowledge myself indebted to Dr.

PREFACE.
Ryan, late Bishop of Mauritius ; to the Rev. Charles
New, interpreter to the Livingstone Search Expedi-
tion; to Edward Hutchinson, Esq., Lay Secretary
to the Church Missionary Society, and others, for
kindly furnishing me with information in connexion
with the slave-trade.
Besides examining the Parliamentary Blue-books
which treat of this subject, I have read or consulted,
among others, the various authoritative works to
which reference is made in the foot-notes sprinkled
throughout this book,—all of which works bear the
strongest possible testimony to the fact that the
horrible traffic in human beings is in all respects as
bad at the present time on the east coast of Africa
as it ever was on the west coast in the days of
Wilberforce.
I began my tale in the hope that I might produce
something to interest the young (perchance, also, the
old) in a most momentous cause,—the total aboli-
tion of the African slave-trade. I close it with the
prayer that God may make it a tooth in the file
which shall eventually cut the chain of slavery, and
set the black man free.

BLACK IVORY.
CHAPTER L.
BHOWS THAT A GOOD BEGINNING MAY SOMETIMES BE FOLLOWED BY
A BAD ENDING.
"Six feet water in the hold, sir !"
That would not have been a pleasant announce-
ment to the captain of the 'Aurora' at any time,
but its unpleasantness was vastly increased by the
fact that it greeted him near the termination of
what had been, up to that point of time, an exceed-
ingly prosperous voyage.
. "Are you sure, Davis ?" asked the captain ; "try
again."
He gave the order under the influence of that
feeling which is styled "hoping against hope," and
himself accompanied the ship's carpenter to see it
obeyed.
"Six feet two inches," was the result of this
I investigation.
The vessel, a large English brig, had sprung a

BLACK IVORY.
leak, and was rolling heavily in a somewhat rough
sea off the east coast of Africa. It was no consola-
tion to her captain that the shores of the great con-
tinent were visible on his lee, because a tremendous
surf roared along the whole line of coast, threaten-
ing destruction to any vessel that should venture to
approach, and there was no harbour of refuge nigh.
"She's sinking fast, Mr. Seadrift," said the captain
to a stout, frank-looking youth of about twenty
summers, who leant against the bulwarks and gazed
wistfully at the land ; "the carpenter cannot find
the leak, and the rate at which the water is rising
shows that she cannot float long."
"What then do you propose to do?" inquired
young Seadrift, with a troubled expression of coun-
tenance.
"Abandon her," replied the captain.
"Well, you may do so, captain, but I shall not
forsake my father's ship as long as she can float.
Why not beach her somewhere on the coast ? By
so doing we might save part of the cargo, and, at all
events, shall have done the utmost that lay in our
power."
"Look at the coast," returned the captain ; "where
would you beach her? No doubt there is smooth
water inside the reef, but the channels through it,
if there be any here, are so narrow that it would be
almost certain death to make the attempt."


## p. 3 (#21) ###############################################

BLACK IVORY.
The youth turned away without replying. He
was sorely perplexed. Just before leaving England
his father had said to him, "Harold, my boy, here's
your chance for paying a visit to the land you've
read and talked so much about, and wished so often
to travel through. I have chartered a brig, and
shall send her out to Zanzibar with a cargo of beads,
cotton cloth, brass wire, and such like : what say
you to go as supercargo ? Of course you won't be
able to follow in the steps of Livingstone or Mungo
Park, but while the brig is at Zanzibar you will have
an opportunity of running across the channel, the
island being only a few miles from the main, and
having a short run up-country to see the niggers,
and perchance have a slap at a hippopotamus.
I'll line your pockets, so that you won't lack the
sinews of war, without which travel either at home
or abroad is but sorry work, and I shall only expect
you to give a good account of ship and cargo on
your return.—Come, is it fixed ?"
Need we say that Harold leaped joyfully at the
proposal ? And now, here he was, called on to
abandon the 'Aurora' to her fate, as we have said,
near the end of a prosperous voyage. No wonder
that he was perplexed.
The crew were fully aware of the state of matters.
By the captain's orders they stood ready to lower
the two largest boats, into which they had put as

much of their worldly goods and provisions as they
could hold with safety.
"Port, port your helm," said the captain to the
man at the wheel.
"Port it is, sir," replied the man at the wheel,
who was one of those broad-shouldered, big-chested,
loose-garmented, wide-trousered, bare-necked, free-
and-easy, off-hand jovial tars who have done so much,
in years gone by, to increase the wealth and pros-
perity of the British Empire, and who, although
confessedly scarce, are considerately allowed to
perish in hundreds annually on our shores for want
of a little reasonable legislation. But cheer up,
ye jolly tars! There is a glimmer of sunrise on
your political horizon. It really does seem as if,
in regard to you, there were at last "a good time
coming."
"Port, port," repeated the captain, with a glance
at the compass and the sky.
" Port it is, sir," again replied the jovial one.
"Steady! Lower away the boat, lads.—Now,
Mr. Seadrift," said the captain, turning with an air
of decision to the young supercargo, "the time has
come for you to make up your mind. The water is
rising in the hold, and the ship is, as you see, set-
tling fast down. I need not say to you that it is
with the utmost regret I find it necessary to abandon
her; but self-preservation and the duty I owe to

BLACK IVORY.
my men render the step absolutely necessary. Do
you intend to go with us?"
"No, captain, I don't," replied Harold Seadrift
firmly. "I do not blame you for consulting your
own safety, and doing what you believe to be your
duty, but I have already said that I shall stick by
the ship as long as she can float."
"Well, sir, I regret it, but you must do as you
think best," replied the captain, turning away-
"Now, lads, jump in,"
The men obeyed, but several of those who were
last to quit the ship looked back and called to the
free-and-easy man who still stood at the wheel,-
"Come along, Disco; we'll have to shove off directly."
"Shove off w'en you please," replied the man at
the wheel, in a deep rich voice, whose tones were
indicative of a sort of good-humoured contempt;
"wot I means for to do is to stop where I am. It'll
never be said of Disco Lillihammer that he forsook
the owner's son in distress."
"But you 'll go to the bottom, man, if you don't
come."
" Well, wot if I do? I'd raither go to the bottom
with a brave man, than remain at the top with a set
o'fine fellers like you !"
Some of the men received this reply with a laugh,
others frowned, and a few swore, while some of them
looked regretfully at their self-willed shipmate; for

BLACK IVORY.
it must not be supposed that all the tars who float
upon the sea are of the bold, candid, open-handed
type, though we really believe that a large propor-
tion of them are so.
Be this as it may, the boats left the brig, and
were soon far astern.
"Thank you, Lillihammer," said Harold, going up
and grasping the horny hand of the self-sacrificing
sea-dog. "This is very kind of you, though I fear
it may cost you your life. But it is too late to talk
of that; we must fix on some plan, and act at once."
"The werry thing, sir," said Disco quietly, "that
wos runnin' in my own mind, 'cos it's werry
clear that we hain't got too many minits to spare
in confabilation."
"Well, what do you suggest ?".
" Arter you, sir," said Disco, pulling his forelock;
"you are capting now, an' ought to give orders."
"Then I think the best thing we can do," rejoined
Harold, "is to make straight for the shore, search
for an opening in the reef, run through, and beach
the vessel on the sand. What say you ?"
"As there's nothin' else left for us to do," replied
Disco, " that's 'zactly wot I think too, an' the sooner
we does it the better."
springing forward," and I'll ease off the sheets."
In a few minutes the "Aurora' was surging

BLACK IVORY.
before a stiff breeze towards the line of foam which
indicated the outlying reef, and inside of which all
was comparatively calm.
"If we only manage to get inside," said Harold,
"we shall do well."
Disco made no reply. His whole attention was
given to steering the brig, and running his eyes
anxiously along the breakers, the sound of which
increased to a thunderous roar as they drew near.
"There seems something like a channel yonder,"
said Harold, pointing anxiously to a particular spot
in the reef.
"I see it, sir," was the curt reply.
A few minutes more of suspense, and the brig
drove into the supposed channel, and struck with
such violence that the foremast snapped off near
the deck, and went over the side.
." God help us, we 're lost !" exclaimed Harold, as
a towering wave lifted the vessel up and hurled her
like a plaything on the rocks.
"Stand by to jump, sir," cried Disco.
Another breaker came roaring in at the moment,
overwhelmed the brig, rolled her over on her beam-
ends, and swept the two men out of her. They
struggled gallantly to free themselves from the
wreck, and, succeeding with difficulty, swam across
the sheltered water to the shore, on which they
finally landed.


## p. 8 (#26) ###############################################

BLACK IVORY.
Harold's first exclamation was one of thankful-
ness for their deliverance, to which Disco replied
with a hearty " Amen!" and then turning round and
surveying the coast, while he slowly thrust his hands
into his wet trouser-pockets, wondered whereabouts
in the world they had got to.
"To the east coast of Africa, to be sure," observed
the young supercargo, with a slight smile, as he
wrung the water out of the foot of his trousers, "the
place we were bound for, you know."
"Werry good; so here we are—come to an anchor!
Well, I only wish," he added, sitting down on a piece
of driftwood, and rummaging in the pockets before
referred to as if in search of something—"I only wish
I'd kep' on my weskit, 'cause all my 'baccy's there,
and it would be a rael comfort to have a quid in the
circumstances."
It was fortunate for the wrecked voyagers that
the set of the current had carried portions of their
vessel to the shore, at a considerable distance from
the spot where they had landed, because a band of
natives, armed with spears and bows and arrows,
had watched the wreck from the neighbouring
heights, and had hastened to that part of the coast on
which they knew from experience the cargo would
be likely to drift. The heads of the swimmers
being but small specks in the distance, had escaped
observation. Thus they had landed unseen. The

BLACK IVORY.
spot was near the entrance to a small river or creek,
which was partially concealed by the formation of
the land and by mangrove trees.
Harold was the first to observe that they had not
been cast on an uninhabited shore. While gazing
round him, and casting about in his mind what was
best to be done, he heard shouts, and hastening to a
rocky point that hid part of the coast from his view
looked cautiously over it and saw the natives. He
beckoned to Disco, who joined him.
"They haven't a friendly look about 'em," ob-
served the seaman, "and they're summat scant in
the matter of clothin'."
" Appearances are often deceptive," returned his
companion, "but I so far agree with you that I
think our wisest course will be to retire into the
woods, and there consult as to our future proceedings,
for it is quite certain that as we cannot live on sand
and salt water, neither can we safely sleep in wet
clothes or on the bare ground in a climate like this."
Hastening towards the entrance to the creek, the
unfortunate pair entered the bushes, through which
they pushed with some difficulty, until they gained
a spot sufficiently secluded for their purpose, when
they observed that they had passed through a belt
of underwood, beyond which there appeared to be
an open space. A few steps further and they came
out on a sort of natural basin formed by the creek,

in which floated a large boat of a peculiar construc-
tion, with very piratical-looking lateen sails. Their
astonishment at this unexpected sight was increased
by the fact that on the opposite bank of the creek
there stood several men armed with muskets, which
latter were immediately pointed at their breasts.
The first impulse of the shipwrecked friends was
to spring back into the bushes—the second to ad-
vance and hold up their empty hands to show that
they were unarmed.
"Hold on," exclaimed Disco, in a free and easy
confidential tone ; " we're friends, we are; ship-
wrecked mariners we is, so ground arms, my lads,
an' make your minds easy."
One of the men made some remark to another,
who, from his Oriental dress, was easily recognised
by Harold as one of the Arab traders of the coast.
His men appeared to be half-castes.
The Arab nodded gravely, and said something
which induced his men to lower their muskets.
Then with a wave of his hand he invited the
strangers to come over the creek to him.
This was rendered possible by the breadth of the
boat already mentioned being so great that while one
side touched the right bank of the creek the other
was within four or five feet of the left.
Without hesitation Harold Seadrift bounded
lightly from the bank to the half-deck of the

11
boat, and stepping ashore walked up to the Arab,
closely followed by his companion.
"Do you speak English ?" asked Harold.
The Arab shook his head and said, "Arabic,
Portuguese."
Harold therefore shook his head ;—then, with a
hopeful look, said " French ? interrogatively.
The Arab repeated the shake of his head, but
after a moments' thought said, "I know littil Eng-
leesh ; speak, where comes you ?".
"We have been wrecked," began Harold (the
Arab glanced gravely at his dripping clothes, as if to
say, I had guessed as much), "and this man and I
are the only survivors of the crew of our ship-at
least the only two who swam on shore, the others
went off in a boat.".
"Come you from man-of-war ?" asked the Arab,
with a keen glance at the candid countenance of the
youth.
"No, our vessel was a trader bound for Zanzibar.
She now lies in fragments on the shore, and we
have escaped with nothing but the clothes on our
backs. Can you tell us whether there is a town or
a village in the neighbourhood ? for, as you see, we
stand sadly in need of clothing, food, and shelter.
We have no money, but we have good muscles and
stout hearts, and could work our way well enough, I
doubt not."

BLACK IVORY.
Young Seadrift said this modestly, but the
remark was unnecessary, for it would have been
quite obvious to a man of much less intelligence
than the Arab that a youth who, although just
entering on the age of manhood, was six feet high,
deep-chested, broad-shouldered, and as lithe as a
kitten, could not find any difficulty in working his
way, while his companion, though a little older, was
evidently quite as capable.
"There be no town, no village, for fifty miles fro
where you stand," replied the Arab.
"Indeed !" exclaimed Harold in surprise, for he
had always supposed the east African coast to be
rather populous.
"That's a blue look-out anyhow," observed Disco,
" for itnecessitates starvation, unless this good
gentleman will hire us to work his craft. It ain't
very ship-shape to be sure, but anything of a sea-
goin' craft comes more or less handy to an old salt.".
The trader listened with the politeness and pro-
found gravity that seems to be characteristic of
Orientals, but by no sign or expression showed
whether he understood what was said.
"I go to Zanzibar," said he, turning to Harold,
"and will take you,—so you wish."
There was something sinister in the man's manner
which Harold did not like, but as he was destitute,
besides being in the Arab's power, and utterly igno-

13
rant of the country, he thought it best to put a good
face on matters, and therefore thanked him for his
kind offer, and assured him that on reaching Zanzi-
bar he would be in a position to pay for his passage
as well as that of his friend.
"May I ask," continued Harold, "what your
occupation is ?"
"I am trader."
Harold thought he would venture another ques-
tion:-
"In what sort of goods do you trade ?"
" Ivory. Some be white, an' some be what your
contrymans do call black."
"Black !" exclaimed Harold, in surprise.
"Yees, black," replied the trader. "White ivory do
come from the elephant-hims tusk; Black Ivory do
come"-he smiled slightly at this pointa"from the
land everywheres. It bees our chef artikil of trade."
"Indeed! I never heard of it before."
"No ?" replied the trader; "you shall see it much
here. But I go talk with my mans. Wait."
Saying this, in a tone which savoured somewhat
unpleasantly of command, the Arab went towards a
small hut, near to which his men were standing, and
entered into conversation with them.
It was evident that they were ill pleased with
what he said at first, for there was a good deal of
remonstrance in their tones, while they pointed


## p. 14 (#32) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
frequently in a certain direction which seemed to
indicate the coast-line; but by degrees their tones
changed, and they laughed and chuckled a good
deal, as if greatly tickled by the speech of the
Arab, who, however, maintained a look of dignified
gravity all the time. "
"I don't like the looks o' them fellers," remarked
Disco, after observing them in silence for some time.
"They're a cut-throat set, I'm quite sure, an' if
you 'll take my advice, Mister Seadrift, we'll give
'em the slip, an' try to hunt up one o' the native
villages. I shouldn't wonder, now, if that chap was
a slave-trader."
"The same idea has occurred to myself, Disco,"
replied Harold, "and I would willingly leave him
if I thought there was a town or village within
twenty miles of us; but we are ignorant on that
point, and I have heard enough of the African
climate to believe that it might cost us our lives
if we were obliged to spend a night in the jungle
without fire, food, or covering, and with nothing on
but a wet flannel shirt and pair of canvas breeches.
No, no, lad, we must not risk it. Besides, although
some Arabs are slave-traders, it does not follow that
all are. This fellow may turn out better than he
looks."
Disco Lillihammer experienced some sensations
of surprise on hearing his young friend's remarks

BLACK IVORY.
on the climate, for he knew nothing whatever about
that of Africa,-having sailed chiefly in the Arctic
Seas as a whaler,-and laboured under the delusion
that no climate under the sun could in any degree
affect his hardy and well-seasoned frame. He was too
respectful, however, to let his thoughts be known.
Meanwhile the Arab returned.
"I sail this night," he said, "when moon go
down. That not far before midnight. You mus'
keep by boat here-close. If you go this way or
that, the niggers kill you. They not come here ;
they know I is here. I go look after my goods
and chattels—my Black Ivory."
" Mayn't we go with 'ee, mister—what's your
name?"
"My name ?—Yoosoof," replied the Arab, in a
tone and with a look which were meant to com-
mand respect.
"Well, Mister Yoosoof," continued Disco, " if we
may make bold to ax leave for to go with 'ee, we
could lend 'ee a helpin' hand, d'ye see, to carry yer
goods an' chattels down to the boat."
"There is no need," said Yoosoof, waving his
hand, and pointing to the hut before mentioned.
"Go; you can rest till we sail. Sleep; you will
need it. There is littil rice in hut-eat that, and
make fire, dry youselfs."
So saying, the Arab left them by a path leading


## p. 16 (#34) ##############################################

16
BLACK IVORY.
into the woods, along which his men, who were
Portuguese half-castes, had preceded him.
" Make fire indeed !" exclaimed Disco, as he
walked with his companion to the hut; "one would
think, from the free-and-easy way in which he tells
us to make it, that he's in the habit himself of
striking it out o'the point o' his own nose, or some
such convenient fashion."
"More likely to flash it out of his eyes, I should
think," said Harold; "but, see here, the fellow
knew what he was talking about. There is fire
among these embers on the hearth."
"That's true," replied Disco, going down on his
knees, and blowing them carefully.
In a few minutes a spark leaped into a flame,
wood was heaped on, and the flame speedily became
a rousing fire, before which they dried their gar-
ments, while a pot of rice was put on to boil.
Scarcely had they proceeded thus far in their
preparations, when two men, armed with muskets,
were seen to approach, leading a negro girl between
them. As they drew nearer, it was observable that
the girl had a brass ring round her neck, to which a
rope was attached.
"A slave !" exclaimed Disco vehemently, while
the blood rushed to his face; "let's set her free !"
The indignant seaman had half sprung to his legs
before Harold seized and pulled him forcibly back.

"Be quiet, man," said Harold quickly. "If we
could free her by fighting, I would help you, but
we can't. Evidently we have got into a nest
of slavers. Rashness will only bring about our
own death. Be wise ; bide your time, and we may
live to do some good yet."
He stopped abruptly, for the new comers had
reached the top of the winding path that led to the
hut.
A look of intense surprise overspread the faces
of the two men when they entered and saw the
Englishmen sitting comfortably by the fire, and
both, as if by instinct, threw forward the muzzles
of their muskets.
"Oh! come in, come in, make your minds easy,"
cried Disco, in a half-savage tone, despite the warn-
ing he had received; "were all friends here-
leastwise we can't help ourselves."
Fortunately for our mariner the men did not
understand him, and before they could make up
their minds what to think of it, or how to act,
Harold rose, and, with a polite bow, invited them
to enter.
"Do you understand English ?" he asked.
A frown, and a decided shake of the head from
both men, was the reply. The poor negro girl
cowered behind her keepers, as if she feared that
violence were about to ensue.

Having tried French with a like result, Harold
uttered the name, "Yoosoof," and pointed in the
direction in which the trader had entered the woods.
The men looked intelligently at each other, and
nodded.
Then Harold said " Zanzibar," and pointed in the
direction in which he supposed that island lay.
Again the men glanced at each other, and nodded.
Harold next said "Boat—dhow," and pointed
towards the creek, which remark and sign were
received as before.
"Good," he continued, slapping himself on the
chest, and pointing to his companion; "I go to Zan-
zibar, he goes, she goes" (pointing to the girl), "you
go, and Yoosoof goes—all in the dhow together to
Zanzibar—to-night-when moon goes down.. D'ee
understand ? Now then, come along and have some
rice."
He finished up by slapping one of the men on
the shoulder, and lifting the kettle off the fire, for
the rice had already been cooked and only wanted
warming.
The men looked once again at each other, nodded,
laughed, and sat down on a log beside the fire,
opposite to the Englishmen.
They were evidently much perplexed by the
situation, and, not knowing what to make of it,
were disposed in the meantime to be friendly.

While they were busy with the rice, Disco gazed
in silent wonder, and with intense pity, at the slave
girl, who sat a little to one side of her guardians on
a mat, her small hands folded together resting on
one knee, her head drooping, and her eyes cast
down. The enthusiastic tar found it very difficult
to restrain his feelings. He had heard, of course,
more or less about African slavery from shipmates,
but he had never read about it, and had never
seriously given his thoughts to it, although his
native sense of freedom, justice, and fair-play had
roused a feeling of indignation in his breast when-
ever the subject chanced to be discussed by him
and his mates. But now, for the first time in his
life, suddenly and unexpectedly, he was brought
face to face with slavery. No wonder that he was
deeply moved.
"Why, Mister Seadrift," he said, in the confi-
dential tone of one who imparts a new discovery,
"I do honestly confess to 'ee that I think that's a
pretty girl!"
"I quite agree with you," replied Harold, smiling.
"Ay, but I mean really pretty, you know. I've
always thought that all niggers had ugly flat noses
an' thick blubber lips. But look at that one: her
lips are scarce a bit thicker than those of many a
good-looking lass in England, and they don't stick
out at all, and her nose ain't flat a bit. It's quite
than

as good as my Nancy's nose, an' that's sayin' a
good deal, I tell 'ee. Moreover, she ain't black-
she's brown."
It is but justice to Disco to say that he was right
in his observations, and to explain that the various
negro tribes in Africa differ very materially from
each other; some of them, as we are told by Dr.
Livingstone, possessing little of what, in our ey.es,
seems the characteristic ugliness of the negro—such
as thick lips, flat noses, protruding heels, etc., -but
being in every sense handsome races of humanity.
The slave girl whom Disco admired and pitied so
much belonged to one of these tribes, and, as was
afterwards ascertained, had been brought from the
far interior. She appeared to be very young, never-
theless there was a settled expression of meek
sorrow and suffering on her face ; and though
handsomely formed, she was extremely thin, no
doubt from prolonged hardships on the journey
down to the coast.
"Here, have somethin' to eat," exclaimed Disco,
suddenly filling a tin plate with rice, and carrying
it to the girl, who, however, shook her head without
raising her eyes.
"You're not hungry, poor thing," said the sea-
man, in a disappointed tone; "you look as if you
should be. Come, try it," he added, stooping, and
patting her head.

The poor child looked up as if frightened, and
shrank from the seaman's touch, but, on glancing a
second time in his honest face, she appeared to feel
confidence in him. Nevertheless, she would not
touch the rice until her guardians said something to
her sternly, when she began to eat with an appetite
that was eloquent.
" Come, now, tell us what your name is, lass,"
said Disco, when she had finished the rice.
Of course the girl shook her head, but appeared
to wish to understand the question, while the
Portuguese laughed and seemed amused with the
Englishman's eccentricities.
"Look here, now," resumed the tar, slapping his
own chest vigorously, " Disco, Disco, Disco, that's
me-Disco. And this man" (patting his companion
on the breast) "is Harold, Harold, that's him—Harold.
Now, then," he added, pointing straight at the girl,
"you—what's you name, eh ?"
A gleam of intelligence shot from the girl's ex-
pressive eyes, and she displayed a double row of
beautiful teeth as in a low soft voice she said-
" Azinté." .
"" Azinté ? come, that's not a bad name ; why, it's
a capital one. Just suited to 'ee. Well, Azinté, my
poor girl," said Disco, with a fresh outburst of feel-
ing, as he clenched his horny right hand and dashed
it into the palm of his left, " if I only knew how to

set you free just now, my dear, I'd do it—ay, if I
was to be roasted alive for so doin'. I would !"
"You 'll never set anybody free in this world,"
said Harold Seadrift, with some severity, "if you
go on talking and acting as you have done to-day.
If these men had not, by good fortune, been ignorant
of our language, it's my opinion that they would
have blown our brains out before this time. You
should restrain yourself, man," he continued, gra-
dually dropping into a remonstrative and then into
an earnestly confidential tone; "we are utterly help-
less just now. If you did succeed in freeing that
girl at this moment, it would only be to let her fall
into the hands of some other slave-owner. Besides,
that would not set free all the other slaves, male and
female, who are being dragged from the interior of
Africa. You and I may perhaps do some small matter
in the way of helping to free slaves, if we keep quiet
and watch our opportunity, but we shall accomplish
nothing if you give way to useless bursts of anger."
Poor Lillihammer was subdued.
"You're right, Mister Seadrift, you're right, sir,
and I'm a ass. I never could keep my feelings
down. It's all along of my havin' bin made too much
of by my mother, dear old woman, w'en I was a
boy. But I'll make a effort, sir; I'll clap a stopper
on 'em_bottle 'em up and screw 'em down tight,
werry tight indeed."

Disco again sent his right fist into the palm of
his left hand, with something like the sound of a
pistol-shot, to the no small surprise and alarm of
the Portuguese, and, rising, went out to cool his
heated brow in the open air.

CHAPTER II.
YOOSOOF'S "BLACK IVORY."
WHEN Yoosoof entered the woods, as before stated,
for the purpose of looking after his property, he
followed a narrow foot-path for about half a mile,
which led him to another part of the same creek, at the
entrance of which we introduced him to the reader.
Here, under the deep shadow of umbrageous trees,
floated five large Arab boats, or dhows, similar to
the one which has been already referred to. They
were quite empty, and apparently unguarded, for
when Yoosoof went down the bank and stood on a
projecting rock which overlooked them, no one
replied to his low-toned hail. Repeating it once,
and still receiving no answer, he sat quietly down
on the rocks, lighted a small pipe, and waited
patiently.
The boats, as we have said, were empty, but there
were some curious appliances in them, having the
appearance of chains, and wristlets, and bars of iron
running along and fixed to their decks, or rather to


## p. 25 (#43) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
the flooring of their holds. Their long yards and
sails were cleared and ready for hoisting.
After the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes, Yoosoof
raised his head for he had been meditating deeply,
if one might judge from his attitude--and glanced
in the direction of an opening in the bushes whence
issued a silent and singular train of human beings.
They were negroes, secured by the necks or wrists—
men, women, and children,—and guarded by armed
half-caste Portuguese. When a certain number of
them, about a hundred or so, had issued from the
wood, and crowded the banks of the creek, they were
ordered to stand still, and the leader of the band
advanced towards his master.
These were some of Yoosoof's "goods and
chattels," his "cattle," his " black ivory."
" You have been long in coming, Moosa," said the
Arab trader, as the man approached.
"I have," replied Moosa, somewhat gruffly," but
the road was rough and long, and the cattle were
ill-conditioned, as you see."
The two men spoke in the Portuguese tongue,
but as the natives and settlers on that coast speak a
variety of languages and dialects, we have no alter-
native, good reader, but to render all into English.
"Make the more haste now," said Yoosoof; "get
them shipped at once, for we sail when the moon
goes down. Pick out the weakest among the lot,

those most likely to die, and put them by them-
selves in the small dhow. If we must sacrifice some
of our wares to these meddling dogs the English, we
may as well give them the refuse."
Without remark, Moosa turned on his heel and
proceeded to obey orders.
Truly, to one unaccustomed to such scenes, it
would have appeared that all the negroes on the spot
were "most likely to die," for a more wretched, starved
set of human beings could scarcely be imagined.
They had just terminated a journey on foot of
several hundreds of miles, with insufficient food and
under severe hardships. Nearly all of them were
lean to a degree,-many so reduced that they
resembled nothing but skeletons with a covering of
black leather. Some of the children were very
young, many of them mere infants, clinging to the
backs of the poor mothers, who had carried them
over mountain and plain, through swamp and jungle,
in blistering sunshine and pelting rain for many
weary days. But prolonged suffering had changed
the nature of these little ones. They were as silent
and almost as intelligently anxious as their seniors.
There were no old pieces of merchandise there.
Most were youthful or in the prime of life; a few
were middle-aged.
Difficult though the task appeared to be, Moosa
soon selected about fifty men and women and a few

27
children, who were so fearfully emaciated that their
chance of surviving appeared but small. These
were cast loose and placed in a sitting posture in
the hold of the smallest dhow, as close together
as they could be packed.
Their removal from the bank made room for
more to issue from the wood, which they did in a
continuous stream. Batch after batch was cast
loose and stowed away in the manner already de-
scribed, until the holds of two of the large boats were
filled, each being capable of containing about two
hundred souls. This was so far satisfactory to
Yoosoof, who had expended a good deal of money
on the venture-satisfactory, even although he had
lost a large proportion of the goods-four-fifths at
least, if not more, by death and otherwise, on the
way down to the coast; but that was a matter of
little consequence. The price of black ivory was
up in the market just at that time, and the worthy
merchant could stand a good deal of loss.
The embarkation was effected with wonderful
celerity, and in comparative silence. Only the stern
voices of the half-caste Portuguese were heard as
they ordered the slaves to move, mingled with the
occasional clank of a chain, but no sounds proceeded
from the thoroughly subdued and worn-out slaves
louder than a sigh or a half-suppressed wail, with
now and then a shriek of pain when some of the

weaker among them were quickened into activity
by the lash.
When all had been embarked, two of the five
boats still remained empty, but Yoosoof had a pretty
good idea of the particular points along the coast
where more "cattle" of a similar kind could be
purchased. Therefore, after stationing some of his
men, armed with muskets, to guard the boats, he
returned with the remainder of them to the hut in
· which the Englishmen had been left.
There he found Azinté and her guardians. He
seemed angry with the latter at first, but after a few
minutes' thought appeared to recover his equanimity,
and ordered the men to remove the ropes with which
the girl was tethered; then bidding her follow him
he left the hut without taking any notice of the
Englishmen further than to say he would be back
shortly before the time of sailing.
Yoosoof's motions were usually slow and his mien
somewhat dignified, but, when occasion required, he
could throw off his Oriental dignity and step out
with the activity of a monkey. It was so on this
occasion, insomuch that Azinté was obliged occa-
sionally to run in order to keep up with him. Pro-
ceeding about two miles in the woods along the
shore without halt, he came out at length on the
margin of a bay, at the head of which lay a small
town. It was a sorry-looking place, composed of

BLACK IVORY.
29
wretchedly built houses, most of which were thatched
with the leaves of the cocoa-nut palm.
Nevertheless, such as it was, it possessed a mud
fort, an army of about thirty soldiers, composed of
Portuguese convicts who had been sent there as a
punishment for many crimes, a Governor, who was
understood to be honourable, having been placed
there by his Excellency the Governor-General at
Mozambique, who had been himself appointed by
His Most Faithful Majesty the King of Portugal.
It was in quest of this Governor that Yoosoof
bent his rapid steps. Besides all the advantages
above enumerated, the town drove a small trade
in ivory, ebony, indigo, orchella weed, gum copal,
cocoa-nut oil, and other articles of native produce,
and a very large (though secret) trade in human
bodies and—we had almost written—souls, but the
worthy people who dwelt there could not fetter
souls, although they could, and very often did, set
them free.
Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti,
the Governor, was seated at the open window of his
parlour, just before Yoosoof made his appearance,
conversing lightly with his only daughter, the ·
Senhorina Maraquita, a beautiful brunette of about
eighteen summers, who had been brought up and
educated in Portugal.
The Governor's wife had died a year before this

time in Madrid, and the Senhorina had gone to live
with her father on the east coast of Africa, at which
place she had arrived just six weeks previous to the
date of the opening of our tale.
Among the various boats and vessels at anchor in
the bay, were seen the tapering masts of a British
war-steamer. The Senhorina and her sire were en-
gaged in a gossiping criticism of the officers of this
vessel when Yoosoof was announced. Audience was
immediately granted.
Entering the room, with Azinté close behind him,
the Arab stopped abruptly on beholding Maraquita,
and bowed gravely.
" Leave us, my child," said the Governor, in
Portuguese; "I have business to transact with this
man."
"And why may not I stay to assist you, father,
in this wonderful man-mystery of transacting
business ?" asked Maraquita, with an arch smile.
"Whenever you men want to get rid of women you
frighten them away with business! If you wish not
to explain something to us, you shake your wise
heads, and call it business! Is it not so?~Come, Arab,"
she added, turning with a sprightly air to Yoosoof,
"you are a trader, I suppose ; all Arabs are, I am
told. Well, what sort of wares have you got to sell?"
Yoosoof smiled slightly as he stepped aside and
pointed to Azinté.


## p. 31 (#49) ##############################################

31
The speaking countenance of the Portuguese girl
changed as if by magic. She had seen little and
thought little about slavery during the brief period
of her residence on the coast, and had scarcely
realized the fact that Sambo, with the thick lips-
her father's gardener—or the black cook and house-
maids, were slaves. It was the first entrance of a
new idea with something like power into her mind
when she saw a delicate, mild-looking, and pretty
negro girl actually offered for sale.
Before she could bethink herself of any remark the
door opened, and in walked, unannounced, a man on
whose somewhat handsome countenance villany was
clearly stamped.
"Ha ! Marizano," exclaimed Senhor Letotti, rising,
" you have thought better of it, I presume ?"
· "I have, and I agree to your arrangement,"
replied Marizano, in an off-hand, surly tone.
"There is nothing like necessity," returned the
Governor, with a laugh. " 'Twere better to enjoy a
roving life for a short time with a lightish purse in
one's pocket, than to attempt to keep a heavy purse
with the addition of several ounces of lead in one's
breast! How say you ?"
Marizano smiled and shrugged his broad shoulders,
but made no reply, for just then his attention had
been attracted to the slave girl.
"For sale ?" he inquired of the Arab carelessly.


## p. 32 (#50) ##############################################

32
BLACK IVORY.
Yoosoof bowed his head slightly.
"How much ?"
"Come, come, gentlemen," interposed the Gover-
nor, with a laugh and a glance at his daughter, "you
can settle this matter elsewhere. Yoosoof has come
here to talk with me on other matters. Now,
Maraquita dear, you had better retire for a short
time."
When the Senhorina had somewhat unwillingly
obeyed, the Governor turned to Yoosoof : " I presume
you have no objection to Marizano's presence during
our interview, seeing that he is almost as well
acquainted with your affairs as yourself ?"
As Yoosoof expressed no objection, the three drew
their chairs together and sat down to a prolonged
private and very interesting palaver.
We do not mean to try the reader's patience by
dragging him through the whole of it; nevertheless
a small portion of what was said is essential to the
development of our tale. .
"Well, then, be it as you wish, Yoosoof," said the
Governor, folding up a fresh cigarette ; " you are one
of the most active traders on the coast, and never
fail to keep correct accounts with your Governor.
You deserve encouragement, but I fear that you run
considerable risk."
"I know that; but those who make much must
risk much."


## p. 33 (#51) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
33
"Bravo !" exclaimed Marizano, with hearty appro-
val;"nevertheless those who risk most do not always
make most. Contrast yourself with me, now. You
risk your boats and cattle, and become rich. I risk
my life, and behold! I am fleeced. I have little or
nothing left, barely enough to buy yonder girl from
you—though I think I have enough for that."
He pointed as he spoke to Azinté, who still stood
on the spot where she had been left, near the door.
"Tell me," resumed Senhor Letotti," how do you
propose to elude the English cruiser ? for I know that
her captain has got wind of your whereabouts, and
is determined to watch the coast closely—and let
me tell you, he is a vigorous, intelligent man."
"You tell me he has a number of captured slaves
already in his ship ?" said Yoosoof.
"Yes, some hundreds, I believe."
"He must go somewhere to land these, I presume?"
rejoined the Arab.
Yoosoof referred here to the fact that when a
British cruiser engaged in the suppression of the
slave-trade on the east coast of Africa has captured a
number of slaves, she is under the necessity of run-
ning to the Seychelles Islands, Aden, or some other
British port of discharge, to land them there as free-
men, because, were she to set them free on any
part of the coast of Africa, belonging either to Portu-
gal or the Sultan of Zanzibar, they would certainly

be recaptured and again enslaved. When therefore
the cruisers are absent—it may be two or three
weeks—on this duty, the traders in human flesh of
course make the most of their opportunity to run
cargoes of slaves to those ports in Arabia and Persia
where they always find a ready market.
On the present occasion Yoosoof conceived that
the captain of the Firefly' might be obliged to
take this course to get rid of the negroes already on
board, who were of course consuming his provisions,
besides being an extremely disagreeable cargo, many
of them being diseased and covered with sores, owing
to their cruel treatment on board the slave-dhows:
"He won't go, however, till he has hunted the
coast north and south for you, so he assures me,"
said the Governor, with a laugh.
" Well, I must start to-night, therefore I shall
give him a small pill to swallow which will take
him out of the way," said Yoosoof, rising to leave
the room.
"I wish you both success," said the Governor, as
Marizano also rose to depart, " but I fear that you
will find the Englishman very troublesome.—Adieu."
The Arab and the half-caste went out talking
earnestly together, and followed by Azinté, and
immediately afterwards the Senhorina Maraquita
entered hurriedly.
Father, you must buy that slave-girl for me. I


## p. 35 (#53) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
want a pretty slave all to myself," she said, with
unwonted vehemence.
"Impossible, my child," replied the Governor
kindly, for he was very fond as well as proud of his
daughter.
"Why impossible? Have you not enough of
money ?"
"Oh yes, plenty of that, but I fear she is already
bespoken, and I should not like to interfere—"
" Bespoken ! do you mean sold ?" cried Mara-
quita, seizing her father's hands, "not sold to that
man Marizano ?"
"I think she must be by this time, for he's a
prompt man of business, and not easily thwarted
when he sets his mind to a thing."
The Senhorina clasped her hands before her eyes,
and stood for a moment motionless, then rushing
wildly from the room she passed into another apart-
ment, the windows of which commanded a view of
a considerable part of the road which led from the
house along the shore. There she saw the Arab
and his friend walking leisurely along as if in
earnest converse, while Azinté followed meekly be-
hind.
The Senhorina stood gazing at them with clenched
hands, in an agony of uncertainty as to what course
she ought to pursue, and so wrapt up in her thoughts
that she failed to observe a strapping young lieuten-

ant of H. M.S. steamer 'Firefly,' who had entered
the room and stood close to her side.
Now this same lieutenant happened to be wildly
in love with Senhorina Maraquita. He had met
her frequently at her father's table, where, in com-
pany with his captain, he was entertained with great
hospitality, and on which occasions the captain was
assisted by the Governor in his investigations into
the slave-trade.
Lieutenant Lindsay had taken the romantic
plunge with all the charming enthusiasm of inex-
perienced youth, and entertained the firm conviction
that if Senhorina Maraquita did not become "his,"
life would thenceforth be altogether unworthy of
consideration; happiness would be a thing of the
past, with which he should have nothing more to do,
and death at the cannon's mouth, or otherwise,
would be the only remaining gleam of comfort in
his dingy future.
"Something distresses you, I fear," began the
lieutenant, not a little perplexed to find the young
lady in such a peculiar mood.
Maraquita started, glanced at him a moment, and
then, with flashing eyes and heightened colour,
pointed at the three figures on the road.
"Yes, Senhor," she said ; "I am distressed-deeply
so. Look! do you see yonder two men, and the
girl walking behind them?"
4000.


## p. 37 (#55) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
"I do."
"Quick ! fly after them and bring them hither
-the Arab and the girl I mean—not the other
man. Oh be quick, else they will be out of sight,
and then she will be lost; quick, if you—if—if
you really mean what you have so often told
me."
Poor Lindsay! It was rather a sudden and
severe test of fidelity to be sent forth to lay violent
hands on a man and woman and bring them forcibly
to the Governor's house, without any better reason
than that a self-willed girl ordered him so to do;
at the same time he perceived that if he did not
act promptly the retreating figures would soon turn
into the town and be hopelessly beyond his power
of recognition.
"But-but," he stammered, "if they won't
come—?"
"They must come. Threaten my father's high
displeasure.—Quick, Senhor," cried the young lady
in a commanding tone.
Lindsay flung open the casement and leapt through
it, as being the shortest way out of the house, rushed
with undignified speed along the road, and overtook
the Arab and his friend as they were about to turn
into one of the narrow lanes of the town.
"Pardon me," said the lieutenant, laying his
hand on Yoosoof's shoulder in his anxiety to make

sure of him, "will you be so good as to return with
me to the Governor's residence ?"
"By whose orders ?" demanded Yoosoof, with a
look of surprise.
"The orders of the Senhorina Maraquita."
The Arab hesitated, looked somewhat perplexed,
and said something in Portuguese to Marizano, who
pointed to the slave-girl, and spoke with considerable
vehemence.
Lindsay did not understand what was said, but
conjecturing that the half-caste was proposing that
Azinté should remain with him, he said :-
"The girl must return with you—if you would
not incur the Governor's displeasure." .
Marizano, on having this explained to him, looked
with much ferocity at the lieutenant, and spoke to
Yoosoof in wrathful tones, but the latter shook his
head, and the former, who disliked Marizano's appear-
ance excessively, took not the least notice of him.
"I do go," said Yoosoof, turning back. Motion-
ing to Azinté to follow, he retraced his steps with
the lieutenant and the slave-girl, while Marizano
strode into the town in a towering rage.
We need scarcely say that Maraquita, having got
possession of Azinté, did not find it impossible to per-
suade her father to purchase her, and that Yoosoof,
although sorry to disappoint Marizano, who was an
important ally and assistant in the slave-trade, did

not see his way to thwart the wishes of the Gover-
nor, whose power to interfere with his trade was
very great indeed, and to whom he was under the
necessity of paying head-money for every slave that
was exported by him from that part of the coast.
Soon after Azinté had been thus happily rescued
from the clutches of two of the greatest villains on
the East-African coast-where villains of the deep-
est dye are by no means uncommon-Lindsay met
Captain Romer of the 'Firefly on the beach, with
his first lieutenant, Mr. Small, who, by the way,
happened to be one of the largest men in his ship.
The three officers had been invited to dine that day
with the Governor, and as there seemed no particular
occasion for their putting to sea that night, and a
fresh supply of water had to be taken on board, the
invitation had been accepted, all the more readily,
too, that Captain Romer thought it afforded an op-
portunity for obtaining further information as to the
movements of certain notorious slavers who were said
to be thereabouts at that time. Lieutenant Lindsay
had been sent ashore at an earlier part of the day,
accompanied by one of the sailors who understood
Portuguese, and who, being a remarkably intelligent
man, might, it was thought, acquire some useful
information from some of the people of the town.
"Well, Mr. Lindsay, has Jackson been of any use
to you?" inquired the captain.

" Not yet," replied the lieutenant; " at least I
know not what he may have done, not having met
him since we parted on landing; but I have myself
been so fortunate as to rescue a slave-girl under
somewhat peculiar circumstances."
"Truly, a most romantic and gallant affair," said
the captain, laughing, when Lindsay had related the
incident, "and worthy of being mentioned in des-
patches ; but I suspect, considering the part that the
Senhorina Maraquita played in it, and the fact that
you only rescued the girl from one slaveholder in
order to hand her over to another, the less that is
said about the subject the better But here comes
Jackson. Perhaps he may have learned something
about the scoundrels we are in search of."
The seaman referred to approached and touched
his cap.
"What news ?" demanded the captain, who knew
by the twinkle in Jack's eye that he had something
interesting to report.
"I've diskivered all about it, sir," replied the man,
with an ill-suppressed chuckle.
"Indeed! come this way. Now, let's hear what
you have to tell," said the captain, when at a suffi-
cient distance from his boat to render the conversa-
tion quite private.
"Well, sir," began Jackson, " w'en I got up into
the town, arter leavin' Mr. Lindsay, who should I

meet but a man as had bin a messmate o' mine
aboard of that there Portuguese ship w'ere I picked up
a smatterin' o' the lingo? Of course we hailed each
other and hove-to for a spell, and then we made sail
for a grog-shop, where we spliced the main-brace.
After a deal o'tackin' and beatin' about, which en-
abled me to find out that he'd left the sea an' taken to
business on his own account, which in them parts
seems to mean loafin' about doin' little or nothin', I
went slap into the subject that was uppermost in my
mind, and says I to him, says I, they does a deal o'
slavin' on this here coast, it appears--Black Ivory is
a profitable trade, ain't it? W'y, sir, you should
have seen the way he grinned and winked, and
opened out on 'em.'—' Black Ivory!' says he,
'w'y, Jackson, there's more slaves exported from
these here parts annooally than would fill a good-
sized city. I could tell you—but,' says he, pullin'
up sudden, "you won't split on me, messmate ?'
Honour bright, says I, if ye don't call tellin' my
captain splittin'. 'Oh no,' says he, with a laugh,
'it's little I care what he knows, or does to the
pirates--for that's their true name, and murderers
to boot-but don't let it come to the Governor's ears,
else I'm a ruined man.' I says I wouldn't, and then
he goes on to tell me all sorts of hanecdots about
their doin's—that they does it with the full consent
of the Governor, who gets head-money for every

slave exported; that nearly all the Governors on the
coast are birds of the same feather, and that the
Governor-General himself, at Mozambique, winks
at it, and makes the subordinate Governors pay
him tribute. Then he goes on to tell me more about
the Governor of this here town, an' says that though
a kind-hearted man in the main, and very good to
his domestic slaves, he encourages the export trade,
because it brings him in a splendid revenue, which he
has much need of, poor man, for like most, if not all,
the Governors on the coast, he do receive nothin' like
a respectible salary from the Portuguese Government
at home, and has to make it up by slave-tradin'."2
It must be explained here that British cruisers
were, and still are, kept on the east coast of Africa,
for the purpose of crushing only the export slave-
trade. They claim no right to interfere with
"domestic slavery," an institution which is still legal
in the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar and in
the so-called colonies of Portugal on that coast.
"But that is not the best of it, sir," continued
Jackson, with a respectful smile, "after we'd had
our jaw out, I goes off along the road by the beach to
think a bit what I'd best do, an' have a smoke-for
that's wot usually sets my brain to work full-swing.

gitate. You see, sir, my old messmate told me
that there are two men here, the worst characters
he ever know'd-ashore or afloat. One they calls
Yoosoof—an Arab he is; the other Marizano—he's a
slave-catcher, and an outlaw just now, havin' taken
up arms and rebelled against the Portuguese autho-
rities. Nevertheless these two men are secretly
hand and glove with the Governor here, and at this
moment there are said to be a lot o' slaves ready for
shipment and only waitin' till the 'Firefly' is out
of the way. More than this my friend could not
tell, so that's w'y I went to excogitate.—I beg
parding, sir, for being so long wi' my yarn, but I
ain't got the knack o'cuttin' it short, sir, that's w'ere
it is."
"Never mind, lad; go on to the end of it," replied
the captain. "Did you excogitate anything more?"
"I can't say as I did, sir, but it was cooriously
enough excogitated for me. W'en I was lying
there looking through the bush at the bay, I sees
two men comin' along, arm in arm. One of 'em
was an Arab. W'en they was near I saw the Arab
start; I thought he'd seen me, and didn't like me.
No more did I like him or his comrade. However,
I was wrong, for after whisperin' somethin' very
earnest-like to his friend, who laughed very much,
but said nothin', they came and sat down not far
from the bush where I lay. Now, thinks I, it ain't

pleasant to be an eavesdropper, but as I'm here to
find out the secrets of villains, and as these two look
uncommon like villains, I'll wait a bit; if they broach
business as don't consarn me or her Majesty the
Queen, I'll sneeze an' let 'em know I'm here, before
they're properly under weigh; but if they speaks of
wot I wants to know, I'll keep quiet. Well, sir, to
my surprise the Arab—he speaks in bad English,
whereby I came to suppose the other was an English-
man, but if he is the climate must have spoiled him
badly, for I never did see such a ruffian to look at.
But he only laughed, and didn't speak, so I couldn't
be sure. Well, to come to the pint, sir, the Arab said
he'd got hold of two shipwrecked Englishmen, whom
he meant to put on board of his dhow, at that time
lyin' up a river not three miles off, and full of slaves,
take 'em off the coast, seize'em when asleep and heave
'em overboard ; the reason bein' that he was afraid,
if they was left ashore here, they'd discover the town,
which they are ignorant of at present, and give the
alarm to our ship, sir, an' so prevent him gettin' clear
off, which he means to attempt about midnight, just
after the moon goes down."
This unexpected information was very gratifying
to Captain Romer, who immediately gave orders to
get steam up and have everything in readiness to start
the moment he should make his appearance on board,
at the same time enjoining absolute silence on his

lieutenants and Jackson, who all returned to the
'Firefly,' chuckling inwardly.
If they had known that the Arab's information,
though partly true, was a ruse ; that Jackson had
indeed been observed by the keen-eyed Oriental, who
had thereupon sat down purposely within ear-shot, and
after a whispered hint to his companion, gave forth
such information as would be likely to lead the British
cruiser into his snares-speaking in bad English,
under the natural impression that the sailor did not
understand Portuguese, to the immense amusement
of Marizano, who understood the ruse, though he did
not understand a single word of what his companion
said-had they known all this, we say, it is probable
that they would have chuckled less, and—but why
indulge in probabilities when facts are before us ?
The sequel will show that the best-laid plans may
fail.

CHAPTER III.
RELATES THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF HAROLD AND DISCO, AND
LIFTS THE CURTAIN A LITTLE HIGHER IN REGARD TO THE SLAVE-
TRADE.
So Captain Romer and his lieutenants went to
dine with the worthy Governor Senhor Francisco
Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, while Yoosoof
returned to the creek to carry out his deep-laid
plans.
In regard to the dinner, let it suffice to observe
that it was good, and that the Governor was urbane,
hospitable, communicative, and every way agreeable.
It is probable that if he had been trained in another
sphere and in different circumstances he might have
been a better man. As things stood, he was un-
questionably a pleasant one, and Captain Romer
found it hard to believe that he was an underhand
schemer.
Nothing could exceed the open way in which
Senhor Letotti condemned the slave-trade, praised the
English for their zeal in attempting to suppress it,
explained that the King of Portugal and the Sultan
of Zanzibar were equally anxious for its total ex-

47
tinction, and assured his guests that he would do
everything that lay in his power to further their
efforts to capture the guilty kidnappers, and to free
the poor slaves !
"But, my dear sir," said he, at the conclusion of
an emphatic declaration of sympathy, "the thing is
exceedingly difficult. You are aware that Arab
traders swarm upon the coast, that they are reckless
men, who possess boats and money in abundance,
that the trade is very profitable, and that, being to
some extent real traders in ivory, palm-oil, indigo,
and other kinds of native produce, these men have
many ruses and methods, what you English call
dodges—whereby they can deceive even the most
sharp-sighted and energetic. The Arabs are smart
smugglers of negroes—very much as your people
who live in the Scottish land are smart smugglers
of the dew of the mountain—what your great poet
Burns speaks much of—I forget its name—it is not
easy to put them down."
After dinner, Senhor Letotti led the officers into
his garden, and showed them his fruit-trees and
offices, also his domestic slaves, who looked healthy,
well cared for, and really in some degree happy.
He did not, however, tell his guests that, being
naturally a humane man, his slaves were better
treated than any other slaves in the town. He did
not remind them that, being slaves, they were his

property, his goods and chattels, and that he pos-
sessed the right and the power to flay them alive if
so disposed. He did not explain that many in the
town were so disposed ; that cruelty grows and feeds
upon itself; that there were ladies and gentlemen
there who flogged their slaves —men, women, and
children—nearly to the death ; that one gentleman
of an irascible disposition, when irritated by some
slight oversight on the part of the unfortunate boy
who acted as his valet, could find no relief to his
feelings until he had welted him first into a condi-
tion of unutterable terror, and then into a state of
insensibility. Neither did he inform them that a
certain lady in the town, who seemed at most times
to be possessed of a reasonably quiet spirit, was roused
once to such a degree by a female slave that she
caused her to be forcibly held, thrust a boiling hot
egg into her mouth, skewered her lips together with
a sail-needle, and then striking her cheeks, burst
the egg, and let the scalding contents run down her
throat.
No, nothing of all this did the amiable Governor
Letotti so much as hint at. He would not for the
world have shocked the sensibilities of his guests by
the recital of such cruelties. To say truth, the
worthy man himself did not like to speak or think
of them. In this respect he resembled a certain

49
class among ourselves, who, rather than submit to a
little probing of their feelings for a few minutes,
would prefer to miss the chance of making an intel-
ligently indignant protest against slavery, and would
allow the bodies and souls of their fellow-men to
continue writhing in agony through all time.
It was much more gratifying to the feelings of
Senhor Letotti to convey his guests to the drawing-
room, and there gratify their palates with excellent
coffee, while the graceful, and now clothed, Azinté
brought a Spanish guitar to the Senhorina Mara-
quita, whose sweet voice soon charmed away all
thoughts of the cruel side of slavery. But duty ere
long stepped in to call the guests to other scenes.
"What a sweet girl the Senhorina is " remarked
Captain Romer, while on his way to the beach.
"Ay, and what a pretty girl Azinté is, black
though she be," observed Lieutenant Small.
" Call her not black; she is brown-a brunette,"
said the captain.
"I wonder how we should feel," said Lindsay, " if
the tables were turned, and our women and children,
with our stoutest young men, were forcibly taken
from us by thousands every year, and imported into
Africa to grind the corn and hoe the fields of the
black man. Poor Azinté !"
"Do you know anything of her history ?" inquired
Mr. Small.


## p. 50 (#68) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
"A little. I had some conversation in French
with the Senhorina just before we left"
"Yes, I observed that," interrupted the captain,
with a quiet smile.
" And," continued Lindsay, " she told me that she
had discovered, through an interpreter, that the poor
girl is married, and that her home is far away in the
interior. She was caught, with many others, while
out working in the fields one day several months
ago, by a party of slave-traders, under an Arab named
Yoosoof, and carried off. Her husband was absent
at the time; her infant boy was with its grand-
mother in their village, and she thinks may have
escaped into the woods, but she has not seen any
of them again since the day of her capture."
"It is a sad case," said the captain, "and yet, bad
though it be, it might be far worse, for Azinté's
master and mistress are very kind, which is more than
can be said of most slave-owners in this region."
In a few minutes the captain's gig was alongside 1
the 'Firefly,' and soon afterwards that vessel quietly
put to sea. Of course it was impossible that she
should depart unobserved, but hercommander took the
precaution to run due south at first, exactly opposite
to the direction of his true course, intending to make a
wide sweep out to sea, and thus get unobserved to the
northward of the place where the slaver's dhow
was supposed to be lying, in time to intercept it.

BLACK IVORY.
Yoosoof, from a neighbouring height, watched
the manquvre, and thoroughly understood it. When
the vessel had disappeared into the shades of night
that brooded over the sea, he smiled calmly, and
in a placid frame of mind betook himself to his lair
in the creek beside the mangrove trees.
He found Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer
in the hut, somewhat impatient of his prolonged
absence, and a dozen of his men looking rather
suspiciously at the strangers.
"Is all ready, Moosa ?" he inquired of a powerful
man, half-Portuguese half-negro in appearance, who
met him outside the door of the hut.
" All ready," replied the half-caste, in a gruff tone
of voice, "but what are you going to do with these
English brutes ?"
"Take them with us, of course," replied Yoosoof.
"For what end ?"
"For our own safety. Why, don't you see, Moosa,
that if we had set them free, they might have
discovered the town and given information to the
cruiser about us, which would have been awkward ?
We might now, indeed, set them free, for the cruiser
is gone, but I still have good reason for wishing to
take them with me. They think that we have but
one boat in this creek, and I should like to make
use of them for the purpose of propagating that false
idea. I have had the good luck while in the town

to find an opportunity of giving one of the sailors of
the cruiser a little information as to my movements
-some of it true, some of it false—which will
perhaps do us a service."
The Arab smiled slightly as he said this.
"Do these men know our trade ?" asked Moosa.
"I think they suspect it," answered Yoosoof.
"And what if they be not willing to go with us?"
demanded Moosa.
"Can twelve men not manage two?" asked the Arab.
Dark though the night had become by that time,
there was sufficient light to gleam on the teeth that
Moosa exposed on receiving this reply.
"Now, Moosa, we must be prompt," continued
Yoosoof; "let some of you get round behind the
Englishmen, and have the slave-chains handy. Keep
your eye on me while I talk with them ; if they are
refractory, a nod shall be the signal."
Entering the hut, Yoosoof informed Harold that
it was now time to set sail. "Good, we are ready,"
said Harold, rising, "but tell me one thing before
my comrade and I agree to go with you,—tell us
honestly if you are engaged in the slave-trade."
A slight smile curled the Arab's thin lip as he
replied
"If I be a slave-trader, I cannot speak honestly, so
you Engleesh think. But I do tell you-yes, I am."
"Then, I tell you honestly," said Harold," that I

.
won't go with you. I'll have nothing to do with
slavers."
" Them 's my sentiments to a tee," said Disco,
with emphasis, thumping his left palm as usual
with his right fist, by way of sheating his remark
home_to use his own words.
"But you will both perish on this uninhabited
coast," said Yoosoof.
"So be it," replied Harold; "I had rather run the
risk of starving than travel in company with slave-
traders. Besides, I doubt the truth of what you say.
There must be several villages not very far off, if my
information in regard to the coast be not altogether
wrong." .
Yoosoof waited for no more. He nodded to
Moosa, who instantly threw a noose round Harold's
arms, and drew it tight. The same operation was
performed for Disco, by a stout fellow who stood
behind him, and almost before they realized what
had occurred, they were seized by a number of men.
It must not be supposed that two able-bodied
Englishmen quietly submitted at once to this sort
of treatment. On the contrary, a struggle ensued
that shook the walls of the little but so violently as
almost to bring it down upon the heads of the com-
batants. The instant that Harold felt the rough clasp
of Moosa's arms, he bent himself forward with such
force as to fling that worthy completely over his

head, and lay him flat on the floor, but two of
the other slavers seized Harold's arms, a third
grasped him round the waist, and a fourth rapidly
secured the ropes that had been thrown around him.
Disco's mode of action, although somewhat different,
was quite as vigorous. On being grasped he uttered
a deep roar of surprise and rage, and, raising his foot,
struck out therewith at a man who advanced to seize
him in front. The kick not only tumbled the man
over a low bench and drove his head against the
wall, but it caused the kicker himself to recoil on
his foes behind with such force that they all fell on
the floor together, when by their united weight the
slavers managed to crush the unfortunate Disco, not,
indeed, into submission, but into inaction.
His tongue, however, not being tied, continued to
pour forth somewhat powerful epithets, until Harold
very strongly advised him to cease.
"If you want to retain a whole skin," he said,
"you had better keep a quiet tongue."
"Praps you're right, sir," said Disco, after a
moment's consideration, "but it ain't easy to shut
up in the succumstances."
After they had thoroughly secured the Englishmen,
the traders led them down the bank of the creek to
the spot where the dhow was moored. In the dark
it appeared to Harold and his companion to be the
same dhow, but this was not so. The boat by which

they had crossed the creek had been removed up
the water, and its place was now occupied by the
dhow into which had been put the maimed and
worn-out slaves of the band whose arrival we have
described. The hold of the little vessel was very
dark, nevertheless there was light enough to enable
the Englishmen to guess that the rows of black
objects just perceptible within it were slaves. If
they had entertained any uncertainty on this point,
the odour that saluted them as they passed to the
stern would have quickly dispelled their doubts.
It was evident from the manner of the slavers
that they did not now fear discovery, because they
talked loudly as they pushed off and rowed away.
Soon they were out of the creek, and the roar of
breakers was heard. Much caution was displayed
in guiding the dhow through these, for the channel
was narrow, and darkness rendered its position
almost indiscernible. At last the sail was hoisted,
the boat bent over to a smart breeze, and held away
in a north-easterly direction. As the night wore on
this breeze became lighter, and most of the crew
being asleep, deep silence prevailed on board the
slave-dhow, save that, ever and anon, a pitiful wail,
as of a sick child, or a convulsive sob, issued from
the hold.
Harold and Disco sat beside each other in the
stern, with an armed half-caste on each side, and

Yoosoof in front. Their thoughts were busy enough
at first, but neither spoke to the other. As the
night advanced both fell into an uneasy slumber.
When Harold awoke, the grey dawn was beginning
to break in the east, and there was sufficient light to
render objects dimly visible. At first he scarcely recol-
lected where he was, but the pain caused by the ropes
that bound him soon refreshed his memory. Casting
his eyes quickly towards the hold, his heart sank
within him at the sight he there beheld. Yoosoof's
Black Ivory was not of the best quality, but there
was a good deal of it, which rendered judicious
packing necessary. So many of his gang had be-
come worthless as an article of trade, through suffer-
ing on the way down to the coast, that the boat could
scarce contain them all. They were packed sitting
on their haunches in rows, each with his knees close
to his chin, and all jammed so tightly together that
none could rise up or lie down. Men, women, and
little children sat in this position with an expression of
indescribable hopelessness and apathy on their faces.
The infants, of which there were several, laymotionless
on their mothers' shrunken breasts. God help them!
they were indeed utterly worthless as pieces of
merchandise. The long journey and hard treatment
had worn all of them to mere skin and bone, and
many were suffering from bad sores caused by the
slave-irons and the unmerciful application of the

57
lash. No one knew better than Yoosoof that this
was his " damaged stock "—hopelessly damaged, and
he meant to make the best use he could of it.
The sun arose in all its splendour, and revealed
more clearly to the horrified Englishmen all the
wretchedness of the hold, but for a considerable time
they did not speak. The circumstances in which
they found themselves seemed to have bereft them
of the faculty of speech. The morning advanced,
and Yoosoof, with his men, took a frugal breakfast,
but they did not offer any to Harold or Disco. As
these unfortunates had, however, supped heartily,
they did not mind that. So much could not have
been said for the slaves. They had received their
last meal, of uncooked rice and water, a very insuffi-
cient one, about thirty-six hours before, and as they
watched the traders at breakfast their glaring eyes
told eloquently of their sufferings.
Had these been Yoosoof's valuable stock, his un-
damaged goods, he would have given them a suffi-
ciency of food to have kept them up to condition as
long as he possessed them ; but, being what they
were, a very little drop of water and a few grains
of raw rice at noon was deemed sufficient to prevent
absolute starvation.
"How can you have the heart," said Harold
at last, turning to Yoosoof, "to treat these poor
creatures so cruelly ?"


## p. 58 (#76) ##############################################

58
BLACK IVORY.
Yoosoof shrugged his shoulders.
"My fader treat them so; I follow my fader's
footsteps."
"But have you no pity for them ? Don't you
think they have hearts and feelings like ourselves ?"
returned Harold earnestly.
"No," replied the Arab coldly. "They have no
feelings. Hard as the stone. They care not for mother,
or child, or husband. Only brutes-cattle."
Harold was so disgusted with this reply that he
relapsed into silence.
Towards the afternoon, while the dhow was
running close in-shore, a vessel hove in sight on the
horizon. A few minutes sufficed to show that it was
a steamer. It was of course observed and closely
watched by the slave-dealers as well as by Harold
Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer, who became
sanguinely hopeful that it might turn out to be a
British man-of-war. Had they known that Yoosoof
was equally anxious and hopeful on that point, they
would have been much surprised; but the wily
Arab pretended to be greatly alarmed, and when the
Union Jack became clearly visible his excitement
increased. He gave some hurried orders to his
men, who laughed sarcastically as they obeyed
them.
" Yoosoof," said Harold, with a slight feeling of
exultation, "your plans seem about to miscarry ?"


## p. 59 (#77) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
59
"No, they not miscarry yet," replied the Arab,
with a grim smile.
"Tell me, Yoosoof," resumed Harold, prompted
by strong curiosity, "why have you carried us off
bound in this fashion ?"
Another smile, more grim than the former, crossed
the Arab's visage as he replied --
"Me carry you off 'cause that sheep," pointing to
the steamer, "lie not two mile off, near to town
of Governor Letotti, when I first met you. We not
want you to let thems know 'bout us, so I carry you
off, and I bind you 'cause you strong."
"Ha! that's plain and reasonable," returned
Harold, scarce able to restrain a laugh at the man's
cool impudence. "But it would appear that some
one else has carried the news; so, you see, you have
been outwitted after all."
"Perhaps. We shall see," replied the Arab, with
something approaching to a chuckle.
Altering the course of the boat, Yoosoof now
ran her somewhat off the shore, as if with a view to
get round a headland that lay to the northward.
This evidently drew the attention of the steamer-
which was none other than the 'Firefly'-for she at
once altered her course and ran in-shore so as to
intercept the dhow. Seeing this, Yoosoof turned
back and made for the land at a place where there
was a long line of breakers close to the shore. To

run amongst these seemed to be equivalent to
running on certain destruction, nevertheless the
Arab held on, with compressed lips and a frowning
brow. Yoosoof looked quite like a man who would
rather throw away his life than gratify his enemy,
and the Englishmen, who were fully alive to their
danger, began to feel rather uneasy-which was a
very pardonable sensation, when it is remembered
that their arms being fast bound, rendered them
utterly unable to help themselves in case of the boat
capsizing.
The 'Firefly' was by this time near enough to
hold converse with the dhow through the medium of
artillery. Soon a puff of white smoke burst from her
bow, and a round shot dropped a few yards astern
of the boat.
"That's a broad hint, my lad, so you'd better
give in," said Lillihammer, scarce able to suppress a
look of triumph.
Yoosoof paid not the slightest attention to the
remark, but held on his course.
"Surely you don't intend to risk the lives of these
poor creatures in such a surf?" said Harold anxiously;
"weak and worn as they are, their doom is sealed if
we capsize."
Still the Arab paid no attention, but continued to
gaze steadily at the breakers.
Harold, turning his eyes in the same direction,

61
observed something like a narrow channel running
through them. He was enough of a seaman to
understand that only one who was skilled in such
navigation could pass in safety.
"They're lowering a boat," said Disco, whose
attention was engrossed by the manquvres of the
Firefly
Soon the boat left the side of the vessel, which
was compelled to check her speed for fear of running
on the reef. Another gun was fired as she came
round, and the shot dropped right in front of the
dhow, sending a column of water high into the air.
Still Yoosoof held on until close to the breakers,
when, to the surprise of the Englishmen, he suddenly
threw the boat's head into the wind.
" You can steer," he said sternly to Disco.
" Come, take the helm an' go to your ship; or, if
you choose, go on the breakers."
He laughed fiercely as he said this, and next
moment plunged into the sea followed by his crew.
Disco, speechless with amazement, rose up and
sprang to the helm. Of course he could not use
his bound hands, but one of his legs answered
almost as well. He allowed the boat to come round
until the sail filled on the other tack, and then look-
ing back, saw the heads of the Arabs as they swam
through the channel and made for the shore. In a
few minutes they gained it, and, after uttering a

shout of defiance, ran up into the bushes and dis-
appeared.
Meanwhile the 'Firefly's' boat made straight for
the dhow, and was soon near enough to hail.
"Heave-to," cried an interpreter in Arabic.
" Speak your own mother tongue and I'll answer
ye," replied Disco.
" Heave-to, or I'll sink you," shouted Mr. Small,
who was in charge.
" I'm just agoin' to do it, sir," replied Disco,
running the dhow into the wind until the sail shook.
Another moment and the boat was alongside.
" Jump aboard and handle the sail, lads; I can't
help'ee no further," said Disco.
The invitation was unnecessary. The moment
the two boats touched, the blue-jackets swarmed on
board, cutlass in hand, and took possession.
"Why, what !—where did you come from ?" asked
the lieutenant, looking in profound astonishment at
Harold and his companion.
"We are Englishmen, as you see," replied Harold,
unable to restrain a smile; "have been wrecked and
caught by the villains who have just escaped you."
" I see-well, no time for talking just now; cut
them loose, Jackson. Make fast the sheet- now
then."
In a few mirutes the dhow ranged up alongside
the 'Firefly,' and our heroes, with the poor slaves,

were quickly transferred to the man-of-war's deck,
where Harold told his tale to Captain Romer.
As we have already stated, there were a number
of slaves on board the · Firefly, which had been
rescued from various Arab dhows. The gang now
received on board made their numbers so great, that
it became absolutely necessary to run to the nearest
port to discharge them.
We have already remarked on the necessity that
lies on our cruisers, when overladen with rescued
slaves, to run to a distant port of discharge to land
them, and on the readiness of the slave-traders to
take advantage of their opportunity, and run north
with full cargoes with impunity when some of the
cruisers are absent, for it is not possible for a small
fleet to guard upwards of a thousand miles of coast
effectually, or even in any degree usefully. If we
possessed a port of discharge—a British station and
settlement on the mainland of the east coast of
Africa, this difficulty would not exist. As it is,
although we place several men-of-war on a station,
the evil will not be cured, for just in proportion as
these are successful in making captures, will arise
the necessity of their leaving the station for weeks
at a time unguarded.
Thus it fell out on the occasion of which we write.
The presence of the large slave-freight on board the
man-of-war was intolerable. Captain Romer was

compelled to hurry off to the Seychelles Islands.
He sailed with the monsoon, but had to steam back
against it. During this period another vessel, simi-
larly freighted, had to run to discharge at Aden.
The seas were thus comparatively clear of cruisers.
The Arabs seized their opportunity, and a stream of
dhows and larger vessels swept out from the various
creeks and ports all along the East African coast,
filled to overflowing with slaves.
Among these were the four large dhows of our
friend Yoosoof. Having, as we have seen, made a
slight sacrifice of damaged and unsaleable goods and
chattels, in order to clear the way, he proceeded
north, touching at various ports where he filled up
his living cargo, and finally got clear off, not with
goods damaged beyond repair, but with thousands
of the sons and daughters of Africa in their youthful
prime.
In the interior each man cost him about four
yards of cotton cloth, worth a few pence; each
woman three yards, and each child two yards, and
of course in cases where he stole them, they cost
him nothing. On the coast these would sell at from
£8 to £12 each, and in Arabia at from £20 to £40.
We mention this to show what strong inducement
there was for Yoosoof to run a good deal of risk in
carrying on this profitable and accursed traffic.
But you must not fancy, good reader, that what


## p. 65 (#83) ##############################################

65
we have described is given as a specimen of the
extent to which the slave-trade on that coast is car-
ried. It is but as a specimen of the manner thereof.
It is certainly within the mark to say that at least
thirty thousand natives are annually carried away
as slaves from the east coast of Africa.
Sir Bartle Frere, in addressing a meeting of the
chief native inhabitants of Bombay in April 1873,
said,—"Let me assure you, in conclusion, that what
you have heard of the horrors of the slave-trade is
in no way exaggerated. We have seen so much of
the horrors which were going on that we can have
no doubt that what you read in books, which are so
often spoken of as containing exaggerations, is ex-
aggerated in no respect. The evil is much greater
than anything you can conceive. Among the poorer
class of Africans there is nothing like security from
fathers and mothers being put to death in order that
their children may be captured;"-and, referring to
the east coast alone, he says that—" thirty thousand,
or more, human beings, are exported every year from
Africa."
Dr. Livingstone tells us that, on the average,
about one out of every five captured human beings
reaches the coast alive. The other four perish or
are murdered on the way, so that the thirty thousand
annually exported, as stated by Sir Bartle Frere, re-
presents a loss of 150,000 human beings annually

from the east coast alone, altogether irrespective of
the enormous and constant flow of slaves to the
north by way of the White Nile and Egypt.
Yoosoof's venture was therefore but a drop in the
vast river of blood which is drained annually from
poor Africa's veins—blood which flows at the pre-
sent time as copiously and constantly as it ever did
in the days of old—blood which cries aloud to God
for vengeance, and for the flow of which we, as a
nation, are far from blameless.

CHAPTER IV.
IN WHICH OUR HEROES SEE STRANGE SIGHTS AT ZANZIBAR, AND
RESOLVE UPON TAKING A BOLD STEP.
BEFORE proceeding to the Seychelles, the 'Firefly'
touched at the island of Zanzibar, and there landed
our hero Harold Seadrift and his comrade in mis-
fortune, Disco Lillihammer.
Here, one brilliant afternoon, the two friends sat
down under a palm-tree to hold what Disco called
a palaver. The spot commanded a fine view of the
town and harbour of Zanzibar.
We repeat that the afternoon was brilliant, but it
is right to add that it required an African body and
mind fully to appreciate the pleasures of it. The
sun's rays were blistering, the heat was intense, and
the air was stifling. Harold lay down and gasped,
Disco followed his example, and sighed. After a
few minutes spent in a species of imbecile contem-
plation of things in general, the latter raised himself
to a sitting posture, and proceeded slowly to fill
and light his pipe. Harold was no smoker, but he
derived a certain dreamy enjoyment from gazing at

Disco, and wondering how he could smoke in such
hot weather.
"We'll get used to it, I s'pose, like the eels,"
observed Disco, when the pipe was in full blast.
"Of course we shall," replied Harold ; " and now
that we have come to an anchor, let me explain the
project which has been for some days maturing in
my mind."
" All right; fire away, sir," said the sailor, blow-
ing a long thin cloud from his lips.
"You are aware," said Harold," that I came out
here as supercargo of my father's vessel" (Disco
nodded), " but you are not aware that my chief
object in coming was to see a little of the world in
general, and of the African part of it in particular.
Since my arrival you and I have seen a few
things, which have opened up my mind in regard
to slavery; we have now been a fortnight in this
town, and my father's agent has enlightened me still
further on the subject, insomuch that I now feel
within me an intense desire to make an excursion
into the interior of Africa; indeed, I have resolved
to do so, for the purpose of seeing its capabilities in
a commercial point of view, of observing how the
slave-trade is conducted at its fountain-head, and of
enjoying a little of the scenery and the sport peculiar
to this land of Ham."
"W'y, you speaks like a book, sir," said Disco,


## p. 69 (#87) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
69
emitting a prolonged puff, " an' it ain't for the likes
o'me to give an opinion on that there ; but if I may
make bold to ax, sir, how do you mean to travel
on the back of a elephant or a ry-noceris ?-for it
seems to me that there ain't much in the shape o'
locomotives or 'busses hereabouts-not even cabs."
"I shall go in a canoe," replied Harold; "but my
reason for broaching the subject just now is, that I
may ask if you are willing to go with me."
"There's no occasion to ax that, sir ; I'm your
man-north or south, east or west, it's all the same
to me. I've bin born to roll about the world, and
it matters little whether I rolls ashore or afloat-
though I prefers the latter."
"Well, then, that's settled," said Harold, with a
look of satisfaction; "I have already arranged with
our agent here to advance me what I require in the
way of funds, and shall hire men and canoes when
we get down to the Zambesi—".
"The Zam—wot, sir ?"
" The Zambesi ; did you never hear of it before ?"
"Never, nor don't know wot it is, sir."
" It is a river; one of the largest on the east coast,
which has been well described by Dr. Livingstone,
that greatest of travellers, whose chief object in
travelling is, as he himself says, to raise the negroes
out of their present degraded condition, and free them
from the curse of slavery."


## p. 70 (#88) ##############################################

BLACK IVORY.
"That's the man to my mind," said Disco em-
phatically; "good luck to him.—But w'en d' you
mean to start for the Zambizzy, sir ?"
"In a few days. It will take that time to get
everything ready, and our money packed."
"Our money packed !" echoed the sailor, with a
look of surprise, "w'y, wot d'ye mean?"
"Just what I say. The money current in the
interior of Africa is rather cumbrous, being neither
more nor less than goods. You'll never guess what
sort-try."
" Rum," said Disco.
"No."
"Pipes and 'baccy."
Harold shook his head.
"Never could guess nothin'," said Disco, replacing
the pipe, which he had removed for a few moments
from his lips ; "I gives it up."
"What would you say to cotton cloth, and thick
brass wire, and glass beads, being the chief currency
in Central Africa ?" said Harold.
"You don't mean it, sir?"
"Indeed I do, and as these articles must be carried
in large quantities, if we mean to travel far into the
land, there will be more bales and coils than you and
I could well carry in our waistcoat pockets."
"That's true, sir," replied Disco, looking earnestly
at a couple of negro slaves who chanced to pass

71
along the neighbouring footpath at that moment,
singing carelessly. "Them poor critters don't seem
to be so miserable after all."
" That is because the nigger is naturally a jolly,
light-hearted fellow," said Harold, "and when his
immediate and more pressing troubles are removed
be accommodates himself to circumstances, and
sings, as you hear. If these fellows were to annoy
their masters and get a thrashing, you 'd hear them
sing in another key. The evils of most things don't
show on the surface. You must get behind the scenes
to understand them. You and I have already had
one or two peeps behind the scenes."
" We have indeed, sir," replied Disco, frowning,
and closing his fists involuntarily, as he thought of
Yoosoof and the dhow.
"Now, then," said Harold, rising, as Disco shook
the ashes out of his little black pipe, and placed
that beloved implement in the pocket of his coat,
" let us return to the harbour, and see what chance
there is of getting a passage to the Zambesi, in an
honest trading dhow-if there is such a thing in
Zanzibar."
On their way to the harbour they had to pass
through the slave-market. This was not the first time
they had visited the scene of this iniquitous traffic,
but neither Harold nor Disco could accustom them-
selves to it. Every time they entered the market,

their feelings of indignation became so intense that
it was with the utmost difficulty they could control
them. When Disco saw handsome negro men and
good-looking girls put up for public sale,—their
mouths rudely opened, and their teeth examined by
cool, calculating Arabs, just as if they had been do-
mestic cattle-his spirit boiled within him, his fingers
tingled, and he felt a terrible inclination to make a
wild attack, single-handed, on the entire population
of Zanzibar, though he might perish in the execution
of vengeance and the relief of his feelings ! We need
scarcely add that his discretion saved him. They soon
reached the small square in which the market was
held. Here they saw a fine-looking young woman
sold to a grave elderly Arab for a sum equal to about
eight pounds sterling. Passing hastily on, they ob-
served another "lot," a tall stalwart man, having
his various "points" examined, and stopped to see
the result. His owner, thinking, perhaps, that he
seemed a little sluggish in his movements, raised his
whip and caused it to fall upon his flank with such
vigour that the poor fellow, taken by surprise,
leaped high into the air, and uttered a yell of pain.
The strength and activity of the man were un-
questionable, and he soon found a purchaser.
But all the slaves were not fine-looking or stal-
wart like the two just referred to. Many of them
were most miserable objects. Some stood, others

73
were seated as if incapable of standing, so emaciated
were they. Not a few were mere skeletons, with
life and skin. Near the middle of the square, groups
of children were arranged—some standing up to be
inspected, others sitting down. These ranged from
five years and upwards, but there was not one that
betrayed the slightest tendency to mirth, and Disco
came to the conclusion that negro children do not
play, but afterwards discovered his mistake, finding
that their exuberant jollity "at home" was not
less than that of the children of other lands.
These little slaves had long ago been terrified, and
beaten, and starved into listless, apathetic and silent
creatures.
Further on, a row of young women attracted their
attention. They were ranged in a semicircle, all
nearly in a state of nudity, waiting to be sold. A
group of Arabs stood in front of them, conversing.
One of these women looked such a picture of woe
that Disco felt irresistibly impelled to stop. There
were no tears in her eyes; the fountain appeared to
have been dried up, but, apparently, without abating
the grief which was stamped in deep lines on her
young countenance, and which burst frequently
from her breast in convulsive sobs. Our Englishmen
· were not only shocked but surprised at this woman's
aspect, for their experience had hitherto gone to
show that the slaves usually became callous under

their sufferings. Whatever of humanity might have
originally belonged to them seemed to have been
entirely driven out of them by the cruelties and
indignities they had so long suffered at the hands of
their captors.
"Wot's the matter with her, poor thing ?" asked
Disco of a half-caste Portuguese, dressed in some-
thing like the garb of a sailor.
"Oh, notting," answered the man in broken
English, with a look of indifference," she have lose
her chile, dat all."
"Lost her child ? how—wot d'ee mean ?"
"Dey hab sole de chile," replied the man; "was
good fat boy, 'bout two-yer ole. S'pose she hab carry
him for months troo de woods, an' over de hills
down to coast, an' tink she keep him altogether.
But she mistake. One trader come here'bout one
hour past. He want boy-not want modder; so he
buy de chile. Modder fight a littil at first, but de
owner soon make her quiet. On, it notting at all.
She cry a littil—soon forget her chile, an' get all right."
"Come, I can't stand this," exclaimed Harold,
hastening away.
Disco said nothing, but, to the amazement of
the half-caste, he grasped him by the collar, and
hurled him aside with a degree of force that caused
him to stagger and fall with stunning violence to the

BLACK IVORY.
ground. Disco then strode away after his friend,
his face and eyes blazing with various emotions,
among which towering indignation predominated.
In a few minutes they reached the harbour, and,
while making inquiries as to the starting of trading
dhows for the south, they succeeded in calming their
feelings down to something like their ordinary
condition.
The harbour was crowded with dhows of all shapes
and sizes, most of them laden with slaves, some dis-
charging cargoes for the Zanzibar market, others
preparing to sail, under protection of a pass from the
Sultan, for Lamoo, which is the northern limit of the
Zanzibar dominions, and, therefore, of the so-called
"domestic " slave-trade.
There would be something particularly humorous
in the barefacedness of this august Sultan of Zanzi-
bar, if it were connected with anything less horrible
than slavery. For instance, there is something
almost amusing in the fact that dhows were sailing
every day for Lamoo with hundreds of slaves,
although that small town was known to be very
much overstocked at the time. It was also quite
entertaining to know that the commanders of the
French and English war-vessels lying in the harbour
at the time were aware of this, and that the Sultan
knew it, and that, in short, everybody knew it, but
that nobody appeared to have the power to prevent

· BLACK IVORY.
it! Even the Sultan who granted the permits or
passes to the owners of the dhows, although he
professed to wish to check the slave-trade, could not
prevent it. Wasn't that strange-wasn't it curious ?
The Sultan derived by far the largest portion of
his revenue from the tax levied on the export of
slaves—amounting to somewhere about £10,000 a
year—but that had nothing to do with it, of course
not, oh dear no! Then there was another very ludi-
crous phase of this oriental, not to say transcendental,
potentate's barefacedness. He knew, and probably
admitted, that about 2000, some say 4000, slaves a
year were sufficient to meet the home-consumption of
that commodity, and he also knew, but probably
did not admit, that not fewer than 30,000 slaves
were annually exported from Zanzibar to meet
this requirement of 4000! These are very curious
specimens of miscalculation which this barefaced
Sultan seems to have fallen into. Perhaps he was
a bad arithmetician. We have said that this state
of things was so at the time of our story, but we
may now add that it still is so in this year of grace
1873. Whether it shall continue to be so remains
to be seen!
Having spent some time in fruitless inquiry,
Harold and Disco at last, to their satisfaction, dis-
covered an Arab dhow of known good character,
See Captain Sulivan's Dhow.chasing in Zanzibar Waters, p. 111.

which was on the point of starting for the Zambesi
in the course of a few days, for the purpose of legiti-
mate traffic. It therefore became necessary that our
hero should make his purchases and preparations
with all possible speed. In this he was entirely
guided by his father's agent, a merchant of the town,
who understood thoroughly what was necessary for
the intended journey.
It is not needful here to enter into full details,
suffice it to say that among the things purchased by
Harold, and packed up in portable form, were a
number of bales of common unbleached cotton,
which is esteemed above everything by the natives
of Africa as an article of dress—if we may dignify
by the name of dress the little piece, about the size
of a moderate petticoat, which is the only clothing of
some, or the small scrap round the loins which is
the sole covering of other, natives of the interior!
There were also several coils of thick brass wire,
which is much esteemed by them for making brace-
lets and anklets; and a large quantity of beads of
various colours, shapes, and sizes. Of beads, we
are told, between five and six hundred tons are
annually manufactured in Great Britain for export
to Africa.
Thus supplied, our two friends embarked in the
dhow and set sail. Wind and weather were pro-
pitious. In few days they reached the mouths of

the great river Zambesi, and landed at the port of
Quillimane.
Only once on the voyage did they fall in with a
British cruiser, which ordered them to lay-to and
overhauled them, but, on the papers and everything
being found correct, they were permitted to pursue
their voyage.
The mouths of the river Zambesi are numerous; ex-
tending over more than ninety miles of the coast. On
the banks of the northern mouth stands—it would
be more appropriate to say festers—the dirty little
Portuguese town of Quillimane. Its site is low,
muddy, fever-haunted, and swarming with mosqui-
toes. No man in his senses would have built a village
thereon were it not for the facilities afforded for
slaving. At spring or flood tides the bar may be
safely crossed by sailing vessels, but, being far from
land, it is always dangerous for boats.
Here, then, Harold and Disco landed, and remained
for some time for the purpose of engaging men.
Appearing in the character of independent travel-
lers, they were received with some degree of hos-
pitality by the principal inhabitants. Had they
gone there as simple and legitimate traders, every
possible difficulty would have been thrown in their
way, because the worthy people, from the Governor
downwards, flourished, -or festered, by means
of the slave-trade, and legitimate commerce is

everywhere found to be destructive to the slave-
trade.
Dr. Livingstone and others tell us that thousands
upon thousands of negroes have of late years gone out
from Quillimane into slavery under the convenient
title of "free emigrants," their freedom being not
quite equal to that of a carter's horse, for while that
animal, although enslaved, is usually well fed, the
human animal is kept on rather low diet, lest his
spirit should rouse him to deeds of desperate violence
against his masters. All agricultural enterprise is
also effectually discouraged here. When a man
wants to visit his country farm he has to purchase
a permit from the Governor. If he wishes to go up
the river to the Portuguese towns of Senna or Tette,
a pass must be purchased from the Governor. In
fact it would weary the reader were we to enumerate
the various modes in which every effort of man to
act naturally, legitimately, or progressively is ham-
pered, unless his business be the buying and selling
of human beings.
At first Harold experienced great difficulty in
procuring men. The master of the trading dhow in
which he sailed from Zanzibar intended to remain
as short a time as possible at Quillimane, purposing
to visit ports further south, and as Harold had made
up his mind not to enter the Zambesi by the Quilli-
mane mouth, but to proceed in the dhow to one of

the southern mouths, he felt tempted to give up
the idea of procuring men until he had gone further
south.
" You see, Disco," said he, in a somewhat discon-
solate tone, "it won't do to let this dhow start with-
out us, because I want to get down to the East
Luavo mouth of this river, that being the mouth
which was lately discovered and entered by Dr.
Livingstone; but I'm not sure that we can procure
men or canoes there, and our Arab skipper either
can't or won't enlighten me."
"Ah !" observed Disco, with a knowing look," he
won't—that's where it is, sir. I've not a spark o'
belief in that man, or in any Arab on the coast. He's
a slaver in disguise, he is, an' so's every mother's
son of 'em."
" Well," continued Harold, " if we must start
without them and take our chance, we must; there
is no escaping from the inevitable; nevertheless. We
must exert ourselves to-day, because the dhow does
not sail till to-morrow evening, and there is no
saying what luck may attend our efforts before that
time. Perseverance, you know, is the only sure
method of conquering difficulties."
"That's so," said Disco; "them 's my sentiments
'xactly. Never say die-Stick at nothing—Nail yer
colours to the mast: them's the mottoes that I goes
in for—always s'posin' that you 're in the right."

81
"But what if you 're in the wrong, and the colours
are nailed ?" asked Harold, with a smile.
" W'y then, sir, of course I'd have to tear 'em
down."
" So that, perhaps, it would be better not to nail
them at all, unless you're very sure—eh ?".
"Oh, of course, sir," replied Disco, with solemn
emphasis. "You don't suppose, sir, that I would
nail 'em to the mast except I was sure, wery sure,
that I wos right ? But, as you wos a sayin', sir,
about the gittin' of them 'ere men."
Disco had an easy way of changing a subject
when he felt that he was getting out of his depth.
" Well, to return to that. The fact is, I would
not mind the men, for it's likely that men of some
sort will turn up somewhere, but I am very anxious
about an interpreter. Without an interpreter we
shall get on badly, I fear, for I can only speak
French, besides a very little Latin and Greek, none
of which languages will avail much among niggers."
Disco assumed a severely thoughtful expression
of countenance.
" That's true," he said, placing his right fist
argumentatively in his left palm, "and I'm afeard
I can't help you there, sir. If it wos to steer a ship
or pull a oar, or man the fore-tops'l yard in a gale
o'wind, or anything else in the seafarin' line, Disco

furrin' lingo at no price. I knows nothin' but my
mother tongue,-nevertheless, though I says it that
shouldn't, I does profess to be somewhat of a dab
at that. Once upon a time I spent six weeks in
Dublin, an' havin' a quick ear for moosic, I soon
managed to get up a strong dash o' the brogue; but
p'raps that wouldn't go far with the niggers."
About two hours after the above conversation,
while Harold Seadrift was walking on the beach, he
observed his faithful ally in the distance grasping a
short thickset man by the arm, and endeavouring to
induce him to accompany him, with a degree of
energy that fell little short of main force. The man
was evidently unwilling.
As the pair drew nearer, Harold overheard Disco's
persuasive voice :-
"Come now, Antonio, don't be a fool; it's the
best service you could enter. Good pay and hard
work, and all the grub that's goin'—what could a
man want more? It's true there's no grog, but we
don't need that in a climate where you've only got
to go out in the sun without yer hat, an' you'll be
as good as drunk in ten minutes any day."
"No, no, not possibil," remonstrated the man, whose
swarthy visage betrayed a mixture of cunning, fun,
and annoyance. He was obviously a half-caste of
the lowest type, but with more pretensions to wealth
than many of his fellows, inasmuch as he wore, be-

sides his loin-cloth, a white cotton shooting-coat
very much soiled, beneath the tails of which his
thin black legs protruded ridiculously.
" Here you are, sir," cried Disco, as he came up;
" here's the man for lingo : knows the native talkee,
as well as Portuguese, English, Arabic, and any-
thing else you like, as far as I know. Antonio's his
name. Come, sir, try him with Greek, or somethin'
o' that sort."
Harold had much ado to restrain a smile, but,
assuming a grave aspect, he addressed the man in
French, while Disco listened with a look of profound
respect and admiration.
"W'y, wot's wrong with 'ee, man," exclaimed Disco,
on observing the blank look of Antonio's counte-
nance; " don't 'ee savay that ?"
"I thought you understood Portuguese ?" said
Harold in English.
" So me do," replied Antonio quickly; "but dat
no Portigeese-dat Spanaish, me 'spose."
" What can you speak, then ?" demanded Harold
sternly.
"Portigeese, Arbik, Eengleesh, an' two, tree, four,
nigger lungwiches."
It was very obvious that, whatever Antonio spoke,
he spoke nothing correctly, but that was of no im-
portance so long as the man could make himself
understood. Harold therefore asked if he would

join his party as interpreter, but Antonio shook his
head.
" Why not, man—why not?" asked Harold im-
patiently, for he became anxious to secure him just
in proportion as he evinced disinclination to en-
gage.
"Speak up, Antonio, don't be ashamed; you've
no need to," said Disco.—" The fact is, sir, Antonio
tells me that he has just bin married, an' he don't
want to leave his wife."
" Very natural," observed Harold. "How long is
it since you were married ?"
" Von veek since I did bought her."
" Bought her!" exclaimed Disco, with a broad
grin ; " may I ax wot ye paid for her ?"
"Paid !" exclaimed the man, starting and opening
his eyes very wide, as if the contemplation of the
vast sum were too much for him; "lat me zee-me
pay me vife's pairyints sixteen yard ob cottin clothe,
an' for me's hut four yard morer."
" Ye don't say that ?" exclaimed Disco, with an
extended grin. " Is she young an' good-lookin'?".
"Yonge !" replied Antonio; "yis, ver yonge; not
mush more dan baby, an'exiquitely bootiful."
" Then, my good feller," said Disco, with a laugh,
" the sooner you leave her the better. A week is a
long time, an' absence, you know, as the old song
says, makes the heart grow fonder; besides. Mr.

Seadrift will give you enough to buy a dozen wives,
if 'ee want 'em."
" Yes, I'll pay you well," said Harold; " that is,
if you prove to be a good interpreter."
Antonio pricked up his ears at this.
" How mush vill 'oo gif ?" he asked.
" Well, let me think; I shall probably be away
three or four months. What would you say, Antonio,
to twenty yards of cotton cloth a month, and a gun
into the bargain at the end, if you do your work
well ?"
The pleased expression of Antonio's face could
not have been greater had he been offered twenty
pounds sterling a month. The reader may estimate
the value of this magnificent offer when we say that
a yard of cotton cloth was at that time sevenpence-
halfpenny, so that Antonio's valuable services were
obtained for about 12s. 6d. a month, and a gun which
cost Harold less than twenty shillings in Zanzibar.
We may remark here that Antonio afterwards
proved to be a stout, able, willing man, and a faith-
ful servant, although a most arrant coward.
From this time Harold's difficulties in regard to
men vanished. With Antonio's able assistance nine
were procured ; stout, young, able-bodied fellows they
were, and all more or less naked. Two of these were
half-caste brothers, named respectively José and
Oliveira ; two were half-wild negroes of the Somali

tribe named Nakoda and Conda; three were negroes
of the Makololo tribe, who had accompanied Dr.
Livingstone on his journey from the far interior of
Africa to the East Coast, and were named respec-
tively Jumbo, Zombo, and Masiko; and finally two,
named Songolo and Mabruki, were free negroes of
Quillimane. Thus the whole band, including Disco
and the leader, formed a goodly company of twelve
stout men.
Of course Harold armed them all with guns and
knives. Himself and Disco carried Enfield rifles;
besides which, Harold took with him a spare rifle of
heavy calibre, carrying large balls, mingled with tin
to harden them. This latter was intended for large
game. Landing near the East Luavo mouth of the
Zambesi, our hero was fortunate enough to procure
two serviceable canoes, into which he transferred
himself, his men, and his goods, and, bidding adieu
to the Arab skipper of the dhow, commenced his
journey into the interior of Africa.

CHAPTER V.
IN WHICH THE TRAVELLERS ENJOY THEMSELVES EXTREMELY, AND
DISCO LILLIHAMMER SEES SEVERAL ASTONISHING SIGHTS.
BEHOLD our travellers, then, fairly embarked on
the waters of the great African river Zambesi, in two
canoes, one of which is commanded by Harold Sea-
drift, the other by Disco Lillihammer.
Of course these enterprising chiefs were modest
enough at first to allow two of the Makololo men,
Jumbo and Zombo, to wield the steering oars, but
after a few days' practice they became sufficiently
expert, as Disco said, to take the helm, except when
strong currents rendered the navigation difficult, or
when the weather became so "piping hot" that none
but men clad in black skins could work.
We must however guard the reader here from sup-
posing that it is always piping hot in Africa. There
are occasional days when the air may be styled luke-
warm, when the sky is serene, and when all nature
seems joyful and enjoyable,-days in which a man
opens his mouth wide and swallows down the atmo-
sphere; when he feels his health and strength, and

rejoices in them, and when, if he be not an infidel,
he also feels a sensation of gratitude to the Giver of
all good.
On such a day, soon after entering the East Luavo
mouth of the Zambesi, the explorers, for such we
may almost venture to style them, ascended the
smooth stream close to the left bank, Harold leading,
Disco following closely in his wake.
The men rowed gently, as if they enjoyed the
sweet calm of early morning, and were unwilling to
disturb the innumerable flocks of wild-fowl that
chuckled among the reeds and sedges everywhere.
Harold sat in the stern, leaning back, and only dip-
ping the steering-oar lazily now and then to keep
the canoe from running on the bank, or plunging
into a forest of gigantic rushes. Disco, having re-
solved to solace himself with a whiff of his darling
pipe, had resigned "the helm " to Jumbo, and laid
himself in a position of comfort which admitted of
his resting his head on the gunwale in such a man-
ner that out of the corners of his eyes he could gaze
down into the water.
The part of the river they had reached was so per-
fectly still that every cloud in the sky, every man-
grove, root and spray, and every bending bulrush,
was perfectly reproduced in the reflected world be-
low. Plaintive cries of wild-fowl formed appropriate
melody, to which chattering groups of monkeys

and croaking bull-frogs contributed a fine tenor and
bass.
"Hallo, Disco !" exclaimed Harold in a subdued
key, looking over his shoulder.
"Ay, ay, sir ?" sighed the seaman, without mov-
ing his position.
"Range up alongside ; I want to speak to you."
"Ay, ay, sir.—Jumbo, you black-faced villain,
d'ee hear that ? give way and go 'longside."
Good-humoured Jumbo spoke very little English,
but had come to understand a good deal during his
travels with Dr. Livingstone. He wrinkled his
visage and showed his brilliant teeth on receiving
the order. Muttering a word to the men, and giving
a vigorous stroke, he shot up alongside of the leader's
canoe.
"You seem comfortable," said Harold, with a
laugh, as Disco's vast visage appeared at his elbow.
"I is."
"Isn't this jolly ?" continued Harold.
"No, sir, 'taint."
"Why, what d' you mean?"
"I means that jolly ain't the word, by a long way,
for to express the natur' o'my feelin's. There ain't
wor a fylosipher, now, I'd coin a word for the oc-
casion. P'raps," continued Disco, drawing an un-
usually long whiff from his pipe, "p'raps, not bein'a

fylosipher, I might nevertheless try to coin one.
Wot's the Latin, now, for heaven?"
" Cælum," replied Harold.
" Sailum, eh? An' wot's the 'arth ?"
"Terra."
" Terra ? well now, wot rediklous names to give to
'em," said Disco, shaking his head gravely, "I can't
see why the ancients couldn't ha' bin satisfied with
the names that we'd given 'em. Hows'ever, that's
neither here nor there. My notion o' the state o'
things that we've got into here, as they now stand,
is, that they are sailumterracious, which means
heaven-upon-earth, d'ee see?"
As Disco pronounced the word with a powerful
emphasis on the u-m part of it, the sound was
rather effective, and seemed to please him.
"Right, you're right, or nearly so," replied Harold ;
" but don't you think the word savours too much of
perfection, seeing that breakfast would add to the
pleasure of the present delightful state of things, and
make them even more sailumterracious than they
are ?"
"No, sir, no; the word ain't too parfect," replied
Disco, with a look of critical severity; "part of it is
'arth, and 'arth is imparfect, bein' susceptible of a
many improvements, among which undoubtedly is
breakfast, likewise dinner an' supper, to say nothin'
of lunch an' tea, which is suitable only for babbies an'

wimen; so I agrees with you, sir, that the state o'
things will be sailumterraciouser if we goes ashore
an' has breakfast."
He tapped the head of his very black little pipe
on the edge of the canoe, and heaved a sigh of con-
tentment as he watched the ash-ball that floated
away on the stream; then, rousing himself, he seized
the steering-oar and followed Harold into a small
creek, which was pleasantly overshadowed by the
rich tropical foliage of that region.
While breakfast was being prepared by Antonio,
whose talents as chef-de-cuisine were of the highest
order, Harold took his rifle and rambled into the
bush in search of game-any kind of game, for at
that time he had had no experience whatever of the
sport afforded by the woods of tropical Africa, and,
having gathered only a few vague ideas from
books, he went forth with all the pleasurable ex-
citement and expectation that we may suppose
peculiar to discoverers.
Disco Lillihammer having only consumed his
first pipe of tobacco, and holding it to be a duty
which he owed to himself to consume two before
breakfast, remained at the camp-fire to smoke and
chaff Antonio, whose good-nature was only equalled
by his activity.
"Wot have 'ee got there?" inquired Disco, as
Antonio poured a quantity of seed into a large pot.

"Dis ? vy, hims be mapira," replied the interpre-
ter, with a benignant smile. "Hims de cheef food
ob dis konterie."
It must be remarked here that Antonio's English,
having been acquired from all sorts of persons, in
nearly every tropical part of the globe, was some-
what of a jumble, being a compound of the broken
English spoken by individuals among the Germans,
French, Portuguese, Arabs, and Negroes with whom
he had at various times associated, modified by his
own ignorance, and seasoned with a dash of his own
inventive fancy.
" Is it good ?" asked Disco.
" Goot!" exclaimed Antonio. Being unable to
find words to express himself, the enthusiastic cook
placed his hand on the region which was destined
ere long to become a receptacle for the mapira, and
rolled his eyes upwards in rapture. " Hah! 00
sall see behind long."
"Before long, you mean," observed the seaman.
"Dat all same ting, s'long's you onerstand him,"
replied Antonio complacently.—"Bring vatter now,
Jumbo. Put him in careful. Not spill on de fire
—20—goot."
Jumbo filled up the kettle carefully, and a broad
grin overspread his black visage, partly because he
was easily tickled into a condition of risibility by
the cool off-hand remarks of Disco Lillihammer,

93
and partly because, having acquired his own small
smattering of English from Dr. Livingstone, he was
intelligent enough to perceive that in regard to
Antonio's language there was something peculiar.
"Now, go fitch noder kittle-queek.".
"Yis, sar—20-goot," replied Jumbo, mimicking
the interpreter, and going off with a vociferous laugh
at his little joke, in which he was joined by his sable
clansmen, Masiko and Zombo.
"Hims got 'nuff of impoodidence," said the inter-
preter, as he bustled about his avocations.
"He's not the only one that's got more than
enough impoodidence," said Disco, pushing a fine
straw down the stem of his "cutty," to make it
draw better. "I say, Tony" (our regardless seaman
had already thus mutilated his name), " you seem
to have plenty live stock in them parts."
"Plenty vat ?" inquired the interpreter, with a
perplexed expression.
"Why, plenty birds and beasts, live stock we
calls it, meanin' thereby livin' creeturs." He pointed
towards an opening in the mangroves, through which
were visible the neighbouring mud and sand flats,
swarming with wild-fowl, and conspicuous among
which were large flocks of pelicans, who seemed to
be gorging themselves comfortably from an ap-
parently inexhaustible supply of fish in the pools
left by the receding tide.

'
"Ho, yis, me perceive; yis, plenty bird and
beast-fishes too, and crawbs-look dare."
He pointed to a part of the sands nearest to their
encampment, which appeared to be alive with some
small creatures.
"That's coorious," said Disco, removing his pipe,
and regarding the phenomenon with some interest.
"No, 'taint koorous, it's crawbs," replied Antonio.
" Crabs, is it ?" said Disco, rising and sauntering
down to the sands; for he possessed an inquiring
mind, with a special tendency to investigate the
habits (pranks, as he called them) of the lower
animals, which, in other circumstances, might have
made him a naturalist.
Muttering to himself—he was fond of muttering
to himself, it felt companionable,—"coorious, very
coorious, quite 'stroanary," he crept stealthily to the
edge of the mangroves, and there discovered that the
sands were literally alive with myriads of minute
crabs, which were actively engaged-it was supposed
by those who ought to know best--in gathering
their food. The moment the tide ebbed from any
part of the sands, out came these crablets in swarms,
and set to work, busy as bees, ploughing up the
sand, and sifting it, apparently for food, until the
whole flat was rendered rough by their incessant
labours. Approaching cautiously, Disco observed
that each crab, as he went along sidewise, gathered

side
a round bit of moist sand at his mouth, which was
quickly brushed away by one of his claws, and
replaced by another, and another, as fast as they
could be brushed aside.
"Eatin' sand they are !" muttered Disco in sur-
prise; but presently the improbability of sand being
very nutritious food, even for crabs, forced itself on
him, and he muttered his conviction that they "was
scrapin' for wittles."
Having watched the crabs a considerable time,
and observed that they frequently interrupted their
labours to dart suddenly into their holes and out
again—for the purpose, he conjectured, of "havin'
a drop o' summat to wet their whistles,"— Disco
thrust the cutty into his vest pocket, and walked a
little further out on the flat, in the hope of discover-
ing some new objects of interest. Nor was he disap-
pointed. Besides finding that the pools left by the
tide swarmed with varieties of little fish—many of
them being "coorious,"—he was fortunate enough
to witness a most surprising combat.
It happened thus :—Perceiving, a little to his
right, some small creature hopping about on the sand
near to a little pool, he turned aside to observe it
more closely. On his drawing near, the creature
jumped into the pool. Disco advanced to the edge,
gazed intently into the water, and saw nothing ex-
cept his own reflected image at the bottoin. Pre-

sently the creature reappeared. It was a small fish
--a familiar fish, too—which he had known in the
pools of his native land by the name of blenny. As
the blenny appeared to wish to approach the edge
of the pool, Disco retired, and, placing a hand on
each knee, stooped, in order to make himself as
small as possible. He failed, the diminution in his
height being fully counterbalanced by the latitudinal
extension of his elbows !
Presently the blenny put its head out of the
water, and looked about. We speak advisedly. The
blenny is altogether a singular, an exceptional fish.
It can, and does, look sidewise, upwards and down-
wards, with its protruding eyes, as knowingly, and
with as much vivacity, as if it were a human being.
This power in a fish has something of the same
awesome effect on an observer that might possibly
result were a horse to raise its head and smile at
him.
Seeing that the coast was clear, for Disco stood
as motionless as a mangrove tree, blenny hopped
upon the dry land. The African blenny is a sort of
amphibious animal, living nearly as much out of the
water as in it. Indeed its busiest time, we are told,
is at low water, when, by means of its pectoral fins
it crawls out on the sand and raises itself into some-
thing of a standing attitude, with its bright eyes

keeping a sharp look-out for the light-coloured flies
on which it feeds.
For several seconds Disco gazed at the fish, and
the fish gazed around, even turning its head a little,
as well as its eyes, on this side and on that. Pre-
sently a small fly, with that giddy heedlessness which
characterizes the race, alighted about two inches in
front of blenny's nose. Instantly the fish leaped
that vast space, alighted with its underset mouth
just over the fly, which immediately rose into it
and was entombed.
" Brayvo !" passed through Disco's brain, but no
sound issued from his lips.
Presently another of the giddy ones alighted in
front of blenny about a foot distant. This appeared
to be much beyond his leaping powers, for, with a
slow, stealthy motion, like a cat, he began deliberately
to stalk his victim. The victim appeared to be blind,
for it took no notice of the approaching monster.
Blenny displayed marvellous powers of self-control,
for he moved on steadily without accelerating his
speed until within about two inches of his prey-
then he leapt as before, and another fly was en-
tombed.
"Well done !" exclaimed Disco, mentally, but
still his lips and body were motionless as before.
At this point an enemy, in the shape of another
blenry, appeared on the scene. It came up out of a

small pool close at hand, and seemed to covet the
first blenny's pool, and to set about taking possession
of it as naturally as if it had been a human being;
for, observing, no doubt, that its neighbour was busily
engaged, it moved quietly in the direction of the
coveted pool. Being a very little fish, it was not
observed by Disco, but it was instantly noticed by
the first blenny, which, being rather the smaller of
the two, we shall style the Little one.
Suddenly Big Blenny threw off all disguise, bound-
ed towards the pool, which was about a foot square,
and plunged in. No mortal blenny could witness this
unwarrantable invasion of its hearth and home with-
out being stirred to indignant wrath. With eyes that
seemed to flash fire, and dorsal fin bristling up with
rage, Little Blenny made five tremendous leaps of
full three inches each, and disappeared. Another
moment and a miniature storm ruffled the pool; for
a few seconds the heavings of the deep were awful;
then, out jumped Big Blenny and tried to flee, but
out jumped Little Blenny and caught him by the
tail; round turned the big one and caught the other
by the jaw.
" Hallo, Disco ! breakfast's ready — where are
you?" shouted Harold from the woods.
Disco replied not. It is a question whether he
heard the hail at all, so engrossed was he in this
remarkable fight.

"Brayvo !" he exclaimed aloud, when Little Blenny
shook his big enemy off and rolled over him.
" Cleverly done!" he shouted, when Big Blenny
with a dart took refuge in the pool.
"I knowed it," he cried approvingly, when Little
Blenny forced him a second time to evacuate the
premises, "Go in an' win, little 'un," thought Disco.
Thus the battle raged furiously, now in the water,
now on the sand, while the excited seaman danced
round the combatants—both of whom appeared to
have become deaf and blind with rage—and gave
them strong encouragement, mingled with appro-
priate advice and applause. In fact Disco's delight
would have been perfect had the size of the belli-
gerents admitted of his patting the little blenny
on the back; but this of course was out of the
question !
At last, having struck, worried, bitten, and chased
each other by land and sea for several minutes, these
pugnacious creatures seized each other by their re-
spective throats, like two bull-dogs, and fell ex-
hausted on the sand.
"It's a draw !" exclaimed Disco, rather disap-
pointed.
"No, 'tain't," he said, as Little Blenny, reviving,
rose up and renewed the combat more furiously than
ever; but it was soon ended, for Big Blenny sud-
denly turned and fled to his own pool. Little Blenny

did not crow; he did not even appear to be elated.
He evidently felt that he had been called on to per-
form a disagreeable but unavoidable duty, and deemed
it quite unnecessary to wave banners, fire guns, or
ring bells in celebration of his victory, as he dived
back into his pool amid the ringing cheers of Disco
Lillihammer.
"Upon my word, if you have not gone stark mad,
you must have had a sun-stroke," said Harold,
coming forward, "what's the matter ?"
"Too late! too late !" cried Disco, in a mingled
tone of amusement and regret.
"D'ye think it is ? Are you incurable already ?"
asked his friend.
"Too late to see the most a-stonishin' scrimmage
I ever did behold in my life," said Disco.
The description of this scrimmage gave the worthy
seaman a subject for conversation and food for medi-
tation during the greater part of the time spent over
the morning meal, and there is no saying how long
he would have kept referring to and chuckling over
it-to the great admiration and sympathy of the
black fellows, who are, as a race, excessively fond
of jocularity and fun-had not another of the
denizens of the mangrove jungle diverted his atten-
tion and thoughts rather suddenly.
This was a small monkey, which, seated on a
branch overhead, peered at the breakfast-party from

among the leaves, with an expression of inquiry and
of boundless astonishment that it is quite impossible
to describe. Surprise of the most sprightly nature, if
we may say so, sat enthroned on that small monkey's
countenance, an expression which was enhanced by
the creature's motions, for, not satisfied with taking
a steady look at the intruders from the right side of
a leaf, it thrust forward its little black head on the
left side of it, and then under it, by way of variety ;
but no additional light seemed to result from these
changes in the point of observation, for the surprise
did not diminish.
In one of its intent stares it caught the eye of
Disco. The seaman's jaws stopped, as if suddenly
locked, and his eyes opened to their widest.
The monkey seemed to feel uneasily that it had
attracted attention, for it showed the smallest
possible glimpse of its teeth. The action, coupled
with the leafy shadows which fell on its countenance,
had the effect of a smile, which caused Disco to
burst into a loud laugh and point upwards. To
bound from its position to a safer retreat, and thence
stare at Disco with deep indignation, and a threaten-
ing display of all its teeth and gums, in addition to
its looks of surprise, was the work of a moment on
the part of the small monkey, whereat Disco burst
into a renewed roar of laughter, in which he was
joined by the whole party.

"Are there many othem fellows hereabouts ?"
inquired the seaman of Antonio.
"Ho, yis, lots ob 'em. Tousands ebery whars ;
see, dare am morer."
He pointed to another part of the umbrageous
canopy overhead, where the face of a still smaller
monkey was visible, engaged, like the previous one,
in an earnest scrutiny of the party, but with a
melancholy, rather than a surprised, expression of
visage.
"Wot a miserable, broken-hearted thing!" said
Disco, grinning, in which act he was immediately
copied by the melancholy monkey, though from
different motives.
Disco was very fond of monkeys. All his life he
had felt a desire to pat and fondle those shivering
creatures which he had been accustomed to see on
barrel-organs in his native land, and the same strong
impulse came over him now.
"Wot a pity the creeturs smell so bad, and ain't
cleanly," he remarked, gazing affectionately up
among the leaves, "they'd make such capital pets;
why, there's another."
This remark had reference to a third monkey, of
large dimensions and fierce countenance, which at
that moment rudely thrust the melancholy monkey
aside and took its place. The latter, with a humble
air and action, took up a new position, somewhat

nearer to the fire, where its sad countenance was
more distinctly seen.
"Well, it does seem a particularly sorrowful
monkey that," said Harold, laughing, as he helped
himself to another canful of tea.
"The most miserable objic' I ever did see," ob-
served Disco.
The negroes looked at each other and laughed.
They were accustomed to monkeys, and took little
notice of them, but they were mightily tickled by
Disco's amusement, for he had laid down his knife
and fork, and shook a good deal with internal
chuckling, as he gazed upwards.
"One would suppose, now," he said softly, " that
it had recently seen its father and mother, and all
its brothers and sisters, removed by a violent death,
or sold into slavery."
"Ha! they never see that," said Harold ; "the
brutes may fight and kill, but they never enslave
each other. It is the proud prerogative of man to
do that."
"That's true, sir, worse luck, as Paddy says,"
rejoined Disco. "But look there : wot's them
coorious things round the creetur's waist-a pair
o'the werry smallest hands-and, hallo ! a face no
bigger than a button! I do believe that it's—"
Disco did not finish the sentence, but he was right.
The small melancholy monkey was a mother!


## p. 104 (#124) ############################################

Probably that was the cause of its sorrow. It is
a touching thought that anxiety for its tiny offspring
perhaps had furrowed that monkey's visage with the
wrinkles of premature old age. That danger threat-
ened it on every side was obvious, for no sooner had
it taken up its new position, after its unceremonious
ejection by the fierce monkey, than the sprightly
monkey before referred to conceived a plot which
it immediately proceeded to carry into execution.
Observing that the tail of the sad one hung down in
a clear space below the branch on which it sat, the
sprightly fellow quickly, but with intense caution
and silence, crept towards it, and when within a
yard or so sprang into the air and caught the tail !
A wild shriek, and what Disco styled a "scrim-
mage," ensued, during which the mother monkey gave
chase to him of the lively visage, using her arms,
legs, and tail promiscuously to grasp and hold on to
branches, and leaving her extremely little one to
look out for itself. This it seemed quite capable of
doing, for no limpet ever stuck to a solid rock with
greater tenacity than did that infant to the maternal
waist throughout the chase. The hubbub appeared
to startle the whole monkey race, revealing the fact
that troops of other monkeys had, unobserved, been
gazing at the strangers in silent wonder, since the
time of their landing.
Pleasant, however, though this state of things

undeniably was, it could not be expected to last.
Breakfast being concluded, it became necessary that
Disco should tear himself from the spot, which,
having first solaced himself with a pipe, he did with
a good grace, remarking, as he re-embarked and
" took the helm" of his canoe, that he had got more
powerful surprises that morning than he had ever
before experienced in any previous twelvemonth of
his life.
Before long he received many more surprises,
especially one of a very different and much less
pleasant nature, an account of which will be found
in the next chapter.

CHAPTER VI.
DESCRIBES SEVERAL NEW AND SURPRISING INCIDENTS, WHICH MUST BE
READ TO BE FULLY APPRECIATED,
To travel with one's mouth and eyes opened to
nearly their utmost width in a state of surprised
stupefaction, may be unavoidable, but it cannot be
said to be either becoming or convenient. Atten-
tion in such a case is apt to be diverted from the
business in hand, and flies have a tendency to im-
molate themselves in the throat.
Nevertheless, inconvenient though the condition
was, our friend Disco Lillihammer was so afflicted
with astonishment at what he heard and saw in this
new land, that he was constantly engaged in swal-
lowing flies and running his canoe among shallows
and rushes, insomuch that he at last resigned the
steering-oar until familiarity with present circum-
stances should tone him down to a safe condition
of equanimity.
And no wonder that Disco was surprised; no
wonder that his friend Harold Seadrift shared in
his astonishment and delight, for they were at once,

and for the first time in their lives, plunged into
the very heart of jungle life in equatorial Africa !
Those who have never wandered far from the com-
paratively tame regions of our temperate zone, can
form but a faint conception of what it is to ramble in
the tropics, and therefore can scarcely be expected
to sympathize fully with the mental condition of
our heroes as they ascended the Zambesi. Every-
thing was so thoroughly strange; sights and sounds
so vastly different from what they had been accus-
tomed to see and hear, that it seemed as though
they had landed on another planet. Trees, shrubs,
flowers, birds, beasts, insects, and reptiles, all were
unfamiliar, except, indeed, one or two of the more
conspicuous trees and animals, which had been so
imprinted on their minds by means of nursery
picture-books that, on first beholding them, Disco
unconsciously paid these books the compliment of
saying that the animals "wos uncommon' like the
picturs."
Disco's mental condition may be said, for the
first two or three days, to have been one of gentle
ever-flowing surprise, studded thickly with little
bursts of keen astonishment.
The first part of the river ran between mangrove
jungle, in regard to which he remarked that "them
there trees had legs like crabs," in which observation
he was not far wrong, for, when the tide was out,

the roots of the mangroves rose high out of the
mud, forming supports, as it were, for the trees to
stand on.
But it was the luxuriance of the vegetation that
made the most powerful impression on the travellers.
It seemed as if the various groups and families of
the vegetable kingdom had been warmed by the sun
into a state of unwonted affection, for everything
appeared to entertain the desire to twine round and
embrace everything else. One magnificent screw-
palm in particular was so overwhelmed by affectionate
parasites that his natural shape was almost entirely
concealed. Others of the trees were decked with
orchilla weed. There were ferns so gigantic as to
be almost worthy of being styled trees, and palm-
bushes so sprawling as to suggest the idea of huge
vegetable spiders. Bright yellow fruit gleamed
among the graceful green leaves of the mangroves;
wild date-palms gave variety to the scene, if that
had been needed, which it was not, and masses of
umbrageous plants with large yellow flowers grew
along the banks, while, down among the underwood,
giant roots rose in fantastic convolutions above
ground, as if the earth were already too full, and
there wasn't room for the whole of them. There
was an antediluvian magnificence, a prehistoric
snakiness, a sort of primeval running-to-seedness,
which filled Harold and Disco with feelings of awe,

109
and induced a strange, almost unnatural tendency to
regard Adam and Eve as their contemporaries.
Animal life was not wanting in this paradise.
Frequently did our seaman give vent to "Hallo!"
"There they go !" "Look out for the little un wi'
the long tail !" and similar expressions, referring of
course to his favourite monkeys, which ever and
anon peered out upon the strangers with looks of
intensity, for whatever their expression might be-
sadness, grief, interrogation, wrath, surprise—it was
always in the superlative degree. There were birds
also, innumerable. One, styled the " king-hunter,"
sang wild exultant airs, as if it found king-hunting
to be an extremely exhilarating occupation, though
what sort of kings it hunted we cannot tell. Per-
haps it was the king of beasts, perhaps the king-
fisher, a bright specimen of which was frequently
seen to dart out from the banks, but we profess
ignorance on this point. There were fish-hawks also,
magnificent fellows, which sat in regal dignity on
the tops of the mangrove trees, and the glossy ibis,
with others of the feathered tribe too numerous to
mention.
Large animals also were there in abundance,
though not so frequently seen as those which have
been already mentioned. Disco occasionally made
known the fact that such, or something unusual,
had transpired, by the sudden and violent exclama-
a-

tion of "What's that ?" in a voice so low that "that,"
whatever it might be, sometimes bolted or took to
flight before any one else caught sight of it.
"Hallo!" he exclaimed, on one such occasion, as
the canoes turned a bend of the river.
"What now?" demanded Harold, looking at his
companion to observe the direction of his eyes.
"I'm a Dutchman," exclaimed Disco in a hoarse
whisper that might have been heard half a mile off,
"if it's not a zebra !"
"So it is; my rifle-look sharp!" said Harold
eagerly.
The weapon was handed to him, but before it
could be brought to bear, the beautiful striped crea-
ture had tossed its head, snorted, whisked its tail,
kicked up its heels, and dashed into the jungle.
"Give way, lads ; let's after him," shouted Disco,
turning the canoe's bow to shore.
"Hold on," cried Harold; " you might as well go
after a needle in a haystack or a locomotive."
" So I might," admitted Disco, with a mortified
air, resuming his course ; " but it ain't in reason to
expect a feller to keep quiet wen he sees one o' the
very picturs of his child'ood, so to speak, come alive
an' kick up its heels like that."
Buffaloes were also seen in the grassy glades, but
it proved difficult to come within range of them;
also wart-hogs, and three different kinds of antelope.

Of these last Harold shot several, and they were
found to be excellent food.
Human beings were also observed, but those first
encountered fled at the sight of the white men as if
they had met with their worst foes; and such was
in very truth the case,—if we may regard the Portu-
guese half-castes of that coast as white men,—for
these negroes were runaway slaves, who stood the
chance of being shot or drowned, or whipped to
death if re-captured.
Other animals they saw-some queer, some terri-
ble, nearly all strange—and last, though not least,
the hippopotamus.
When Disco first saw this ungainly monster he
was bereft of speech for some minutes. The usual
"Hallo !" stuck in his throat and well-nigh choked
him. He could only gasp, and point.
" Ay, there goes a hippopotamus," said Harold,
with the easy nonchalance of a man who had been
to the Zoological Gardens, and knew all about it.
Nevertheless it was quite plain that Harold was
much excited, for he almost dropped his oar over-
board in making a hasty grasp at his rifle. Before
he could fire, the creature gaped wide, as if in
laughter, and dived.
" Unfortunate !" said Harold, in a philosophically
careless tone ; " never mind, we shall see lots more
of them."

" Ugliness embodied !" said Disco, heaving a deep
sigh.
"But him 's goot for eat," said Antonio, smacking
his lips.
" Is he?" demanded Disco of Jumbo, whose en-
joyment of the sailor's expressive looks was so great,
that whenever the latter opened his lips the former
looked back over his shoulder with a broad grin of
expectation.
" Ho yis; de hiputmus am fust-rate grub for dis
yer boy," replied the negro, rolling his red tongue
inside his mouth suggestively.
"He never eats man, does he ?" inquired Disco.
"Nevair," replied Antonio.
" He looks as if he might," returned the seaman;
" anyhow, he's got a mouth big enough to do it.
You're quite sure he don't, I 'spose ?"
" Kite sure an' sartin; but me hab seen him tak
mans," said Antonio.
« Tak mans, wot d'ee mean by that?"
" Tak him," repeated Antonio. "Go at him's
canoe or boat—bump with him's head-dash in de
timbers—capsize, so's man hab to swim shore-all
as got clear ob de crokidils."
While Disco was meditating on this unpleasant
trait of character in the hippopotamus, the specimen
which they had just seen, or some other member of
his family, having compassion no doubt on the sea-

man's ignorance, proceeded to illustrate its method
of attack then and there by rising suddenly under
the canoe with such force, that its head and shoulders
shot high out of the water, into which it fell with a
heavy splash. Harold's rifle being ready, he fired
just as it was disappearing.
Whether he hit or not is uncertain, but next
moment the enraged animal rose again under Disco's
canoe, which it nearly lifted out of the water in its
efforts to seize it in its mouth. Fortunately the
canoe was too flat for its jaws to grip; the monster's
blunt teeth were felt, as well as heard, to grind
across the planks; and Disco being in the stern,
which was raised highest, was almost thrown over-
board by the jerk.
Rising about two yards off, the hippopotamus
looked savagely at the canoe, and was about to
dive again when Harold gave it a second shot.
The large gun being fortunately ready, had been
handed to him by one of the Makololo men. The
heavy ball took effect behind the eye, and killed the
animal almost instantaneously. The hippopotamus
usually sinks when shot dead, but in this case they
were so near that, before it had time to sink, Zombo,
assisted by his friend Jumbo, made a line fast to it,
and it was finally dragged to the shore. The land-
ing, however, was much retarded by the crocodiles,
which now showed themselves for the first time,

and kept tugging and worrying the carcase much as
a puppy tugs and worries a ladies' muff, afford-
ing Disco and his friend strong reason to congra-
tulate themselves that the canoe had not been
overturned.
The afternoon was pretty well advanced when the
landing was accomplished on a small sandy island,
and as the spot was suitable for encamping, they
determined to remain there for the night, and feast.
There are many points of resemblance between
savage and civilized festivities. Whether the per-
formers be the black sons of Africa, or the white
fathers of Europe, there is the same powerful tend-
ency to eat too much, and the same display of good-
fellowship; for it is an indisputable fact that feed-
ing man is amiable, unless, indeed, he be dyspeptic.
There are also, however, various points of difference.
The savage, owing to the amount of fresh air and
exercise which he is compelled to take, usually eats
with greater appetite, and knows nothing of equine
dreams or sleepless nights. On the whole, we in-
cline to the belief that, despite his lack of refinement
and ceremony, the savage has the best of it in this
matter.
Disco Lillihammer's visage, during the progress
of that feast, formed a study worthy of a physiog-
nomist. Every new achievement, whether trifling or
important, performed by the Makololo triad, Jumbo,

115
Zombo, and Masiko-every fresh hippopotamus steak
skewered and set up to roast by the half-caste
brothers José and Oliveira-every lick bestowed on
their greasy fingers by the Somali negroes Nakoda
and Conda, and every sigh of intense satisfaction
heaved by the so-called "freemen" of Quillimane,
Songolo and Mabruki, was watched, commented on,
and, if we may say so, reflected in the animated
countenance of the stout seaman with such variety
of expression, and such an interesting compound of
grin and wrinkle, that poor Jumbo, who gazed at
him over hippopotamus ribs and steaks, and tried
hard not to laugh, was at last compelled to turn
away his eyes, in order that his mouth might have
fair play.
But wonderful, sumptuous, and every way satis-
factory though that feast was, it bore no comparison
whatever to another feast carried on at the same
time by another party, about fifty yards off, where the
carcase of the hippopotamus had been left half in
and half out of the water—for, of course, being fully
more than a ton in weight, only a small portion of
the creature was appropriated by the canoe-men.
The negroes paid no attention whatever to this other
festive party; but in a short time Disco turned his
head to one side, and said —
"W'y, wot's that splashin' I hears goin' on over
there ?"


## p. 116 (#136) ############################################

116
BLACK IVORY.
"I suspect it must be some beast or other that
has got hold of the carcase," replied Harold, who
was himself busy with a portion of the same.
"Yis, dat am krokidils got 'im," said Antonio,
with his mouth full—very full.
"You don't say so ?" said Disco, washing down the
steak with a brimming cup of tea.
No one appeared to think it worth while to asseve-
rate the fact, for it was self-evident. Several crocodiles
were supping, and in doing so they tore away at the
carcase with such violence, and lashed the water so
frequently with their powerful tails, as to render it
clear that their feast necessitated laborious effort,
and seemed less a recreation than a duty. More-
over, they sat at their meal, like insatiable gour-
mands, so long into the night that supper became
transmuted into breakfast, and Harold's rest was
greatly disturbed thereby. He was too sleepy and
lazy, however, to rise and drive them away.
Next morning the travellers started early, being
anxious to pass, as quietly as possible, a small Por-
tuguese town, near to which it was said a party of
runaway slaves and rebels against the Government
were engaged in making depredations.
When grey dawn was beginning to rise above the
tree-tops, they left their encampment in profound
silence, and rowed up stream as swiftly as pos-
sible. They had not advanced far, when, on turning

a point covered with tall reeds, Zombo, who was
bowman in the leading canoe, suddenly made a sign
to the men to cease rowing.
"What's the matter ?" whispered Harold
The negro pointed through the reeds, and whis-
pered the single word " Canoe."
By this time the other canoe had ranged up along-
side, and after a brief consultation between Harold
and Disco, it was decided that they should push
gently into the reeds, and wait till the strange canoe
should pass; but a few seconds sufficed to show that
the two men who paddled it did not intend to pass
down the river, for they pushed straight out towards
the deepest part of the stream. They were, however,
carried down so swiftly by the current that they
were brought quite near to the point of rushes where
our travellers lay concealed--so near that their
voices could be distinctly heard. They talked in
Portuguese.
Antonio muttered a few words, and Harold ob-
served that there was a good deal of excitement in
the looks of his men.
"What's the matter ?" he asked anxiously.
Antonio shook his head. "Dat nigger goin'
to be drownded," he said ; " bad nigger-obstro-
polous nigger, suppose."
"Wot !" exclaimed Disco in a whisper, "goin' to
be drownded ! wot d'ee mean?"


## p. 118 (#138) ############################################

Antonio proceeded to explain that it was a custom
amongst the Portuguese slave-owners there, when
they found any of their slaves intractable or refrac-
tory, to hire some individuals who, for a small sum,
would bind and carry off the incorrigible for the
purpose of making away with him. One method of
effecting this was to tie him in a sack and throw
him into the river, the crocodiles making quite sure
that the unfortunate being should never again be
seen, either alive or dead. But before Antonio had
finished his brief explanation he was interrupted by
an exclamation from the horrified Englishmen, as
they beheld the two men in the canoe raise some-
thing between them which for a moment appeared
to struggle violently.
"Shove off! give way!" shouted Harold and
Disco in the same breath, each thrusting with his
paddle so vigorously that the two canoes shot out
like arrows into the stream.
At the same instant there was a heavy plunge in
the water beside the strange canoe, and the victim
sank. Next moment one end of the sack rose to
the surface. Both Harold and Disco made straight
towards it, but it sank again, and the two murderers
paddled to the shore, on which they drew up their
canoe, intending to take to the bush, if necessary,
for safety.
Once again the sack rose not more than three

yards from Disco's canoe. The bold seaman knew
that if it disappeared a third time there would be
little chance of its rising again. He was prompt in
action, and daring to recklessness. In one moment
he had leaped overboard, dived, caught the sack in
his powerful grasp, and bore it to the surface. The
canoe had been steered for him. The instant he
appeared, strong and ready hands laid hold of him
and his burden, and dragged them both inboard.
"Cut the lashin's and give him air," cried Disco,
endeavouring to find his clasp-knife; but one of the
men quickly obeyed the order, and opened the sack.
A groan of horror and pity burst from the seaman
when he beheld the almost insensible form of a
powerful negro, whose back was lacerated with
innumerable ragged cuts, and covered with clotted
blood.
"Where are the—"
He stopped short on looking round, and, observ-
ing that the two men were standing on the shore,
seized a double-barrelled gun. The stream had
carried the canoe a considerable distance below the
spot where the murder had been attempted, but they
were still within range. Without a moment's hesi-
tation Disco took deliberate aim at them and fired.
Fortunately for him and his party Disco was a
bad shot-nevertheless the bullet struck so close
to the feet of the two men that it drove the sand

and pebbles into their faces. They turned at once
and fled, but before they reached the cover of the
bushes the second barrel was fired, and the bullet
whistled close enough over their heads greatly to
accelerate their flight.
The negroes opened their great round eyes, and
appeared awe-struck at this prompt display of a
thirst for vengeance on the part of one who had
hitherto shown no other disposition than hilarity,
fun, and good-humour.
Harold was greatly relieved to observe Disco's
failure, for if he had hit either of the fugitives the
consequences might have been very disastrous to
· their expedition.
On being partially revived and questioned, it
turned out that the poor fellow had been whipped
almost to death for refusing to be the executioner
in whipping his own mother. This was a refinement
in cruelty on the part of these professedly Christian
Portuguese, which our travellers afterwards learned
was by no means uncommon.
We are told by those who know that region well,
and whose veracity is unquestionable, that the Por-
tuguese on the east coast of Africa live in constant
dread of their slaves rising against them. No
wonder, considering the fiendish cruelties to which
they subject them! In order to keep them in sub-
jection they underfeed them, and if any of them

venture to steal cocoa-nuts from the trees the owners
thereof are at liberty to shoot them and throw them
into the sea. Slaves being cheap there, and plenti-
ful, are easily replaced, hence a cruel owner never
hesitates. If a slave is refractory, and flogging only
makes him worse, his master bids the overseer flog
him until " he will require no more." Still further
to keep them in subjection, the Portuguese then
endeavour to eradicate from them all sympathy with
each other, and all natural affection, by the following
means. If a woman requires to be flogged, her
brother or son is selected to do it. Fathers are
made to flog their daughters, husbands their wives,
and if two young negroes of different sexes are
observed to show any symptoms of growing attach-
ment for each other, these two are chosen for each
other's executioners.
The poor wretch whom we have just described as
having been saved from death, to which he had
been doomed for refusing to become the executioner
of his own mother, was placed as tenderly and com-
fortably as circumstances would admit of in the
bottom of the canoe, and then our travellers pushed
on with all haste—anxious to pass the town before
the two fugitives could give the alarm.
They were successful in this, probably because

the two men may have hid themselves for some
time in the jungle, under the impression that the
exasperated Englishmen might be searching for them
on shore.
Giving themselves time only to take a hurried
meal in the middle of the day, our travellers rowed
continuously till sunset, when, deeming it probable
abandoned, they put ashore on the right bank of
the river and encamped.
When the sufferer had been made as comfortable
as circumstances would allow-for he was much
weakened by loss of blood as well as agonized with
pain—and after he had been refreshed with food and
some warm tea, Harold questioned him, through the
interpreter, as to his previous history.
At first the man was brusque in his manner, and
inclined to be sulky, for a long course of cruelty had
filled him with an intense hatred of white men.
Indeed, an embittered and desperate spirit had begun
to induce callous indifference to all men, whether
white or black. But kind treatment, to which he
was evidently unaccustomed, and generous diet,
which was obviously new to him, had a softening
influence, and when Harold poured a small glass
of rum into his tea, and Antonio added a lump of
sugar, and Disco pressed him tenderly to drink it
off which he did—the effect was very decided;

123
the settled scowl on his face became unsettled, and
gradually melting away, was replaced by a milder
and more manly look. By degrees he became com-
municative, and, bit by bit, his story was drawn
from him. It was brief, but very sorrowful.
His name, he said, was Chimbolo. He belonged
to a tribe which lived far inland, beyond the Man-
ganja country, which latter was a country of hills.
He was not a Manganja man, but he had married a
Manganja woman. One night he, with his wife and
mother, was paying a visit to the village of his wife's
relations, when a band of slave-hunters suddenly
attacked the village. They were armed with guns,
and at once began to murder the old people and
capture the young. Resistance was useless. His
relatives were armed only with bows and spears.
Being taken by surprise, they all fled in terror, but
were pursued and few escaped. His wife, he said—
and a scowl of terrible ferocity crossed Chimbolo's
face as he said it-was about to become a mother at
the time. He seized her in his arms on the first
alarm, and fed with her into the bush, where he
concealed her, and then hurried back to aid his
relations, but met them-old and young, strong and
feeble—flying for their lives. It was not possible to
rally them, he therefore joined in the flight. While
running, a bullet grazed his head and stunned him.
Presently he recovered and rose, but in a few

minutes was overtaken and captured. A slave-
stick was put on his neck, and, along with a number
of Manganja men, women, and children, he was
driven down to the coast and sold, with a number of
other men and women, among whom was his own
mother, to a Portuguese merchant on the coast near
the East Luavo mouth of the Zambesi. There he was
found to be of a rebellious spirit, and at last, on posi-
tively refusing to lash his mother, his master ordered
him to be whipped to death, but, changing his mind
before the order had been quite carried out, he
ordered him to be bound hand and foot and taken
away in a sack. As to his wife, he had never heard
of her since that night, which was about two years
past. He knew that she had not been found, because
he had not seen her amongst the other captives. If
they had found her they would have been sure to
carry her off, because—here Chimbolo's visage
again grew diabolical—she was young, he said, and
beautiful.
When all this had been translated into bad
English by Antonio, Harold asked if Chimbolo
thought it probable that his wife was still alive in
the Manganja highlands. To this the former said
that he thought it likely.
"W'y, then," said Disco, giving his right thigh a
powerful slap, which was his favourite method of
emphasizing a remark, "wot d'ye say, sir, to lay our

course for these same highlands, and try for to find
out this poor critter ?"
"Just what was running in my own mind, Disco,"
said Harold, musing over his supper. "It does not
make much difference what part of this country we
go to, being all new to us; and as Antonio tells me
the Manganja highlands are up the Shire river, which
was explored by Dr. Livingstone not long ago, and
is not distant many days' journey from this, I think
we can't do better than go there. We shall have a
good as well as a definite object in view."
"Wery good, sir ; I'm agreeable," returned Disco,
reaching forth his. pewter plate; "another hunk o'
that pottimus, Jumbo ; it's better than salt-junk any
day; and I say, Jumbo, don't grin so much, else
ye'll enlarge yer pretty little mouth, which 'ud be a
pity."
" Yis, saar," replied Jumbo, becoming very grave
all of a sudden, but on receiving a nod and an ex-
pressive wink from the seaman, he exploded again,
and rolled backward on the grass, in the performance
of which act he capsized Zombo's can of tea, where-
upon Zombo leaped upon him in wrath, and Masiko,
as in duty bound, came to the rescue.
" Clap a stopper on yer noise, will 'ee?" cried
Disco sternly, "else you 'll be bringin' all the wild
beasts in these parts down on us to see wot it's all
about."

.
"That reminds me," said Harold, when quiet was
restored, " that we must now organize ourselves into
something of a fighting band—a company, as it
were, of soldiers,—and take our regular spell of
watching by night, for, from all that I hear of the
disturbed state of the country just now, with these
runaway slaves and rebels, it will be necessary to
be on our guard. Of course," he added, smiling, "I
suppose I must be captain of the company, and you,
Disco, shall be lieutenant."
"Not at all," replied the seaman, shaking his
head, and frowning at Jumbo, whose brilliant teeth
at once responded to the glance, "not at all, none of
your sodgerin' for me. I never could abide the
lobsters. Fust-mate, sir, that's wot I am, if I'm
to be expected to do my dooty."
"Well then, first-mate be it," rejoined Harold,
"and Antonio shall be serjeant-major_"
"Bo's'n-bo's'n," suggested Disco; " keep up
appearances wotiver ye do, an' don't let the memory

"Very good," said Harold, laughing; "then you
shall be boatswain, Antonio, as well as cook, and I
will instruct you in the first part of your duty, which
will be to keep watch for an hour while the rest of
us sleep. My first-mate will teach you the
whistling part of a boatswain's duty, if that should
be required "

"Ah, and the roar," interrupted Disco, "a bo's'n
would be nothin' without his roar—".
At that moment the woods around them were
filled with a tremendous and very unexpected roar,
which caused the whole party to spring up, and
induced the new bo's'n to utter a yell of terror
that would have done credit to the whistle of the
most violent bo's'n on the sea. Next moment the
travellers were surrounded by a large and excited
band of armed negroes.

ENEMIES ARE CHANGED INTO FRIENDS-OUR TRAVELLERS PENETRATE
INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE LAND.
Y
To possess the power of looking perfectly calm
and unconcerned when you are in reality consider-
ably agitated and rather anxious, is extremely useful
in any circumstances, but especially so when one
happens to be in the midst of grinning, gesticulating,
naked savages.
Our hero, Harold Seadrift, possessed that power
in an eminent degree, and his first-mate, Disco
Lillihammer, was not a whit behind him. Although
both had started abruptly to their legs at the first
alarm, and drawn their respective revolvers, they no
sooner found themselves surrounded by overwhelm-
ing numbers than they lowered their weapons, and,
turning back to back, faced the intruders with calm
countenances.
"Sit down, men, every one of you except Antonio,"
said Harold, in a quiet but clear and decided voice.
His men, who, having left their guns in the canoe,
were utterly helpless, quietly obeyed.

" Who are you, and what do you want ?" de-
manded Antonio, by Harold's order.
To this a tall negro, who was obviously the leader
of the band, replied in the native tongue,—" It
matters little who we are; you are in our power."
"Not quite," said Harold, slightly moving his
revolver. "Tell him that he may overcome us, but
before he does so my friend and I carry the lives of
twelve of his men in our pistols."
The negro chief, who quite understood the powers
of a revolver, replied —
" Tell your master, that before he could fire two
shots he and his friend would have each twelve
bullets in his body. But I have not time to palaver
here.—Who are you, and where are you going ?".
"We are Englishmen, travelling to see the coun-
try," replied Harold.
The chief looked doubtfully at him, and seemed
to waver, then suddenly making up his mind, he
frowned and said sternly-
"No; that is a lie. You are Portuguese scoundrels.
You shall all die. You have robbed us of our liberty,
our wives, our children, our homes; you have chained,
and tortured, and flogged us !"-he gnashed his teeth
at this point, and his followers grew excited. "Now
we have got free, and you are caught. We will let
you know what it is to be slaves."
As the negro chief stirred up his wrath by thus

recounting his wrongs, and advanced a step, Harold
begged Disco, in a low, urgent voice, not to raise his
pistol. Then looking the savage full in the face,
without showing a trace of anxiety, he said .
"You are wrong. We are indeed Englishmen, and
you know that the English detest slavery, and would,
if they could, put a stop to it altogether."
"Yes, I know that," said the chief. "We have
seen one Englishman here, and he has made us to
know that all men with white faces are not devils—
like the Portuguese and Arabs. But how am I to
know you are English ?"
Again the chief wavered a little, as if half-inclined
to believe Harold's statement.
" Here is proof for you," said Harold, pointing to
Chimbolo, who, being scarcely able to move, had
remained all this time beside the fire leaning on his
elbow and listening intently to the conversation.
" See," he continued, " that is a slave. Look at
him." .
As he said this, Harold stepped quickly forward
and removed the blanket, with which he had covered
his lacerated back after dressing it.
A howl of execration burst from the band of
negroes, who pointed their spears and guns at the
travellers' breasts, and would have made a speedy
end of the whole party if Antonio had not exclaimed
" Speak, Chimbolo, speak!"

The slave looked up with animation, and told
the rebels how his Portuguese owner had ordered
him to be flogged to death, but changed his mind
and doomed him to be drowned,-how that, in the
nick of time, these white men had rescued him, and
had afterwards treated him with the greatest kind-
ness.
Chimbolo did not say much, but what he did say
was uttered with emphasis and feeling. This was
enough. Those who would have been enemies were
suddenly converted into warm friends, and the des-
peradoes, who would have torn their former masters,
or any of their race, limb from limb, if they could
have got hold of them, left our adventurers undis-
turbed in their bivouac, after wishing them a pros-
perous journey.
It was nevertheless deemed advisable to keep
watch during the night. This was done faithfully
and conscientiously as far as it went. Harold took
the first hour by way of example. He sat over the
fire, alternately gazing into its embers while he
meditated of home, and round upon the dark forest
while he thought of Africa. True to time, he called
Disco, who, equally true to his sense of duty, turned
out at once with a deep " Ay, ay, sir." The self-
styled first-mate placed his back against a tree, and,
endeavouring to believe it to be a capstan, or binnacle,
or any other object appertaining to the sea, stared at

the ghostly stems of the forest-trees until they began
to dance hornpipes for his special gratification, or
glowered at the shadows until they became instinct
with life, and all but induced him to rouse the camp
twenty times in the course of his hour's vigil. True
to time also, like his predecessor, Disco roused An-
tonio and immediately turned in.
The vivacious chef de cuisine started up at once,
took up his position at the foot of the tree which
Disco had just left, leaned his back against it and
straightway went to sleep, in which condition he
remained till morning, leaving the camp in unpro-
tected felicity and blissful ignorance.
Fortunately for all parties, Disco awoke in time
to catch him napping, and resolved to punish him.
He crept stealthily round to the back of the tree
against which the faithless man leaned, and reached
gently round until his mouth was close to Antonio's
cheek, then, collecting all the air that his vast lungs
were capable of containing, he poured into Antonio's
ear a cumulative roar that threw the camp and the
denizens of the wilderness far and near into confu-
sion, and almost drove the whole marrow in Antonio's
body out at his heels. The stricken man sprang up
as if earth had shot him forth, uttered a yell of
terror such as seldom greets the ear, and rushed
! blindly forward. Repeating the roar, Disco plunged
after him. Antonio tumbled over the fire, recovered

himself, dashed on, and would certainly have plunged
into the river, if not into the jaws of a crocodile, had
not Jumbo caught him in his arms, in the midst of
a chorus of laughter from the other men.
"How dare 'ee go to sleep on dooty ?" demanded
Disco, seizing the culprit by the collar," eh! we
might have bin all murdered by rebels or eaten by
lions, or had our eyes picked out by gorillas, for all
that you would have done to prevent it-eh?" giving
him a shake.
"Oh, pardon, forgif. Nevair doot more again,"
exclaimed the breathless and trembling Antonio.
" You'd better not!" said Disco, giving him another
shake and releasing him.
Having done so, he turned on his heel and be-
stowed a quiet look, in passing, on Jumbo, which of
course threw that unfortunate man into convulsions.
After this little incident a hasty breakfast was
taken, the canoes were launched, and the voyage
was continued
It is not necessary to trace the course of our
explorers day by day as they ascended the Zambesi,
or to recount all the adventures or misadventures
that befell them on their journey into the interior.
It is sufficient for the continuity of our tale to say
that many days after leaving the coast they turned
into the Shire river, which flows into the Zambesi
about 150 miles from the coast.


## p. 134 (#154) ############################################

There are many fountain-heads of slavery in
Africa. The region of the interior, which gives birth
to the head-waters of the Shire river, is one of the
chief of these. Here lies the great lake Nyassa,
which was discovered and partly explored by Dr.
Livingstone, and hence flows a perennial stream of
traffic to Kilwa, on the coast—which traffic, at the
present time, consists almost exclusively of the
two kinds of ivory, white and black, the former
(elephants' tusks) being carried by the latter (slaves),
by which means the slave-trade is rendered more
profitable.
Towards this populous and fertile region, then,
our adventurers directed their course, when they
turned out of the great river Zambesi and began to
ascend the Shire.
And here, at the very outset of this part of the
journey, they met with a Portuguese settler, who did
more to open their eyes to the blighting and wither-
ing influence of slavery on the land and on its people
than anything they had yet seen.
Towards the afternoon of the first day on the
Shire, they landed near the encampment of the
settler referred to, who turned out to be a gentleman
of a Portuguese town on the Zambesi. "
Harold found, to his delight, that he could speak
English fluently, and was, moreover, an exceedingly
agreeable and well-informed man. He was out at

the time on a hunting expedition, attended by a
party of slaves.
Harold spent the evening in very pleasant in-
tercourse with Senhor Gamba, and at a later hour
than usual returned to his camp, where he enter-
tained Disco with an account of his new acquaint-
ance.
While thus engaged, he was startled by the most
appalling shrieks, which proceeded from the neigh-
bouring encampment. Under the impression that
something was wrong, both he and Disco leaped up
and ran towards it. There, to his amazement and
horror, Harold beheld his agreeable friend Senhor
Gamba thrashing a young slave unmercifully with
a whip of the most formidable character. Only a
few lashes from it had been given when Harold ran
up, but these were so powerful that the unhappy
victim dropped down in a state of insensibility just
as he reached the spot.
The Portuguese "gentleman" turned away from
the prostrate slave with a scowl, but betrayed a
slight touch of confusion on meeting the gaze of
Harold Seadrift.
" Senhor !" exclaimed the latter sternly, with
mingled remonstrance and rebuke in his tone," how
can you be so cruel ? What has the boy done to
merit such inhuman chastisement ?"
" He has neglected my orders," answered the

Portuguese, as though he resented the tone in which
Harold spoke.
" But surely, surely," said Harold, "the punish-
ment is far beyond the offence. I can scarcely be-
lieve the evidence of my own eyes and ears when
they tell me that you have been guilty of this."
" Come," returned Senhor Gamba, softening into
a smile, " you English cannot understand our case
in this land. Because you do not keep slaves, you
take the philanthropic, the religious view of the
question. We who do keep slaves have a totally
different experience. You cannot understand, you
cannot sympathize with us."
"No, truly, we can not understand you," said
Harold earnestly, " and God forbid that we should
ever sympathize with you in this matter. We detest
the gross injustice of slavery, and we abhor the
fearful cruelties connected with it."
"That is because, as I said, you are not in our
position," rejoined the Senhor, with a shrug of his
shoulders. "It is easy for you to take the philan-
thropic view, which, however, I admit to be the
best, for in the eyes of God all men are equal, and
though the African be a degraded man, I know
enough of him to be sure that he can be raised by
kindness and religion into a position not very in-
ferior to our own; but we who keep slaves cannot
help ourselves : we must act as we do."

"Why so?—is cruelty a necessity?" asked Harold.
"Yes, it is," replied the Senhor decidedly.
"Then the abolition of slavery is a needcessity
too," growled Disco, who had hitherto looked on and
listened in silent wonder, debating with himself as
to the propriety of giving Senhor Gamba, then and
there, a sound thrashing with his own whip!
"You see," continued the Portuguese, paying no
attention to Disco's growl,—"You see, in order to live
out here I must have slaves, and in order to keep
slaves I must have a whip. My whip is no worse
than any other whip that I know of. I don't justify it
as right, I simply defend it as necessary. Wherever
slavery exists, discipline must of necessity be brutal.
If you keep slaves, and mean that they shall give
you the labour of their bodies, and of their minds
also, in so far as you permit them to have minds,
you must degrade them by the whip and by all
other means at your disposal, until, like dogs, they
become the unhesitating servants of your will, no
matter what that will may be, and live for your
pleasure only. It will never pay me to adopt your
philanthropic, your religious views. I am here. I
must be here. What am I to do? Starve ? No,
not if I can help it. I do as others do-keep slaves
and act as the master of slaves. I must úse the
whip. Perhaps you won't believe me," continued
Senhor Gamba, with a sad smile," but I speak truth

when I say that I was tender-hearted when I first
came to this country, for I had been well nurtured
in Lisbon ; but that soon passed away—it could not
last. I was the laughing-stock of my companions.
Just to explain my position, I will tell you a cir-
cumstance which happened soon after I came here.
The Governor invited me to a party of pleasure.
The party consisted of himself, his daughters, some
officers, and others. We were to go in boats to a
favourite island resort several miles off. I took one of
my slaves with me, a lad that I kept about my person.
As we were going along, this lad fell into the river.
He could not swim, and the tide was carrying him fast
away to death. Dressed as I was, in full uniform, I
plunged in after him and saved him. The wish
alone to save the boy's life prompted me to risk my
own. And for this I became the jest of the party ;
even the ladies tittered at my folly. Next evening
the Governor had a large dinner-party. I was there.
Having caught cold, I coughed slightly ; this drew
attention to me. Remarks were made, and the
Governor alluded in scoffing terms to my exploit,
which created much mirth. Were you drunk ?'
said one. 'Had you lost your senses, to risk your
life for a brute of a negro ?' said another. Rather
than spoil my uniform, I would have knocked him
on the head with a pole,' said a third ; and it was a
long time before what they termed my folly was

forgotten or forgiven. You think I am worse than
others. I am not; but I do not condescend to
their hypocrisy. What I am now, I have been made
by this country and its associates."1
Senhor Gamba said this with the air of one who
thinks that he has nearly, if not quite, justified him-
self. "I am no worse than others," is an excuse
for evil conduct not altogether unknown in more
highly favoured lands, and is often followed by the
illogical conclusion, "therefore I am not to blame;"
but, although Harold felt pity for his agreeable
chance acquaintance, he could not admit that this
explanation excused him, nor could he get over the
shock which his feelings had sustained; it was,
therefore, with comparatively little regret that he
bade him adieu on the following morning, and
pursued his onward way.
Everywhere along the Shire they met with a more
or less hospitable reception from the natives, who
regarded them with great favour, in consequence of
their belonging to the same nation which had sent
forth men to explore their country, defend them from
the slave-dealer, and teach them about the true God.
These men, of whom mention is made in another
chapter, had, some time before this, been sent by
1 These words are not fictitious. The remarks of Senhor Gamba
were actually spoken by a Portuguese slave-owner, and will be
found in The Story of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa,

the Church of England to the Manganja highlands,
at the suggestion of Dr. Livingstone, and laid,
we believe, the foundation-stone of Christian civi-
lisation in the interior of Africa, though God saw
fit to arrest them in the raising of the super-
structure.
Among other pieces of useful knowledge conveyed
by them to the negroes of the Shire, was the fact that
Englishmen are not cannibals, and that they have no
special longings after blackman steaks !
It may perchance surprise some readers to learn
that black men ever entertain such a preposterous
notion. Nevertheless, it is literally true. The
slavers—Arabs and Portuguese-find it their interest
to instil this falsehood into the minds of the ignorant
tribes of the interior, from whom the slaves are
gathered, in order that their captives may entertain
a salutary horror of Englishmen, so that if their
dhows should be chased by our cruisers while creep-
ing northward along the coast, and run the risk of
being taken, the slaves may willingly aid their
captors in trying to escape. That the lesson has
been well learnt and thoroughly believed is proved
by the fact that when a dhow is obliged to run
ashore to avoid capture, the slaves invariably take to
the woods on the wings of terror, preferring, no
doubt, to be re-enslaved rather than to be roasted
and eaten by white fiends. Indeed, so thoroughly

has this been engrained into the native mind, that
mothers frequently endeavour to overawe their re-
fractory offspring by threatening to hand them over
to the dreadful white monster who will eat them up
if they don't behave!

CHAPTER VIII.
RELATES ADVENTURES IN THE SHIRE VALLEY, AND TOUCHES ON ONE
OR TWO PHASES OF SLAVERY.
EVERYTHING depends upon taste, as the monkey
remarked when it took to nibbling the end of its own coc
tail ! If you like a thing, you take one view of it;
if you don't like it, you take another view. Either
view, if detailed, would be totally irreconcilable with
the other.
The lower part of the river Shire, into which our
travellers had now entered, is a vast swamp. There
are at least two opinions in regard to that region.
To do justice to those with whom we don't sympa-
thize, we give our opponent's view first. Our oppo-
nent, observe, is an honest and competent man; he
speaks truly; he only looks at it in another light
from Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer.
He says of the river Shire, " It drains a low and
exceedingly fertile valley of from fifteen to twenty
miles in breadth. Ranges of wooded hills bound
this valley on both sides. After the first twenty
miles you come to Mount Morambala, which rises

143
with steep sides to 4000 feet in height. It is wooded
to the top, and very beautiful. A small village peeps
out about half-way up the mountain. It has a pure,
bracing atmosphere, and is perched above mosquito
range. The people on the summit have a very
different climate and vegetation from those on the
plains, and they live amidst luxuriant vegetation.
There are many species of ferns, some so large as to
deserve the name of trees. There are also lemon
and orange trees growing wild, and birds and ani-
mals of all kinds." Thus far we agree with our
opponent, but listen to him as he goes on : .
" The view from Moram bala is extensive, but
cheerless past description. Swamp, swamp-reek-
ing, festering, rotting, malaria-pregnant swamp,
where poisonous vapours for several months in the
year are ever bulging up and out into the air,—lies
before you as far as the eye can reach, and farther.
If you enter the river at the worst seasons of the
year, the chances are you will take the worst type
of fever. If, on the other hand, you enter it during
the best season, when the swamps are fairly dried
up, you have everything in your favour."
Now, our opponent gives a true statement of facts
undoubtedly, but his view of them is not cheering.
Contrast them with the view of Disco Lilliham-
mer. That sagacious seaman had entered the Shire
neither in the " best" nor the "worst" of the sea.

son. He had chanced upon it somewhere between
the two.
" Git up your steam an' go 'longside," he said
to Jumbo one afternoon, as the two canoes were
proceeding quietly among magnificent giant-reeds,
sedges, and bulrushes, which towered high above
them—in some places overhung them.
"I say, Mister Harold, ain't it splendid ?"
" Magnificent !" replied Harold with a look of
quiet enthusiasm.
"I does enjoy a swamp," continued the seaman,
allowing a thin cloud to trickle from his lips.
"So do I, Disco."
"There's such a many outs and ins an' round-
abouts in it. And such powerful reflections o'them
reeds in the quiet water. W'y, sir, I do declare
wien I looks through 'em in a dreamy sort of way
for a long time I get to fancy they 're palm-trees an'
that we 're sailin' through a forest without no end to
it; an' w'en I looks over the side an' sees every
reed standin' on its other self, so to speak, an' follers
the under one down till my eyes git lost in the blue
sky an'clouds below us, I do sometimes feel as if
we'd got into the middle of fairy-land, was fairly
afloat on the air, an' off on a voyage through the
univarse! But it's them reflections as I like most.
Every leaf, an' stalk, an' flag is just as good an' rea!
in the water as out of it. An' just look at that

there frog, sir, that one on the big leaf which has
swelled hisself up as if he wanted to bust, with his
head looking up hopefully to the—ah! he's down
with a plop like lead, but he wos sittin' on his own
image which wos as clear as his own self. Then
there's so much variety, sir—that's where it is. You
never know wot you 're comin' to in them swamps.
It may be a openin' like a pretty lake, with islands
of reeds everywhere; or it may be a narrow bit like
a canal, or a river; or a bit so close that you go
scrapin' the gun'les on both sides. An' the life, too,
is most amazin'. Never saw nothin' like it no-
where. All kinds, big an' little, plain an' pritty,
queer an''orrible, swarms here to sitch an extent that
I've got it into my head that this Shire valley must
be the great original nursery of animated nature."
" It looks like it, Disco."
The last idea appeared to furnish food for reflec-
tion, as the two friends here relapsed into silence.
Although Disco's description was quaint, it could
scarcely be styled exaggerated, for the swamp was
absolutely alive with animal life. The principal
occupant of these marshes is the elephant, and
hundreds of these monster animals may be seen in
one herd feeding like cattle in a meadow. Owing
to the almost impenetrable nature of the reedy
jungle, however, it is impossible to follow them, and
anxious though Disco was to kill one, he failed to

obtain a single shot. Buffaloes and other large game
were also numerous in this region, and in the water
crocodiles and hippopotami sported about every-
where, while aquatic birds of every shape and size
rendered the air vocal with their cries. Sometimes
these feathered denizens of the swamp arose, when
startled, in a dense cloud so vast that the mighty
rush of their wings was almost thunderous in
character.
The crocodiles were not only numerous but
dangerous because of their audacity. They used to
watch at the places where native women were in
the habit of going down to the river for water, and
not unfrequently succeeded in seizing a victim.
This, however, only happened at those periods when
the Shire was in flood, when fish were driven from
their wonted haunts, and the crocodiles were reduced
to a state of starvation and consequent ferocity.
One evening, while our travellers were proceed-
ing slowly up stream, they observed the corpse of
a negro boy floating past the canoe; just then a
monstrous crocodile rushed at it with the speed of
a greyhound, caught it and shook it as a terrier does
a rat. Others dashed at the prey, each with his
powerful tail causing the water to churn and froth
as he tore off a piece. In a few seconds all was
gone. That same evening Zombo had a narrow

escape. After dusk he ran down to the river to
drink. He chanced to go to a spot where a croco-
dile was watching. It lay settled down in the
mud with its head on a level with the water, so
that in the feeble light it could not be seen. While
Zombo was busy laving the water into his mouth it
suddenly rushed at him and caught him by the
hand. The limb of a bush was fortunately within
reach, and he laid hold of it. There was a brief
struggle. The crocodile tugged hard, but the man
tugged harder; at the same time he uttered a yell
which brought Jumbo to his side with an oar, a
blow from which drove the hideous reptile away.
Poor Zombo was too glad to have escaped with his
life to care much about the torn hand, which
rendered him hors de combat for some time after
that.
Although Disco failed to get a shot at an elephant,
his hopeful spirit was gratified by the catching of a
baby-elephant alive. It happened thus :-
One morning, not very long after Zombo's tussle
with the crocodile, Disco's canoe, which chanced to
be in advance, suddenly ran almost into the midst
of a herd of elephants which were busy feeding on
palm-nuts, of which they are very fond. Instantly
the whole troop scattered and fled. Disco, taken
completely by surprise, omitted his wonted "Hallo!" :
as he made an awkward plunge at his rifle, but be-

i
fore he could bring it to bear, the animals were over
the bank of the river and lost in the dense jungle.
But a fine little elephant, at that period of life
which, in human beings, might be styled the toddling
age, was observed to stumble while attempting to
follow its mother up the bank. It fell and rolled
backwards.
"Give way for your lives !" roared Disco.
The boat shot its bow on the bank, and the sea-
man flew rather than leaped upon the baby
elephant!
The instant it was laid hold of it began to scream
with incessant and piercing energy after the fashion
of a pig.
"Queek! come in canoe ! Modder come back
for 'im," cried Jumbo in some anxiety.
Disco at once appreciated the danger of the
enraged mother returning to the rescue, but, resolved
not to resign his advantage, he seized the vicious little
creature by the proboscis and dragged it by main
force to the canoe, into which he tumbled, hauled
the proboscis inboard, as though it had been the
bite of a cable, and held on.
"Shove off ! shove off! and give way, lads !
Look alive!"
The order was promptly obeyed, and in a few
minutes the baby was dragged into the boat and
secured.

cided too night, much to the it. Disco led bi
This prize, however, was found to be more of a
nuisance than an amusement, and it was soon de-
cided that it must be disposed of. Accordingly,
that very night, much to the regret of the men who
wanted to make a meal of it, Disco led his baby
squealing into the jungle and set it free with a
hearty slap on the flank, and an earnest recommen-
dation to make all sail after its venerable mother,
which it did forthwith, cocking its ears and tail,
and shrieking as it went.
Two days after this event they made a brief halt
at a poor village where they were hospitably received
by the chief, who was much gratified by the liberal
quantity of calico with which the travellers paid for
their entertainment. Here they met with a Portu-
guese half-caste who was reputed one of the greatest
monsters of cruelty in that part of the country.
He was, however, not much more villanous in aspect
than many other half-castes whom they saw. He
was on his way to the coast in a canoe manned by
slaves. If Harold and Disco had known that this
was his last journey to the coast they would have
regarded him with greater interest. As it was,
having learned his history from the chief through
their interpreter, they turned from him with loathing.
As this half-caste's career illustrates the depths
to which humanity may fall in the hot-bed of
slavery, as well as, to some extent, the state of

things existing under Portuguese rule on the east
coast of Africa, we give the particulars briefly.
Instead of the whip, this man used the gun, which
he facetiously styled his "minister of justice," and, in
mere wantonness, he was known to have committed
murder again and again, yet no steps were taken
by the authorities to restrain, much less to punish
him. Men heard of his murders, but they shrugged
their shoulders and did nothing. It was only a
wild beast of a negro that was killed, they said,
and what was that! They seemed to think less of
it than if he had shot a hippopotamus. One of his
murders was painfully notorious, even to its minutest
particulars. Over the female slaves employed in a
house and adjacent lands there is usually placed a
head-woman, a slave also, chosen for such an office
for her blind fidelity to her master. This man had
one such woman, one who had ever been faithful to
him and his interests, who had never provoked him
by disobedience or ill-conduct, and against whom,
therefore, he could have no cause of complaint. One
day when half drunk he was lying on a couch in
his house ; his forewoman entered and made herself
busy with some domestic work. As her master lay
watching her, his savage disposition found vent in
a characteristic joke : "Woman," said he, "I think
I will shoot you." The woman turned round and
said, " Master, I am your slave; you can do what

151
you will with me. You can kill me if you like ; I
can do nothing. But don't kill me, master, for if
you do, who is there to look after your other women ?
they will all run away from you."
She did not mean to irritate her master, but
instantly the man's brutal egotism was aroused.
The savage jest became a fearful reality, and he
shouted with rage :-
"Say you that! say you that ! fetch me my gun,
I will see if my women will run away after I have
killed you."
Trained to implicit obedience, the poor woman
did as she was bid. She brought the gun and handed
him powder and ball. At his command she knelt
down before him, and the wretch fired at her breast.
In his drunken rage he missed his mark—the ball
went through her shoulder. She besought him to
spare her. Deaf to her entreaties, he ordered her to
fetch more powder and ball. Though wounded and
in agony, she obeyed him. Again the gun was
loaded, again levelled and fired, and the woman fell
dead at his feet.
The facts of this case were known far and wide.
The Portuguese Governor was acquainted with them,
as well as the ministers of justice, but no one put forth
a hand to punish the monster, or to protect his slaves.
1 The above narrative is quoted almost verbatim from The Story of
the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, pp. 78-9, the author of
which vouches for its accuracy.

But vengeance overtook him at last. On his way
down the Zambesi he shot one of his men. The
others, roused to irresistible fury, sprung upon and
strangled him.
Then, indeed, the Governor and Magistrates were
roused to administer "justice!" They had allowed
this fiend to murder slaves at his will, but no sooner
had the slaves turned on and killed their master
than ceaseless energy and resolution were displayed
in punishing those who slew him. Soldiers were
sent out in all directions; some of the canoe-men
were shot down like wild beasts, the rest were re-
captured and publicly whipped to death!
Reader, this is " domestic slavery." This is what
Portugal and Zanzibar claim the right to practise.
This is what Great Britain has for many years
declined to interfere with. This is the curse with
which Africa is blighted at the present day in some
of her fairest lands, and this is what Portugal has
decreed shall not terminate in what she calls her
African dominions for some years to come. In other
words, it has been coolly decreed by that weakest
of all the European nations, that slavery, murder,
injustice, and every other conceivable and un-
mentionable vice and villany shall still, for some
considerable time, continue to be practised on the
men, women, and children of Africa !
Higher up the Shire river, the travellers saw

symptoms of recent distress among the people,
which caused them much concern. Chimbolo, in
particular, was rendered very anxious by the account
given of the famine which prevailed still farther
up the river, and the numerous deaths that had
taken place in consequence.
The cause of the distress was a common one, and
easily explained. Slave-dealers had induced the
Ajawa, a warlike tribe, to declare war against the
people of the Manganja highlands. The Ajawa had
done this before, and were but too ready to do it
again. They invaded the land, captured many of
the young people, and slew the aged. Those who
escaped to the jungle found on their return that
their crops were destroyed. Little seed remained in
their possession, and before that was planted and
grown, famine began to reduce the ranks, already
thinned by war.
Indications of this sad state of things became
more numerous as the travellers advanced. Few
natives appeared to greet them on the banks of the
river as they went along, and these few resembled
living skeletons. In many places they found dead
bodies lying on the ground in various stages of de-
composition, and everywhere they beheld an aspect
of settled unutterable despair on the faces of the
scattered remnant of the bereaved and starving
people.

It was impossible, in the circumstances, for Harold
Seadrift to give these wretched people more than
very slight relief. He gave them as much of his
stock of provisions as he could spare, and was glad
when the necessity of continuing the journey on
foot relieved him from such mournful scenes by
taking him away from the river's bank.
Hiring a party of the strongest men that he could
find among them, he at length left his canoes, made
up his goods, food, and camp-equipage into bundles
of a shape and size suitable to being carried on the
heads of men, and started on foot for the Manganja
highlands.
"Seems to me, sir," observed Disco, as they
plodded along together on the first morning of the
land journey—"seems to me, sir, that Chimbolo
don't stand much chance of findin' his wife alive."
" Poor fellow," replied Harold, glancing back at
the object of their remarks, "I fear not."
Chimbolo had by that time recovered much of his
natural vigour, and although not yet able to carry
a man's load, was nevertheless quite capable of
following the party. He walked in silence, with his
eyes on the ground, a few paces behind Antonio,
who was a step or two in rear of his leader, and
who, in virtue of his position as " bo's'n " to the
party, was privileged to walk hampered by no greater
burden than his gun.

"We must keep up his sperrits, tho', poor chap,"
said Disco, in the hoarse whisper with which he was
wont to convey secret remarks, and which was much
more fitted to attract attention than his ordinary
voice. "It 'ud never do to let his sperrits down;
'cause w'y ? he's weak, an' if he know'd that his
wife was dead, or took off as a slave, he'd never be +
able to go along with us, and we couldn't leave him
to starve here, you know."
" Certainly not, Disco," returned Harold. "Besides,
his wife may be alive, for all we know to the con-
trary.—How far did he say the village was from
where we landed, Antonio ?"
" 'Bout two, tree days," answered the bo's'n.
That night the party encamped beside the ruinsi
of a small hamlet, where charred sticks and frag-
ments of an African household's goods and chattels
lay scattered on the ground.
Chimbolo sat down here on the ground, and, resting
his chin on his knees, gazed in silence at the ruin
around him.
"Come, cheer up, old fellow," cried Disco, with
rather an awkward effort at heartiness, as he slapped
the negro gently on the shoulder; " tell him, Antonio,
not to let his heart go down. Didn't he say that
what-dee-call-the-place-his village—was a strong
place, and could be easily held by a few brave
men ?"


## p. 156 (#176) ############################################

"True," replied Chimbolo, through the interpreter,
"but the Manganja men are not very brave."
"Well, well, never mind," rejoined the sym-
pathetic tar, repeating his pat on the back, " there's
no sayin'. P'raps they got courage w'en it came
to the scratch. P'raps it never came to the scratch
at all up there. Mayhap you 'll find 'em all right
after all. Come, never say die s'long as there's a
shot in the locker. That's a good motto for 'ee,
Chimbolo, and ought to keep up your heart, even
tho' ye are a nigger, 'cause it wos inwented by the
great Nelson, and shouted by him, or his bo's'n, just
before he got knocked over at the glorious battle of
Trafalgar. Tell him that, Antonio."
Whether Antonio told him all that, is extremely
doubtful, although he complied at once with the
order, for Antonio never by any chance declined at
least to attempt the duties of his station, but the
only effect of his speech was that Chimbolo shook
his head and continued to stare at the ruins.
Next morning they started early, and towards
evening drew near to Zomba.
The country through which, during the previous
two days, they had travelled, was very beautiful,
and as wild as even Disco could desire-and, by the
way, it was no small degree of wildness that could
slake the thirst for the marvellous which had been
awakened in the breast of our tar, by his recent

experiences in Africa. It was, he said and said
truly—a real out-and-out wilderness. There were
villages everywhere, no doubt, but these were so
thickly concealed by trees and jungle that they
were not easily seen, and most of them were at that
time almost depopulated. The grass was higher
than the heads of the travellers, and the vegetation
everywhere was rankly luxuriant. Here and there
open glades allowed the eye to penetrate into other-
wise impenetrable bush. Elsewhere, large trees
abounded in the midst of overwhelmingly affec-
tionate parasites, whose gnarled lower limbs and
twining tendrils and pendant foliage gave a softness
to the landscape, which contrasted well with the wild
passes and rugged rocks of the middle distance and
the towering mountains which rose, range beyond
range, in the far distance.
But as the party approached the neighbourhood
of Zomba mountains, few of them were disposed to
give much heed to the beauties of nature. All being
interested in Chimbolo, they became more or less
anxious as to news that awaited him.
On turning a spur of one of the mountains which
had hitherto barred their vision, they found them-
selves suddenly face to face with a small band of
Manganja men, whose woe-begone countenances
told too eloquently that the hand of the destroyer
had been heavy upon them.

Of course they were questioned by Chimbolo, and
the replies they gave him were such as to confirm
the fears he had previously entertained.
The Ajawa, they said, just the day before, burnt
their villages, stole or destroyed their property,
killed many of their kinsmen, and carried off their
wives and children for slaves. They themselves
had escaped, and were now on their way to visit
their chief, who was at that time on the banks of
the Zambesi, to beg of him to return, in order that
he might bewitch the guns of the Ajawa, and so
render them harmless !
"Has a woman of your tribe, named Marunga,
been slain or captured ?" asked Chimbolo eagerly.
To this the men replied that they could not tell.
Marunga, they said, was known well to them by
name and sight. They did not think she was
among the captives, but could not tell what had
become of her, as the village where she and her
little boy lived had been burnt, and all who had
not been killed or captured had taken to the bush.
Marunga's husband, they added, was a man named
Chimbolo—not a Manganja man, but a friend of
the tribe—who had been taken by the slavers,
under command of a Portuguese half-caste named
Marizano, about two years before that time.
· Chimbolo winced as though he had been stung
when Marizano's name was mentioned, and a dark

159
frown contracted his brows when he told the Man-
ganja men that he was Chimbolo, and that he
was even then in search of Marunga and her little
boy.
When all this had been explained to Harold Sea-
drift, he told the men that it was a pity to waste
time in travelling such a long way to see their chief,
who could not, even if he wished, bewitch the guns
of the Ajawa, and advised them to turn back and
guide him and his men to the place where the
attack had been made on the Manganja, so that a
search might be made in the bush for those of the
people who had escaped.
This was agreed to, and the whole party proceeded
on their way with increased speed, Chimbolo and
Harold hoping they might yet find that Marunga
had escaped, and Disco earnestly desiring that they
might only fall in with the Ajawa and have a brush
with them, in which case he assured the negroes he
would show them a way of bewitching their guns
that would beat their chief's bewitchment all to
sticks and stivers !
The village in which Marunga had dwelt was
soon reached. It was, as they had been told by
their new friends, a heap of still smouldering ashes;
but it was not altogether destitute of signs of life.
A dog was observed to slink away into the bush as
they approached.

The moment Chimbolo observed it he darted into
the bush after it.
" Hallo!" exclaimed Disco in surprise ; " that
nigger seems to have took a sudden fancy to the
cur? - Eh, Antonio, wot's the reason of that,
think 'ee?"
" Dun no; s'pose where dog be mans be."
" Ah! or womans," suggested Disco.
" Or womans," assented Antonio.
Just then they heard Chimbolo's shout, which
was instantly followed by a succession of female
shrieks. These latter were repeated several times,
and sounded as though the fugitives were scattering.
"Hims find a nest of womins !" exclaimed Jumbo,
throwing down his load and dashing away into the
bush.
Every individual of the party followed his ex-
ample, not excepting Harold and Disco, the latter
of whom was caught by the leg, the moment he left
the track, by a wait-a-bit thorn-most appropriately
so called, because its powerful spikes are always
ready to seize and detain the unwary passer-by. In
the present instance it checked the seaman's career
for a few seconds, and rent his nether garments
sadly; while Harold, profiting by his friend's mis-
fortune, leaped over the bush, and passed on. Disco
quickly extricated himself, and followed.
They were not left far behind, and overtook their

comrades just as they emerged on an open space, or
glade, at the extremity of which a sight met their
eyes that filled them with astonishment, for there a
troop of women and one or two boys were seen
walking towards them, with Chimbolo in front,
having a child on his left shoulder, and performing
a sort of insane war-dance round one of the women.
"He's catched her!" exclaimed Disco, with ex-
cited looks, just as if Chimbolo had been angling
unsuccessfully for a considerable time, and had
hooked a stupendous fish at last.
And Disco was right. A few of the poor creatures
who were so recently burnt out of their homes,
and had lost most of those dearest to them, had
ventured, as if drawn by an irresistible spell, to re-
turn with timid steps to the scene of their former
happiness, but only to have their worst fears con-
firmed. Their homes, their protectors, their children,
their hopes, all were gone at one fell swoop. Only
one among them-one who, having managed to save
her only child, had none to mourn over, and no one
to hope to meet with—only one returned to a joyful
meeting. We need scarcely say that this was
Marunga.
The fact was instantly made plain to the travel-
lers by the wild manner in which Chimbolo shouted
her name, pointed to her, and danced round her,
while he showed all his glistening teeth and as

i
much of the whites of his eyes as was consistent
with these members remaining in their orbits.
Really it was quite touching, in spite of its being
ludicrous, the way in which the poor fellow poured
forth his joy like a very child, which he was in
everything except years; and Harold could not
help remembering and recalling to Disco's memory
Yoosoof's observations touching the hardness of
negroes' hearts, and their want of natural affection,
on the morning when his dhow was captured by
the boat of the Firefly.'
The way in which, ever and anon, Chimbolo
kissed his poor but now happy wife, was wondrously
similar to the mode in which white men perform
that little operation, except that there was more of
an unrefined smack in it. The tears which would
hop over his sable cheeks now and then sparkled
to the full as brightly as European tears, and were
perhaps somewhat bigger; and the pride with which
he regarded his little son, holding him in both hands
out at arms'-length, was only excelled by the joy
and the tremendous laugh with which he received a
kick on the nose from that undutiful son's black
little toes.
But Yoosoof never chanced to be present when
such exhibitions of negro feeling and susceptibility.
took place. How could he, seeing that men and
women and children if black-fled from him and

163
such as he in abject terror? Neither did Yoosoof
ever chance to be present when women sat down
beside their blackened hearths, as they did that
night, and quietly wept as though their hearts would
burst, at the memory of little voices and manly
tones—not silent in death, but worse than that,
gone, gone for ever! Doubtless they felt, though
they never heard of, and could not in words express,
the sentiment-
" Oh for the touch of a vanished hand,
And the sound of a voice that is still!"
Yoosoof knew not of, and cared nothing for, such
feelings as these. We ask again, how could he ?
His only experience of the negro was when cowering
before him as a slave, or when yelling in agony
under his terrible lash, or when brutalized and
rendered utterly apathetic by inhuman cruelty.
Harold learned, that night, on further conversa-
tion with the Manganja men, that a raid had re-
cently been made into those regions by more than
one band of slavers, sent out to capture men and
women by the Portuguese half-castes of the towns
of Sena and Tete, on the Zambesi, and that they
had been carrying the inhabitants out of the country
at the rate of about two hundred a week.
This however was but a small speck, so to speak,
of the mighty work of kidnapping human beings that
was going on-that is still going on in those regions.

Yoosoof would have smiled—he never laughed-if
you had mentioned such a number as being large.
But in truth he cared nothing about such facts,
except in so far as they represented a large amount
of profit accruing to himself.
The result of Harold Seadrift's cogitations on
these matters was that he resolved to pass through
as much of the land as he could within a reasonable
time, and agreed to accompany Chimbolo on a visit
to his tribe, which dwelt at some distance to the
north of the Manganja highlands.

CHAPTER IX.
IN WHICH A SAVAGE CHIEF ASTONISHES A SAVAGE ANIMAL.
THERE is something exceedingly pleasant in the
act of watching-ourselves unseen—the proceedings
of some one whose aims and ends appear to be very
mysterious. There is such a wide field of specula-
tion opened up in which to expatiate, such a vast
amount of curious, we had almost said romantic,
expectation created; all the more if the individual
whom we observe be a savage, clothed in an un-
familiar and very scanty garb, and surrounded by
scenery and circumstances which, albeit strange to
us, are evidently by no means new to him.
Let us—you and me, reader,-quitting for a time
the sad subject of slavery, and leaping, as we are
privileged to do, far ahead of our explorers Harold
Seadrift and his company, into the region of Central
Africa; let you and me take up a position in a
clump of trees by the banks of yonder stream, and
watch the proceedings of that negro-negro-chief
let me say, for he looks like one,—who is engaged in

some mysterious enterprise under the shade of a
huge baobab tree.
The chief is a fine, stately, well-developed speci-
men of African manhood. He is clothed in black
tights manufactured in nature's loom, in addition to
which he wears round his loins a small scrap of
artificial cotton cloth. If an enthusiastic member
of the Royal Academy were in search of a model
which should combine the strength of Hercules with
the grace of Apollo, he could not find a better than
the man before us, for, you will observe, the more
objectionable points about our ideal of the negro are
not very prominent in him. His lips are not thicker
than the lips of many a roast-beef-loving John Bull.
His nose is not flat, and his heels do not protrude
unnecessarily. True, his hair is woolly, but that is
scarcely a blemish. It might almost be regarded as
the crisp and curly hair that surrounds a manly
skull. His skin is black—no doubt about that, but
then it is intensely black and glossy, suggestive of
black satin, and having no savour of that dirtiness
which is inseparably connected with whity-brown.
Tribes in Africa differ materially in many respects,
physically and mentally, just as do the various
tribes of Europe.
This chief, as we have hinted, is a "savage;"
that is to say, he differs in many habits and points
from "civilized " people. Among other peculiarities,


## p. 167 (#187) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
167
he clothes himself and his family in the fashion
that is best suited to the warm climate in which he
dwells. This display of wisdom is, as you know,
somewhat rare among civilized people, as any one
may perceive who observes how these over-clothe the
upper parts of their children, and leave their tender
little lower limbs exposed to the rigours of northern
latitudes, while, as if to make up for this inconsis-
tency by an inconsistent counterpoise, they swathe
their own tough and mature limbs in thick flannel
from head to foot.
It is however simple justice to civilized people
to add here that a few of them, such as a portion of
the Scottish Highlanders, are consistent, inasmuch
as the men clothe themselves similarly to the
children.
Moreover, our chief, being a savage, takes daily
a sufficient amount of fresh air and exercise, which
nine-tenths of civilized men refrain from doing, on
the economic and wise principle, apparently, that
engrossing and unnatural devotion to the acquisition
of wealth, fame, or knowledge, will enable them at
last to spend a few paralytic years in the enjoyment
of their gains. No doubt civilized people have the
trifling little drawback of innumerable ills, to which
they say (erroneously, we think) that flesh is heir,
and for the cure of which much of their wealth is
spent in supporting an army of doctors. Savages

know nothing of indigestion, and in Central Africa
they have no medical men.
There is yet another difference which we may
point out: savages have no literature. They cannot
read or write therefore, and have no permanent
records of the deeds of their forefathers. Neither
have they any religion worthy of the name. This
is indeed a serious evil, one which civilized people
of course deplore, yet, strange to say, one which
consistency prevents some civilized people from
remedying in the case of African savages, for it
would be absurdly inconsistent in Arab Mohamme-
dans to teach the negroes letters and the doctrines
of their faith with one hand, while with the other
they lashed them to death or dragged them into
perpetual slavery; and it would be equally incon-
sistent in Portuguese Christians to teach the negroes
to read " Whatsoever ye would that men should do
unto you, do ye even so to them," while "domestic
slavery" is, in their so-called African territories,
claimed as a right, and the traffic connected with it
sanctioned.
Yes, there are many points of difference between
civilized people and savages, and we think it right
to point this out very clearly, good reader, because
the man at whom you and I are looking just now
is a "savage."
Of course, being capable of reading this book, you

are too old to require to be told that there is nothing
of our nursery savage about him. That peculiar
abortion was born and breed in the nursery, and
dwells only there, and was never heard of beyond
civilized lands—although something not unlike him,
alas ! may be seen here and there among the lanes
and purlieus where our drunkards and profligates
resort. No; our savage chief does not roar, or glare,
or chatter, or devour his food in its blood like the
giant of the famous Jack. He carries himself like a
man, and a remarkably handsome man too, with his
body firm and upright, and his head bent a little
forward, with his eyes fixed on the ground, as if in
meditation, while he walks along.
But a truce to digressive explanation. Let us
follow him.
Reaching the banks of the river, he stops, and,
standing in an attitude worthy of Apollo, though he
is not aware that we are looking at him, gazes first
up the stream and then down. This done, he looks
across, after which he tries to penetrate the depths
of the water with his eye.
As no visible result follows, he wisely gives up
staring and wishing, and apparently resolves to
attain his ends by action. Felling a small tree,
about as thick as his thigh, with an iron hatchet, he
cuts off it a length of about six feet. Into one end
of this he drives a sharp-pointed hard-wood spike,


## p. 170 (#190) ############################################

170
BLACK IVORY.
several inches long, and to the other end attaches a
stout rope made of the fibrous husk of the cocoa-nut.
The point of the spike he appears to anoint-
probably a charm of some kind,—and then suspends
the curious instrument over a forked stick at a con-
siderable height from the ground, to which he fastens
the other end of the rope. This done, he walks
quietly away with an air of as much self-satisfac-
tion as if he had just performed a generous deed.
Well, is that all? Nay, if that were all we should
owe you a humble apology. Our chief, "savage"
though he be, is not insane. He has an object in
view—which is more than can be said of every-
body.
He has not been long gone, an hour or two, when
the smooth surface of the river is broken in several
places and out burst two or three heads of hippo-
potami. Although, according to Disco Lillihammer,
the personification of ugliness, these creatures do
not the less enjoy their existence. They roll about
in the stream like puncheons, dive under one another
playfully, sending huge waves to the banks on either
side. They gape hideously with their tremendous
jaws, which look as though they had been split
much too far back in the head by a rude hatchet
-the tops of all the teeth having apparently been
lopped off by the same clumsy blow. They laugh
too, with a demoniacal "Ha! ha! ha!" as if they

we.
rejoiced in their excessive plainness, and knew that
we—you and I, reader-are regarding them with
disgust not unmingled with awe.
Presently one of the herd betakes himself to the
land. He is tired of play, and means to feed. Grass
appears to be his only food, and to procure this he
must needs go back from the river a short way, his
enormous lips, like an animated mowing-machine,
cutting a track of short cropped grass as he waddles
along.
The form of that part of the bank is such that he
is at least inclined, if not constrained, to pass directly
under the suspended beam. Ha! we understand
the matter now. Most people do understand, when
a thing becomes obviously plain. The hippopotamus
wants grass for supper; the "savage" chief wants
hippopotamus. Both set about arranging their
plans for their respective ends. The hippopo-
tamus passes close to the forked stick, and touches
the cord which sustains it in air like the sword of

spike deep into his back. A cry follows, something
between a grunt, a squeak, and a yell, and the
wounded animal falls, rolls over, jumps up, with
unexpected agility for such a sluggish, unwieldy
creature, and rumbles, rushes, rolls, and stumbles
back into the river, where his relatives take to flight
in mortal terror. The unfortunate beast might per-

haps recover from the wound, were it not that the
spike has been tipped with poison. The result is that
he dies in about an hour. Not long afterwards the
chief returns with a band of his followers, who,
being experts in the use of the knife and hatchet,
soon make mince-meat of their game-laden with
which they return in triumph to their homes.
Let us follow them thither.

CHAPTER X.
DESCRIBES AFRICAN DOMESTICITY, AND MANY OTHER THINGS RELATIVE
THERETO, BESIDES SHOWING THAT ALARMS AND FLIGHTS, SUR-
PRISES AND FEASTS, ARE NOT CONFINED TO PARTICULAR PLACES.
WHEN our negro chief—whose name, by the way,
was Kambira— left the banks of the river, followed
by his men bearing the hippopotamus-flesh, he set
off at a swinging pace, like to a man who has a con-
siderable walk before him.
The country through which they passed was not
only well wooded, but well watered by numerous
rivulets. Their path for some distance tended
upwards towards the hills, now crossing over
mounds, anon skirting the base of precipitous
rocks, and elsewhere dipping down into hollows;
but although thus serpentine in its course, its upward
tendency never varied until it led them to the highest
parts of a ridge from which a magnificent prospect
was had of hill and dale, lake, rivulet, and river,
extending so far that the distant scenery at the
horizon appeared of a thin pearly-grey colour, and
of the same consistency as the clouds with which it
mingled.


## p. 174 (#194) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
Passing over this ridge, and descending into a
wide valley which was fertilized and beautified by a
moderately-sized rivulet, Kambira led his followers
towards a hamlet which lay close to the stream,
nestled in a woody hollow, and, like all other Man-
ganja villages, was surrounded by an impenetrable
hedge of poisonous euphorbia-a tree which casts
a deep shade, and renders it difficult for bowmen to
aim at the people inside.
In the immediate vicinity of the village the land
was laid out in little gardens and fields, and in these
the people—men, women, and children,—were busily
engaged in hoeing the ground, weeding, planting, or
gathering the fruits of their labour.
These same fruits were plentiful, and the people
sang with joy as they worked. There were large
crops of maize, millet, beans, and ground-nuts ; also
patches of yams, rice, pumpkins, cucumbers, cassava,
sweet potatoes, tobacco, cotton, and hemp, which
last is also called "bang," and is smoked by the
natives as a species of tobacco.
It was a pleasant sight for Kambira and his men
to look upon, as they rested for a few minutes on
the brow of a knoll near a thicket of bramble bushes,
and gazed down upon their home. Doubtless they
thought so, for their eyes glistened, so also did their
teeth when they smilingly commented on the scene
before them. They did not, indeed, become enthu-

siastic about scenery, nor did they refer to the
picturesque grouping of huts and trees, or make any
allusion whatever to light and shade; no, their
thoughts were centred on far higher objects than
these. They talked of wives and children, and
hippopotamus flesh; and their countenances glowed
—although they were not white—and their strong
hearts beat hard against their ribs-although they
were not clothed, and their souls (for we repudiate
Yoosoof's opinion that they had none), their souls
appeared to take quiet but powerful interest in their
belongings.
It was pleasant, also, for Kambira and his men to
listen to the sounds that floated up from the valley,
-sweeter far than the sweetest strains of Mozart
or Mendelssohn,—the singing of the workers in the
fields and gardens, mellowed by distance into a soft
humming tone ; and the hearty laughter that burst
occasionally from men seated at work on bows,
arrows, fishing-nets, and such-like gear, on a flat
green spot under the shade of a huge banyan-tree,
which, besides being the village workshop, was the
village reception-hall, where strangers were enter-
tained on arriving,—also the village green, where
the people assembled to dance, and sing, and smoke
" bang," to which last they were much addicted, and
to drink beer made by themselves, of which they
were remarkably fond, and by means of which they

sometimes got drunk ;-in all which matters the in-
telligent reader will not fail to observe that they bore
a marked resemblance to many of the civilized Euro-
pean nations, except, perhaps, in their greater freedom
of action, lightness of costume, and colour of skin.
The merry voices of children, too, were heard, and
their active little black bodies were seen, while they
engaged in the play of savages—though not neces-
sarily in savage play. Some romped, ran after each
other, caught each other, tickled each other, occa-
sionally whacked each other—just as our own little
ones do. Others played at games, of which the skip-
ping-rope was a decided favourite among the girls, but
the play of most of the older children consisted in
imitating the serious work of their parents. The
girls built little huts, hoed little gardens, made small
pots of clay, pounded imaginary corn in miniature
mortars, cooked it over ideal fires, and crammed it
down the throats of imitation babies; while the boys
performed deeds of chivalric daring with reed spears,
small shields, and tiny bows and arrows, or amused
themselves in making cattle-pens, and in sculpturing
cows and crocodiles. Human nature, in short, was
powerfully developed, without anything particular
to suggest the idea of " savage" life, or to justify the
opinion of Arabs and half-caste Portuguese that
black men are all "cattle."
The scene wanted only the spire of a village

church and the tinkle of a Sabbath bell to make it
perfect.
But there was a tinkle among the other sounds,
not unlike a bell, which would have sounded marvel-
lously familiar to English ears had they been listen-
ing. This was the ringing of the anvil of the village
blacksmith. Yes, savage though they were, these
natives had a blacksmith who wrought in iron,
almost as deftly, and to the full as vigorously, as
any British son of Vulcan. The Manganja people
are an industrious race. Besides cultivating the soil
extensively, they dig iron-ore out of the hills, and
each village has its smelting-house, its charcoal-
burners, its forge with a pair of goatskin bellows, and
its blacksmith-we might appropriately say, its very
blacksmith! Whether the latter would of necessity,
and as a matter of course, sing bass in church if the
land were civilized enough to possess a church, re-
mains to be seen ! At the time we write of, he merely
hummed to the sound of the hammer, and forged hoes,
axes, spears, needles, arrow-heads, bracelets, armlets,
necklets, and anklets, with surprising dexterity.
Pity that he could not forge a chain which would
for ever restrain the murderous hands of the Arabs
and half-caste Portuguese who for ages have blighted
his land with their pestilential presence !
After contemplating the picture for a time, Kam-
bira descended the winding path that led to the

village. He had not proceeded far when one of the
smallest of the children-a creature so rotund that
his body and limbs were a series of circles and
ovals, and so black that it seemed an absurdity
even to think of casting a shadow on him—
espied the advancing party, uttered a shrill cry of
delight, and ran towards them.
His example was followed by a dozen others, who,
being larger, outran him, and, performing a war-dance
round the men, possessed themselves by amicable
theft of pieces of raw meat, with which they hastened
back to the village. The original discoverer of the
party, however, had other ends in view. He toddled
straight up to Kambira with the outstretched arms
of a child who knows he will be welcomed.
Kambira was not demonstrative, but he was hearty.
Taking the little ball of black butter by the arms,
he whirled him over his head, and placed him on his
broad shoulders, with a fat leg on each side of his
neck, and left him there to look after himself. This
the youngster did by locking his feet together under
the man's chin, and fastening his fat fingers in his
woolly hair, in which position he bore some resem-
blance to an enormous chignon.
Thus was he borne crowing to the chief's hut,
from the door of which a very stout elderly woman
came out to receive them.
There was no one else in the hut to welcome

them, but Yohama, as the chief styled her, was suffi-
cient; she was what some people call " good com-
pany." She bustled about making preparations for
a feast with a degree of activity that was quite sur-
prising in one so fat--so very fat—asking questions
the while with much volubility, making remarks
to the child, criticising the hippopotamus-meat, or
commenting on things in general.
Meanwhile Kambira seated himself in a corner
and prepared to refresh himself with a pipe of bang
in the most natural and civilized fashion imaginable ;
and young Obo—for so Yohama called him—entered
upon a series of gymnastic exercises with his father
—for such Kambira was—which partook of the play-
fulness of the kitten mingled with the eccentricity
and mischief of the monkey.
It would have done you good, reader, if you
possess a spark of sympathy, to have watched these
two as they played together. The way in which
Obo assaulted his father, on whose visage mild
benignity was enthroned, would have surprised you.
Kambira was a remarkably grave, quiet, and re-
served man, but that was a matter of no moment
to Obo, who threatened him in front, skirmished in
his rear, charged him on the right flank with a reed
spear, shelled him on the left with sweet potatoes,
and otherwise harassed him with amazing perse-
verance and ingenuity.

To this the enemy paid no further attention than
lay in thrusting out an elbow and raising a knee to
check an unusually fierce attack, or in giving Obo a
pat on the back when he came within reach, or
sending a puff of smoke in his face, as if to taunt
and encourage him to attempt further deeds of
daring.
While this was going on in the chief's hut, active
culinary preparations were progressing all over the
village—the women forsook their hoes and grind-
ing-mortars, and the looms on which they had been
weaving cotton cloth, the men laid down various
implements of industry, and, long ere the sun began
to descend in the west, the entire tribe was feasting
with all the gusto, and twenty times the appetite, of
aldermen.
During the progress of the feast, a remarkably
small, wiry old negro, entertained the chief and his
party with a song, accompanying himself the while
on a violin-not a European fiddle, by any means,
but a native production—with something like a
small keg, covered with goat-skin, for a body, a
longish handle, and one string which was played
with a bow by the " Spider." Never having heard
his name, we give him one in accordance with his
aspect.

of the north, could hold a candle—we had almost
said a fiddle-to this sable descendant of Ham, who,
squatted on his hams in the midst of an admiring
circle, drew forth sounds from his solitary string
that were more than exquisite,—they were excru-
ciating.
The song appeared to be improvised, for it referred
to objects around, as well as to things past, present,
and to come; among others, to the fact that slave
parties attacked villages and carried off the in-
habitants.
At such points the minstrel's voice became low
and thrilling, while his audience grew suddenly
earnest, opened their eyes, frowned, and showed
their teeth ; but as soon as the subject was changed
the feeling seemed to die away. It was only old
memories that had been awakened, for no slavers
had passed through their country for some time
past, though rumours of an attack on a not very
distant tribe had recently reached and greatly
alarmed them.
Thus they passed the afternoon, and when the
cool of the evening drew on a dance was proposed,
seconded, and carried unanimously.
They were about to begin when a man was seen
running down the path leading to the village at a
speed which proved him to be the bearer of tidings.
In a few minutes he burst into the midst of them

with glaring eyeballs and labouring chest—for he
had run fast, though not far, and told his news in
rapid short sentences—to the effect that a band of
slavers, led by Portuguese, were on their way to the
valley, within a mile or so of it even while he spoke;
that he thought the leader was Marizano; and that
they were armed with the loud-sounding guns !
The consternation consequent on this news was
universal, and there was good ground for it, because
Marizano was a well-known monster of cruelty, and
his guns had rendered him invincible hitherto
wherever he went, the native spear and bow being
utterly useless in the hands of men who, however
courageous, were shot down before they could come
within arrow-range of their enemies.
It is the custom of the slave-dealers, on going
into the interior for the purpose of procuring slaves,
to offer to buy them from such tribes as are disposed
to sell. This most of the tribes are willing to do.
Fathers do not, indeed, sell their own children, or
husbands their wives, from preference, but chiefs
and head men are by no means loath to get rid of
their criminals in this way-their bad stock, as it
were, of black ivory. They also sell orphans and
other defenceless ones of their tribes, the usual rate
of charge being about two or three yards of calico
for a man, woman, or child.
But the Arab slave-dealer sometimes finds it diffi-

cult to procure enough of " cattle" in this way to
make up a band sufficiently large to start with for
the coast, because he is certain to lose four out of
every five, at the lowest estimate, on his journey down.
The drove, therefore, must be large. In order to
provide it he sends out parties to buy where they
can, and to steal when they have the chance. Mean-
while he takes up his quarters near some tribe, and
sets about deliberately to produce war. He rubs up
old sores, foments existing quarrels, lends guns and
ammunition, suggests causes of dispute, and finally
gets two tribes to fight. Of course many are
slaughtered, fearful barbarities and excesses are
committed, fields are laid waste and villages are
burnt, but this is a matter of no consequence to our
Arab. Prisoners are sure to be taken, and he buys
the prisoners ; for the rest,—there are plenty of
natives in Africa !
When all else fails, not being very particular,
he sends off a party under some thorough-going
scoundrel, well armed, and with instructions to
attack and capture wherever they go.
No wonder, then, that the rumoured approach of
• Marizano and his men caused the utmost alarm in
Kambira's village, and that the women and children
were ordered to fly to the bush without delay. This
they required no second bidding to do, but oh! it
was a sad sight to see them do it. The younger

women ran actively, carrying the infants and lead-
ing the smaller children by the hands, and soon dis-
appeared; but it was otherwise with the old people.
These, men and women, bowed with age, and totter-
ing as much from terror as decrepitude, hobbled
along panting as they went, and stumbling over
every trifling obstruction in their path, being some-
times obliged to stop and rest though death might be
the consequence; and among these there were a few
stray little creatures barely able to toddle, who had
probably been forgotten or forsaken by their mothers
in the panic, yet were of sufficient age to be aware,
in their own feeble way, that danger of some sort
was behind them, and that safety lay before. By
degrees all—young and old, strong and feeble-
gained the shelter of the bush, and Kambira was
left with a handful of resolute warriors to check the
invaders and defend his home.
Well was it at that time for Kambira and his
men that the approaching band was not Marizano
and his robbers.
When the head of the supposed enemy's column
appeared on the brow of the adjacent hill, the
Manganja chief fitted an arrow to his bow, and,
retiring behind a hut, as also did his followers,
resolved that Marizano should forfeit his life even
though his own should be the penalty. Very bitter
were his thoughts, for his tribe had suffered from

that villain at a former period, and he longed to rid
the land of him.
As he thought thus he looked at his followers
with an expression of doubt, for he knew too well
that the Manganja were not a warlike tribe, and
feared that the few who remained with him might
forsake him in the hour of need. Indeed, much of
his own well-known courage was to be attributed
to the fact, that his mother had belonged to a family
more or less nearly connected with the Ajawa, who
are very warlike—too much so, in truth, for it is
they who, to a large extent, are made use of by the
slave-dealers to carry on war with the neighbouring
tribes. Kambira's men, however, looked resolute,
though very grave.
While he was thus meditating vengeance, he ob-
served that one of the approaching band advanced
alone without arms, and making signs of peace.
This surprised him a little, but, dreading treachery,
he kept under the shelter of a hut until the stranger
was close to the village ; then, observing that the
party on the hill had laid down their arms and
seated themselves on the grass, he advanced, still,
however, retaining his weapons.
The stranger was a little man, and appeared timid,
but seeing that the chief evidently meant no mis-
chief, and knowing that the guns of his friends had
him within range, he drew near.

"Where come you from?" demanded Kambira.
To this Antonio—for it was he-replied that his
party came from the coast; that they wanted to
pass through the land to see it, and to find out what
it produced and what its people had to sell; that it
was led by two Englishmen, who belonged to a
nation that detested slavery—the same nation that
sent out Dr. Livingstone, who, as everybody knew,
had passed through that land some years before.
They were also, he said, countrymen of the men of
God who had come out to teach the Manganja the
Truth, who had helped them in their troubles, deli-
vered them from the slave-traders, and some of
whom had died in their land. He added that there
were Manganja men and women in their company.
The "men of God" to whom Antonio referred,
and to whom he had been expressly told by Harold
Seadrift to refer, were those devoted missionaries
mentioned in a previous chapter, who, under the
leadership of the amiable and true-hearted Bishop
Mackenzie, established a mission among these very
Manganja hills in the year 1861. By a rare com-
bination of Christian love and manly courage under
very peculiar circumstances, they acquired extra-
ordinary power and influence over the natives in the
space of a few months, and laid the foundation of
what might have been—perhaps may yet be-true
Christianity in Central Africa. But the country

was unhappily involved at the time in one of the
wars created by the Portuguese and Arab slave-
traders. The region was almost depopulated by
man-stealers, and by the famine that resulted from
the culture of the land having been neglected during
the panic. The good bishop and several of his
devoted band sank under the combined effects of
climate and anxiety, and died there, while the en-
feebled remnant were compelled, sorrowfully, to
quit the field, to the deep regret of the surviving
Manganja.
When, therefore, Antonio mentioned Bishop
Mackenzie and Dr. Livingstone, a gleam of intelli-
gent interest lit up Kambira's swarthy countenance,
and he was about to speak, but suddenly checked
himself, and a stern frown chased the gleam away.
"The Manganja," he said, after a few moments'
silence, during which poor Antonio eyed him with
some distrust, "know well that these men of God
were not of the same country as the Arab and the
Portuguese; that they hated slavery and loved the
Manganja, and that the graves of some of them are
with us now; but we know also that some white
men are great liars. How am I to make sure that

your leaders are English? Why did you not bring
down the Manganja nien and women you say are
with you ?"
"The women were footsore, and fell behind with
their men," answered Antonio, "and we thought it
best not to wait for them."
"Go," rejoined Kambira, waving his hand; "if
you be true men let the Englishmen come to me,
and also the Manganja, without guns, then I will
believe you.-Go."
The peremptory manner in which this was said
left no room for reply. Antonio therefore returned
to his friends, and the chief to his cover.
On consultation and consideration it was agreed
that Kambira's advice should be acted on, "For,"
said Disco, removing the pipe with which he had
been solacing himself during Antonio's absence, "we
can plant our fellers on the knoll here with a blun-
derbuss each, and arrange a signal so that, if there
should be anything like foul play, we'd have nothin'
to do but hold aloft a kercher or suthin o' that sort,
an'they'd pour a broadside into 'em afore they
could wink—d'ee see ?".
"Not quite clearly," replied Harold, smiling,
" because some of our fellows can't take an aim at
all, much less a good one, so they'd be as likely to
shoot us as them."
Disco pondered this a little, and shook his head,

189
then shook the ashes out of his pipe, and said that
on the whole he was willing to risk it,—that they
"could not expect to travel through Afriky without
risking summat."
As Chimbolo with his wife and the rest of the
party came up at that moment, the case was put
before him. He at once advised compliance with
Kambira's request, saying that the presence of him-
self and his friends would be quite sufficient to put
the chief's mind at rest.
In a few minutes the plan was carried out, and
Kambira satisfied of the good faith of his visitors.
Nevertheless he did not at once throw open his
arms to them. He stood upon his dignity; asked
them a good many questions, and answered a good
many more, addressing himself always to Antonio
as the spokesman, it being a point of etiquette not
to address the principal of the party. Then, presents
were exchanged, in the management of which a
considerable time was spent. One of the warriors
having in the meantime been despatched to recall
the fugitives, these began to pour out of the woods,
the frail old people and forsaken toddlers being the
last to return, as they had been the last to fly.
After this, fires were kindled, fowls were chased,
caught, slain, plucked, roasted, and boiled; hippo-
potamus-flesh was produced, the strangers were in-
vited to make themselves at home, which they very

soon did. Beer and bang were introduced ; the
celebrated fiddler was reinstated, the dance, which
had been so long delayed, was at last fairly begun,
and, as if to make the picture perfect and felicity
complete, the moon came out from behind a thick
cloud, and clothed the valley with a flood of silver
light.

REVEALS DISCO'S OPINIONS ABOUT SAVAGES, AND THE SAVAGES' OPINIONS
OF DISCO, AND OTHER WEIGHTY MATTERS.
As two or three of Harold's people were not very
well just at that time, he resolved to remain at
Kambira's village for a few days to give them rest,
and afterwards to push on to the country of his
friend Chimbolo.
This arrangement he came to the more readily
that he was short of provisions, and Kambira told
him that a particular part of the country near the
shores of a lake not far distant abounded with game
of all sorts.
To Disco Lillihammer he explained his plans next
day, while that worthy, seated under the shade of a
banyan-tree, was busily engaged with what he styled
his "mornin' dooties"-namely, the filling and smok-
ing of his cutty-pipe.
"You see, Disco," he said, " it won't do to knock
up the men with continuous travel, therefore I shall
give them a spell of rest here. Kambira tells me
that there is plenty of game, large and small, to be

had not far off, so that we shall be able to replenish
our stock of meat, and perchance give the niggers a
feast such as they have not been accustomed to of
late, for it is not too much to expect that our rifles
will do more execution, at all events among lions and
elephants, than native spears. Besides, I wish to see
something of the people, who, being what we may
call pure out-and-out savages—"
"Savages !" interrupted Disco, removing his pipe,
and pointing with the stem of it to the village on
an eminence at the outskirts of which they were
seated;" d'ee call them folk savages ?"
Harold looked at the scene before him, and paused
for a few moments; and well he might, for not fifty
yards off the blacksmith was plying his work ener-
getically, while a lad sat literally between a pair of
native bellows, one of which he blew with his left
hand, the other with his right, and, beyond these,
groups of men and women wrought at their primitive
looms or tilled their vegetable gardens and patches
of land.
" Savages !" repeated Disco, still pointing to the
village with the stem of his pipe, and gazing earnestly
at his companion, " humph !".
It is probable that Disco might have said more,
but he was an accurate judge of the precise moment
when a pipe is about to go out, and delay will prove
fatal. He therefore applied himself diligently to

suck and cherish the dying spark. Having revived
its powers to such an extent that clouds enveloped
his visage, and his nose, being red, loomed luridly
through them, he removed the pipe, and again said
"Humph! They ain't a bit more savages, sir, than
you or me is."
"Perhaps not," replied Harold. "To say truth,
it would be difficult to point out any peculiarity
that justifies the name, except the fact that they
wear very little clothing, and neither go to school
nor church."
"They wears no clothin'," rejoined Disco, "'cause
they don't need for to do so; an' they don't go to
church or school, 'cause they hain't got none to go
to-that same bein' not the fault o' the niggers, but
o' them as knows better."
"There's truth in what you say, Disco," returned
Harold, with a smile," but come, you must admit
that there is something .savage in the custom they
have of wearing these hideous lip-rings."
The custom to which he referred is one which
prevails among several of the tribes of Africa, and is
indeed so utterly hideous and outrageous that we
should be justified in refusing to believe it, were we
not assured of the fact by Dr. Livingstone and other
missionaries and travellers of unquestionable in-
tegrity. The ring is worn in the upper lip, not
hanging from it, but fitted into a hole in it, in such

a manner as to thrust the lip straight and far out
from the face. As the ring is about the size of an
ordinary napkin-ring, it may be easily believed that
time is required for the formation of the deformity.
At an early age the middle of the upper-lip of a
girl is pierced close to the nose, and a small pin in-
troduced to prevent the hole closing up. After it is
healed the pin is taken out and a larger one forced
into its place, and so for weeks, months, and years
the process of increasing the size of the lip goes on,
until a ring of two inches in diameter can be intro-
duced. Nearly all the women in these parts use this
ring, or, as it is called, pelele. Some make them of
bamboo, others of ivory or tin. When a wearer of
the pelele smiles, the action of the cheek muscles
draws the lip tight, which has the effect of raising
the ring towards the eyebrows, so that the nose is
seen in the middle of it, and the teeth are exposed,
a revelation which shows that the latter have been
chipped to sharp points so as to resemble the teeth
of a cat or crocodile.
"No doubt," said Disco, in reply to Harold's
remark, "the lip-rings are uncommon ugly, but the
principle o' the thing, sir, that's w'ere it is, the
principle ain't no wuss than ear-rings. The savages,
as we calls 'em, bores holes in their lips an' sticks
rings into 'em. The civilized folk, as we calls our-
selves, bores holes in their ears an' sticks rings into

'em. W'ere's the difference? that 's wot I want to
know."
". There's not much difference in principle," said
Harold, laughing, " but there is a great difference in
appearance. Ear-rings hang gracefully; lip-rings
stick out horribly."
" H'm ! it appears to me that that's a matter o'
taste, now. Howsoever, I do admit that lip-rings is
wuss than ear-rings; moreover it must make kissin'
somewhat difficult, not to say onpleasant, but, as I
said before, so I says again, It's all in the principle
w'ere it lies. W'y, look here, sir,—savages, as we
call 'em, wear brass rings round their necks, our
women wear gold and brass chains. The savages
wear anklets, we wear bracelets. They have no end
o'rings on their toes, we have 'em on our fingers.
Some savages shave their heads, some of us shaves
our faces. Their women are raither given to clothin'
which is too short and too narrer, ours come out in
toggery far too wide, and so long sometimes, that a
feller daren't come within a fathom of 'em astarn
without runnin' the risk o'trampin' on, an' carry-
ing away some o' the canvas. The savage women
frizzes out their hair into most fantastical shapes,
till the very monkeys has to hold their sides
sittin' in the trees larfin' at 'em-and wot do we do
in regard to that? W'y, some of our women puts
on a mixture o' hairy pads, an' combs, an' pins, an'

ribbons, an' flowers, in a bundle about twice the size
o'their heads, all jumbled together in such a way as
to defy description ; an' if the monkeys was to see
them, they'd go off into such fits that they'd bu'st
altogether an' the race would become extinct in
Afriky. No, sir ; it's my opinion that there ain't no
such thing as savages—or, if you choose to put it
the tother way, we're all savages together."
Disco uttered the last part of his speech with
intense energy, winding it up with the usual slap
on the thigh, delivered with unusual fervour, and
then, becoming aware that the vital spark of the
cutty had all but fled, he applied himself to its re-
suscitation, in which occupation he found relief to
his feelings, and himself formed a brilliant illustra-
tion of his remarks on savage customs.
Harold admitted that there was much truth in
what he said, but rather inclined to the opinion
that of the two sets of savages the uncivilized were,
if anything, the wildest. Disco however, contrary
to his usual habits, had nailed his colours to the
mast on that point, and could not haul them down.
Meanwhile Harold's opinion was to some extent
justified by the appearance of a young man, who,
issuing from the jungle close at hand, advanced to-
wards them.
Most of the men at the village displayed a good
deal of pride, if not taste, in the arrangement of

their hair. Some wore it long and twisted into a
coil which hung down their backs; others trained
and stiffened it in such a way that it took the form
of buffalo horns, while some allowed it to hang over
the shoulders in large masses, and many shaved it
either entirely, or partially in definite patterns. But
the young dandy who now approached outdid all
others, for he had twisted his hair into innumerable
little tails, which, being stiffened by fillets of the
inner bark of a tree, stuck straight out and radiated
from the head in all directions. His costume other-
wise was simple enough, consisting merely of a
small kilt of white calico. He was accompanied by
Antonio.
"We've be come from Kambira," said the inter-
preter, " to tell you for come to feast."
"All right," said Disco, rising; "always ready for
wittles if you only gives us an hour or two between
times.—I say, Tony" (he had by that time reduced
the interpreter's name to this extent)," ask this feller
what he means by makin' sitch a guy of hisself."
"Hims say it look well," said Antonio, with a
broad grin.
"Looks well-eh ? and ask him why the women
wear that abominable pelele."
When this question was put to the black dandy
he looked at Disco evidently in surprise at his
stupidity. "Because it is the fashion," he said.


## p. 198 (#218) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
" They wear it for beauty, to be sure! Men have
beards and whiskers; women have none, and what
kind of creature would woman be without whiskers,
and without a pelele? She would have a mouth
like a man, and no beard !"
The bare idea of such a state of things tickled
the dandy so much that he went into roars of
laughter, insomuch that all the radiating tails of
his head quivered again. The effect of laughter
and tails together was irresistible. Harold, Disco,
and Antonio laughed in sympathy, till the tears
ran down their cheeks, and then returned to the
village where Kambira and his chief men awaited
them.
While enjoying the feast prepared for them,
Harold communicated his intentions and desires to
the chief, who was delighted at the prospect of hav-
ing such powerful allies on a hunting expedition.
The playful Obo meanwhile was clambering over
his father's person like a black monkey. He ap-
peared to be particularly fond of his father, and as
love begets love, it is not surprising that Kambira
was excessively fond of Obo. But Obo, becoming
obstreperous, received an amicable punch from his
father, which sent him headlong into a basket of
boiled hippopotamus. He gave a wild howl of alarm
as Disco snatched him out of the dish, dripping with
fat, and set him on his knee.

"There, there, don't blubber," said the seaman,
tenderly wiping off the fat, while the natives, in-
cluding Kambira, exploded with laughter. "You
ain't burnt, are you?".
As Obo could not reply, Disco put his finger into
the gravy from which the urchin had been rescued,
and satisfied himself that it was not hot enough to
have done the child injury. This was also rendered
apparent by his suddenly ceasing to cry, struggling
off Disco's knee, and renewing his assaults on his
easy-going father.
Accepting an egg which was offered him by
Yohama, Harold broke it, and entered into conver-
sation with Kambira through the medium of
Antonio.
"Is your boy's mother a—Hollo! there's a chick
in this egg," he exclaimed, throwing the offensive
morsel into the fire.
Jumbo, who sat near the place where it fell,
snatched it up, grinned, and putting it into his
cavernous mouth, swallowed it.
"Dem's betterer wid chickies," he said, resuming
his gravity and his knife and fingers,-forks being
held by him in light esteem.
"Ask him, Antonio, if Obo's mother is alive,"
said Harold, trying another egg, which proved to be
in better condition.
The interpreter, instead of putting the question

without comment, as was his wont, shook bis head,
looked mysterious, and whispered—
"No better ask dat. Hims lost him's wife. The
slave-hunters cotch her some time ago, and carry
her off when hims away hunting. Hims awful mad,
worser dan mad elerphint when hims speak to 'bout
her."
Harold of course dropped the subject at once,
after remarking that he supposed Yohama was the
child's grandmother.
"Yis," said Antonio ; "she be Kambira's moder,
an' Obo's gran'moder—bof at once."
This fact was, we may almost say, self-evident,
for Obo's attentions and favours were distributed
exclusively between Yohama and Kambira, though
the latter had unquestionably the larger share.
During the course of the feast beer was served
round by the little man who had performed so deftly
on the violin the previous evening.
"Drink," said Kambira hospitably; "I am glad
to see my white brothers here ; drink, it will warm
your hearts."
"Ay, an' it won't make us drunk," said Disco,
destroying Jumbo's peace of mind by winking and
making a face at him as he raised the calabash to
his lips. "Here's long life to you, Kambira, an'
death to slavery."
There can be no doubt that the chief and his

201
retainers would have heartily applauded that senti-
ment if they had understood it, but at the moment
Antonio was too deeply engaged with another cala-
bash to take the trouble to translate it.
The beer, which was pink, and as thick as gruel,
was indeed too weak to produce intoxication unless
taken in very large quantities ; nevertheless many
of the men were so fond of it that they sometimes
succeeded in taking enough to bring them to the
condition which we style "fuddled." But at that
time the particular brew was nearly exhausted, so
that temperance was happily the order of the day.
Having no hops in those regions, they are
unable to prevent fermentation, and are therefore
obliged to drink up a whole brewing as quickly as
possible after it is made.
"Man, why don't ye wash yer face?" said Disco
to the little fiddler as he replenished his calabash;
"it's awful dirty."
Jumbo laughed, of course, and the small musician,
not understanding what was said, followed suit out
of sympathy.
"Wash him's face!" cried Antonio, laughing,
"him would as soon cut off him's head. Manganja
nevair wash. Ah me! You laugh if you hear de
womans ask me yesterday—'Why you wash?' dey
say, 'our men nevair do.' Ho! ho! dey looks like
it too."

"I'm sure that cannot be said of Kambira or any
of his chief men," said Harold.
"Perhaps not," retorted Antonio, "but some of
'um nevair wash. Once 'pon a time one man of dis
tribe foller a party me was with. Not go way for
all we tell 'um. We said we shoot 'um. No mat-
ter, hims foller still. At last we say, "You scoun'rel,
we wash you! Ho! how hims run! Jist like
zebra wid lion at 'um's tail. Nevair see 'um after
dat-nevair more !"
"Wot a most monstrous ugly feller that is sittin
opposite Kambira, on the other side o' the fire-
the feller with the half-shaved head," said Disco in
an undertone to Harold during a temporary pause
in eating
"A well-made man, however," replied Harold.-
"I say, Disco," he added, with a peculiar smile,
"you think yourself rather a good-looking fellow,
don't you, now?"
The worthy seaman, who was indeed an excep-
tionally good-looking tar, modestly replied-
"Well now, as you have put it so plump I don't
mind if I do confess that I've had some wild sus-
picions o' that sort now and then."
"Then you may dismiss your suspicions now, for
I can assure you that you are regarded in this land
as a very monster of ugliness," said Harold, laughing.
" In the estimation of niggers your garments are

203
hideous; your legs they think elephantine, your red
beard frightful, and your blue eyes savage-savage !
think of that."
"Well, well," retorted Disco, "your own eyes are
as blue as mine, an' I don't suppose the niggers
think more of a yaller beard than a red one."
"Too true, Disco; we are both ill-favoured fellows
here, whatever we may be elsewhere; however, as
we don't intend to take Manganja wives it won't
matter much. But what think you of our plan,
now that Kambira is ready to fall in with it?"
"It seems a good one. When do we start ?"
"To-morrow," said Harold.
" Wery good," replied Disco, "I'm agreeable."
The morrow came, and with the early light all
the people turned out to witness the departure of
the hunters. Scouts had been previously sent out
in all directions to make sure that no enemies or
slave-traders were at that time in their immediate
neighbourhood, and a strong force of the best warriors
was left to guard the village.
Of Harold's band, two half-castes, José and Oliveira,
volunteered to stay in camp with the guard, and
two, Songolo and Mabruki, the freemen of Quilli-
mane, remained in the village to recruit their health,
which had failed. Chimbolo likewise remained, the
wounds on his back not having healed sufficiently
to admit of the hard labour of hunting. All the

rest accompanied the hunters, and of these the
three Makololo men, Jumbo, Zombo, and Masiko,
were incomparably the best and bravest. Of
course the volatile Antonio also went, being indis-
pensable.
On setting out-each man with his sleeping mat
on his back and his little wooden pillow hung at his
neck,—there was a great deal of shouting and ho-
ho-ing and well-wishing on the part of those who
remained behind, but above all the noise there
arose a shrill cry of intense and agonizing despair.
This proceeded from the small windpipe of little
Obo, who had not, until the last moment, made the
appalling discovery that Kambira was going away
without him!
There was something very touching in the cry of
the urchin, and something which brought vividly to
the minds of the Englishmen the infantine com-
munity of their own land. There was the same
sudden gaze of horror on realizing the true position
of affairs,—the same sharp shriek and frantic struggle
to escape from the grasp of those who held him
back from following his father,--the same loud cry
of agony on finding that his efforts were vain, and
then, the wide-open mouth, the close-shut eyes, and
the awful, prolonged silence—suggestive of fits-
that betokens the concentration of mind, heart, and
lungs into that tremendous roar of unutterable sig-

nificance which appears to be the safety-valve of
the human family, black and white, at that tender
period of life.
Poor Obo ! his sobs continued to burst out with
steam-engine power, and his eyes to pour cataracts
of tears into Yohama's sympathetic bosom, long after
the hunting party had left the hills behind them,
and advanced into the almost impenetrable jungles
of the low grounds.

CHAPTER XII.
DESCRIBES A HUNTING EXPEDITION WHICH WAS BOTH EXCITING
AND SUCCESSFUL.
Down by the reedy margin of a pretty large lake
—where wild-fowl innumerable made the air vocal
with their cries by day, and frogs, in numbers in-
conceivable, chirped and croaked a lullaby to men
who slept, and a symphony to beasts that howled
and growled and prowled at night in bush and
brake-Kambira pitched his camp.
He did not, indeed, select the moist level of the
fever-breeding marshes, but he chose for his tem-
porary habitation the dry summit of a wooded hill
which overlooked the lake.
Here the natives of the neighbourhood said that
elephants had been lately seen, and buffaloes, zebras,
etc., were at all times numerous.
After two long days' march they had reached
the spot, and encamped late in the evening. Next
morning early the business of the expedition began.
Various parties of natives, armed with bows and

BLACK IVORY.
207
arrows and spears, were sent out in different direc-
tions, but the principal band was composed of Kam-
bira and his chief men, with Harold and his party.
They did not go far before game was found.
Guinea-fowl were numerous, and those who were
armed with bows soon procured a goodly supply of
these, but our travellers did not waste their energies or
powder on such small game. Besides these, monkeys
peeped inquisitively at the hunters from among the
trees, and myriads of turtle doves were seen in the
covers. As they advanced, wild pigs, elands, water-
bucks, koodoos, and other creatures, were seen in
herds, and the natives dropped off, or turned aside
in pursuit of these, so that ere long the band re-
maining with Kambira was reduced to about forty
men.
Coming to a small river in which were a number
of deep pools and shallows, they saw several hippo-
potami lying asleep, their bodies nearly all out of
the water, appearing like masses of black rock in the
stream. But at the same place they discovered
fresh traces of elephants and buffaloes, therefore the
hippopotami were left unmolested, save that Harold
sent a bullet amongst them, partly to let the natives
hear the report of his gun, and partly to see how the
animals would take it.
They all started to their feet at once, and stared
around them with looks of stolid surprise that were

almost equal to the looks of the natives, to whom
fire-arms were little known, except by report.
Another shot sent the whole herd with a heavy
plunge into deep water.
"It's a queer country," observed Disco when they
had resumed their march. "Just look at them there
lizards with red and blue tails running about among
the rocks an' eatin' up the white ants like one
o'clock."
Disco might have said like twelve o'clock, if num-
bers would have added to the force of his remark,
for the little creatures referred to were miraculously
active in pursuit of their food.
"But I s'pose," continued Disco, "the niggers
would think our country a queerer place than this."
" Undoubtedly they would," replied Harold;"just
fancy what would be the feelings of Kambira if he
were suddenly transported into the heart of London."
"Hallo !" exclaimed Disco, stopping suddenly and
pointing to one of the men in advance, who had
crouched and made signals to his friends to halt,
" breakers ahead—eh ?"
"More likely buffaloes," whispered Harold, as he
cocked his rifle and advanced quickly with Kambira,
who carried a short spear or javelin.
On reaching an opening in the bushes, a small
herd of zebras was observed not much more than a
hundred yards in advance.

" Will the white man's gun kill so far?" asked the
chief, turning to Antonio.
The interpreter made no reply, but pointed to
Harold, who was in the act of taking aim. The loud
report was followed by the fall of the nearest zebra.
Disco also fired and wounded another, which bounded
away in wild alarm with its fellows.
The natives yelled with delight, and Disco cheered
in sympathy.
"You've hit him," said Harold, as he reloaded.
"Ay, but I han't disabled him. Better luck next
time. I think I took him somewhere on the port
bow."
"If by that you mean the left shoulder," returned
Harold, with a laugh, "it's likely he won't run far.
What does Kambira think of the white man's gun?"
he added, turning round.
The tall chief nodded approvingly, and said, with
a grave countenance—"Good, good; it is good —
better than this," shaking his short spear.
At that moment a small antelope, which had
been startled and put to flight by some of the other
bands of hunters, came crashing wildly towards them,
ignorant of the enemy in its front until within about
thirty yards. It turned at a sharp angle and
plunged into the jungle, but the spear which Kam-
bira had shaken whizzed through the air and pierced
its heart before it had time to disappear.

"A splendid heave!" cried Disco, with enthusiasm;
"why, man alive, you'd make yer fortin' as a har-
pooner if ye was to go to the whale-fishin'.-Hallo i
there's somethin' else ; w'y, the place is swarmin'.
It's for all the world like a zoological gardings let
loose."
As he spoke, the hoofs of a herd of ponderous
animals were heard, but the rank grass and under-
wood concealed them entirely from view. The
whole party rushed to the nearest opening, and were
just in time to see the tail of an irate buffalo make
a magnificent flourish in the air as its owner
plunged into cover.
There was no further attempt at conversation after
this. The near presence of large game was too
exciting, so that merely a word of advice, direction,
or inquiry, passed as the party advanced rapidly-
one or two of the most active going before as
pioneers.
While Disco was striding along with flashing eyes,
rifle ready, and head turning from side to side in
momentary expectation of something bounding
suddenly out of somewhere, he chanced to cast his
eyes upwards, and, to his horror, beheld two huge
serpents coiled together among the branches of a
tree close to his head.
Uttering a yell of alarm—for he entertained an
almost superstitious dread of serpents—he fired

211
blindly upwards, and dashed to one side so violently
that he tumbled himself and Harold into a bush of
wait-a-bit thorns, out of which the laughing natives
found it difficult to extract them.
"What is the matter, man?" said Harold some-
what testily.
"Have a care! look! Avast! A bite 'll be death,
an' no mistake!" cried Disco, pointing to the reptiles.
Harold fired at once and brought them both down,
and the natives, attacking them with sticks, soon
killed them.
"No fear," said Antonio, with a chuckle. "Dem
not harm nobody, though ums ugly an' big enough."
This was true. They were a couple of pythons,
and the larger of the two, a female, was ten feet long;
but the python is a harmless creature.
While they were talking, smoke was observed to
rise from an isolated clump of long grass and bushes
not far from the banks of the river, much to the
annoyance of Kambira, who feared that the fire
might spread and scare away the game. It was
confined, however, to the place where it began, but
it had the effect of driving out a solitary buffalo that
had taken refuge in the cover. Jumbo chanced to
be most directly in front of the infuriated animal
when it burst out, and to him exclusively it directed
its attentions.
Never since Jumbo was the size of Obo had that

laughter-loving savage used his lithe legs with
greater energy than on this occasion. An ostrich
might have envied him as he rushed towards the
river, into which he sprang headlong when the
buffalo was barely six feet behind him.
Of course Harold fired, as well as Disco, and both
shots told, as also a spear from Kambira, neverthe-
less the animal turned abruptly on seeing Jumbo
disappear, and charged furiously up the bank,
scattering its enemies right and left. Harold fired
again at little more than fifty yards off, and heard
the bullet thud as it went in just behind the
shoulder, yet, strange to say, it seemed to have no
other effect than to rouse the brute to greater wrath,
and two more bullets failed to bring him down.
This toughness of the buffalo is by no means
uncommon, but different animals vary much in
their tenacity of life. Some fall at once to the first
well-directed shot; others die hard. The animal
the hunters were now in pursuit of, or rather which
was in pursuit of the hunters, seemed to be of the
latter class. Harold fired another shot from behind
a tree, having loaded with a shell-bullet, which ex-
ploded on hitting the creature's ribs. It fell, much
to the satisfaction of Disco, of whom it happened to
be in pursuit at the time. The seaman at once
stopped and began to reload, and the natives came
running forward, when Antonio, who had climbed a

213
tree to be out of harm's way, slipped down and ran
with great bravery up to the prostrate animal.
Just as he reached it the buffalo sprang up with
the activity of a cat and charged him. Antonio
turned and ran with such rapidity that his little
legs became almost invisible, like those of a sparrow
in a hurry. He gained a tree, and had just time to
climb into it when the buffalo struck it like a
battering-ram, hard enough almost to have split
both head and tree. It paused a few seconds, drew
back several paces, glared savagely at Antonio, and
then charged again and again, as if resolved either
to shake him out of the tree or give itself a splitting
headache, but another shell from Harold, who could
hardly take aim for laughing, stretched the huge
animal dead upon the ground. Altogether, it took
two shells and five large solid rifle-balls to finish him.
" That wos a pretty good spurt," said Disco, pant-
ing, as he joined Harold beside the fallen beast.
" It's well known that a starn chase is a long 'un,
but this would have been an exception to the rule
if you hadn't shot him, sir. He pretty nigh made
short work o' me. He was a'most aboard of me wen
you fired."
" True," said Harold ; " and had that tree not
grown where it stands, and grown tough, too, I
suspect he would have made short work of Antonio
too."

BLACK IVORY.
" Bah!" said the interpreter, with affected care-
lessness, "him was but a slow brute, after all."
Disco looked at Jumbo, who was none the worse
of his ducking, and shut his right eye smartly.
Jumbo opened his cavernous mouth, and exploded
so violently that his double row of brilliant teeth
must have been blown out and scattered on the
ground had they not been miraculously strong.
" Come, now," said Kambira, who had just given
orders to some of his followers to remain behind
phants."
"Have we much chance of findin' them ?" in-
quired Disco.
Kambira thought they had, because fresh traces
had been recently seen in the neighbourhood, where-
upon Disco said that he would prefer to go after
lions, but Kambira assured him that these animals
were not so easy to find, and much more dangerous
when attacked. Admitting the force of this, though
still asserting his preference of lions to elephants,
the bloodthirsty son of Neptune shouldered his rifle
and followed his leader.
While the main party of hunters were thus suc-
cessfully pushing along, the other bands were not
idle, though, possessing no fire-arms, they were less
noisy. In fact their proceedings were altogether of
the cat-catty. One fellow, as black as a coal, as

lithe as an eel, and as long—according to Disco's
standard—as a fathom of pump-water, having come
upon a herd of buffalo unseen by them, and being
armed with a small bow and quiver of arrows, sud-
denly dropped on all-fours and began to glide through
the long grass.
Now there is a particular little bird in those
regions which calls for special notice here. It is a
very singular bird, inasmuch as it has constituted
itself the guardian of the buffalo. It frequently sits
upon that animal's back, and, whenever it sees the
approach of man, or any other danger, it flaps its
wings and screams to such an extent, that the
buffalo rushes off without waiting to inquire or see
what is the matter; and the small guardian seems
to think itself sufficiently rewarded with the pick-
ings it finds on the back of its fat friend. So vigilant
is this little creature, that it actually renders the
approach of the hunter a matter of great difficulty
in circumstances when, but for it, he might approach
with ease.
Our wary native was, however, aware of this
little fellow's propensities, and took precautions to
outwit the bird rather than the beast. It may per-
haps cause some surprise to be told that a small
bow and arrows were a sufficiently powerful species
of artillery to bring to bear against such noble game,
See Livingstone's Zumbesi and its Tributaries, p. 209.

but the surprise will vanish when we state that the
arrows were poisoned.
Having crawled to within range, the fathom of
black pump-water suddenly arose and let fly an
arrow. The missile went deep into the side of a
majestic bull. The little bird fluttered and screamed
too late. The bull at once dashed away at full speed,
starting off the whole herd in alarm. The black
fathom followed at the top of his speed, and was
joined by a number of other black fathoms, who
were quite aware of what had been done. The
buffaloes were soon out of sight, but the fathoms
followed the trail with the unerring pertinacity of
fate. After a long run they came up with the
stricken bull, which had fallen behind its fellows,
and waited patiently until the poison took full effect.
In a short time the animal fell, and the successful
hunters fell to work upon his carcase with their
knives.
Leaving them thus employed, we will return to
Kambira and his friends.
They had not gone far when a fine water-buck
was observed feeding beside a creek.
Kambira laid his hand on Harold's shoulder and
pointed to it with a smile, which might have been
interpreted, "Now, then, there's a chance for you !"
Harold fired, and the water-buck dropped.
"Good," said Kambira.

"Hallo!" exclaimed Disco.
And well he might, for at that moment an enor-
mous crocodile, which had evidently been watching
the water-buck, seized and dragged it into the water.
It was not deep, however, and the wounded animal
made a desperate plunge, hauled the crocodile several
yards, and tore itself out of its hideous jaws. It
then jumped into the stream and was swimming
across when another crocodile made a dash at it,
but Harold sent a ball into its ugly head, which
appeared to make it change its mind. It disap-
peared, and the water-buck turning, made for the
bank from which it had started. Just as it reached
it the vital spark fled—the fine head dropped and
the body turned over.
It will be seen from what has been told, that on
this occasion the rifles did most of the work. The
natives who followed Harold had nothing to do but
look on exultingly, glare, dance, show their teeth
and gums, and secure the game. We cannot, per-
haps, expect the good-natured reader to follow us
through all the details of that day's work; but it
would be unpardonable were we to close the chap-
ter without referring to the principal event of the
day, which occurred a couple of hours after the
shooting of the water-buck.
It happened thus :—When the hunters began to
grow tired, and the prospect of falling in with large

game became less hopeful, the chief determined to
return to camp; but Disco felt so disappointed at
not having seen an elephant or a lion, that he ex-
pressed a wish to continue the chase with a sinall
select party. Harold laughed at the idea of the
seaman leading such a party, but offered no objec-
tion, although he did not care to accompany his
friend, having, as he said, had enough of it, and
being desirous of having a long chat with the chief
in camp.
"You see, sir," said Disco, patting the stock of
his rifle with his right hand, "we chance to have
got, so to speak, into the heart of a shoal o' big fish,
an' there's no sayin' how soon they may take it into
their heads to up anchor, and make sail for other
grounds. Therefore, says I, blaze away at 'em
while you've got the chance."
"But you may have as good a chance to-morrow,
or next day," suggested Harold.
"We ain't sure o' that, sir. To-morrow, they say,
never comes," returned Disco. "It's my ambition
to let fly a broadside at a lion or a elephant, so I
means for to go on; an' wot I says is, Who wolun-
teers to sail in company ?"
When the party were given to understand what
"wolunteers" meant, the three Makololo joined
the tar with alacrity, also the Somali negroes
Nakoda and Conda, and about a dozen of the

natives, armed with spears. Disco's own men were
armed with their guns. Antonio, being necessary to
Harold, returned to camp; but this was a matter of
little importance, as Jumbo and his fellow-country-
men knew enough of English to act as interpreters.
Every one who has had a few years' experience of
life knows the truth of the proverb which asserts
that "fortune favours the brave." Its truth was
exemplified on the present occasion not more than
an hour after the little band of heroes had set out.
Disco led the way, as a matter of course, hold-
ing, as he said, that no nigger could possibly be
equal to a white sailor in the matter of steering,
whether ashore or afloat. He steered by the sun,
and directed his course to nowhere in particular,
being influenced chiefly by the form of the ground
and the appearance of the jungle.
Jumbo grinned a good deal at the sententious
gravity with which the leader delivered his orders,
and the self-important strides with which he passed
over the land. He would have grinned still more,
perhaps have laughed outright, if he had understood
that the occasional off-hand kicks which Disco
bestowed on a thick bush here and there, were given
in the hope that a lion might thereby be set up, as
one dislodges a rabbit or a hare!
At last, on reaching the crest of a mound which
was comparatively free of underwood, Disco beheld

a sight which caused him to drop on his hands and
knees as though he had been shot.
Not more than fifty yards off a herd of cow
elephants and their calves were seen feeding quietly
on tall heavy-seeded grass in the plain below.
" Avast!" said Disco, in a hoarse whisper, at the
same time crouching behind a bush, and making
frantic signals to the rest of the party to advance
with extreme caution.
"Wat 'um see ?" inquired Jumbo in a low
whisper, creeping up to his excited leader.
There was no need for a reply. A glance over
the top of the bush sufficed.
"Be quiet as mice now, lads," said Disco, when
all the members of his party had crept around him,
and become aware of the presence of elephants.
"Get your guns laid, and if any one of you dares to
pull a trigger till I give the word, I'll keelhaul
him."
This, or something distantly resembling it, having
been explained to the men who carried guns, they
lay down and took aim.
The noise made by the hunters attracted the
attention of the nearest elephant, and, with true
motherly instinct, she placed her young one between
her fore-legs for protection.
. "We fire right in de middel ob de lot ?" inquired
Zombo hastily.

"Not at all," whispered Disco; " let every man
point at the nearest one—the one that lays broad-
side on to us, wi' the little un under her bows.
Now-ready—present—fire !"
Bang went the seven guns with a degree of pre-
cision that might have put to shame any corps of
volunteer riflemen in England ; up went the trunks
and tails of the elephants, little and big, and away
rushed the whole herd in dire alarm. But the
wounded animal suddenly stumbled and fell on its
knees, then leaped up and ran on heavily.
Meanwhile Disco, who had discharged only one
barrel of his heavy gun, leaped over the bushes, and
rushed forward at a pace which for a few seconds
enabled him to keep ahead even of the fleet natives.
The elephants, however, easily left them all behind,
and it appeared as if the affair were about to end in
disappointment, when the wounded beast again
stumbled.
"Hold on! halt!" cried Disco in a voice of
thunder.
He kneeled at the same time, took aim, and
fired.
Whether it was this last shot, or the effects of
previous loss of blood, we cannot tell; but after
· receiving it, the ponderous animal rolled over on
its side, and died.
To say that the natives became temporarily

insane would give but a feeble idea of what now
took place, because few readers are likely to be
aware of the amazing power of the negro to give
expression to the vagaries of insanity. We shall
therefore content ourselves by saying that they
cheered, laughed, howled, shouted, danced, and
yelled—and leave the rest to imagination.
"Now, then, boys, avast howlin'. Clap a stopper
on your bellows, will 'ee ?" said Disco, in a boat-
swain's roar, that effectually quelled the tumult.
"Cut off to camp, every mother's son of you, an'
bring up Kambira an' all the boys, with as many
knives and dishes as ye can muster, for this moun-
tain of flesh ain't to be cut up in a hurry, an' the
sun won't be long o' goin' to bed. Away with 'ee !
Let's see how you can wag yer black legs, an' I'll
keep watch over the carcase. If anything comes to
have a look at it—a lion, for instance,—so much
the worse for the lion !"
It was in vain that Jumbo explained there was
no necessity for sending more than one of the party
to the camp. Disco was a strict disciplinarian, and,
having given the order, enforced it in a manner
which admitted of no disobedience. They therefore
departed, leaving the seaman seated on the elephant
smoking his pipe with his gun beside him.
But Jumbo did not go far. He soon turned aside
from his companions, and returned to the scene of

the hunt, resolved if possible to give his leader a
fright. Gaining the skirts of the jungle which sur-
rounded the open space where Disco kept watch, he
crept cautiously as near to him as possible.
Disco still sat smoking and eyeing the elephant
with a smile of satisfaction. Presently he rose, -
retreated a few yards from the carcase, and stood
admiring it, with his head on one side, as if it were
a picture and he a connoisseur. He had in this act
approached somewhat nearer to Jumbo, who saluted
him with a most awful growl.
No monkey in Africa could have dropped its
pipe, had it been a smoker, or sprung to seize its
gun, had it been a sportsman, with greater agility
than did Disco Lillihammer on that trying occasion !
Getting on the other side of the dead elephant he
faced round, cocked both barrels, and prepared to
receive whatever might come. -
Jumbo, lying very low behind a bank of earth
for safety, gave another low growl. Disco started
and half raised his piece. Jumbo then threw a
large stone towards a neighbouring bush, which it
struck and caused to rustle.
This was enough for Disco, who took a quick aim
and let fly the contents of both barrels into the
bush.
Jumbo noiselessly but swiftly crept back into the
woods, chuckling as he went, leaving Disco to re-

load in wild haste. But his haste was uncalled for.
There was no more growling ; no more rustling in
the bushes.
"I've done for him," muttered Disco, after waiting
patiently at the "ready" for some time. "But it
won't do for me to ventur' up to it all by myself.
Praps it's a lion, an' they do say that it's chancy
work to go near a wounded lion. To be sure the
growl wasn't so loud as I'd have expected o' the
king o' the forest, but then they don't always growl
loud. Anyhow I'll keep a bright look-out, an' wait
till the niggers return."
Philosophizing thus the bold seaman mounted
guard over the elephant.
Meanwhile Jumbo, having got out of earshot of
his friend, indulged in a loud laugh and made after
his friends, but observing the visage of a small
yellow-coloured monkey among the leaves over-
head a thought flashed into his mind and induced
him to change his plans.
Throwing his spear dexterously he transfixed the
monkey and brought it down. Returning with
great caution to the bush into which Disco had fired,
and gliding with the noiseless motion of a snake the
latter part of the way, he placed the dead monkey
on the ground and left it there.
It was by that time too late to overtake his com-
rades. He therefore waited until they returned, and

then joined the party in rear, as though he had
followed them from the camp.
The same wild exhibition of delight was about
to be enacted when the party came trooping up, but
Disco quickly checked it by the astounding an-
nouncement that he thought he had shot a lion or
somethin' o' that sort !
" You don't mean it!" said Harold, rather excited.
"All I know is," said Disco, " that I heerd some-
thin' uncommon like a lion growl twice in yonder
bush, an' saw the bush move too, so I fired a broad-
side that seemed to finish him at once, for there was
no more rustlin' after that."
" An' no more growlin' ?" asked Jumbo, with
much simplicity of countenance.
"Not a grow], nor nothin' else," answered Disco.
"Well,get your guns ready, lads," said Harold, "and
stand by to fire while we go and search the bush."
So saying, Harold and Disco advanced together
with their rifles ready, while the natives, who were
more or less alarmed, according to their respective
degrees of courage, scattered in a semicircle well
in rear. Kambira, armed with a spear, kept close
to Harold, and Jumbo, with unwonted bravery,
walked alongside of Disco. Antonio, quietly retir-
ing, took refuge in a tree.
"Yoo's sure you hit um?" inquired Jumbo in a
whisper.


## p. 226 (#248) ############################################

226
BLACK IVORY.
"Can't say I'm sure," replied Disco, "but we'll
soon see."
"Was um's growl very bad ? " asked Jumbo.
"Hold yer long tongue !" said Disco testily, for
he was becoming excited.
"Look ! see dere !" exclaimed Jumbo in an
energetic whisper.
"What? where?"
"Look! right troo de bush. Dis way. Dar, don'
you zee um's skin,—tother side ? Fire !"
"Why, eh !" exclaimed Disco, peering keenly
through the leaves, "yellow hair ! yes—its—"
Stopping abruptly he pointed his gun at the bush
and poured the contents of both barrels into it.
Then clubbing his weapon and brandishing it in the
air he uttered a wild cry—went crashing through
the bush, and next moment stood aghast before the
yellow monkey, whose little carcase he had almost
blown to atoms.
We won't chronicle the roars of laughter, the yells
of delight that followed,—the immense amount of
chaffing, the innumerable witticisms and criticisms
that ensued.-no, no! regard for the gallant seaman
constrains us to draw a veil over the scene and leave
it, as we have left many things before, and shall
leave many things yet to come, to the reader's vivid
imagination.
· Fortunately for Disco, the superior attractions of

the dead elephant soon drew off attention from this
exploit. The natives proceeded to cut up the huge
spectacle. At first the men stood round the carcase
in dead silence, while Kambira delivered a species
of oration, in which he pointed out minutely the
particular parts of the animal which were to be
apportioned to the head-men of the different fires
of which the camp was composed,—the left hind-
leg and the parts around the eyes being allotted
to his English visitors. These points settled, the
order was given to "cut up," and immediately the
excitement which had been restrained burst forth
again with tenfold violence. The natives seemed
to be quite unable to restrain their feelings of de-
light as they cut away at the carcase with spears
and knives. They screamed as well as danced with
glee. Some attacked the head, others the flanks,
jumping over the animal or standing on it, the
better to expedite their operations; some ever and
anon ran off screaming with masses of bloody meat,
threw it on the grass and went back for more, while
others, after cutting the carcase open, jumped in-
side and wallowed about in their eagerness to reach
and cut out the precious fat-all talking and shout-
ing at the utmost pitch of their voices.
"Well, now," said Disco to Harold, with a grin
of amusement, " the likes o' that I never did see

nowheres. Cuttin' up a Greenland whale is nothin'
to it."
" Come, come," said Harold, checking his laughter
and seizing an excited negro by the shoulder, "no
fighting allowed."
This had reference to two who chanced to have
taken a fancy for the same mass of meat, and were
quarrelling so violently over it, that blows seemed
on the point of following, but having let off part of
their superabundant energy in words, they rushed
back to expend the remainder on their dead friend.
Suddenly a sharp agonized yell was heard inside
the carcase. Next moment Zombo jumped out, all
bloody and furious, holding up his right hand.
While groping about inside, one of his too eager
comrades outside had laid about rather incautiously
with his knife, drove it through the meat, and
sliced Zombo's left hand. He was easily soothed,
however ; Harold bound up the cut with a piece of
rag, and Zombo went to work as recklessly as ever.
In a marvellously short time tons of meat were
cut up and divided amongst the band, and before
daylight had quite disappeared the hunters were on
their way back to camp, while a troop of hyenas and
other carnivora were gorging themselves with the
elephant's remains.

CHAPTER XIII.
THE ENCAMPMENT AND THE SUPPER-DISCUSSIONS, POLITICAL AND
OTHERWISE-KAMBIRA RECEIVES A SHOCK, AND OUR WANDERERS
ARE THROWN INTO PERPLEXITY.
TURN we now to a more peaceful scene. The
camp is almost quiet, the stars are twinkling brightly
overhead, the fires are glimmering fitfully below.
The natives, having taken the edge off their appetites,
have stretched their dusky forms on their sleeping
mats, and laid their woolly heads on their little
wooden pillows. The only persons moving are
Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer—the first
being busy making notes in a small book, the second
being equally busy in manufacturing cloudlets from
his unfailing pipe, gazing the while with much
interest at his note-making companion.
"They was pretty vigorous wen they wos at it,
sir," said Disco, in reference to supper, observing
that his companion looked up from his book," but
they wos sooner done than I had expected."
"Yes, they weren't long about it," replied Harold,
with an abstracted air, as he resumed his writing.
Lest the reader should erroneously imagine that

supper is over, it is necessary here to explain what
taking the edge off a free African's appetite means.
On reaching camp after the cutting up of the
elephant, as detailed in the last chapter, the negroes
had set to work to roast and boil with a degree of
vigour that would have surprised even the chefs de
cuisine of the world's first-class hotels. Having
gorged themselves to an extent that civilized people
might perhaps have thought dangerous, they had
then commenced an uproarious dance, accompanied
by stentorian songs, which soon reduced them to the
condition of beings who needed repose. Proceeding
upon the principle of overcoming temptation by
giving way to it, they at once lay down and went to
sleep.
It was during this stage of the night's proceedings
that Disco foolishly imagined that supper had come
to a close. Not many minutes after the observation
was made, and before the black cutty-pipe was
smoked out, first one and then another of the
sleepers awoke, and, after a yawn or two, got up to
rouse the fires and put on the cooking-pots. In less
than a quarter of an hour the whole camp was astir,
conversation was rife, and the bubbling of pots that
had not got time to cool, and the hissing of roasts
whose fat had not yet hardened, mingled with songs
whose echoes were still floating in the brains of the
wild inhabitants of the surrounding jungle.


## p. 231 (#253) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
231
Roasting, boiling, and eating were recommenced with
as much energy as if the feast had only just begun.
Kambira, having roused himself, gave orders to
one of his men, who brought one of the elephant's
feet and set about the cooking of it at Harold's fire.
Kambira and Disco, with Antonio and Jumbo, sat
round the same fire.
There was a hole in the ground close beside them
which contained a small fire; the embers of this
were stirred up and replenished with fuel. When
the inside was thoroughly heated, the elephant's foot
was placed in it and covered over with hot ashes
and soil, and another fire kindled above the whole.
Harold, who regarded this proceeding with some
surprise, said to Kambira—through Antonio—"Who
are you cooking that for ?"
"For my white guests," replied the chief.
"But we have supped already," said Harold; " we
have already eaten as much as we can hold of the
elephant's trunk and tongue, both of which were
excellent—why prepare more ?"
"This is not for to-night, but for to-morrow,"
returned Kambira, with a smile. "The foot takes
all night to cook."
This was a sufficient explanation, and in truth
the nature of the dish required that it should be well
done. When, on the morrow, they were called to
partake of it, they found that it was, according to

Disco's estimation, " fust-rate !" It was a whitish
mass, slightly gelatinous and sweet, like marrow,
and very palatable. Nevertheless, they learned from
experience that if the effect of bile were to be
avoided, a long march was necessary after a meal of
elephant's foot !
Meanwhile the proceedings of the natives were
food enough for our travellers for the time being.
Like human creatures elsewhere, they displayed
great variety of taste. Some preferred boiled meat,
others roast; a few indulged in porridge made of
mapira meal. The meal was very good, but the
porridge was doubtful, owing to the cookery. It
would appear that in Africa, as in England, woman
excels in the culinary art. At all events, the mapira
meal was better managed by them than by the men.
On the present occasion the hunters tumbled in the
meal by handfuls in rapid succession as soon as the
water was hot, until it became too thick to be stirred
about, then it was lifted off the fire, and one man
held the pot while another plied the porridge-stick
with all his might to prevent the solid mass from
being burnt. Thus it was prepared and thus eaten
in enormous quantities. No wonder that dancing
and profuse perspiration were esteemed a necessary
adjunct to feeding !
At the close of the second edition of supper, which
went into four or five editions before morning, some

233
of the men at the fire next to that of Kambira en-
gaged in a debate so furious, that the curiosity of
Disco and Harold was excited, and they caused
Antonio to translate much of what was said. It is
not possible to give a connected account of this de-
bate as translated by Antonio. To overcome the
difficulty we shall give the substance of it in what
Disco styled Antonio's " lingo."
There were about a dozen natives round the fire,
but two of them sustained the chief part in the
debate. One of these was a large man with a flat
nose; the other was a small man with a large frizzy
head.
"Hold 'oos tongue," said Flatnose (so Antonio
named him); " tongue too long-far!"
" Boh! 'oos brains too short," retorted Frizzy-
head contemptuously.
An immense amount of chattering by the others
followed these pithy remarks of the principals.
The question in debate was, Whether the two
toes of the ostrich represented the thumb and fore-
finger in man, or the little and ring fingers ? But in
a few minutes the subject changed gradually, and
somehow unaccountably, to questions of a political
nature,-for, strange to say, in savage Africa, as in
civilized England, politics are keenly discussed,
doubtless at times with equal wisdom in the one
land as in the other.


## p. 234 (#256) ############################################

234
BLACK IVORY.
" What dat 'oo say ?" inquired Flatnose, on hear-
ing some muttered remarks of Frizzyhead in refer-
ence to the misgovernment of chiefs. Of course
there, as here, present company was understood to
be excepted.
" Chiefs ob no use—no use at all!" said Frizzy-
head so vehemently that the men at several of the
nearest fires ceased to talk, and began to listen.
" Ob no use ?" cried Flatnose, with vehemence so
superior that the attention of the whole camp was
arrested.
"No!" replied Frizzyhead, still more energetically,
" ob no use at all. We could govern ourselves
betterer, so what de use of 'um ? The chief 'ums
fat an' hab plenty wife, but we, who do all de hard
work, hab hunger, an' only one wife, prehaps none
at all. Dis is bad, unjust, wrong."
There was a general shout of "eehee !" from all
quarters, which was equivalent to our " hear,
hear."
" 'Oo know noting at all," retorted Flatnose, who
was a loyal subject. "Is not de chief de fader of de
peepil? Can dere be peepil widout a fader-eh?
God made de chief—who says dat chief is not wise?
He is wise, but um's child'n am big fools !"
Kambira nodded his head and smiled at this, and
there was a general inclination on the part of most
of the audience to applaud, for there, as elsewhere,

235
men have a tendency to be blown about by every
wind of doctrine.
It was amusing to observe the earnestness and
freedom with which men of the lowest grade as-
saulted the opinions of their betters on this occasion.
Unable at other times, or in any other way, to bring
themselves into importance, they were glad of the
opportunity to do so with their tongues, and, like
their civilized types, they assumed an air of mock
modesty.
" Oh !" cried one of these, in reply to Flatnose,
"we is littil infants; we is still holdin' on to de
boosums ob our moders; we not able to walk alone;
we knows notin' at all; but on dis point, we knows
that you old men speak like de ignorint peepil.
We nebber hear such nonsense-nebber !"
No notice was taken of this, but Frizzyhead,
whose passion was rising to white heat in conse-
quence of the glibness of his opponent's tongue,
cried out-
" 'Oo cannot prove wat 'ou says ?".
"Oh yes, can prove it well 'nuff," replied Flat-
nose," but 'oos no' got brain for onerstand."
This last was too much for poor Frizzyhead, who
leaped up, stuttered, and cried-
" Can 'oo outrun me, then ?"
"Ye-ye-yes !" gasped Flatnose, springing up.
Away they went like two hunted springboks, and

.
ran for a mile, then turned and came back into
camp streaming with perspiration, little Frizzyhead
far ahead of the big man, and rejoicing in the fact
that he could beat his opponent in a race, if not in
an argument. Thus was peace restored. Pity that
civilized arguments cannot be terminated in the
same way!
While these discussions were going on, Disco
observed that hyenas were occasionally to be seen
prowling near the verge of the bushes around them,
as if anxious to join in the feast, which no doubt
was the case.
" Don't they do mischief sometimes ?" he inquired
of Antonio.
"No; him a cowardly beast. Him come at mans
when sleepin' or dyin', but not at oder time. 'Oo
like see me catch um ?"
"Why, yes, if 'ee can do it," answered Disco, with
a slight look of contempt at his friend, who bore too
much resemblance in some points to the hyena.
" Come here, den."
They went together into the jungle a little dis-
tance, and halted under the branch of a large tree.
To this Antonio suspended a lump of raw flesh, at
such a height from the ground that a hyena could
only reach it by leaping Directly underneath it
he planted a short spear in the earth with its point
upward.


## p. 237 (#259) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
237
"Now, come back to fire," he said to Disco; "'ou
soon hear sometin'."
Antonio was right. In a short time afterwards a
sharp yell was heard, and, on running to the trap,
they found a hyena in its death-agonies. It had
leaped at the meat, missed it, and had come down
on the spear and impaled itself.
"Well, of all the fellers I ever know'd for dodges,"
said Disco, on reseating himself at the fire, " the
men in these latitudes are the cleverest."
By this time dancing was going on furiously;
therefore, as it would have been impossible to sleep,
Disco refilled his pipe and amused himself by con-
templating the intelligent countenance of Kambira,
who sat smoking bang out of a huge native meer-
schaum on the other side of the fire.
" I wonder," said Harold, who lay stretched on a
sleeping-mat, leaning on his right arm and gazing
contemplatively at the glowing heart of the fire;
" I wonder what has become of Yoosoof ?"
" Was 'ee thinkin' that he deserved to be shoved
in there?" asked Disco, pointing to the fire.
"Not exactly," replied Harold, laughing ; "but
I have frequently thought of the scoundrel, and
wondered where he is and what doing now. I have
sometimes thought, too, about that girl Azinté, poor
thing. She—"
He paused abruptly and gazed at Kambira with

great surprise, not unmixed with alarm, for the chief
had suddenly dropped his pipe and glared at him in
a manner that cannot be described. Disco observed
the change also, and was about to speak, when
Kambira sprang over the fire and seized Harold by
the arm.
There was something in the movement, however,
which forbade the idea of an attack, therefore he lay
still.
"What now, Kambira ?" he said.
" Antonio, cried the chief, in a voice that brought
the interpreter to his side in a twinkling ; "what
name did the white man speak just now ?".
"Azinté," said Harold, rising to a sitting posture.
Kambira sat down, drew up his knees to his chin,
and clasped his hands round them.
"Tell me all you know about Azinté," he said in
a low, firm voice.
It was evident that the chief was endeavouring
to restrain some powerful feeling, for his face, black
though it was, indicated a distinct degree of pallor,
and his lips were firmly compressed together.
Harold therefore, much surprised as well as
interested, related the little he knew about the poor
girl,—his meeting with her in Yoosoof's hut; Disco's
kindness to her, and her subsequent departure with
the Arab.
Kambira sat motionless until he had finished.

"Do you know where she is gone ?" he inquired.
"No. I know not; but she was not in the boat
with the other slaves when we sailed, from which I
think it likely that she remained upon the coast.
-But why do you ask, Kambira, why are you so
anxious about her ?"
"She is my wife," muttered the chief between his
teeth ; and as he said so a frown that was absolutely
diabolical settled down on his features.
For some minutes there was a dead silence, for
both Harold and Disco felt intuitively that to offer
consolation or hope were out of the question.
Presently Kambira raised his head, and a smile
chased the frown away as he said,
"You have been kind to Azinté, will you be kind
to her husband ?"
"We should be indeed unworthy the name of
Englishmen if we said no to that," replied Harold,
glancing at Disco, who nodded approval.
"Good. Will you take me with you to the
shores of the great salt lake ?" said Kambira, in a
low, pathetic tone," will you inake me your servant,
your slave ?"
"Most gladly will I take you with me as a friend,".
returned Harold. "I need not ask why you wish to
go," he added,—"you go to seek Azinté ?"
"Yes," cried the chief, springing up wildly and
drawing himself up to his full height, "I go to seek

Azinté. Ho! up men! up! Ye have feasted
enough and slept enough for one night. Who knows
but the slavers may be at our huts while we lie idly
here? Up! Let us go !"
The ringing tones acted like a magic spell.
Savage camps are soon pitched and sooner raised. In
a few minutes the obedient hunters had bundled up
all their possessions, and in less than a quarter of
an hour the whole band was tracking its way by
moonlight through the pathless jungle.
The pace at which they travelled home was much
more rapid than that at which they had set out on
their expedition. Somehow, the vigorous tones in
which Kambira had given command to break up
the camp, coupled with his words, roused the idea
that he must have received information of danger
threatening the village, and some of the more anxious
husbands and fathers, unable to restrain themselves,
left the party altogether and ran back the whole way.
To their great relief, however, they found on arriving
that all was quiet. The women were singing and
at work in the fields, the children shouting at play,
and the men at their wonted occupation of weaving
cotton cloth or making nets and bows under the
banyan-trees.
Perplexity is not a pleasant condition of existence,
nevertheless, to perplexity mankind is more or less
doomed in every period of life and in every mundane

scene-particularly in the jungles of central Africa,
as Harold and his friends found out many a time to
their cost.
On arriving at the native village, the chief point
that perplexed our hero there was as to whether he
should return to the coast at once, or push on further
into the interior. On the one hand he wished very
much to see more of the land and its inhabitants ;
on the other hand, Kambira was painfully anxious
to proceed at once to the coast in search of his lost
wife, and pressed him to set off without delay.
The chief was rather an exception in regard to his
feelings on this point. Most other African potentates
had several wives, and in the event of losing one of
them might have found consolation in the others.
But Kambira had never apparently thought of taking
another wife after the loss of Azinté, and the only
comfort he had was in his little boy, who bore a
strong resemblance, in some points, to the mother.
But although Harold felt strong sympathy with
the man, and would have gone a long way out of his
course to aid him, he could not avoid perceiving
that the case was almost, if not altogether, a hopeless
one. He had no idea to what part of the coast
Azinté had been taken. For all he knew to the
contrary, she might have been long ago shipped off
to the northern markets, and probably was, even
while he talked of her, the inmate of an Arab harem,

or at all events a piece of goods—a "chattel"-in
the absolute possession of an irresponsible master.
Besides the improbability of Kambira ever hearing
what had become of his wife, or to what part of the
earth she had been transported, there was also the
difficulty of devising any definite course of action for
the chief himself, because the instant he should
venture to leave the protection of the Englishmen
he would be certain to fall into the hands of Arabs
or Portuguese, and become enslaved.
Much of this Harold had not the heart to explain
to him. He dwelt, however, pretty strongly on the
latter contingency, though without producing much
effect. Death, the chief replied, he did not fear,
and slavery could easily be exchanged for death.
"Alas! not so easily as you think," said Harold,
" they will try every kind of torture before they kill
you."
Chimbolo nodded his head, assenting, and ground
his teeth together fiercely when this was said.
Still Kambira was unmoved; he did not care
what they did to him. Azinté was as life to him,
and to search for her he would go in spite of every
consideration.
Harold prevailed on him, however, to agree to
wait until he should have spent another month in
visiting Chimbolo's tribe, after which he promised

ras
faithfully to return and take him along with his
party to the coast.
Neither Harold nor Disco was quite at ease in
his mind after making this arrangement, but they
both agreed that no other course could be pursued,
the former saying with a sigh that there was no
help for it, and the latter asserting with a grunt
that the thing "wos unawoidable."
On the following day the journey of exploration
was resumed. Kambira accompanied his friends a
few miles on the road, and then bade them farewell.
On the summit of an elevated ridge the party halted
and looked back. Kambira's manly form could be
seen leaning on his spear. Behind him the little
village lay embosomed in luxuriant verdure, and
glowing in the bright sunshine, while songs and
sounds of industry floated towards them like a
sweet melody. It was with a feeling of keen regret
that the travellers turned away, after waving their
hands in reply to a parting salute from the stalwart ;
chief, and, descending to the plain, pushed forward
into the unknown wilderness beyond.

CAMPING, TRAVELLING, SHOOTING, DREAMING, POETIZING, PHILOSO-
PHIZING, AND SURPRISING IN EQUATORIAL AFRICA.
At sunset the travellers halted in a peculiarly wild
spot, and encamped under the shelter of a gigantic
baobab-tree.
Two rousing fires were quickly kindled, round
which the natives busied themselves in preparing
supper, while their leaders sat down, the one to
write up his journal, the other to smoke his pipe.
" Well, sir," said Disco, after a few puffs delivered
with extreme satisfaction, "you do seem for to enjoy
writin'. You go at that log of yours every night as
if it wos yer last will and testament, that ye couldn't
die happy without exikootin' an' signin' it with yer
blood."
"A better occupation, isn't it," replied Harold,
with a sly glance," than to make a chimney-pot of
my mouth ?"
"Come, sir," returned Disco, with a deprecatory
smile," don't be too hard on a poor feller's pipe. If
you can't enjoy it, that's no argiment against it."

"How d'you know I can't enjoy it ?".
"Why? cos I s'pose you'd take to it if you did."
"Did you enjoy it when you first began ?" asked
Harold.
"Well, I can't 'zactly say as I did."
"Well, then, if you didn't, that proves that it is
not natural to smoke, and why should I acquire an
unnatural and useless habit ?"
"Useless ! why, sir, on'y think of wot you loses
by not smokin'—wot a deal of enjoyment !"
"Well, I am thinking," replied Harold, affecting
a look of profound thoughtfulness, "but I can't
quite make it out-enjoyment ? let me see. Do I
not enjoy as good health as you do ?"
"O, cer'nly, sir, cer'nly. You're quite up to the
mark in that respect."
"Well then, I enjoy my food as well, and can
eat as much, can't I ?"
"No doubt of it," replied Disco, with a grin; "I
was used to be considered raither a dab at wittles,
but I must say I knocks under to you, sir."
"Very good," rejoined Harold, laughing; "then as
to sleep, I enjoy sleep quite as soundly as yourself,
don't I ?"
"I can't say as to that," replied Disco. "You
see, sir, as I never opens my eyes arter shuttin' of
'em till the bo's'n pipes all hands ahoy, I've no
means of knowin' wot you accomplish in that way."


## p. 246 (#268) ############################################

« On the whole, then, it seems that I enjoy every-
thing as much as you do, and—"
"No, not everything ; you don't enjoy baccy, you
know.—But please, sir, don't go for to moralize ; I
can't stand it. You 'll spile my pipe if ye do !" .
"Well, I shall spare you," said Harold, "all the
more that I perceive supper is about—"
At that moment Antonio, who had gone down to
a streamlet which trickled close at hand, gave utter-
ance to a hideous yell, and came rushing into camp
with a face that was pea-green from terror.
" Ach !" he gasped, "a lion ! queek ! your guns !"
Every one leaped up and seized his weapon with
marvellous alacrity on receiving an alarm so violent
and unlooked-for.
"Where away?" inquired Disco, blazing with
excitement, and ready at a moment's notice to rush
into the jungle and fire both barrels at whatever
should present itself.
"No, no, don' go," cried Antonio in alarm; "be
cautionous."
The interpreter's caution was enforced by Chim-
bolo, who laid his hand on Disco's arm and looked
at him with such solemnity that he felt it necessary
to restrain his ardour.
Meanwhile Antonio with trembling steps led
Harold to a point in the thicket whence he beheld
two bright phosphoric-looking objects which his

247
companion said were the lion's eyes, adding that
lion's eyes always shone in that way.
Harold threw forward his rifle with the inten-
tion of taking aim, but lowered it quickly, for he
felt convinced that no lion could possibly have eyes
so wide apart, unless its head were as large as that
of an elephant.
"Nonsense, Antonio !" he said, laughing; "that
cannot be a lion."
"Ho, yis, him's a lion, for sure," Antonio returned,
positively.
"We shall see."
Harold raised his rifle and fired, while Antonio
turned and fled, fully expecting the wounded beast to
spring. Harold himself half looked for some such act,
and shrank behind a bush by way of precaution, but
when the smoke cleared away, he saw that the two
glowing eyes were gazing at him as fixedly as ever.
" Pooh !" exclaimed Disco, brushing past ; "I
knows wot it is. Many a time I've seed 'em in the
West Injies."
Saying which, he went straight up to the sup-
posed lion, picked up a couple of glow-worms and
brought them to the camp-fires, much to the amuse-
ment of the men, especially of Jumbo, and greatly
to the confusion of the valorous interpreter, who,
according to his invariable custom when danger
threatened, was found to have sought refuge in a tree.


## p. 248 (#270) ############################################

This incident furnished ground for much discus-
sion and merriment during supper, in which An-
tonio, being in no wise ashamed of himself, joined
noisily; and Chimbolo took occasion to reprove
Disco for his rashness, telling him that it was im-
possible to kill lions in the jungle during the dark-
ness of night, and that if they did pay them a visit
it would be wise to let them be, and trust to the
camp-fires keeping them at a respectful distance.
To which Disco retorted that he didn't believe there
was any lions in Afriky, for he'd heard a deal about
'em an' travelled far, but had not yet heard the
sound of their woices, an', wot was more, didn't ex-
pect to.
Before that night was far advanced, Disco was
constrained to acknowledge himself in error, for a
veritable lion did actually prowl down to the camp
and salute them with a roar which had a wonder-
fully awe-inspiring effect on every member of the
party, especially on those who heard it for the first
time in their lives.
Just before the arrival of this nocturnal visitor,
one of the men had been engaged in some poetic
effusions, which claim preliminary notice here, be-
cause they were rudely terminated by the lion.
This man was one of Kambira's people, and had
joined the party by permission. He was one of
those beings who, gifted with something like genius,

249
or with superior powers of some sort, have sprung
up in Africa, as elsewhere, no doubt from time im-
memorial, to dazzle their fellows for a little, and
then pass away, leaving a trail of tradition behind
them. The existence there in time past of men of
mind far in advance of their fellows, as well as of
heroes whose physical powers were marvellous, may
be assumed from the fact that some such exist at
the present time, as well as from tradition. Some
of these heroes have excited the admiration of large
districts by their wisdom, others by their courage or
their superior dexterity with the spear and bow,
like William Tell and Robin Hood, but the memory
of these must soon have been obliterated for want
of literature. The man who had joined Harold was
a poet and a musician. He was an improvvisatore,
composed verses on the incidents that occurred as
they travelled along, and sang them with an accom-
paniment on an instrument called the sansa, which
had nine iron keys and a calabash for a sounding-
board.
The poet's name was Mokompa. With the free
and easy disposition of his race, he allowed his fancy
to play round the facts of which he sang, and was
never at a loss, for, if the right word did not come
readily, he spun out the measure with musical sounds
which meant nothing at all.
After supper was over, or rather when the first

interval of repose occurred, Mokompa, who was an
obliging and hearty little fellow, was called on for a
song. Nothing loath, he seized his sansa and began
a ditty, of which the following, given by Antonio,
may be regarded as a remarkably free, not to say
easy, translation :-
MOKOMPA'S SONG.
Kambira goes to hunt,
Yo ho !
Him's spear am nebber blunt,
Yo ho!
Him kill de buff'lo quick,
An' lub de porridge thick;
Him chase de lion too,
An' stick um troo an' troo.

Nor put us in our graves,
But set de black mans free,

Yo ho!

De drefful lion roar,
De gun goes crack once more,
De bullet fiy an' splits
Yo ho!
De glow-worm next arise,
De Englishman likewise
Wid werry much surprise,
An' hit um 'tween de eyes,
" Hooray! hooray !" um cries,
An' run to fetch um's prize-
Yo ho !
The last " Yo ho !" was given with tremendous
energy, and followed by peals of laughter.
It was at this point that the veritable lion thought
proper to join in, which he did, as we have said,
with a roar so tremendous that it not only put a
sudden stop to the music, but filled the party with
so much alarm that they sprang to their arms with
surprising agility. .
Mindful of Chimbolo's previous warning, neither
Harold nor Disco sought to advance, but both looked
at their savage friend for advice.
Now, in some parts of Africa there exists a popu-
lar belief that the souls of departed chiefs enter into
lions and render them sacred, and several members
of Harold Seadrift's party entertained this notion,
Chimbolo was one of these. From the sounds of
growling and rending which issued from the thicket,
he knew that the lion in question was devouring
part of their buffalo-meat, which had been hung on

252

the branch of a neighbouring tree, not, however,
near enough to the fires to be visible. Believing
that the beast was a chief in disguise, Chimbolo
advanced a little towards the place where he was,
and, much to our traveller's amusement, gave him a
good scolding.
" You call yourself a chief, do you-eh ?" he said
sternly. "What kind of a chief can you be, to come
sneaking about in the dark like this, trying to steal
our buffalo-meat! Are you not ashamed of yourself?
A pretty chief, truly; you are like the scavenger-
beetle, and think of yourself only; you have not the
heart of a chief. Why don't you kill your own beef ?
You must have a stone in your chest, and no heart
at all."
" That's werry flowery lingo, but it don't seem to
convince him," said Disco, with a quiet smile, as the
lion, which had been growling continuously over its
meal all the time, wound up Chimbolo's speech with
another terrific roar.
At this point another believer in transmigration
of souls, a quiet man who seldom volunteered
remarks on any subject, stepped forward and began
seriously to expostulate with the lion.
"It is very wrong of you," he said, "to treat
strangers in this fashion. You might have more re-
spect for Englishmen who have come to see your
land, and never did you any harm. We are travel-

253
ling peaceably through the country; we never kill
anybody, and never steal anything; the buffalo-meat
is ours, not yours, and it ill becomes a great chief like
you to be prowling about in the dark, like a hyena,
trying to steal the meat of strangers. Surely you
can hunt for yourself—there is plenty of meat in the
forest."
As the lion was equally deaf to this man's
reasoning, Harold thought it right to try a more
persuasive plan. He drew up in a line all the men
who had guns, and at a word of command they fired
a volley of balls into the jungle, in the direction
whence the sounds issued. A dead silence followed,
but it was deemed advisable not to venture in to see
the effect, as men had frequently lost their lives by
so doing. A watch, however, was kept during the
night, and the fires were well replenished, for they
knew that the king of the forest usually shrinks
from doing his evil deeds in the light of a strong
camp-fire. We say usually—because they are not
always thus shy. Authentic instances are on record
of lions having leaped into the centre of a bivouac
and carried off one of the men in spite of being
smitten in the face with flaming firebrands.
Fortunately the lion of which we write thought
"discretion the better part of valour." He retired
peaceably, nevertheless Disco and his friend con-
1 See Livingstone's Zambesi and its Tributaries, p. 160.

tinued to dream of him all night so vividly that they
started up several times and seized their rifles, under
the impression that he had roared his loudest into
their very ears, and after each of these occasions
they crept back into their sleeping bags to re-dream
of the lion!
The "bag" which formed each man's couch was
made simply of two mats sewed together, and left
open, not at one of the ends but at one of the sides,
so that a man could roll out of or into it more easily
than he could have slid, feet first, into a sack. It
was large enough also for two to sleep inside together,
always supposing that the two were of accom-
modating dispositions !
That they had now reached a land which swarmed
with wild animals was intimated to some extent by
the running past, within fifty yards of their bivouac, of
a troop of elephants. It was day break at the time, so
that, having been thus rudely aroused, they did not
deem it necessary to return to rest, but, after taking
a hasty mouthful of food, set forth on their journey.
The usual mode of proceeding on the march was
as follows :—They rose about five o'clock, or soon
after the appearance of dawn, and swallowed a cup
of tea, with a bit of biscuit, then some of the men
folded up the blankets and stowed them away in the
bags, others tied up the cooking utensils, etc., in
bundles, and hung them at the ends of carrying-

255
sticks, which they bore upon their shoulders. The
process did not take long. They were soon on the
march, either in single file, if the path were narrow,
or in groups, according to fancy, where the ground
admitted of their spreading out. About nine, a
convenient spot was chosen for a halt to breakfast,
which meal, although not " eaten the night before in
order to save time in the morning," was at all events
cooked on the previous evening for the same end, so
that it only needed warming up. Then the march
was resumed; a short rest was allowed in the heat
of the day, when, of course, Disco had a pipe and
much sagacious intercourse with his fellows, and
they finally encamped for the remainder of the day
and night early in the afternoon. Thus they travelled
five or six hours at a stretch, and averaged from twelve
to fifteen miles a day, which is about as much as
Europeans can stand in a hot climate without being
oppressed. This Disco called "taking it easy," and
so it was when compared with the custom of some
travellers, whose chief end would appear to be the
getting over as much ground as possible in a given
time, in order that they may afterwards boast of the
same, and for the accomplishment of which they are
obliged to abuse and look ferocious at the blacks,
cock their pistols, and flourish their whips, in a
manner which is only worthy of being styled con-
temptible and cowardly. We need not say that our

friends Harold and Disco had no such propensities.
They had kindly consideration for the feelings of
their "niggers," coupled with great firmness; became
very sociable with them, and thus got hearty, willing
work out of them. But to return from this digression.
During the day, the number of animals of all sorts
that were seen was so great as to induce Disco to
protest, with a slap of his thigh, that the whole
land, from stem to stern, seemed to him to be one
prodigious zoological garden-it did, an' no mistake
about it.
Disco was not far wrong. He and Harold having
started ahead of the party, with Chimbolo as their
guide, came on a wonderful variety of creatures in
rapid succession. First, they fell in with some large
flocks of guinea-fowl, and shot a few for dinner. As
they advanced, various birds ran across their path,
and clouds of turtle doves filled the air with the
blatter of their wings as they rose above the trees.
Ducks, geese, and francolins helped to swell the
chorus of sounds.
When the sun rose and sent a flood of light over
a wide and richly wooded vale, into which they
were about to descend, a herd of pallahs stood gazing
at the travellers in stupid surprise, and allowed
them to approach within sixty yards before trot-
ting leisurely away. These and all other animals
were passed unmolested, as the party had sufficient

257
meat at the time, and Harold made it a point not to
permit his followers to shoot animals for the mere
sake of sport, though several of them were uncom-
monly anxious to do so. Soon afterwards a herd of
waterbucks were passed, and then a herd of koodoos
with two or three magnificently-horned bucks
amongst them, which hurried off to the hillsides on
seeing the travellers. Antelopes also were seen,
and buffaloes, grazing beside their path.
Ere long they came upon a small pond with a
couple of elephants standing on its brink, cooling
their huge sides by drawing water into their trunks
and throwing it all over themselves. Behind these
were several herds of zebras and waterbucks, all of
which took to flight on "getting the wind" of man.
They seemed intuitively to know that he was an
enemy. Wild pigs, also, were common, and troops of
monkeys, large and small, barked, chattered, grinned,
and made faces among the trees.
After pitching the camp each afternoon, and having
had a mouthful of biscuit, the two Englishmen were
in the habit of going off to hunt for the daily supply
of fresh meat, accompanied by Chimbolo as their
guide and game-carrier, Antonio as their interpreter,
and Mokompa as their poet and jester. They did
not, indeed, appoint Mokompa to that post of honour,
but the little worthy took it upon himself for the
express purpose of noting the deeds of the white

men in order to throw his black comrades into con-
vulsions over supper by a poetic recital of the same.
"It pleases them, an' it don't hurt us," was Disco's
observation on this head.
On the afternoon, then, of which we write, the
party of four went out to hunt while the encamp-
ment was being prepared under the superintendence
of Jumbo, who had already proved himself to be an
able manager and cook, as also had his countrymen
Masiko and Zombo.
"What a rich country !" exclaimed Harold, look-
ing round in admiration from the top of a small
hillock on as fine a scene as one could wish to
behold, "and what a splendid cotton country it
might be if properly cultivated !"
"So it is," said Disco, "an' I shouldn't wonder if
there wos lots of gold too, if we only knew where to
look for it."
"Gold !" exclaimed Antonio, who sat winking
placidly on the stump of a fallen tree; " dere be lots
ob gold near Zambesi—an' oder ting too."
"Let's hear wot are some of the other things,"
said Disco.
"What are dere ?-oh, let me see : der be coal, lots
ob coal on Zambesi, any amount ob it, an' it burn
fuss-rate, too. Dere be iron-ore, very much, an'
indigo, an' sugar-cane, an' ivory; you hab hear an'

tobacco. Oh! great plenty ob eberyting eberywhere
in dis yere country, but," said Antonio, with a shrug
of his shoulders, "no can make noting out ob it on
account ob de slave-trade."
" Then I 'spose 'ee don't approve of the slave-
trade ?" said Disco.
"No, dat am true," replied Antonio; " de country
very good for slave-trader, but no good for man like
me what want to trade proper."
"H'm! I've more respect for 'ee than I had," said
Disco. "I'spose you've bin up in these parts be-
fore now, have 'ee?"
" No, nevair, but I hab sister what marry one
nigger, one slave, what sold himself, an' him tell me
much 'bout it. Hims bin up here many time.".
" Sold himself !" repeated Harold in surprise.
" What do you mean ?"
" Mean dat," returned Antonio. " Him was a
black free-man-call him Chibanti; him was all
alone in de world, lose fader, moder, broder, sister,
wife, eberyting by slave-trader, who steal dem all
away or murder dem. So Chibanti him say, 'What
de use of be free ?' So him go to one master, who
berry good to hims niggers-gib dem plenty to eat
an' little to do—an' sole hisself to him."
" An' wot did he get for himself ?" asked Disco.

"Did he consider himself cheap or dear at that ?"
inquired Disco.
"Oh, dear-awful dear!"
"What has come of him now ?" asked Harold.
"Dunno," answered Antonio. "After him got de
cloth, hims master send him to Quillimane wid
cargo ob ivory, an' gib him leave to do leetil trade
on hims own account; so him bought a man, a
woman, an'a boy, for sixty yard ob cottin, an' wid
de rest hired slaves for de voyage down, an' drove a
mos' won'erful trade. But long time since me hear
ob him. Praps hims good master be dead, an' him
go wid de rest of de goods an' chattels to a bad
master, who berry soon make him sorry him sole
hisself."
Pushing forward for several days in the manner
which we have attempted to describe, our travellers
passed through many varied scenes, which, however,
all bore one mark in common, namely, teeming ani-
found to be exceedingly numerous, but not so uni-
versally distributed as the others, for, although many
villages and hamlets were passed, the inhabitants of
which were all peacefully inclined and busy in their
fields, or with their native cotton, iron, and pottery
manufactures, vast expanses of rich ground were
also traversed, which, as far as man was concerned,
appeared to be absolute solitudes.

Entering upon one of these about noon of a re-
markably fine day, Harold could not help remarking
on the strange stillness which pervaded the air.
No sound was heard from beast, bird, or insect; no
village was near, no rippling stream murmured, or
zephyr stirred the leaves; in short, it was a scene
which, from its solitude and profound silence, be-
came oppressive.
"W'y, sir," said Disco, whose face was bathed in
perspiration, "it do seem to me as if we'd got to the
fag-end of the world altogether. There ain't nothin'
nowhere."
Harold laughed, and said it looked like it. But
Disco was wrong. It was only the hour when ani-
mals seem to find a siesta indispensable, and vege-
tables as well as air had followed their example. A
few minutes sufficed to prove their mistake, for, on
entering a piece of woodland, a herd of pallahs, and
another of water-bucks, appeared, standing as quiet
and still as if they were part of a painted landscape.
Then, in passing a thick clump of thorns, they could
see, through openings in the bushes, the dim phan-
tom-like forms of buffaloes, with heads lowered and
eyes glaring at them, ready to charge, if need be,
though too lazy from heat, apparently, to begin the
fray, and willing to act on the principle of " let be
for let be." Still farther on, a native was observed
keeping at a respectful distance. He had seen the

travellers from afar, and had come with noiseless
tread to get a nearer view.
Halting to rest the party for a few minutes in a
shady hollow, Harold threw himself at full length
on the grass, but Disco, who, strange to say, did not
feel inclined to smoke at the moment probably
because he had only just finished his fifth pipe a few
minutes previously-sauntered on alone to the top
of the next ridge.
He had barely reached the summit when Harold,
who chanced to be looking after him, observed that
he crouched suddenly behind a bush, and, after
gazing steadfastly for a few seconds over the hill,
turned and ran back, making excessively wild de-
monstrations with head and arms, but uttering no
sound.
Of course the whole party sprang up and ran
towards the excited mariner, and soon were near
enough to understand that his violent actions were
meant to caution them to make no noise.
"Hush !" he said eagerly, on coming near enough
to be heard ; " keep quiet as mice. There's a slave-
gang, or somethin' uncommon like it, goin' along on
right athwart us."
Without a word of reply, the whole party hurried
forward and gained a point of observation behind
the low bushes which crowned the ridge.

CHAPTER XV.
SHOWS SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF THE SLAVE-TRADE AT THE
FOUNTAIN-HEAD.
Down in a gorge, just below the spot where
Harold Seadrift and his men lay concealed, a strange
sight met the eyes of the two Englishmen, in regard
to which, despite all that they had heard and seen,
and were prepared to see, they were as much
shocked as if it had never been presented even to
their imaginations up to that moment.
It was a gang of slaves winding its way slowly
but steadily through the gorge.
The head of the dusky procession was just
emerging on the open ground beyond the gorge
when the travellers first came upon it. The slaves
advanced towards the spot where they lay, passing
under it so closely that they could see the very
expressions on the faces of the men, women, and
children who composed the gang. These expres-
sions were varied and very terrible. Our travellers
had now reached the fountain-head whence the
perennial stream of " Black Ivory" flows out of

Africa. The process of manufacture, although con-
siderably advanced, had not yet reached that perfec-
tion of callous subjection and settled despair which
had struck our Englishmen so forcibly in the slave-
market of Zanzibar. There was anxiety not an-
mingled with faint hope in the faces of some of the
women; and a few of the more stalwart and cour-
ageous among the men wore a fierce, determined
aspect, which told of manhood not yet absolutely
prostrated in the dust of abject servility, while, in
regard to some of the children, surprise at the
peculiar circumstances of their surroundings had
not yet been swallowed up in a condition of chronic
terror.
They marched in a long line, fastened to each
other by chains and ropes and heavy "gorees" or
slave-sticks. The latter implements were poles
from six to seven feet long, with a fork at the
end of each, in which the necks of the men were
fitted and secured by means of an iron bolt passing
across the throat, and riveted at both ends. To
render marching possible with such encumbrances,
the men went in couples, one behind the other, so
that the slave-stick of the leading man could be
tied to the stick of his fellow behind, which was
slewed round to the front for the purpose. Their
wrists were also tied, some in front, others behind
their backs. Secured thus, Hercules himself might

have been reduced to obedience, especially if he
had felt the frequent sting of the cruel lash that
was laid on these captives, a lash whose power was
made manifest by the numerous seams and scars
which crossed and recrossed their backs and limbs.
The women and children were deemed sufficiently
secure by being fastened to each other with ropes
and iron rings round their necks. All were naked,
with the exception of a little piece of cloth round
the loins, and some of the women had infants of a
few weeks old strapped to their backs by means of
this shred of cloth, while others carried baskets on
their heads containing meal for the sustenance of
the party during their journey.
In advance of the line marched a tall, powerfully-
built half-caste, armed with a musket and small
axe, and clad in a loose coat, short drawers reaching
the knees, and straw hat. He was obviously the
commander of the band. Behind him came several
negroes, also armed with muskets, and with thick
wands for the purpose of flagellation. These wore
loin-cloths and turbans or red caps, but nothing
more. They laughed, talked and strutted as they
went along, forming a marked contrast to the silent
and depressed slaves.
At intervals along the line, and in rear, there
were stationed one or two of these drivers, who
urged on their " cattle" with more or less

cruelty according to their individual impulses or
natures.
We need scarcely say that this sight filled Harold
and Disco not only with feelings of horror and
pity, but with sensations of towering indignation
that almost suffocated them. Those who only read
of such things at home can form but a faint con-
ception of what it is actually to behold them.
"We must fight !" muttered Harold between his
teeth.
Disco could not speak, but he looked at his com-
panion and gave a nod that plainly indicated the
state of his feelings.
"'Sh !" hissed Chimbolo, creeping up at that
moment and laying his hand, which trembled
violently, on Harold's shoulder, " Marizano !"
" What! the scoundrel in advance ?"
Chimbolo pointed to the leader of the slave gang,
and almost foamed at the mouth with suppressed
rage.
At that moment their attention was attracted to
a woman who walked immediately behind the
slavers. She was a young and, according to African
ideas, a comely girl, but was apparently very weak-
so weak that she panted and stumbled as she went
along, a circumstance which was accounted for by
the little infant tied to her back, which could not
have been more than a couple of weeks old.


## p. 267 (#291) ############################################

267
Stumbling against the fallen branch of a tree she
fell at last with a low wail to the ground, and
made no effort, as on previous occasions, to re-
cover herself.
The whole gang stopped, and Marizano, turning
back, pushed the woman with his foot.
A fine-looking young man, who was the leader
in a couple secured by a slave-stick, seemed to re-
gard this woman with a degree of interest that argued
near relationship. He started forward half involun-
tarily when the Portuguese half-caste kicked her.
He had forgotten for an instant his fellow in rear,
as well as the bar of the goree across his throat,
which checked him violently; at the same time one
of the drivers who had observed the movement
laid a supple wand across his bare back so sharply
as to draw forth a terrific yell of agony.
This was too much for Disco Lillihammer.
Unable to restrain himself, he leaped up, seized
his rifle by the muzzle with both hands, and
swinging it round his head rushed upon Marizano
with a bursting shout of rage and defiance.
It is probable that the half-caste leader, who
was by no means destitute of courage, would have
stood his ground had his assailant been a man of
colour, but this unexpected apparition of a white
man with a fiery countenance and blue eyes that
absolutely flashed as he rushed forward with irre-

sistible fury, was too much for him. Firing hastily,
and with bad aim, Marizano turned and fled into
the woods, followed by all his men. There was
however a large band of Ajawa savages in rear,
armed with bows and poisoned arrows. When he
encountered these the Portuguese chief halted, and
rallying his men took shelter behind trees and
began to fire at the advancing enemy.
Seeing this, Harold drew his men together and
made them fire a united volley, which had the
effect of utterly routing the slavers. Disco mean-
while, finding that he could not overtake Marizano,
at last did what he ought to have done at first-
kneeled down, took deliberate aim at him, and
fired. His agitation prevented accuracy of aim;
nevertheless he succeeded in sending a bullet
through the fleshy part of the man's arm, above
the elbow, which effectually put him to flight.
Returning to the slaves, who had been left
standing where they were first stopped in a state
of great surprise and perplexity, he assisted his
companions in freeing them. This was easy enough
in regard to the women and children, but the gorees
on the men were very difficult to remove. Being
riveted, as we have said, it became necessary to
split the forks with hatchets, an operation which
endangered the heads of the poor captives and
hurt their galled necks considerably. It was ac-

complished however in the midst of a deal of ex-
citement and hurried conversation, while Jumbo
and his comrades kindled fires, and Harold bade
the women cook the meal—which they had hitherto
carried—for themselves and their children. They
seemed to consider this too good news to be true,
but, on being encouraged, began with alacrity.
" Don't be afeared, lass," cried Disco, patting a
young woman on the head, "eat as much as 'ee
like. You need it, poor thing, an' stuff the childer
till they can't hold no more. Bu'st 'em if 'ee can.
The slavers won't come back here in a hurry. Ha!
I only wish they would, an' let's have a brush with
'em. But there's no such luck. Cowards never
fight 'xcept w'en they 're sure to win.—Now, picca-
ninny, here you are," he said, stuffing some raw
mapira meal into the open mouth of a thin little
girl of about six or seven, who was gazing at him
in open-eyed surprise ; " don't put off time, you're
half-starved already !"
The little black skeleton began to chew the dry
meal with evident satisfaction, but without taking
her eyes off her deliverer.
"Who are you ?" asked a somewhat older girl of
Harold, whom she regarded with looks of reverence
and wonder.
Of course Harold did not understand her, but he
immediately called Antonio, who translated.

"Who are you ?" she said ; " the other people tied
and starved us, but you cut the ropes and tell us to
eat; what sort of people are you? Where did you
come from ?"
To this Harold replied briefly that he was an
Englishman, who hated slavers and slavery, but he
said nothing more at that time, as he intended to
have a palaver and explanation with the freed
*captives after their meal was over.
There was a great clapping of hands among the
slaves, expressive of gratitude, on hearing that they
were free.
About a hundred sat down to that meal, most of
whom were women and children, and the manner in
which they devoured the food set before them, told
eloquently of their previous sufferings. At first they
timidly held back, scarce venturing to believe that
their new captors, as they thought them, were in
earnest. But when their doubts and fears were
removed, they attacked the mapira porridge like
ravening wolves. Gradually the human element
began to reappear, in the shape of a comment or a
smile, and before long the women were chatting
together, and a few of the stronger among the
young children were making feeble attempts to
play.
When the oldest man of the party, who appeared.
to be between twenty and thirty, was brought for-

ward and questioned he gave some interesting and
startling information.
"Tell him," said Harold to Antonio, "that we are
Englishmen; that we belong to the same nation
as the great white man Dr. Livingstone, who
travelled through this land some years ago—the
nation which hates slavery because the Great God
hates it, and would have all men to be free, to serve
each other in love, and to do to other people as
they would have other people do to them. Ask
him, also, where he comes from, and who captured
him and his companions."
To this the negro replied-
"What the white man says may be true, but the
white men seem to tell lies too much. The men
who killed our warriors, burned our villages, and
took our women and children away, came to us
saying that they were friends; that they were the
servants of the same people as the white man
Livingstone, and wanted to trade with us. When
we believed and trusted them, and were off our
guard, they fired on us with their guns. We know
not what to think or to believe."
Harold was much perplexed by this reply, for he
knew not what evidence to cite in proof that he, at
least, was not a deceiver.
"Tell him," he said at length, " that there are
false white men as well as true, and that the best

proof I can give him that I am one of the true is, to
set him and his friends at liberty. They are now as
free to go where they please as we are."
On receiving this assurance the negro retired to
consult with his friends. Meanwhile Antonio, who
seemed to have been touched by the unvarying kind-
ness with which he had been treated by his em-
ployers, opened his mind to them and gave them a
good deal of information, of which the substance is
as follows :
At that time the merchants of the Portuguese
inland town of Tete, on the Zambesi, were carrying
on the slave-trade with unusual vigour, for this
reason, that they found it difficult to obtain ivory
except in exchange for slaves. In former years
they had carried on a trade in ivory with a tribe
called the Banyai, these Banyai being great elephant-
hunters, but it happened that they went to war
with another tribe named the Matabele, who had
managed to steal from them all their women and
children. Consequently the forlorn Banyai said to
the Tete merchants, when they went to trade with
them as they had been accustomed to do, " We do
not want your merchandise. Bring us women and
children, and you shall have as much ivory as you
wish."
These good people of Tete-being chiefly half-
caste Portuguese, and under Portuguese government,

273
and claiming, as they do, to be the possessors of
that region of Africa—are so utterly incapable of
holding their own, that they are under the necessity
of paying tribute to a tribe of savages who come
down annually to Tete to receive it, and who,
but for that tribute, would, as they easily could,
expel them from the land. These merchants cf
Tete, moreover, in common with all the Portuguese
in Africa, are by the laws of Portugal prohibited
from engaging in the export slave-trade. They are
not, however, forbidden to engage temporarily in
the "domestic slave-trade," hence they had sent out
slaving parties—in other words, robbers, kidnappers,
murderers—who hired the war-like Ajawa tribe to
aid them in killing the Manganja men and robbing
them of their wives and little ones, by which means
they were enabled to supply the demand for such
"cattle" among the Banyai, and thus obtained the
desired supply of ivory! So vigorously had this
slave traffic been carried on, at the time of which
we write, that no fewer than two hundred people-
mostly women and children-were carried out of
the hill-country every week.
In a short time the negro returned to the place
where Harold and Disco were seated, and said that
he believed his white deliverers were true men, but
added that he and his people had no home to go to;
1 See The Universities' Mission to Central Africa, p. 112.

their village having been burnt, and all the old
people and warriors killed or dispersed by Marizano,
who was a terribly cruel man. In proof of this
assertion he said that, only the day before, Marizano
had shot two of the women for attempting to untie
their thongs; a man had been killed with an axe
because he had broken down with fatigue; and a
woman had her infant's brains dashed out because
she was unable to carry it as well as the load assigned
to her.
"It is difficult to decide what one should do in
these circumstances," said Harold to Disco. " You
know it would never do to leave these helpless people
here to starve; but if we take them on with us our
progress will be uncommonly slow."
"We'd better take 'em back," said Disco.
" Back! Where to ?"
"W'y, to the last village wot we passed through.
It ain't more than a day's march, an' I'm sure the
old feller as is capting of it would take care o' the
lot."
"There is good advice in that, yet I grudge to go
back," said Harold ;" if there were a village the same
distance in advance, I would rather take them on."
"But there ain't," returned Disco. "Hallo! I
say, wot's wrong with Tony ?".
The interpreter came forward with a look of much
excitement as he spoke.

"What now, Antonio ?"
"Oh! it's drefful," replied the interpreter. "Dey
tells me have hear Marizano speak ob anoder slav-
ing party what go straight to Kambira's village for
attack it."
" Who told you that? Are they sure ?" asked
Harold hastily.
"Two, tree mans tole me," replied Antonio. "All
say same ting. Too late to help him now, me's
'fraid."
"Never say too late," cried Disco, starting up;
"never say die while there's a shot in the locker.
It may be time enough yet if we only look sharp.
I votes that we leave nearly all the provisions
we have with these poor critters here; up anchor,
'bout ship, clap on all sail, and away this werry
minit.".
Harold agreed with this advice heartily, and at
once acted on it. The arrangements were quickly
made, the provisions distributed, an explanation
made, and in less than an hour the travellers were
retracing their steps in hot haste.
By taking a straight line and making forced
marches, they arrived in sight of the ridge where
they had last seen Kambira, on the evening of the
third day. As they drew near Harold pushed im-
patiently forward, and, outrunning his companions,
was first to reach the summit. Disco's heart sank

within him, for he observed that his companion
stood still, bowed his head, and covered his face
with both hands. He soon joined him, and a groan
burst from the seaman's breast when he saw dense
volumes of smoke rising above the spot where the
village had so recently lain a picture of peaceful
beauty.
Even their followers, accustomed though they were
to scenes and deeds of violence and cruelty, could
not witness the grief of the Englishmen unmoved.
" Praps," said Disco, in a husky voice," there's
some of 'em left alive, hidin' in the bushes."
" It may be so," replied Harold, as he descended
the slope with rapid strides. "God help them !"
A few minutes sufficed to bring them to the
scene of ruin, but the devastation caused by the fire
was so great that they had difficulty in recognising
the different spots where the huts had stood. Kam-
bira's hut was, however, easily found, as it stood on
a rising ground. There the fight with the slavers
had evidently been fiercest, for around it lay the
charred and mutilated remains of many human !
bodies. Some of these were so far distinguishable
that it could be told whether they belonged to man,
woman, or child.
" Look here !" said Disco, in a deep, stern voice, 1
as he pointed to an object on the ground not farý
from the hut.

It was the form of a woman who had been
savagely mangled by her murderers. The upturned
and distorted face proved it to be Yohama, the grand-
mother of little Obo. Near to her lay the body of
a grey-haired negro, who might, to judge from his
position, have fallen in attempting to defend her.
"Oh! if the people of England only saw this
sight !" said Harold, in a low tone; "if they only
believed in and realized this fact, there would be
one universal and indignant shout of 'No toleration
of slavery anywhere throughout the world !!"
"Look closely for Kambira or his son," he added,
turning to his men.
A careful search among the sickening remains
was accordingly made, but without any discovery
worth noting being made, after which they searched
the surrounding thickets. Here sad evidence of the
poor fugitives having been closely pursued was
found in the dead bodies of many of the old men
and women, and of the very young children and
infants ; also the bodies of a few of the warriors.
All these had been speared, chiefly through the
back. Still they were unsuccessful in finding the
bodies of the chief or his little boy.
" It's plain," said Disco," that they have either
escaped or been took prisoners."
"Here is some one not quite dead," said Harold.
-"Ah! poor fellow ?"

He raised the unfortunate man's head on his
knee, and recognised the features of the little man
who had entertained them with his tunes on the
native violin.
It was in vain that Antonio tried to gain his
attention while Disco moistened his lips with water.
He had been pierced in the chest with an arrow.
Once only he opened his eyes, and a faint smile
played on his lips as if he recognised friends, but it
faded quickly and left the poor musician a corpse.
Leaving, with heavy hearts, the spot where they
had spent such pleasant days and nights, enjoying
the hospitality of Kambira and his tribe, our travel-
lers began to retrace their steps to the place where
they had left the rescued slaves, but that night the
strong frame of Disco Lillihammer succumbed to
the influence of climate. He was suddenly stricken
with African fever, and in a few hours became as
helpless as a little child.
In this extremity Harold found it necessary to
encamp. He selected the highest and healthiest
spot in the neighbourhood, caused his followers to
build a rude but comparatively comfortable hut, and
set himself diligently to hunt for, and to tend, his
sick friend.

CHAPTER XVI.
TREATS OF LOVE, HATRED, AND SORROW, AND PROVES THAT SLAVERY
AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT CONFINED TO BLACK MEN AND
WOMEN.
We must now change the scene to the garden of
that excellent Governor, Senhor Francisco Alfonso
Toledo Bignoso Letotti, and the date to three months'
in advance of the period in which occurred the events
related in the last chapter.
"Maraquita, I am sorry to find that you still
persist in encouraging that morbid regret for the
loss of one who cannot now be recovered."
Thus spoke the Governor, in tones that were un-
usually petulant for one who idolized his child.
" Father, why did you sell her without saying a
word to me about your intention ? It was very, very,
very unkind-indeed it was."
Poor Maraquita's eyes were already red and
swollen with much weeping, nevertheless she pro-
ceeded to increase the redness and the swelling by a
renewed burst of passionate distress.
The worthy Governor found it difficult to frame a
reply or to administer suitable consolation, for in
his heart he knew that he had sold Azinté, as it were

surreptitiously, to Marizano for an unusually large
sum of money at a time when his daughter was
absent on a visit to a friend. The noted Portuguese
kidnapper, murderer, rebel, and trader in black ivory,
having recovered from his wound, had returned to
the town, and, being well aware of Azinté's market
value, as a rare and remarkably beautiful piece of
ivory of extra-superfine quality, had threatened, as
well as tempted, Governor Letotti beyond his powers
of resistance. Marizano did not want the girl as
his own slave. He wanted dollars, and, therefore,
destined her for the markets of Arabia or Persia,
where the smooth-tongued and yellow-skinned in-
habitants hold that robbery, violence, and cruelty
such as would make the flesh of civilized people
creep, although borrible vices in themselves, are,
nevertheless, quite justifiable when covered by the
sanction of that miraculous talisman called a
" domestic institution." 1
Governor Letotti's heart had smitten him at first,
for he really was an amiable man, and felt kindly
disposed to humanity at large, slaves included. Un-
fortunately the same kindliness was concentrated
with tenfold power on himself, so that, when self-
interest came into play the amiable man became

capable of deeds that Marizano himself might have
been proud of. The only difference, in fact, between
the two was that the Governor, like the drunkard,
often felt ashamed of himself, and sometimes wished
that he were a better man, while the man-stealer
gloried in his deeds, and had neither wish nor in-
tention to improve.
"Maraquita," said Senhor Letotti, still somewhat
petulantly, though with more of remonstrance in
his tone," how can you speak so foolishly? It was
out of my power, you know, to speak to you when
you were absent about what I intended to do.
Besides, I was at the time very much in need of
some ready money, for, although I am rich enough,
there are times when most of my capital is what
business men called 'locked up, and therefore not
immediately available. In these circumstances,
Marizano came to me with a very tempting offer.
But there are plenty of good-looking, amiable, affec-
tionate girls in Africa. I can easily buy you another
slave quite as good as Azinté."
"As good as Azinté !" echoed Maraquita wildly,
starting up and gazing at her father with eyes that
flashed through her tears, " Azinté, who has opened
her heart to me-her bursting, bleeding heart—and
told me all her former joys and all her present woes,
and who loves me as she loves—ay, better than she
loves-her own soul, merely because I dropped a few

good as Azinté!" she cried with increasing vehemence;
"would you listen with patience to any one who
should talk to you of another as good as Maraquita ?"
"Nay, but," remonstrated the Governor, "you are
now raving; your feelings towards Azinté cannot be
compared with my love for you."
"If you loved me as I thought you did, you would
not you could not have thus taken from me my
darling little maid. Oh! shame, shame on you,
father—"
She could say no more, but rushed from the room
to fling herself down and sob out her feelings in the
privacy of her own chamber, where she was sought
out by the black cook, who had overheard some of
the conversation, and was a sympathetic soul. But
that amiable domestic happened to be inopportunely
officious; she instantly Aed from the chamber, fol-
lowed by the neatest pair of little slippers imaginable,
which hit her on the back of her woolly head,-for
Maraquita, like other spoilt children, had made up
her mind not to be comforted.
Meanwhile the Governor paced the floor of his
drawing-room with uneasy feelings, which, how-
ever, were suddenly put to flight by the report of a
gun. Hastening to the window, he saw that the
shot had been fired by a war-steamer which was
entering the bay.

"Ha! the 'Firefly;' good !" exclaimed the
Governor, with a gratified look; "this will put it
all right."
He said nothing more, but left the room hastily.
It may however be as well to explain that his
remark had reference to the mutual affection which
he was well aware existed between his daughter and
the gallant Lieutenant Lindsay. He had not, indeed,
the most remote intention of permitting Maraquita
to wed the penniless officer, but he had no objection
whatever to their flirting as much as they pleased;
and he readily perceived that nothing would be
more likely to take the Senhorina's thoughts off her
lost maid than the presence of her lover.
There was a bower in a secluded corner of the
Governor Letotti's garden, a very charming bower
indeed, in which Lieutenant Lindsay had been wont,
at times when duty to the Queen of England per-
mitted, to hold sweet converse with the "queen of
his soul." What that converse was it neither be-
comes us to say nor the reader to inquire. Perhaps
it had reference to astronomy, perchance to domestic
economy. At all events it was always eminently
satisfactory to both parties engaged, save when the
Senhorina indulged in a little touch of waywardness,
and sent the poor officer back to his ship with a
heavy heart, for the express purpose of teaching him
the extent of her power and the value of her favour.

She overclouded him now and then, just to make
him the more ardently long for sunshine, and to
convince him that in the highest sense of the word
he was a slave!
To this bower, then, the Senhorina returned with a
sad heart and swollen eyes, to indulge in vain re-
grets. Her sorrows had overwhelmed her to such
an extent that she failed to observe the 'Firefly's'
salute. It was therefore with a look of genuine sur-
prise and agitation that she suddenly beheld Lieu-
tenant Lindsay, who had availed himself of the first
free moment, striding up the little path that led to
the bower.
"Maraquita !" he exclaimed, looking in amaze-
ment at the countenance of his lady-love, which was
what Norsemen style "begrutten."
But Maraquita was in no mood to be driven out
of her humour, even by her lover.
"I am miserable," she said with vehemence,
clenching one of her little fists as though she
meditated an assault on the lieutenant,—"utterly,
absolutely, inconsolably miserable."
If Lindsay had entertained any doubt regarding
the truth of her assertion, it would have been dis-
pelled by her subsequent conduct, for she buried her
face in a handkerchief and burst into tears.
"Beloved, adorable, tender, delicious Maraquita,"
were words which leapt into the lieutenant's

mind, but he dare not utter them with his lips.
Neither did he venture to clasp Maraquita's waist
with his left arm, lay her pretty little head on
his breast and smooth her luxuriant hair with his
right hand, though he felt almost irresistibly tempted
so to do—entirely from feelings of pity, of course,
—for the Senhorina had hitherto permitted no
familiarities beyond a gentle pressure of the hand
on meeting and at parting.
It is unnecessary to repeat all that the bashful
though ardent man of war said to Maraquita, or
all that Maraquita said to the man of war; how,
ignoring the celestial orbs and domestic economy, she
launched out into a rhapsodical panegyric of Azinté;
told how the poor slave had unburdened her heart
to her about her handsome young husband and
her darling little boy in the far-off interior, from
whom she had been rudely torn, and whom she
never expected to see again; and how she, Mara-
quita, had tried to console Azinté by telling her
that there was a heaven where good people might
hope to meet again, even though they never met
on earth, and a great deal more besides, to all of
which the earnest lieutenant sought to find words
wherewith to express his pity and sympathy, but
found them not, though he was at no loss to find
words to tell the queen of his soul that, in the
peculiar circumstances of the case, and all things

considered, his love for her (Maraquita) was ten-
fold more intense than it had ever been before !
- "Foolish boy," said the Senhorina, smiling through
her tears, "what is the use of telling me that? Can
it do any good to Azinté ?"
"Not much, I'm afraid," replied the lieutenant.
"Well, then, don't talk nonsense, but tell me what
I am to do to recover my little maid."
"It is impossible for me to advise," said the
lieutenant, with a perplexed look.
"But you must advise," said Maraquita, with great
decision.
"Well, I will try. How long is it since Azinté
was taken away from you ?"
"About two weeks."
: "You say that Marizano was tne purchaser. Do
you know to what part of the coast he intended to
convey her ?"
" How should I know? I have only just heard
of the matter from my father."
"Well then, you must try to find out from your
father all that he knows about Marizano and his
movements. That is the first step. After that I
will consider what can be done."
"Yes, Senhor," said Maraquita, rising suddenly,
"you must consider quickly, and you must act at
once, for you must not come here again until you
bring me news of Azinté."

Poor Lindsay, who knew enough of the girl's
character to believe her to be thoroughly in earnest,
protested solemnly that he would do his utmost.
All that Maraquita could ascertain from her
father was, that Marizano meant to proceed to
Kilwa, the great slave-depôt of the coast, there to
collect a large cargo of slaves and proceed with them
to Arabia, whenever he had reason to believe that
the British cruisers were out of the way. This
was not much to go upon, but the Senhorina was
as unreasonable as were the Egyptians of old,
when they insisted on the Israelites making bricks
without straw.
He was unexpectedly helped out of his dilemma
by Captain Romer, who called him into his cabin
that same evening, told him that he had obtained
information of the movements of slavers which
induced him to think it might be worth while to
watch the coast to the northward of Cape Delgado,
and bade him prepare for a cruise in charge of the
cutter, adding that the steamer would soon follow
and keep them in view.
With a lightened heart Lindsay went off to prepare,
and late that night the cutter quietly pulled away
from the 'Firefly's' side, with a well-armed crew,
and provisioned for a short cruise.
Their object was to proceed as stealthily as possible
along the coast, therefore they kept inside of islands

as much as possible, and cruised about a good deal
at nights, always sleeping on board the boat, as the
low-lying coast was very unhealthy, but landing
occasionally to obtain water and to take a survey of
the sea from convenient heights.
Early one morning as they were sailing with a
very light breeze, between two small islands, a vessel
was seen looming through the haze, not far from
shore.
Jackson, one of the men, who has been introduced
to the reader at an earlier part of this narrative, was
the first to observe the strangers.
"It's a brig," he said; "I can make out her royals."
"No, it's a barque," said the coxswain.
A little midshipman, named Midgley, differed
from both, and said it was a large dhow, for he
could make out the top of its lateen sail.
"Whatever it is, we'll give chase," said Lindsay,
ordering the men to put out the oars and give way,
the sail being of little use.
In a few minutes the haze cleared sufficiently to
prove that Midgley was right. At the same time it
revealed to those on board the dhow that they were
being chased by the boat of a man-of-war. The
little wind that blew at the time was insufficient to
enable the dhow to weather a point just ahead of
her, and the cutter rowed down on her so fast that
it was evidently impossible for her to escape.


## p. 289 (#313) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
289
Seeing this, the commander of the dhow at once
ran straight for the shore. Before the boat could
reach her she was among the breakers on the bar,
which were so terrible at that part of the coast as
to render landing in a small boat quite out of the
question. In a few minutes the dhow was hurled
on the beach and began to break up, while her crew
and cargo of slaves swarmed into the sea and tried
to gain the shore. It seemed to those in the boat
that some hundreds of negroes were struggling at one
time in the seething foam.
"We must risk it, and try to save some of the
poor wretches," cried Lindsay; "give way, lads, give
way!"
The boat shot in amongst the breakers, and was
struck by several seas in succession, and nearly
swamped ere it reached the shore. But they were
too late to save many of the drowning. Most of the
strongest of the slaves had gained the shore and
taken to the hills in wild terror, under the impres-
sion so carefully instilled into them by the Arabs,
that the only object the Englishmen had in view
was to catch, cook, and eat them! The rest were
drowned, with the exception of two men and seven
little children, varying from five to eight years of
age, who were found crawling on the beach, in such
a state of emaciation that they could not follow their
companions into the bush. They tried, however, in

their own feeble, helpless way, to avoid capture and
the terrible fate which they thought awaited them.
These were soon lifted tenderly into the boat.
"Here, Jackson," cried Lindsay, lifting one of the
children in his strong arms, and handing it to the
sailor, "carry that one very carefully, she seems to
be almost gone. God help her, poor, poor child !"
There was good cause for Lindsay's pity, for the
little girl was so thin that every bone in her body
was sticking out-her elbow and knee-joints being
the largest parts of her shrunken limbs, and it was
found that she could not rise or even stretch her-
self out, in consequence, as was afterwards ascer-
tained, of her having been kept for many days in
the dhow in a sitting posture, with her knees
doubled up against her face. Indeed, most of the
poor little things captured were found to be more
or less stiffened from the same cause.
An Arab interpreter had been sent with Lindsay,
but he turned out to be so incapable that it was
scarcely possible to gain any information from him.
He was either stupid in reality, or pretended to be
so. The latter supposition is not improbable, for
many of the interpreters furnished to the men-of-
war on that coast were found to be favourable to
the slavers, insomuch that they have been known to
mislead those whom they were paid to serve.
With great difficulty the cutter was pulled through

the surf. That afternoon the 'Firefly' hove in sight,
and took the rescued slaves on board.
Next day two boats from the steamer chased an-
other dhow on shore, but with even less result than
before, for the whole of the slaves escaped to the
hills. On the day following, however, a large dhow
was captured, with about a hundred and fifty slaves
on board, all of whom were rescued, and the dhow
destroyed.
The dhows which were thus chased or captured
were all regular and undisguised slavers. Their
owners were openly engaged in what they knew
was held to be piracy alike by the Portuguese, the
Sultan of Zanzibar, and the English. They were
exporting slaves from Africa to Arabia and Persia,
which is an illegal species of traffic. In dealing
with these, no difficulty was experienced except the
difficulty of catching them. When caught, the dhows
were invariably destroyed and the slaves set free
- that is to say, carried to those ports where they
might be set free with safety.
But there were two other sorts of traffickers in
the bodies and souls of human beings who were
much more difficult to deal with.
There were, first, the legal slave-traders, namely,
the men who convey slaves by sea from one part of
the Sultan of Zanzibar's dominions to another. This
kind of slavery was prosecuted under the shelter of

!
what we have already referred to as a domestic
institution! It involved, as we have said before,
brutality, injustice, cruelty, theft, murder, and ex-
termination, but, being a domestic institution of
Zanzibar, it was held to be legal, and the British
Government have recognised and tolerated it by
treaty for a considerable portion of this century!
It is, however, but justice to ourselves to say,
that our Government entered into the treaty with
the view of checking, limiting, and mitigating the
evils of the slave-trade. We have erred in recog-
nising any form of slavery, no matter how humane
our object was—one proof of which is that we have,
by our interference, unintentionally increased the
evils of slavery instead of abating them.
It is worth while remarking here, that slavery is
also a domestic institution in Arabia and Persia. If
it be right that we should not interfere with the
Zanzibar institution, why should we interfere with
that of Arabia or Persia ?? We maintain a squadron
on the east coast of Africa to stop the flow of Africans
to the latter countries, while we permit the flow by
treaty, as well as by practice, to the former. Is this
consistent? The only difference between the two
cases is one of distance, not of principle.
But to return to our point—the legal traders. In
1 Our treaty appears to have been founded on the principle that
we ought to respect domestic institutions.

consequence of the Sultan's dominions lying partly
on an island and partly on the mainland, his do-
mestic institution necessitates boats, and in order
to distinguish between his boats and the pirates,
there is a particular season fixed in which he may
carry his slaves by sea from one part of his domi-
nions to another; and each boat is furnished with
papers which prove it to be a "legal trader." This
is the point on which the grand fallacy of our inter-
ference hinges. The" domestic institution" would
be amply supplied by about 4000 slaves a year.
The so-called legal traders are simply legalized de-
ceivers, who transport not fewer than 30,000 slaves
a year ! They leave Zanzibar with full cargoes
continually, with far more than is required for what
we may term home-consumption. Nevertheless,
correct papers are furnished to them by the Sultan,
which protects them from British cruisers within
the prescribed limits, namely, between Cape Dalgado
and Lamoo, a line of coast about 1500 miles in ex-
tent. But it is easy for them to evade the cruisers
in these wide seas and extensive coasts, and the
1 It must be borne in mind that these 30,000 represent only a
portion—the Zanzibar portion-of the great African slave-trade. From
the Portuguese settlements to the south, and from the north by way
of Egypt, the export of negroes as slaves is larger. It is estimated
that the total number of human beings enslaved on the east and north-
east coast of Africa is about 70,000 a year. As all authorities agree
in the statement that at the lowest estimate only one out of every five
captured survives to go into slavery, this number represents a loss to
Africa of 350,000 human beings a year.

value of Black Ivory is so great that the loss of a
few is but a small matter. On reaching the northern
limits the legal traders become pirates. They run
to the northward, and take their chance of being
captured by cruisers.
The reason of all this is very obvious. The
Sultan receives nearly half a sovereign a head for
each slave imported into Zanzibar, and our Govern-
ments, in time past, have allowed themselves to
entertain the belief, that, by treaty, the Sultan could
be induced to destroy this the chief source of his
revenue !
Surely it is not too much to say, that Great
Britain ought to enter into no treaty whatever in
regard to slavery, excepting such as shall provide for
the absolute, total, and immediate extirpation thereof
by whatsoever name called.
Besides these two classes of slavers,—the open,
professional pirates, and the sneaking, deceiving
" domestic" slavers, there are the slave-smugglers.
They are men who profess to be, and actually are,
legal traders in ivory, gum, copal, and other produce
of Africa. These fellows manage to smuggle two or
three slaves each voyage to the Black Ivory markets,
under pretence that they form part of the crew of
their dhows. It is exceedingly difficult, almost
impossible, for the officers of our cruisers to convict
these smugglers—to distinguish between slaves and

295
crews, consequently immense numbers of slaves are
carried off to the northern ports in this manner.
Sometimes these dhows carry Arab or other passen-
gers, and when there are so many slaves on board
that it would be obviously absurd to pretend that
they formed part of the crew, the owner dresses
the poor wretches up in the habiliments that come
most readily to hand, and passes them off as the wives
or servants of these passengers. Any one might see
at a glance that the stupid, silent, timid-looking
creatures, who have had almost every human ele-
ment beaten out of them, are nothing of the sort,
but there is no means of proving them other than
they are represented to be. If an interpreter were
to ask them they would be ready to swear anything
that their owner had commanded; hence the cruisers
are deceived in every way—in many ways besides
those now mentioned—and our philanthropic in-
tentions are utterly thwarted; for the rescuing and
setting free of 1000 or 2000 negroes a year out of
the 30,000 annually exported, is not an adequate
result for our great expense in keeping a squadron
on the coast, especially when we consider that
hundreds, probably thousands, of slaves perish amid
horrible sufferings caused by the efforts of the man-
stealers to avoid our cruisers. These would proba-
bly not lose their lives, and the entire body of slaves
would suffer less, if we did not interfere at all.

From this we do not argue that non-interference
would be best, but that, as our present system of
repression does not effectively accomplish what is
aimed at, it ought to be changed. What the change
should be, many wise and able men have stated.
Their opinion we cannot quote here, but one thing
taught to us by past experience is clear, we cannot
cure the slave-trade by merely limiting it. Our
motto in regard to slavery ought to be — Total and
immediate extinction everywhere

STRONG MEASURES LEAD TO UNEXPECTED DISCOVERIES.
"I'm terribly worried and perplexed," said Lieu-
tenant Lindsay one afternoon to Midshipman
Midgley, as they were creeping along the coast in
the neighbourhood of Cape Dalgado.
"Why so ?" inquired the middy.
"Because I can learn nothing whatever about the
movements of Marizano," replied the Lieutenant.
"I have not spoken to you about this man hitherto,
because-because—that is to say—the fact is, it
wasn't worth while, seeing that you know no more
about him than I do, perhaps not so much. But I
can't help thinking that we might have learned
something about him by this time, only our inter-
preter is such an unmitigated ass, he seems to
understand nothing—to pick up nothing."
- "Indeed !" exclaimed the midshipman; "I'm
surprised to hear you say so, because I heard
Suliman whispering last night with that half-caste

fellow whom we captured along with the other
niggers, and I am confident that he mentioned the
name of Marizano several times."
"Did he? Well now, the rascal invariably looks
quite blank when I mention Marizano's name, and
shakes his head, as if he had never heard of it
before."
"Couldn't you intimidate him into disgorging
a little of his knowledge ?" suggested Midgley, with
an arch look.
"I have thought of that," replied Lindsay, with
a frown. "Come, it's not a bad idea ; I'll try!
Hallo! Suliman, come aft, I want you."
Lieutenant Lindsay was one of those men who
are apt to surprise people by the precipitancy of
their actions. He was not, indeed, hasty; but
when his mind was made up he was not slow in
proceeding to action. It was so on the present
occasion, to the consternation of Suliman, who had
hitherto conceived him to be rather a soft, easy-
going man.
"Suliman," he said, in a low but remarkably firm
tone of voice, "you know more about Marizano
than you choose to tell me. Now," he continued,
gazing into the Arab's cold grey eyes, while he
pulled a revolver from his coat-pocket, and cocked
it, "I intend to make you tell me all you know
about him, or to blow your brains out."


## p. 299 (#323) ############################################

299
He moved the pistol gently as he spoke, and
placed his forefinger on the trigger.
"I not know," began Suliman, who evidently did
not believe him to be quite in earnest; but before
the words had well left his lips the drum of his left
ear was almost split by the report of the pistol, and
a part of his turban was blown away.
" You don't know ? very well," said Lindsay, re-
cocking the pistol, and placing the cold muzzle of it
against the Arab's yellow nose.
This was too much for Suliman. He grew pale,
and suddenly fell on his knees.
"Oh! stop! no-no! not fire! me tell you'bout'im."
"Good, get up and do so," said the Lieutenant,
uncocking the revolver, and returning it to his
pocket; "and be sure that you tell me all, else
your life won't be worth the value of the damaged
turban on your head."
With a good deal of trepidation the alarmed in-
terpreter thereupon gave Lindsay all the informa-
tion he possessed in regard to the slaver, which
' amounted to this, that he had gone to Kilwa,
where he had collected a band of slaves sufficient to
fill a large dhow, with which he intended, in two
days more, to sail, in company with a fleet of
slavers, for the north.
"Does he intend to touch at Zanzibar ?" inquired
Lindsay.

"Me tink no," replied the interpreter; "got many
pritty garls—go straight for Persia."
On hearing this the Lieutenant put the cutter
about, and sailed out to sea in search of the
*Firefly,' which he knew could not at that time
be at any great distance from the shore.
He found her sooner than he had expected ; and,
to his immense astonishment as well as joy, one of
the first persons he beheld on stepping over the side
of his ship was Azinté.
"You have captured Marizano, sir, I see," he
said to Captain Romer.
"Not the scoundrel himself, but one of his
dhows," replied the Captain. "He had started for
the northern ports with two heavily-laden vessels.
We discovered him five days ago, and, fortunately,
just beyond the protected water, so that he was a
fair and lawful prize. The first of his dhows being
farthest out from shore we captured, but the other,
commanded by himself, succeeded in running
ashore, and he escaped, with nearly all his slaves
-only a few of the women and children being
drowned in the surf. And now, as our cargo of
poor wretches is pretty large, I shall run for the
Seychelles. After landing them I shall return as
fast as possible, to intercept a few more of these
pirates."
"To the Seychelles !" muttered the Lieutenant to

himself as he went below, with an expression on
his countenance something between surprise and
despair.
Poor Lindsay! His mind was so taken up with
and confused by the constant and obtrusive pre-
sence of the Senhorina Maraquita that the particu-
lar turn which affairs had taken had not occurred
to him, although that turn was quite natural, and
by no means improbable. Marizano, with Azinté on
board of one of his piratical dhows, was proceeding
to the north. Captain Romer, with his war-steamer,
was on the look-out for piratical dhows. What more
natural than that the Captain should fall in with
the pirate? But Lieutenant Lindsay's mind had
been so filled with Maraquita that it seemed to be,
for the time, incapable of holding more than one
other idea —that idea was the fulfilment of Mara-
quita's commands to obtain information as to her
lost Azinté. To this he had of late devoted all his
powers, happy in the thought that it fell in with
and formed part of his duty to his Queen and
country, as well as to the "Queen of his soul." To
rescue Azinté from Marizano seemed to the bold
Lieutenant an easy enough matter; but to rescue
her from his own Captain, and send her back into
slavery! "Ass ! that I am," he exclaimed, "not to
have thought of this before. Of course she can
never be returned to Maraquita, and small comfort

it will be to the Senhorina to be told that her
favourite is free in the Seychelles Islands, and
utterly beyond her reach, unless she chooses to go
there and stay with her."
Overwhelmed with disgust at his own stupidity,
and at the utter impossibility of doing anything to
mend matters, the unfortunate Lieutenant sat down
to think, and the result of his thinking was that
he resolved at all events to look well after Azinté,
and see that she should be cared for on her arrival
at the Seychelles.
Among the poor creatures who had been rescued
from Marizano's dhow were nearly a hundred
children, in such a deplorable condition that small
hopes were entertained of their reaching the island
alive. Their young lives, however, proved to be
tenacious. Experienced though their hardy rescuers
were in rough and tumble work, they had no con-
ception what these poor creatures had already gone
through, and, therefore, formed a mistaken estimate
of their powers of endurance. Eighty-three of them
reached the Seychelles alive. They were placed
under the care of a warm-hearted missionary, who
spared no pains for their restoration to health ; but,
despite his utmost efforts, forty of these eventually
died—their little frames had been whipped, and
starved, and tried to such an extent that recovery
was impossible.

To the care of this missionary Lieutenant Lindsay
committed Azinté, telling him as much of her sad
story as he was acquainted with. The missionary
willingly took charge of her, and placed her as a
nurse in the temporary hospital which he had insti-
tuted for the little ones above referred to. Here
Azinté proved herself to be a most tender, affec-
tionate, and intelligent nurse to the poor children,
for whom she appeared to entertain particular regard,
and here, on the departure of the Firefly shortly
afterwards, Lindsay left her in a state of comfort,
usefulness, and comparative felicity.

A DIRTY shop, in a filthy street, in the unhealthy
town of Zanzibar, is the point to which we now beg
leave to conduct our reader—whom we also request
to leap, in a free and easy way, over a few months
of time!
It is not for the sake of the shop that we make
this leap, but for the purpose of introducing the
two men who, at the time we write of, sat over their
grog in a small back-room connected with that shop.
Still the shop itself is not altogether unworthy of
notice. It is what the Americans call a store—a
place where you can purchase almost every article
that the wants of man have called into being. The
prevailing smells are of oil, sugar, tea, molasses,
paint and tar, a compound which confuses the
discriminating powers of the nose, and, on the
principle that extremes meet, removes the feeling
of surprise that ought to be aroused by discovering

that these odours are in close connexion with
haberdashery and hardware. There are enormous
casks, puncheons, and kegs on the floor; bales on
the shelves ; indescribable confusion in the corners;
preserved meat tins piled to the ceiling ; with dust
and dirt encrusting everything. The walls, beams,
and rafters, appear to be held together by means of
innumerable cobwebs. Hosts of flies fatten on, with-
out diminishing, the stock, and squadrons of cock-
roaches career over the earthen floor.
In the little back-room of this shop sat the slave-
dealer Yoosoof, in company with the captain of an
English ship which lay in the harbour.
Smoke from the captain's pipe filled the little den
to such an extent that Yoosoof and his friend were
not so clearly distinguishable as might have been
desired.
" You're all a set of false-hearted, wrong-headed,
low-minded, scoundrels," said the plain-spoken
captain, accompanying each asseveration with a puff
so violent as to suggest the idea that his remarks
were round-shot and his mouth a cannon.
The Briton was evidently not in a complimentary
mood. It was equally evident that Yoosoof was not
in a touchy vein, for he smiled the slightest possible
smile and shrugged his shoulders. He had business
to transact with the captain which was likely to
result very much to his advantage, and Yoosoof was

not the man to let feelings stand in the way of
business.
" Moreover," pursued the captain, in a gruff voice,
" the trade in slaves is illegally conducted in one
sense, namely, that it is largely carried on by British
subjects."
"How you make that out ?" asked Yoosoof.
"How? why, easy enough. Aren't the richest
men in Zanzibar the Banyans, and don't these
Banyans, who number about 17,000 of your popula-
tion, supply you Arabs with money to carry on the
accursed slave-trade? And ain't these Banyans
Indian merchants—subjects of Great Britain ?"
Yoosoof shrugged his shoulders again and smiled.
"And don't these opulent rascals," continued the
Briton, " love their ease as well as their money, and
when they want to increase the latter without
destroying the former, don't they make advances to
the like of you and get 100 per cent. out of you for
every dollar advanced ?"
Yoosoof nodded his head decidedly at this, and
smiled again.
"Well, then, ain't the whole lot of you a set of
mean scoundrels ?" said the captain fiercely.
Yoosoof did not smile at this; he even looked for
a moment as if he were going to resent it, but it
was only for a moment. Self-interest came oppor-
tunely to his aid and made him submissive.

"What can we do ?" he asked after a short silence.
"You knows what the Sultan say, other day, to one
British off'cer, 'if you stop slave-trade you will ruin
Zanzibar. We mus' not do that. Zanzibar mus'
not be ruin."
"Why not ?" demanded the captain, with a look
of supreme contempt, "what if Zanzibar was ruined ?
Look here, now, Yoosoof, your dirty little island-
the whole island observe—is not quite the size of my
own Scotch county of Lanark. Its population is short
of 250,000 all told-scarce equal to the half of the
population of Lanark-composed of semi-barbarians
and savages. That's one side of the question. Here's
the other side : Africa is one of the four quarters of
the earth, with millions of vigorous niggers and
millions of acres of splendid land, and no end of
undeveloped resources, and you have the impudence
to tell me that an enormous lump of this land must
be converted into a desert, and something like
150,000 of its best natives be drawn off annually-
for what ?—for what ?" repeated the sailor, bringing
his fist down on the table before him with such force
that the glasses danced on it and the dust flew up;"for
what? I say ; for a paltry, pitiful island, ruled by a
sham sultan, without army or navy, and with little
money, save what he gets by slave-dealing; an
island which has no influence for good on the world,
morally, religiously, or socially, and with little com-

mercially, though it has much influence for evil ; an
island which has helped the Portuguese to lock up
the east coast of Africa for centuries ; an island which
would not be missed-save as a removed curse-if
it were sunk this night to the bottom of the sea, and
all its selfish, sensual, slave-dealing population swept
entirely off the face of the earth."
The captain had risen and dashed his pipe to
atoms on the floor in his indignation as he made
these observations. He now made an effort to
control himself, and then, sitting down, he con-
tinued-
"Just think, Yoosoof; you're a sharp man of
business, as I know to my cost. You can under-
stand a thing in a commercial point of view. Just
try to look at it thus: On the one side of the
world's account you have Zanzibar sunk with all its
Banyan and Arab population ; we won't sink the
niggers, poor wretches. We'll suppose them saved,
along with the consuls, missionaries, and suchlike.
Well, that's a loss of somewhere about 83,000
scoundrels,—a gain we might call it, but for the
sake of argument we'll call it a loss. On the other
side of the account you have 30,000 niggers-
fair average specimens of humanity-saved from
slavery, besides something like 150,000 more saved
from death by war and starvation, the results of
the slave-trade; 83,000 from 150,000 leaves 67,000!


## p. 309 (#333) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
309
The loss, you see, would be more than wiped off,
and a handsome balance left at the world's credit
the very first year! To say nothing of the open-
ing up of legitimate commerce to one of the richest
countries on earth, and the consequent introduction
of Christianity."
The captain paused to take breath. Yoosoof
shrugged his shoulders, and a brief silence ensued,
which was happily broken not by a recurrence to
the question of slavery, but by the entrance of a
slave. He came in search of Yoosoof for the pur-
pose of telling him that his master wished to speak
with him. As the slave's master was one of the
wealthy Banyans just referred to, Yoosoof rose at
once, and, apologising to the captain for quitting
him so hurriedly, left that worthy son of Neptune
to cool his indignation in solitude.
Passing through several dirty streets the slave led
the slaver to a better sort of house in a more salu-
hrious or, rather, less pestilential, part of the town.
He was ushered into the presence of an elderly man
of quiet unobtrusive aspect.
"Yoosoof," said the Banyan in Arabic, "I have
been considering the matter about which we had
some conversation yesterday, and I find that it will
be convenient for me to make a small venture. I
can let you have three thousand dollars."
" On the old terms?" asked Yoosoof.


## p. 310 (#334) ############################################

310
BLACK IVORY.
"On the old terms," replied the merchant. "Will
you be ready to start soon ?"
Yoosoof said that he would, that he had already
completed the greater part of his preparations, and
that he hoped to start for the interior in a week or
two.
"That is well; I hope you may succeed in doing
a good deal of business," said the merchant with an
amiable nod and smile, which might have led an
ignorant onlooker to imagine that Yoosoof's business
in the interior was work of a purely philanthropic
nature !
"There is another affair, which it has struck me
may lie in your way," continued the merchant.
"The British consul is, I am told, anxious to find
some one who will undertake to make inquiries in
the interior about some Englishmen who are said to
have been captured by the black fellows and made
slaves of."
"Does the consul know what tribe has captured
them?" asked Yoosoof.
"I think not; but as he offers five hundred dol-
lars for every lost white man who shall be recovered
and brought to the coast alive, I thought that you
might wish to aid him !"
"True," said Yoosoof, musing, "true, I will go
and see him."
Accordingly, the slave-dealer had an interview

311
with the consul, during which he learned that there
was no absolute certainty of any Englishmen hav-
ing been captured. It was only a vague rumour ;
nevertheless it was sufficiently probable to warrant
the offer of five hundred dollars to any one who
should effect a rescue; therefore Yoosoof, having
occasion to travel into the interior at any rate,
undertook to make inquiries.
He was also told that two Englishmen had,
not long before, purchased an outfit and started
off with the intention of proceeding to the interior
by way of the Zambesi river, and they, the consul
said, might possibly be heard of by him near the
regions to which he was bound; but these, he sug-
gested, could not be the men who were reported as
missing.
Of course Yoosoof had not the most remote idea
that these were the very Englishmen whom he him-
self had captured on the coast, for, after parting
from them abruptly, as described in a former chap-
ter, he had ceased to care or think about them, and
besides, was ignorant of the fact that they had been
to Zanzibar.
Yoosoof's own particular business required a
rather imposing outfit. First of all, he purchased
and packed about £600 worth of beads of many
colours, cloth of different kinds, thick brass wire,
and a variety of cheap trinkets, such as black men

and women are fond of, for Yoosoof was an "honest"
trader, and paid his way when he found it suitable
to do so. He likewise hired a hundred men, whom
he armed with guns, powder, and ball, for Yoosoof
was also a dishonest trader, and fought his way
when that course seemed most desirable.
With this imposing caravan he embarked in a
large dhow, sailed for the coast, landed at Kilwa,
and proceeded into the interior of Africa.
It was a long and toilsome journey over several
1 hundred miles of exceedingly fertile and beautiful
country, eminently suited for the happy abode of
natives. But Yoosoof and his class who traded in
black ivory had depopulated it to such an extent
that scarce a human being was to be seen all the
way. There were plenty of villages, but they were
in ruins, and acres of cultivated ground with the
weeds growing rank where the grain had once
flourished. Further on in the journey, near the
end of it, there was a change; the weeds and grain
grew together and did battle, but in most places the
weeds gained the victory. It was quite evident
that the whole land had once been a rich garden
teeming with human life-savage life, no doubt,
still, not so savage but that it could manage to exist
passed through a hundred and fifty miles of this
land; it was a huge grave, which, appropriately

enough, was profusely garnished with human
bones.
At last the slave-trader reached lands which
were not utterly forsaken.
Entering a village one afternoon he sent a present
of cloth and beads to the chief, and, after a few
preliminary ceremonies, announced that he wished
to purchase slaves.
The chief, who was a fine-looking young warrior,
said that he had no men, women or children to sell,
except a few criminals to whom he was welcome
at a very low price,-about two or three yards of
calico each. There were also one or two orphan
children whose parents had died suddenly, and to
whom no one in the village could lay claim. It was
true that these poor orphans had been adopted by
various families who might not wish to part with
them; but no matter, the chief's command was law.
Yoosoof might have the orphans also for a very
small sum,—a yard of calico perhaps. But nothing
would induce the chief to compel any of his people
to part with their children, and none of the people
seemed desirous of doing so.
The slave-trader therefore adopted another plan.
He soon managed to ascertain that the chief had an old
grudge against a neighbouring chief. In the course of
conversation he artfully stirred up the slumbering
1 See Livingstone's Tributaries of the Zambesi, p. 391..
,

ill-will, and carefully fanned it into a flame without
appearing to have any such end in view. When
the iron was sufficiently hot he struck it-supplied
the chief with guns and ammunition, and even, as a
great favour, offered to lend him a few of his own
men in order that he might make a vigorous attack
on his old enemy.
The device succeeded to perfection. War was
begun without any previous declaration; prisoners
were soon brought in—not only men, but women
and children. The first were coupled together with
heavy slave-sticks, which were riveted to their
necks; the latter were attached to each other with
ropes; and thus Yoosoof, in a few days, was enabled
to proceed on his journey with a goodly drove of
" black cattle" behind him.
This occurred not far from Lake Nyassa, which
he intended should be his head-quarters for a time,
while his men, under a new leader whom he ex-
pected to meet there, should push their victorious
arms farther into the interior.
On reaching the shores of the noble lake, he
found several birds of the same feather with him-
self-Arabs-engaged in the same trade. He also
found his old friend and trusty ally, Marizano.
This gratified him much, for he was at once enabled
to hand over the charge of the expedition to his
lieutenant, and send him forth on his mission.


## p. 315 (#339) ############################################

315
That same evening-a lovely and comparatively
cool one-Yoosoof and the half-caste sauntered on
the margin of the lake, listening to the sweet melody
of the free and happy birds, and watching the de-
barkation, from a large boat, of a band of miserable
slaves who had been captured or purchased on the
other side.
"Now, Marizano," said Yoosoof, addressing the
half-caste in his native tongue, "I do not intend to
cumber you with cloth or beads on this expedition.
I have already spent a good deal in the purchase of
slaves, who are now in my barracoon, and I think it
will be both cheaper and easier to make up the rest
of the gang by means of powder and lead."
" It is lighter to carry, and more effectual," re-
marked Marizano, with a nod of approval.
" True," returned Yoosoof, " and quicker. Will a
hundred men and guns suffice ?"
" Eighty are enough to conquer any of the bow
and spear tribes of this region," replied the half-
caste carelessly.
"Good !" continued Yoosoof. " Then you shall
start to-morrow. The tribes beyond this lake are
not yet afraid of us—thanks to the mad English-
man, Livingstone, who has opened up the country
and spread the information that white men are the
friends of the black, and hate slavery. You may

try to pass yourself off as a white man, though your
face is not so white as might be desired; however,
you can comfort yourself with the knowledge that
it is whiter than your heart !"
The Arab smiled and glanced at his lieutenant.
Marizano smiled, bowed in acknowledgment of the
compliment, and replied that he believed himself to
be second to no one except his employer in that
respect.
"Well, then," continued Yoosoof, " you must fol-
low up the discoveries of this Englishman; give out
that you are his friend, and have come there for the
same purposes; and, when you have put them quite
at their ease, commence a brisk trade with them—
for which purpose you may take with you just
enough of cloth and beads to enable you to carry
out the deception. For the rest, I need not instruct;
you know what to do as well as I."
Marizano approved heartily of this plan, and
assured his chief that his views should be carried
out to his entire satisfaction.
" But there is still another point," said Yoosoof,
"on which I have to talk. It appears that there are
some white men who have been taken prisoners by
one of the interior tribes—I know not which for
that the Portuguese slave-traders had followed closely in the footsteps
of his previous discoveries, and passed themselves off as his friends,
by which means they were successful in gaining the confidence of the
natives whom they afterwards treacherously murdered or enslaved.

the finding of whom the British consul at Zanzibar
has offered me five hundred dollars. If you can
obtain information about these men it will be well.
If you can find and rescue them it will be still
better, and you shall have a liberal share of the
reward."
While the Arab was speaking, the half-caste's
visage betrayed a slight degree of surprise.
" White men !" he said, pulling up his sleeve
and showing a gun-shot wound in his arm which
appeared to be not very old. "A white man in-
flicted that not long ago, and not very far from the
spot on which we stand. I had vowed to take the
life of that white man if we should ever chance to
meet, but if it is worth five hundred dollars I may
be tempted to spare it !"
He laughed lightly as he spoke, and then added,
with a thoughtful look, —
"But I don't see how these men—there were two
of them, if not 'more-can be prisoners, because,
when I came across them, they were well armed,
well supplied, and well attended, else, you may be
sure, they had not given me this wound and freed
my slaves. But the scoundrels who were with me
at the time were cowards."
" You are right," said Yoosoof. "The white men
you met I heard of at Zanzibar. They cannot be the
prisoners we are asked to search for. They have not

yet been long enough away, I should think, to have
come by any mischance, and the white men who are
said to be lost have been talked about in Zanzibar
for a long time. However, make diligent inquiries,
because the promise is, that the five hundred dollars
shall be ours if we rescue any white man, no matter
who he may chance to be. And now I shall show
you the cattle I have obtained on the way up."
The barracoon, to which the Arab led his lieute-
nant, was a space enclosed by a strong and high
stockade, in which slaves were kept under guard
until a sufficient number should be secured to form
a gang, wherewith to start for the coast. At the
entrance stood a savage-looking Portuguese half-
caste armed with a gun. Inside there was an
assortment of Yoosoof's Black Ivory. It was in
comparatively good condition at that time, not hav-
ing travelled far, and, as it was necessary to keep it
up to a point of strength sufficient to enable it to
reach the coast, it was pretty well fed except in the
case of a few rebellious articles. There were, how-
ever, specimens of damaged goods even there. Se-
veral of the orphans, who had become Yoosoof's
property, although sprightly enough when first pur-
chased, had not stood even the short journey to the
lake so well as might have been expected. They
had fallen off in flesh to such an extent, that Yoosoof
was induced to remark to Marizano, as they stood

319
surveying them, that he feared they would never
reach the coast alive.
" That one, now," he said, pointing to a little boy
who was tightly wedged in the midst of the group
of slaves, and sat on the ground with his face resting
on his knees, " is the most troublesome piece of
goods I have had to do with since I began business ;
and it seems to me that I am going to lose him
after all."
"What's the matter with him ?" asked the half-
caste.
"Nothing particular, only he is a delicate boy.
At first I refused him, but he is so well made,
though delicate, and such a good-looking child,
and so spirited, that I decided to take him ; but
he turns out to be too spirited. Nothing that
I can do will tame him,-oh, that won't do it,"
said Yoosoof, observing that Marizano raised the
switch he carried in his hand with a significant
action; "I have beaten him till there is scarcely
a sound inch of skin on his whole body, but it's
of no use. Ho! stand up," called Yoosoof, letting
the lash of his whip fall lightly on the boy's
shoulders.
There was, however, no response; the Arab
therefore repeated the order, and laid the lash across
the child's bare back with a degree of force that
would have caused the stoutest man to wince ; still

the boy did not move. Somewhat surprised, Yoo-
soof pushed his way towards him, seized him by
the hair and threw back his head.
The Arab left him immediately and remarked in
a quiet tone that he should have no more trouble
with him—he was dead !
"What's the matter with that fellow?" asked Mari-
zano, pointing to a man who was employed in con-
stantly rolling up a bit of wet clay and applying it
to his left eye.
"Ah, he's another of these unmanageable fellows,"
replied Yoosoof. "I have been trying to tame him
by starvation. The other morning he fell on his
knees before the man who guards the barracoon
and entreated him to give him food. The guard
is a rough fellow, and had been put out of
temper lately by a good many of the slaves. In-
stead of giving him food he gave him a blow in
the eye which burst the ball of it, and of course
has rendered him worthless; but he won't trouble
us long."
In another place a woman crouched on the
ground, having something wrapped in leaves which
she pressed to her dried breast. It was the body
of a child to which she had recently given birth in
that place of woe.
Leaving his cringing and terrified goods to the
guardian of the barracoon, the Arab returned to his

tent beside the beautiful lake, and there, while en-
joying the aroma of flowers and the cool breeze, and
the genial sunshine, and the pleasant influences
which God has scattered with bountiful hand over
that luxuriant portion of the earth, calmly concerted
with Marizano the best method by which he could
bring inconceivable misery on thousands of its
wretched inhabitants.

CHAPTER XIX.
TELLS OF MISFORTUNES THAT BEFELL OUR WANDERERS ; OF
FAMILIAR TOYS UNDER NEW ASPECTS, ETC.
WHEN Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer
were stopped in their journey, as related in a for-
mer chapter, by the sudden illness of the bold sea-
man, an event was impending over them which
effectually overturned their plans. This was the
sudden descent of a band of armed natives who had
been recently driven from their homes by a slaving
party. The slavers had taken them by surprise
during the night, set their huts on fire, captured
their women and children, and slaughtered all the
men, excepting those who sought and found safety
in flight. It was those who had thus escaped that
chanced to come upon the camp of our travellers one
evening about sunset.
Disco was recovering from his attack of fever at the
time, though still weak. Harold was sitting by his
couch of leaves in the hut which had been erected
for him on the first day of the illness. Jumbo was
cutting up a piece of flesh for supper, and Antonio

323
was putting the kettle on the fire. The rest of the
party were away in the woods hunting.
No guard was kept; consequently the savages
came down on them like a thunderbolt, and found
them quite unprepared to resist, even if resistance
had been of any use.
At first their captors, bitterly infuriated by their
recent losses, proposed to kill their prisoners, with-
out delay, by means of the most excruciating tor-
tures that they could invent, but from some un-
known cause, changed their minds; coupled Harold
and Disco together by means of two slave-sticks;
tied Antonio and Jumbo with ropes, and drove them
away.
So suddenly was the thing done, and so effectually
that Disco was far from the camp before he could
realize that what had occurred was a fact, and not
one of the wild feverish dreams that had beset him
during his illness.
The natives would not listen to the earnest ex-
planation of Antonio that Harold and Disco were
Englishmen, and haters of slavery. They scowled
as they replied that the same had been said by the
slavers who had attacked their village; from which
remark it would seem that Yoosoof was not quite
the originator of that device to throw the natives
off their guard. The Portuguese of Tete on the
Zambesi had also thought of and acted on it !


## p. 324 (#348) ############################################

324
BLACK IVORY.
Fortunately it was, as we have said, near sunset
when the capture was made, and before it became
quite dark the band encamped, else must poor Disco
have succumbed to weakness and fatigue. The
very desperation of his circumstances, however,
seemed to revive his strength, for next morning he
resumed his journey with some hope of being able
to hold out. The continued protestations and
assurances of Antonio, also, had the effect of in-
ducing their captors to remove the heavy slave-
sticks from the necks of Harold and Disco, though
they did not unbind their wrists. Thus were they
led further into the country, they knew not whither,
for several days and nights, and at last reached a
large village where they were all thrust into a hut
and left to their meditations, while their captors
went to palaver with the chief man of the place.
This chief proved to be a further-sighted man
than the men of the tribe who had captured the
Englishmen. His name was Yambo. He had
heard of Dr. Livingstone, and had met with men of
other tribes who had seen and conversed with the
great traveller. Thus, being of a thoughtful and
inquiring disposition, he had come to understand
enough of the good white man's sentiments to guard
him from being imposed on by pretended Christians.
Yambo's name signified "how are you?" and
was probably bestowed on him because of a strongly

325
benevolent tendency to greet friend and stranger
alike with a hearty "how d'ee do?" sort of expres-
sion of face and tone of voice.
He was a tall grave man, with a commanding
firm look, and, withal, a dash of child-like humour
and simplicity. On hearing his visitors' remarks
about their captives, he at once paid them a visit,
and a few leading questions put to Harold through
Antonio convinced him that the prisoners were
true men. He therefore returned to his black
visitors, told them that he had perfect confidence
in the good faith of the white men, and said that
he meant to take charge of them. He then en-
tertained his black brothers hospitably, gave them
a few presents, and sent them on their way. This
done he returned to his guests and told them that
they were free, that their captors were gone, and
that they might go where they pleased, but that
it would gratify him much if they would consent
to spend some time hunting with him in the
neighbourhood of his village.
"Now," said Disco, after Yambo left them, " this
is wot I call the most uncommon fix that ever wos
got into by man since Adam an' Eve began house-
keepin' in the garden of Eden."
"I'm not quite sure," replied Harold, with a
rueful look, "that it is absolutely the worst fix, but it
is bad enough. The worst of it is that this Yambo

has let these rascals off with all our fire-arms and
camp equipage, so that we are absolutely helpless-
might as well be prisoners, for we can't quit this
village in such circumstances."
"Wot's wuss than that to my mind, sir, is, that
here we are at sea, in the heart of Afriky, without
chart, quadrant, compass, or rudder, an' no more idea
of our whereabouts than one o' them spider monkeys
that grins among the trees. Hows'ever, we're in
luck to fall into the hands of a friendly chief, so,
like these same monkeys, we must grin an' bear it;
only I can't help feelin' a bit cast down at the loss
of our messmates. I fear there's no chance of their
findin' us."
"Not the least chance in the world, I should
say," returned Harold. "They could not guess in
which direction we had gone, and unless they had hit
on the right road at first, every step they took after-
wards would only widen the distance between us."
"It's lucky I was beginnin' to mend before we
was catched," said Disco, feeling the muscles of his
legs; " true, I ain't much to boast of yet, but I'm
improvin'."
"That is more than I can say for myself," returned
Harold, with a sigh, as he passed his hand across his
forehead; "I feel as if this last push through the
woods in the hot sun, and the weight of that terrible
slave-stick had been almost too much for me."

327
Disco looked earnestly and anxiously into the
face of his friend.
"Wot," asked he," does you feel ?"
"I can scarcely tell," replied Harold, with a faint
smile. "Oh, I suppose I'm a little knocked up,
that's all. A night's rest will put me all right."
"So I thought myself, but I wos wrong," said
Disco. "Let's hear wot your feelin's is, sir;
I'm as good as any doctor now, I am, in regard
to symptoms."
"Well, I feel a sort of all-overishness, a kind of
lassitude and sleepiness, with a slight headache, and
a dull pain which appears to be creeping up my
spine."
"You're in for it, sir," said Disco. "It's lucky
you have always carried the physic in your pockets,
'cause you 'll need it, an' it's lucky, too, that I am
here and well enough to return tit for tat and nurse
you, 'cause you 'll have that 'ere pain in your spine
creep up your back and round your ribs till it lays
hold of yer shoulders, where it'll stick as if it had
made up its mind to stay there for ever an' a day.
Arter that you'll get cold an' shivering like ice-
oh! doesn't I know it well—an' then hot as fire,
with heavy head, an' swiming eyes, an' twisted sight,
an' confusion of_"
"Hold ! hold !" cried Harold, laughing, " if you go
on in that way I shall have more than my fair share

that's my din first this songe a couch
of it! Pray stop, and leave me a little to find out
for myself."
"Well, sir, take a purge, and turn in at once-
that's my advice. I'll dose you with quinine to-
morrow mornin', first thing," said Disco, rising and
proceeding forthwith to arrange a couch in a corner
of the hut, which Yambo had assigned them."
Harold knew well enough that his follower was
right. He took his advice without delay, and next
morning found himself little better than a child,
both physically and mentally, for the disease not
only prostrated his great strength—as it had that of
his equally robust companion—but, at a certain
stage, induced delirium, during which he talked
the most ineffable nonsense that his tongue could
pronounce, or his brain conceive.
Poor Disco, who, of course, had been unable to
appreciate the extent of his own delirious condition,
began to fear that his leader's mind was gone for
ever, and Jumbo was so depressed by the unutterably
solemn expression of the mariner's once jovial
countenance, that he did not once show his teeth
for a whole week, save when engaged with meals.
As for Antonio, his nature not being very sym-
pathetic, and his health being good, he rather enjoyed
the quiet life and good living which characterized the
native village, and secretly hoped that Harold might
remain on the sick-list for a considerable time to come.

How long this state of affairs lasted we cannot tell,
for both Harold and Disco lost the correct record of
time during their respective illnesses.
Up to that period they had remembered the days
of the week, in consequence of their habit of
refraining from going out to hunt on Sundays,
except when a dearth of meat in the larder rendered
hunting a necessity. Upon these Sundays Harold's
conscience sometimes reproached him for having
set out on his journey into Africa without a Bible.
He whispered, to himself at first and afterwards
suggested to Disco, the excuse that his Bible had
been lost in the wreck of his father's vessel, and
that, perhaps, there were no Bibles to be purchased
in Zanzibar, but his conscience was a troublesome
one, and refused to tolerate such bad reasoning, re-
minding him, reproachfully, that he had made no
effort whatever to obtain a Bible at Zanzibar.
As time had passed, and some of the horrors of
the slave-trade had been brought under his notice,
many of the words of Scripture leaped to his re-
membrance, and the regret that he had not carried a
copy with him increased. That touch of thought-
lessness, so natural to the young and healthy-to
whom life has so far been only a garden of roses-
was utterly routed by the stern and dreadful realities
which had been recently enacted around him, and
just in proportion as he was impressed with the lies,

tyranny, cruelty, and falsehood of man, so did his
thoughtful regard for the truth and the love of God
increase, especially those truths that were most
directly opposed to the traffic in human flesh, such
as—"love your enemies," "seek peace with all men,"
" be kindly affectioned one to another," "whatsoever
ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even
so to them." An absolute infidel, he thought, could
not fail to perceive that a most blessed change
would come over the face of Africa if such prin-
ciples prevailed among its inhabitants even in an
extremely moderate degree.
But, to return, the unfortunate travellers were
now "at sea" altogether in regard to the Sabbath as
well as the day of the month. Indeed their minds
were not very clear as to the month itself !
"Hows'ever," said Disco, when this subject after-
wards came to be discussed, " it don't matter much.
Wot is it that the Scriptur says,— Six days shalt
thou labour an' do all that thou hast to do, but the
seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.
In it thou shalt do no work.' I wos used always to
stick at that pint w'en my poor mother was a-teachin'
of me. Never got past it. But it's enough for pre-
sent use anyhow, for the orders is, work six days an'
don't work the seventh. Werry good, we'll begin
to-day an' call it Monday; we'll work for six days,
an' w'en the seventh day comes we'll call it Sunday.

If it ain't the right day, we can't help it; moreover,
wot's the odds? It's the seventh day, so that to us
it'll be the Sabbath."
But we anticipate. Harold was still—at the be-
ginning of this digression in the delirium of fever,
though there were symptoms of improvement about
him.
One afternoon one of these symptoms was strongly
manifested in a long, profound slumber. While he
slept, Disco sat on a low stool beside him, busily
engaged with a clasp-knife on some species of manu-
facture, the nature of which was not apparent at a
glance.
His admirer, Jumbo, was seated on a stool
opposite, gazing at him: open-mouthed, with a
countenance that reflected every passing feeling of
his dusky bosom.
Both men were so deeply absorbed in their occu-
pation-Disco in his manufacture, and Jumbo in
staring at Disco—that they failed for a considerable
time to observe that Harold had wakened suddenly,
though quietly, and was gazing at them with a look
of lazy, easy-going surprise.
The mariner kept up a running commentary on
his work, addressed to Jumbo indeed, but in a quiet
interjectional manner that seemed to imply that he
was merely soliloquizing, and did not want or ex-
pect a reply.

"It's the most 'stror'nary notion, Jumbo, between
you and me and the post, that I ever did see. Now,
then, this here bullet-head wants a pair oeyes an'
a nose on it; the mouth 'll do, but it's the mouth as
is most troublesome, for you niggers have got such
wappin' muzzles—it's quite a caution, as the Yankees
say"—a pause)—"on the whole, however, the nose
is very difficult to manage on a flat surface, 'cause
w'y?—if I leaves it quite flat, it don't look like a
nose, an' if I carves it out ever so little, it's too
prominent for a nigger nose. There, ain't that a
good head, Jumbo ?"
Thus directly appealed to, Jumbo nodded his own
head violently, and showed his magnificent teeth
from ear to ear, gums included.
Disco laid down the flat piece of board which he
had carved into the form of a human head, and took
up another piece, which was rudely blocked out into
the form of a human leg—both leg and head being
as large as life.
"Now this limb, Jumbo," continued Disco, slowly,
as he whittled away with the clasp-knife vigorously,
" is much more troublesome than I would have ex-
pected; for you niggers have got such abominably
ill-shaped legs below the knee. There's such an
unnat'ral bend for'ard o' the shin-bone, an' such a
rediklous sticking out o' the heel astarn, d'ee see,
that a feller with white-man notions has to make a

study of it if he sets up for a artist; in course, if he
don't set up for a artist, any sort o'shape 'll do, for
it don't affect the jumpin'. Ha! there they go," he
exclaimed, with a humorous smile at a hearty shout
of laughter which was heard just outside the hut,
"enjoyin' the old 'un; but it's nothin' to wot the
noo'un 'll be w'en it's finished."
At this exhibition of amusement on the counte-
nance of his friend, Jumbo threw back his head
and again showed not only his teeth and gums
but the entire inside of his mouth, and chuckled
softly from the region of his breast-bone.
"I'm dreaming, of course," thought Harold, and
shut his eyes.
Poor fellow ! he was very weak, and the mere act
of shutting his eyes induced a half-slumber. He
awoke again in a few minutes, and re-opening his
eyes, beheld the two men still sitting and occupied
as before.
"It is a wonderfully pertinacious dream," thought
Harold. "I'll try to dissipate it."
Thinking thus, he called out aloud, -
" I say, Disco !"
" Hallo! that's uncommon like the old tones,"
exclaimed the seaman, dropping his knife and the
leg of wood as he looked anxiously at his friend.
" What old tones ?" asked Harold..
" The tones of your voice," said Disco.

" Have they changed so much of late ?" inquired
Harold in surprise.
" Have they? I should think they have, just.
W'y, you haven't spoke like that, sir, for—but,'
surely—are you better, or is this on'y another dodge
o'yer madness ?" asked Disco with a troubled look.
"Ah! I suppose I've been delirious, have I ?"
said Harold with a faint smile.
To this Disco replied that he had not only been
delirious, but stark staring mad, and expressed a
very earnest hope that, now he had got his senses
hauled taut again, he'd belay them an' make all
fast, for if he didn't, it was his, Disco's opinion, that
another breeze o' the same kind would blow 'em all
to ribbons.
"Moreover," continued Disco, firmly, "you're not
to talk. I once nursed a messmate through a fever,
an' I remember that the doctor wos werry partikler
w'en he began to come round, in orderin' him to
hold his tongue an' keep quiet."
" You are right, Disco. I will keep quiet, but
you must first tell me what you are about, for it has
roused my curiosity, and I can't rest till I know."
" Well, sir, I 'll tell you, but don't go for to make
no obsarvations on it. Just keep your mouth shut
an' yer ears open, an' I'll do all the jawin'. Well,
you must know, soon after you wos took bad, I

the watch time about, for Antony isn't able to hold
a boy, much less you w'en you gits obstropolous-
Well, sir, I had took a sort o' fancy for Yambo's
youngest boy, for he's a fine, brave little shaver, he
is, an' I thought I'd make him some sort o' toy, an'
it struck me that the thing as u'd please him most
'ud be a jumpin'-jack, so I set to an' made him one
about a futt high.
"You never see such a face o' joy as that youngster

hands, an' ran home to show it to his mother. Well,

an English boy, an' says he to Tony, says he,

surprised at this, an' went right off to see about it,

grinnin' an' sniggerin' like a blue-faced baboon in a
passion—his wife likewise standin' by holdin' her
sides wi' laughin'. Well, sir, the moment I goes in,
up gits the chief an' shouts for Tony, an' tells him
to tell me that I must make him a jumpin'-jack !
In course I says I'd do it with all the pleasure in
life ; and he says that I must make it full size, as
big as his-self! I opened my eyes at this, but he

said he must have a thing that was fit for a man-
a chief-so there was nothin' for it but to set to
work. An' it worn't difficult to manage neither, for
they supplied me with slabs o'timber an inch thick,
an' I soon blocked out the body an' limbs with a
hatchet, an' polished 'em off with my knife, and then
put 'em together. W'en the big jack wos all right
Yambo took it away, for he'd watched me all the
time I wos at it, an' fixed it up to the branch of a
tree an' set to work.
"I never, no I never, did," continued Disco, slap-
ping his right thigh, while Jumbo grinned in
sympathy, "see sítch a big baby as Yambo became
w'en he got that monstrous jumpin'-jack into
action with his courtiers all round him, their faces
blazin' with surprise, or conwulsed wi' laughter.
The chief his-self was too hard at work to laugh
much. He could only glare an' grin, for, big an'
strong though he is, the jack wos so awful heavy
that it took all his weight an' muscle haulin' on the
rope which okipied the place o' the string that
we're used to.
" Haul away, my hearty, thought I, w'en I seed
him heavin', blowin', an' swettin' at the jack's hal-
yards, you 'll not break that rope in a hurry.'
"But I was wrong, sir, for, although the halyards
held on all right, I had not calkilated on such wiolent
action at the joints. All of a sudden off comes a

leg at the knee. It was goin' the up'ard kick at
the time, an' went up like a rocket, slap through a
troop o monkeys that was lookin' on aloft, which it
scattered like foam in a gale. Yambo didn't seem
to care a pinch o'snuff. His blood was up. The
sweat was runnin' off him like rain. "Hi ! cries he,
givin' another most awful tug. But it wasn't high
that time, for the other leg came off at the hip-jint
on the down kick, an' went straight into the buzzum
of a black warrior an' floored him wuss than he ever
wos floored since he took to fightin'. Yambo didn't
care for that either. He gave another haul with all
his might which proved too much for jack without
his legs, for it threw his arms out with such force
that they jammed hard an' fast as if the poor critter
howlin' for mercy!
"Yambo looked awful blank at this. Then he
turned sharp round an' looked at me for all the
world as if he meant to say 'wot d'ee mean by that?
eh !'
"He shouldn't ought to lick into him like that,
says I to Tony, 'the figure ain't made to be druv
by a six-horse power steam-engine! But tell him
I'll fix it up with jints that'll stand pullin' by an
elephant, and I'll make him another jack to the full
as big as that one an' twice as strong.'
"This," added Disco in conclusion, taking up
the head on which he had been engaged, "is the noo

jack. The old un's outside working away at this
moment like a win'-mill. Listen; don't 'ee hear
'em ?"
Harold listened and found no difficulty in hearing
them, for peals of laughter and shrieks of delight
burst forth every few minutes, apparently from a
vast crowd outside the hut.
"I do believe," said Disco, rising and going
towards the door of the hut, " that you can see 'em
from where you lay."
He drew aside the skin doorway as he spoke, and
there, sure enough, was the gigantic jumping-jack
hanging from the limb of a tree, clearly defined
against the sky, and galvanically kicking about its
vast limbs, with Yambo pulling fiercely at the tail,
and the entire tribe looking on steeped in ecstasy
and admiration.
It may easily be believed that the sight of this,
coupled with Disco's narrative, was almost too much
for Harold's nerves, and for some time he exhibited,
to Disco's horror, a tendency to repeat some antics
which would have been much more appropriate to
the jumping-jack, but after a warm drink ad-
ministered by his faithful though rough nurse, he
became composed, and finally dropped into a plea-
sant sleep, which was not broken till late the
following morning.

he had fought for many days was conquered, and

the corner, and had begun to regain some of his
wonted health and vigour.

CHAPTER XX.
HAROLD APPEARS IN A NEW CHARACTER, AND TWO OLD CHARACTERS
RE-APPEAR TO HAROLD.
1
The mind of Yambo was a strange compound-a
curious mixture of gravity and rollicking joviality;
at one time displaying a phase of intense solemnity;
at another exhibiting quiet pleasantry and humour;
but earnestness was the prevailing trait of his
character. Whether indulging his passionate fond-
ness for the jumping-jack, or engaged in guiding the
deliberations of his counsellors, the earnest chief
was equally devoted to the work in hand. Being a
savage-and, consequently, led entirely by feeling,
which is perhaps the chief characteristic of savage,
as distinguished from civilized, man, he hated his
enemies with exceeding bitterness, and loved his
friends with all his heart.
Yambo was very tender to Harold during his
illness, and the latter felt corresponding gratitude,
so that there sprang up between the two a closer
friendship than one could have supposed to be
possible, considering that they were so different

341
from each other, mentally, physically, and socially,
and that their only mode of exchanging ideas was
through the medium of a very incompetent inter-
preter.
Among other things Harold discovered that his
friend the chief was extremely fond of anecdotes and
stories. He, therefore, while in a convalescent
state and unable for much physical exercise, amused
himself and spent much of his time in narrating to
him the adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Yambo's
appetite for mental food increased, and when
Crusoe's tale was finished he eagerly demanded
more. Some of his warriors also came to hear, and
at last the hut was unable to contain the audiences
that wished to enter. Harold, therefore, removed to
an open space under a banyan-tree, and there daily,
for several hours, related all the tales and narratives
with which he was acquainted to the hundreds of
open-eyed and open-mouthed negroes who squatted
around him.
At first he selected such tales as he thought
would be likely to amuse, but these being soon ex-
hausted, he told them about anything that chanced
to recur to his memory. Then, finding that their
power to swallow the marvellous was somewhat
crocodilish, he gave them Jack the Giant-killer, and
Jack of Beanstalk notoriety, and Tom Thumb,
Cinderella, etc., until his entire nursery stock was

exhausted, after which he fell back on his inventive
powers; but the labour of this last effort proving
very considerable, and the results not being ade-
quately great, he took to history, and told them
stories about William Tell, and Wallace, and Bruce,
and the Puritans of England, and the Scottish
Covenanters, and the discoveries of Columbus, until
the eyes and mouths of his black auditors were held
so constantly and widely on the stretch, that Disco
began to fear they would become gradually incap-
able of being shut, and he entertained a fear that
poor Antonio's tongue would, ere long, be dried-up
at the roots.
At last a thought occurred to our hero, which
he promulgated to Disco, one morning as they
were seated at breakfast on the floor of their
hut.
"It seems to me, Disco," he said, after a pro-
longed silence, during which they had been busily
engaged with their knives and wooden spoons, " that
illness must be sent, sometimes, to teach men that
they give too little of their thoughts to the future
world."
"Werry true, sir," replied Disco, in that quiet
matter-of-course tone with which men generally re-
ceive axiomatic verities; "we is raither given to be
swallered up with this world, which ain't surprisin'
neither, seein' that we've bin putt into it, and are

343
surrounded by it, mixed up with it, steeped in it, so
to speak, an' can't werry well help ourselves.".
"That last is just the point I'm not quite so sure
about," rejoined Harold. "Since I've been lying
ill here, I have thought a good deal about forget-
ting to bring a Bible with me, and about the mean-
ing of the term Christian, which name I bear; and
yet I can't, when I look honestly at it, see that I
do much to deserve the name."
"Well, I don't quite see that, sir," said Disco,
with an argumentative curl of his right eyebrow;
"you doesn't swear, or drink, or steal, or commit
murder, an' a many other things o'that sort. Ain't
that the result o' your being a Christian."
"It may be so, Disco, but that is only what may
be styled the don't side of the question. What
troubles me is, that I don't see much on the do side
of it."
"You says your prayers, sir, don't you ?" asked
Disco, with the air of a man who had put a telling
question.
"Well, yes," replied Harold; "but what troubles
me is that while in my creed I profess to think the
salvation of souls is of such vital importance, in my
practice I seem to say that it is of no importance at
all, for here have I been, for many weeks, amongst
these black fellows, and have never so much as
mentioned the name of our Saviour to them, al-

314

though I have been telling them no end of stories of
all kinds, both true and fanciful."
"There's something in that, sir," admitted Disco.
Harold also thought there was so much in it that he
gave the subject a great deal of earnest considera-
tion, and finally resolved to begin to tell the negroes
Bible stories. He was thus gradually led to tell
them that "old, old story" of God the Saviour's
life and death, and love for man, which he found
interested, affected, and influenced the savages far
more powerfully than any of the tales, whether true
or fanciful, with which he had previously enter-
tained them. While doing this a new spirit seemed
to actuate himself, and to influence his whole being.
While Harold was thus led, almost unconsciously,
to become'a sower of the blessed seed of God's Word,
Marizano vas working his way through the country,
setting forth, in the most extreme manner, the ulti-
mate results of man's sinful nature, and the devil's
lies.
One of his first deeds was to visit a village
which was beautifully situated on the banks of a
small but deep river. In order to avoid alarming
the inhabitants, he approached it with only about
thirty of his men, twenty of whom were armed.
Arrived at the outskirts, he halted his armed men,
and advanced with the other ten, calling out cheer-
fully, "We have things for sale ! have you any-

345
thing to sell ?" The chief and his warriors, armed
with their bows and arrows and shields, met him,
and forbade him to pass within the hedge that en-
circled the village, but told him to sit down under a
tree outside. A mat of split reeds was placed for
Marizano to sit on; and when he had explained to
the chief that the object of his visit was to trade
with him for ivory—in proof of which he pointed
to the bales which his men carried, he was well
received, and a great clapping of hands ensued.
Presents were then exchanged, and more clapping
of hands took place, for this was considered the
appropriate ceremony. The chief and his warriors
on sitting down before Marizano and his men
clapped their hands together, and continued slap-
ping on their thighs while handing their presents,
or when receiving those of their visitats. It was
the African "thank you." To have omitted it
would have been considered very bad manners.
Soon a brisk trade was commenced, in which the
entire community became ere long deeply and
eagerly absorbed.
Meanwhile Marizano's armed men were allowed
to come forward. The women prepared food for the
strangers; and after they had eaten and drunk of
the native beer heartily, Marizano asked the chief
if he had ever seen fire-arms used.
" Yes," replied the chief, "but only once at a
down befom the chief and
clapped

great distance off. It is told to me that your guns
kill very far off—much further than our bows. Is
that so ?"
"It is true," replied Marizano, who was very
merry by this time under the influence of the beer,
as, indeed, were also his men and their entertainers.
"Would you like to see what our guns can do ?"
asked the half-caste. "If you will permit me, I
shall let you hear and see them in use ?"
The unsuspecting chief at once gave his consent.
His visitors rose; Marizano gave the word; a
volley was poured forth which instantly killed the
chief and twenty of his men. The survivors fled
in horror. The young women and children were
seized; the village was sacked—which means that
the old and useless members of the community were
murdered in cold blood, and the place was set on
fire—and Marizano marched away with his band of
captives considerably augmented, leaving a scene of
death and horrible desolation behind him.
Thus did that villain walk through the land with
fire and sword procuring slaves for the supply of the
"domestic institution " of the Sultan of Zanzibar.
By degrees the murderer's drove of black "cattle"
increased to such an extent that when he approached
the neighbourhood of the village in which Harold
and Disco sojourned, he began to think that he had

obtained about as many as he could conveniently
manage, and meditated turning his face eastward,
little dreaming how near he was to a thousand
dollars' worth of property in the shape of ransom
for two white meni
He was on the point of turning back and missing
this when he chanced to fall in with a villager who
was out hunting, and who, after a hot chase, was
captured. This man was made much of, and pre-
sented with some yards of cloth as well as a few
beads, at the same time being assured that he had
nothing to fear; that the party was merely a slave-
trading one; that the number of slaves required had
been made up, but that a few more would be purchased
if the chief of his village had any to dispose of.
On learning from the man that his village was a
large one, fully two days' march from the spot where
he stood, and filled with armed men, Marizano came
to the conclusion that it would not be worth his
while to proceed thither, and was about to order
his informant to be added to his gang with a slave-
stick round his neck, when he suddenly bethought
him of inquiring as to whether any white men had
been seen in these parts. As he had often made the
same inquiry before without obtaining any satisfac-
tory answer, it was with great surprise that he now
heard from his captive of two white men being in the
very village about which he had been conversing.

At once he changed his plan, resumed his march,
and, a couple of days afterwards, presented himself
before the astonished eyes of Harold Seadrift and
Disco Lillihammer, while they were taking a walk
about a mile from the village.
Disco recognised the slave-trader at once, and,
from the troubled as well as surprised look of Mari-
zano, it was pretty evident that he remembered the
countenance of Disco.
When the recollection of Marizano's cruelty at
the time of their first meeting flashed upon him,
Disco felt an almost irresistible desire to rush upon
and strangle the Portuguese, but the calm deport-
ment of that wily man, and the peaceful manner in
which he had approached, partly disarmed his wrath.
He could not, however, quite restrain his tongue.
"Ha!" said he, "you are the blackguard that we
met and pretty nigh shot when we first came to
these parts, eh? Pity we missed you, you black-
hearted villain !"
As Marizano did not understand English, these
complimentary remarks were lost on him. He
seemed, however, to comprehend the drift of them,
for he returned Disco's frown with a stare of
defiance.
"Whatever he was, or whatever he is," interposed
Harold, "we must restrain ourselves just now, Disco,
because we cannot punish him as he deserves, how-

ever much we may wish to, and he seems to have
armed men enough to put us and our entertainers
completely in his power. Keep quiet while I speak
to him."
Jumbo and Antonio, armed with bows and ar-
rows,—for they were in search of small game where-
with to supply the pot,-came up, looking very much
surprised, and the latter a good deal frightened.
"Ask him, Antonio," said Harold, "what is his
object in visiting this part of the country."
"To procure slaves," said Marizano, curtly.
"I thought so," returned Harold; "but he will find
that the men of this tribe are not easily overcome."
"I do not wish to overcome them," said the half-
caste. "I have procured enough of slaves, as you
see" (pointing to the gang which was halted some
hundred yards or so in rear of his armed men),
"but I heard that you were prisoners here, and I
have come to prove to you that even a slave-trader
can return good for evil. You did this," he said,
looking at Disco, and pointing to his old wound in
the arm; "I now come to deliver you from slavery."
Having suppressed part of the truth, and supple-
mented the rest of it with this magnificent lie,
Marizano endeavoured to look magnanimous.
"I don't believe a word of it," said Disco, de-
cidedly.
"I incline to doubt it too," said Harold; "but he

may have some good reason of his own for his
friendly professions towards us. In any case we
have no resource left but to assume that he speaks
the truth."
Turning to Marizano, he said :-
"We are not prisoners here. We are guests of
the chief of this village."
"In that case," replied the half-caste, "I can
return to the coast without you."
As he said this a large band of the villagers,
having discovered that strangers had arrived, drew
near. Marizano at once advanced, making peaceful
demonstrations, and, after the requisite amount of
clapping of hands on both sides, stated the object
for which he had come. He made no attempt to
conceal the fact that he was a slave-trader, but said
that, having purchased enough of slaves, he had
visited their village because of certain rumours to
the effect that some white men had been lost in
these regions, and could not find their way back to
the coast. He was anxious, he said, to help these
white men to do so, but, finding that the white men
then at the village were not the men he was in
search of, and did not want to go to the coast, he
would just stay long enough with the chief to ex-
chauge compliments, and then depart.
All this was translated to the white men in ques-
tion by their faithful ally Antonio, and when they

351
retired to consult as to what should be done, they
looked at each other with half amused and half
perplexed expressions of countenance.
"Werry odd," said Disco, "how contrairy things
turns up at times !"
"Very odd indeed," assented Harold, laughing.
" It is quite true that we are, in one sense, lost, and
utterly unable to undertake a journey through this
country without men, means, or arms; and nothing
could be more fortunate than that we should have
the chance thus suddenly thrown in our way of
travelling under the escort of a band of armed men;
nevertheless, I cannot bear the idea of travelling
with or being indebted to a slave-trader and a
scoundrel like Marizano."
"That's w'ere it is, sir," said Disco with emphasis,
" I could stand anything a'most but that."
"And yet," pursued Harold, "it is our only
chance. I see quite well that we may remain
for years here without again having such an
opportunity or such an escort thrown in our
way."
" There's no help for it, I fear," said Disco. "We
must take it like a dose o nasty physic-hold our
nobs, shut our daylights, an' down with it. The
only thing I ain't sure of is your ability to travel
You ain't strong yet."
"Oh, I'm strong enough now, or very nearly so,

and getting stronger every day. Well, then, I sup-
pose it's settled that we go ?"
"Humph! I'm agreeable, an' the whole business
werry disagreeable," said Disco, making a wry face.
Marizano was much pleased when the decision of
the white men was made known to him, and the
native chief was naturally much distressed, for, not
only was he about to lose two men of whom he had
become very fond, but he was on the point of being
bereft of his story-teller, the opener up of his mind,
the man who above all others had taught him to
think about his Maker and a future state.
He had sense enough, however, to perceive that
his guests could not choose but avail themselves
of so good an opportunity, and, after the first feeling
of regret was over, made up his mind to the
separation.
Next day Harold and Disco, with feelings of
strong revulsion, almost of shame, fell into the
ranks of the slave-gang, and for many days there-
after marched through the land in company with
Marizano and his band of lawless villains.
Marizano usually walked some distance ahead of
the main body with a few trusty comrades. Our
adventurers, with their two followers, came next in
order of march, the gang of slaves in single file
followed, and the armed men brought up the rear
It was necessarily a very long line, and at a dis-

tance resembled some hideous reptile crawling slowly
and tortuously through the fair fields and plains of
Africa.
At first there were no stragglers, for the slaves
were as yet, with few exceptions, strong and
vigorous. These exceptions, and the lazy, were
easily kept in the line by means of rope and chain
as well as the rod and lash.
Harold and Disco studiously avoided their leader
during the march. Marizano fell in with their
humour and left them to themselves. At nights
they made their own fire and cooked their own
supper as far removed from the slave camp as was
consistent with safety, for they could not bear to
witness the sufferings of the slaves, or to look upon
their captors. Even the food that they were con-
strained to eat appeared to have a tendency to
choke them, and altogether their situation became
so terrible that they several times almost formed
the desperate resolution of leaving the party and
trying to reach the coast by themselves as they best
might, but the utter madness and hopelessness of
such a project soon forced itself on their minds, and
insured its being finally abandoned.
One morning Marizano threw off his usual reserve,
and, approaching the white men, told them that in
two hours they would reach the lake where his
employer was encamped.


## p. 354 (#380) ############################################

354
BLACK IVORY.
"And who is your master ?" asked Harold.
"A black-faced or yellow-faced blackguard like
himself, I doubt not," growled Disco.
Antonio put Harold's question without Disco's
comment, and Marizano replied that his master was
an Arab trader, and added that he would push on
in advance of the party and inform him of their
approach.
Soon afterwards the lake was reached. A large
dhow was in readiness, the gang was embarked and
ferried across to a place where several rude build-
ings and barracoons, with a few tents, indicated that
it was one of the inland headquarters of the trade
in Black Ivory.
The moment our travellers landed Marizano led
them to one of the nearest buildings and introduced
them to his master.
"Yoosoof !" exclaimed Disco in a shout of aston-
ishment.
It would have been a difficult question to have
decided which of the three faces displayed the most
extreme surprise. Perhaps Disco's would have been
awarded the palm, but Yoosoof was undoubtedly the
first to regain his self-possession.
"You be surprised," he said, in his very broken
English, while his pale-yellow visage resumed its
placid gravity of expression.
" Undoubtedly we are," said Harold.


## p. 355 (#381) ############################################

355
"Bu'stin'!" exclaimed Disco.
"You would be not so mush surprised,—did you
know dat I comes to here every year, an'dat Engleesh
consul ask me for 'quire about you."
"If that be so, how comes it that you were sur-
prised to see us ?" asked Harold.
"'Cause why, I only knows dat some white mans
be loss theirselfs—not knows what mans-not
knows it was you."
"Well now," cried Disco, unable to restrain him-
self as he turned to Harold, " did ever two unfortnits
meet wi' sitch luck? Here have we bin' obliged
for days to keep company with the greatest Por-
tugee villian in the country, an' now we're need-
cessitated to be under a obligation to the greatest
Arab scoundrel in Afriky."
The scoundrel in question smiled and shrugged
his shoulders.
"Yoosoof," cried Disco, clenching his fist and
looking full in the trader's eyes, "when I last saw
yer ugly face, I vowed that if ever I seed it again
I'd leave my mark on it pretty deep, I did; and
now I does see it again, but I haven't the moral
courage to touch sitch a poor, pitiful, shrivelled-
up package o' bones an' half-tanned leather. More-
over, I'm goin' to be indebted to 'ee! Ha! ha!"

in the tone), " to travel under yer care, an' eat yer

After this explosion the sorely tried mariner
brought his right hand down on his thigh with a
tremendous crack, turned about and walked away
to cool himself,

CHAPTER XXI.
PROGRESS OF THE SLAVE-GANG THE DEADLY SWAMP, AND THE
UNEXPECTED RESCUE.
We will now leap over a short period of time-
about two or three weeks during which the sable
procession had been winding its weary way over hill
and dale, plain and swamp.
During that comparatively brief period Harold
and Disco had seen so much cruelty and suffering
that they both felt a strange tendency to believe
that the whole must be the wild imaginings of a
horrible dream. Perhaps weakness, resulting from
illness, might have had something to do with this
peculiar feeling of unbelief, for both had been subject
to a second though slight attack of fever. Neverthe-
less, coupled with their scepticism was a contra-
dictory and dreadful certainty that they were not
dreaming, but that what they witnessed was absolute
verity.
It is probable that if they had been in their
ordinary health and vigour they would have made a
violent attempt to rescue the slaves, even at the

358
BLACK IVORY.
cost of their own lives. But severe and prolonged
illness often unhinges the mind as well as the body,
and renders the spirit all but impotent.
One sultry evening the sad procession came to a
long stretch of swamp and prepared to cross it.
Although already thinned by death, the slave gang
was large. It numbered several hundreds, and was
led by Marizano; Yoosoof having started some days
in advance in charge of a similar gang.
Harold and Disco were by that time in the habit
of walking together in front of the gang, chiefly for
the purpose of avoiding the sight of cruelties and
woes which they were powerless to prevent or
assuage. On reaching the edge of the swamp, how-
ever, they felt so utterly wearied and dis-spirited
that they sat down on a bank to rest, intending to
let the slave-gang go into the swamp before them
and then follow in rear. Antonio and Jumbo also
remained with them.
"You should go on in front," said Marizano
significantly, on observing their intention.
"Tell him we'll remain where we are," said
Disco sternly to Antonio.
Marizano shrugged his shoulders and left them.
The leading men of the slave-gang were ordered
to advance, as soon as the armed guard had com-
menced the toilsome march over ground into which
they sank knee-deep at every step.


## p. 359 (#385) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
359
The first man of the gang hesitated and heaved
a deep sigh as though his heart failed him at the
prospect—and well it might, for, although young, he
was not robust, and over-driving, coupled with the
weight and the chafing of the goree, had worn him
to a skeleton.
It was not the policy of the slave-traders to take
much care of their Black Ivory. They procured
it so cheaply that it was easier and more profitable
to lose or cast away some of it than to put off time
in resting and recruiting the weak.
The moment it was observed, therefore, that the
leading man hesitated, one of the drivers gave him a
slash across his naked back with a heavy whip
which at once drew blood. Poor wretch ; he could
ill bear further loss of the precious stream of life,
for it had already been deeply drained from him by
the slave-stick. The chafing of that instrument of
torture had not only worn the skin off his shoulders
but had cut into the quivering flesh, so that blood
constantly dropped in small quantities from it.
No cry burst from the man's lips on receiving the
cruel blow, but he turned his eyes on his captors
with a look that seemed to implore for mercy. As
well might he have looked for mercy at the hands of
Satan. The lash again fell on him with stinging
force. He made a feeble effort to advance, staggered
and fell to the ground dragging down the man to

BLACK IVORY,
whom he was coupled with such violence as almost
to break his neck. The lash was again about to be
applied to make him rise, but Disco and Harold
rose simultaneously and rushed at the driver, with
what intent they scarcely knew; but four armed
half-castes stepped between them and the slave.
"You had better not interfere," said Marizano,
who stood close by.
"Out of the way!" cried Harold fiercely, in the
strength of his passion hurling aside the man who
opposed him.
"You shan't give him another cut," said Disco
between his teeth, as he seized the driver by the
throat.
"We don't intend to do so," said Marizano coolly,
while the driver released himself from poor Disco's
weakened grasp," he won't need any more."
The Englishmen required no explanation of these
words. A glance told them that the man was
dying.
"Cut him out," said Marizano.
One of his men immediately brought a saw and
cut the fork of the stick which still held the living
to the dying man, and which, being riveted on them,
could not otherwise be removed.
Harold and Disco lifted him up as soon as he
was free, and carrying him a short distance aside to
a soft part of the bank, laid him gently down.

were
The dying slave looked as if he were surprised at
such unwonted tenderness. There was even a slight
smile on his lips for a few moments, but it quickly
passed away with the fast ebbing tide of life.
"Go fetch some water," said Harold. "His lips
are dry."
Disco rose and ran to fill a small cocoa-nut-shell
which he carried at his girdle as a drinking-cup.
- Returning with it he moistened the man's lips and
poured a little of the cool water on the raw sores on
each side of his neck.
They were so much engrossed with their occupa-
tion that neither of them observed that the slave-
gang had commenced to pass through the swamp,
until the sharp cry of a child drew their attention
to it for a moment'; but, knowing that they could do
no good, they endeavoured to shut their eyes and
ears to everything save the duty they had in hand.
By degrees the greater part of the long line had
got into the swamp and were slowly toiling through
it under the stimulus of the lash. Some, like the
poor fellow who first fell, had sunk under their accu-
mulated trials, and after a fruitless effort on the part
of the slavers to drive them forward, had been
kicked aside into the jungle, there to die, or to be
torn in pieces by that ever-watchful scavenger of
the wilderness, the hyena. These were chiefly
women, who having become mothers not long before,

were unable to carry their infants and keep up with
the gang. Others, under the intense dread of flagel-
lation, made the attempt and staggered on a short
distance only to fall and be left behind in the pesti-
lential swamp, where rank reeds and grass closed
over them and formed a ready grave.
The difficulties of the swamp were, however, felt
most severely by the children, who, from little
creatures of not much more than five years of age
to well-grown boys and girls, were mingled with
and chained to the adults along the line. Their
comparatively short legs were not well adapted for
such ground, and not a few of them perished there;
but although the losses here were terribly numerous
in one sense, they after all bore but a small pro-
portion to those whose native vigour carried them
through in safety
Among the men there were some whose strength
of frame and fierce expression indicated untameable
spirits—men who might have been, probably were,
heroes among their fellows. It was for men of this
stamp that the goree, or slave-stick, had been in-
vented, and most effectually did that instrument
serve its purpose. Samson himself would have been
a mere child in it.
There were men in the gang quite as bold, if not
as strong, as Samson. One of these, a very tall and
powerful negro, on drawing near to the place where

Marizano stood superintending the passage, turned
suddenly aside, and, although coupled by the neck
to a fellow-slave, and securely bound at the wrists
with a cord, which was evidently cutting into his
swelled flesh, made a desperate kick at the half-
caste leader.
Although the slave failed to reach him, Marizano
was so enraged that he drew a hatchet from his belt
and instantly dashed out the man's brains. He fell
dead without even a groan. Terrified by this, the
rest passed on more rapidly, and there was no further
check till a woman in the line, with an infant on
her back, stumbled, and, falling down, appeared
unable to rise.
"Get up!" shouted Marizano, whose rage had
rather been increased than abated by the murder
he had just committed.
The woman rose and attempted to advance, but
seemed ready to fall again. Seeing this, Marizano
plucked the infant from her back, dashed it against
a tree, and flung its quivering body into the jungle,
while a terrible application of the lash sent the
mother shrieking into the swamp.
Harold and Disco did not witness this, though

record of cruelties too horrible to be set down in a book like this, we

they heard the shriek of despair, for at the moment
the negro they were tending was breathing his last.
When his eyes had closed and the spirit had been
set free, they rose, and, purposely refraining from
looking back, hurried away from the dreadful scene,
intending to plunge into the swamp at some dis-
tance from the place, and push on until they should
regain the head of the column.
" Better if we'd never fallen behind, sir," said
Disco, in a deep, tremulous voice.
" True," replied Harold. "We should have been
spared these sights, and the pain of knowing that we
cannot prevent this appalling misery and cruelty."
"But surely it is to be prevented somehow," cried
Disco, almost fiercely. " Many a war that has cost
mints o' money has been carried on for causes that
ain't worth mentionin' in the same breath with this !"
As Harold knew not what to say, and was toiling
knee-deep in the swamp at the moment, he made
no reply.
After marching about half an hour he stopped
abruptly and said, with a heavy sigh,—
"I hope we haven't missed our way?" .
" Hope not, sir, but it looks like as if we had.
I've bin so took up thinkin' o' that accursed traffic
in human bein's that I've lost my reckonin'. Hows-
ever, we can't be far out, an', with the sun to guide
us, we'll—"

He was stopped by a loud halloo in the woods,
on the belt of the swamp.
It was repeated in a few seconds, and Antonio,
who, with Jumbo, had followed his master, cried in
an excited tone,
" Me knows dat sound !"
" Wot may it be, Tony?" asked Disco.
There was neither time nor need for an answer,
for at that moment a ringing cry, something like a
bad imitation of a British cheer, was heard, and a
band of men sprang out of the woods and ran at full
speed towards our Englishmen.
" Why, Zombo !" exclaimed Disco, wildly.
" Oliveira !" cried Harold.
" Masiko ! Songolo!" shouted Antonio and Jumbo.
" An' José, Nakoda, Chimbolo, Mabruki !—the
whole bilin' of 'em," cried Disco, as one after another
these worthies emerged from the wood and rushed
in a state of frantic excitement towards their friends
-" Hooray!"
" Hooroo-hay!" replied the runners.
In another minute our adventurous party of tra-
vellers was re-united, and for some time nothing
but wild excitement, congratulations, queries that
got no replies, and replies that ran tilt at irrelevant
queries, with confusion worse confounded by explo-
sions of unbounded and irrepressible laughter not
unmingled with tears, was the order of the hour.


## p. 366 (#392) ############################################

366
BLACK IVORY.
" But wat ! yoos ill ?" cried Zombo suddenly,
looking into Disco's face with an anxious expression.
" Well, I ain't 'xac'ly ill, nor I ain't 'xac'ly well
neither, but I'm hearty all the same, and werry
glad to see your black face, Zombo."
"Ho ! hooroo-hay! so's me for see you," cried
the excitable Zombo; " but come, not good for
talkee in de knees to watter. Fall in boy, ho!
sholler 'ums-queek mash !"
That Zombo had assumed command of his party
was made evident by the pat way in which he
trolled off the words of command formerly taught
to him by Harold, as well as by the prompt obe-
dience that was accorded to his orders. He led the
party out of the swamp, and, on reaching a dry spot,
halted, in order to make further inquiries and answer
questions.
"How did you find us, Zombo ?" asked Harold,
throwing himself wearily on the ground.
" Yoos ill," said Zombo, holding up a finger by
way of rebuke.
" So I am, though not so ill as I look. But come,
answer me. How came you to discover us? You
could not have found us by mere chance in this
wilderness ?"
" Chanz; wat am chanz?" asked the Makololo.
There was some difficulty in getting Antonio to
explain the word, from the circumstance of himself

367
being ignorant of it, therefore Harold put the ques-
tion in a more direct form.
"Oh! ve comes here look for yoo, 'cause peepils
d'reck 'ums—show de way. Ve's been veeks, monts,
oh! days look for yoo. Travil far-g'rong road-
turin bak—try agin—fin' yoo now—hooroo-hay!".
"You may say that, indeed. I'd have it in my
heart," said Disco, " to give three good rousin' British
cheers if it warn't for the thoughts o' that black-
hearted villain, Marizano, an' his poor, miserable
slaves."
" Marizano!" shouted Chimbolo, glaring at Harold.
"Marizano!" echoed Zombo, glaring at Disco.
Harold now explained to his friends that the
slave-hunter was close at hand—a piece of news
which visibly excited them,—and described the
cruelties of which he had recently been a witness.
Zombo showed his teeth like a savage mastiff, and
grasped his musket as though he longed to use it,
but he uttered no word until the narrative reached
that point in which the death of the poor captive
was described. Then he suddenly started forward
and said something to his followers in the native
tongue, which caused each to fling down the small
bundle that was strapped to his shoulders.
"Yoo stop here," he cried, earnestly, as he turned
to Harold and Disco. "Ve's com bak soon. Ho!
boys, sholler 'ums ! queek mash!"


## p. 368 (#394) ############################################

No trained band of Britons ever obeyed with
more ready alacrity. No attention was paid to
Harold's questions. The "queek mash" carried
them out of sight in a few minutes, and when the
Englishmen, who had run after them a few paces,
halted, under the conviction that in their weak con-
dition they might as well endeavour to keep up with
race-horses as with their old friends, they found that
Antonio alone remained to keep them company.
"Where's Jumbo ?" inquired Harold.
"Gon' 'way wid oders," replied the interpreter.
Examining the bundles of their friends, they
found that their contents were powder, ball, and
food. It was therefore resolved that a fire should
be kindled and food prepared to be ready for their
friends on their return.
"I'm not so sure about their return," said Harold
gravely. "They will have to fight against fearful
odds if they find the slavers. Foolish fellows; I
wish they had not rushed away so madly without
consulting us."
The day passed; night came and passed also,
and another day dawned, but there was no appear-
ance of Zombo and his men until the sun had been
up for some hours. Then they came back, wending
their way slowly-very slowlythrough the woods,
with the whole of the slave-gang, men, women, and
children, at their heels !

"Where is Marizano ?" inquired Harold, almost
breathless with surprise.
"Dead !" said Zombo.
"Dead ?"
"Ay, dead, couldn't be deader."
"And his armed followers ?"
"Dead, too—some ob ums. Ve got at um in de
night. Shotted Marizano all to hatoms. Shotted
mos' ob um follerers too. De res' all scatter like
leaves in de wind. Me giv up now," added Zombo,
handing his musket to Harold. "Boys ! orrer ums!
mees Capitin not no more. Now, Capitin Harol',
yoos once more look afer us, an' take care ob all
ums peepil."
Having thus demitted his charge, the faithful
Zombo stepped back and left our hero in the un-
enviable position of a half broken-down man with
the responsibility of conducting an expedition and
disposing of a large gang of slaves in some unknown
part of equatorial Africa !
Leaving him there, we will proceed at once to
the coast and follow, for a time, the fortunes of that
arch-villain, Yoosoof.

to the ransom, Yoosoof proceeded over the same
track which we have already described in part,
leaving a bloody trail behind him.
It is a fearful track, of about 500 miles in length,
that which lies between the head of Lake Nyassa
and the sea-coast at Kilwa. We have no intention
of dragging the reader over it to witness the cruel-
ties and murders that were perpetrated by the
slavers, or the agonies endured by the slaves. Liv-
ingstone speaks of it as a land of death, of desola-
tion, and dead men's bones. And no wonder, for
it is one of the main arteries through which the
blood of Africa flows, like the water of natural
rivers, to the sea. The slave-gangs are perpetually

passing eastward through it-perpetually dropping
four-fifths of their numbers on it as they go.?
Yoosoof left with several thousands of strong and
healthy men, women, and children-most of them
being children he arrived at Kilwa with only eight
hundred. The rest had sunk by the way, either
from exhaustion or cruel treatment, or both. The
loss was great; but as regards the trader it could
not be called severe, because the whole gang of
slaves cost him little—some of them even nothing !
—and the remaining eight hundred would fetch a
good price. They were miserably thin, indeed,
and exhibited on their poor, worn, and travel-
stained bodies the evidence of many a cruel casti-
gation; but Yoosoof knew that a little rest and
good feeding at Kilwa would restore them to some
degree of marketable value, and at Zanzibar he was
pretty sure of obtaining, in round numbers, about
£10 a head for them, while in the Arabian and
Persian ports he could obtain much more, if he
chose to pass beyond the treaty-protected water at
Lamoo, and run the risk of being captured by British
cruisers. It is "piracy" to carry slaves north of
Lamoo. South of that point, for hundreds of miles,

tenth of the slaves captured reach the sea-coast alive. It is therefore
rather under than over-stating the case to say that out of every
hundred starting from the interior, eighty perish on the road.

could not excel if they were to try, is a "domestic
institution" with which Britons are pledged not to
interfere !
The arch robber and murderer, Yoosoof-smooth
and oily of face, tongue, and manner though he was
--possessed a bold spirit and a grasping heart. The
domestic institution did not suit him. Rather than
sneak along his villainous course under its protect-
ing "pass," he resolved to bid defiance to laws,
treaties, and men-of-war to boot—as many hundreds
of his compeers have done and do—and make a bold
dash to the north with his eight hundred specimens
of Black Ivory.
1 Since the above was written Sir Bartle Frere has returned from
his mission, and we are told that a treaty has been signed by the
Sultan of Zanzibar putting an end to this domestic slavery. We have
not yet seen the terms of this treaty, and must go to press before it
appears. We have reason to rejoice and be thankful, however, that
such an advantage has been gained. But let not the reader imagine
that this settles the question of East African slavery. Portugal still
holds to the "domestic institution" in her colonies, and has decreed
that it shall not expire till the year 1878. Decreed, in fact, that the
horrors which we have attempted to depict shall continue for five
years longer! And let it be noted, that the export slave-trade cannot
be stopped as long as domestic slavery is permitted. Besides this,
there is a continual drain of human beings from Africa through
Egypt. Sir Samuel Baker's mission is a blow aimed at that ; but
nothing, that we know of, is being done in regard to Portuguese
wickedness. If the people of this country could only realize the
frightful state of things that exists in the African Portuguese territory,
and knew how many thousand bodies shall be racked with torture,
and souls be launched into eternity during these five years, they
would indignantly insist that Portugal should be compelled to stop it
at once. If it is righteous to constrain the Sultan of Zanzibar, is it
not equally so to compel the King of Portugal ?

Accordingly, full of his purpose, one afternoon he
sauntered up to the barracoons in which his "cattle"
were being rested and fed-up.
Moosa, his chief drivor, was busy among them
with the lash, for, like other cattle, they had a ten-
dency to rebel, at least a few of them had ; the most
of them were by that time reduced to the callous
condition which had struck Harold and Disco so
much on the occasion of their visits to the slave-
market of Zanzibar.
Moosa was engaged, when Yoosoof entered, in
whipping most unmercifully a small boy whose
piercing shrieks had no influence whatever on his
tormentor. Close beside them a large strong-boned
man lay stretched on the ground. He had just
been felled with a heavy stick by Moosa for inter-
fering. He had raised himself on one elbow, while
with his right hand he wiped away the blood that
oozed from the wound in his head, and appeared to
struggle to recover himself from the stunning blow.
"What has he been doing ?" asked Yoosoof, care-
lessly, in Portuguese.
"Oh, the old story, rebelling," said Moosa, savagely
hurling the boy into the midst of a group of cower-
ing children, amongst whom he instantly shrank as
much as possible out of sight. "That brute," pointing
to the prostrate mater" was a chief, it appears, in his
own country, and has not yet got all the spirit

lashed out of him. But it can't last much longer;
either the spirit or the life must go. He has carried
that little whelp the last part of the way on his back,
and now objects to part with him,-got fond of him,
I fancy. If you had taken my advice you would
have cast them both to the hyenas long ago."
"You are a bad judge of human flesh, Moosa,"
said Yoosoof, quietly ; "more than once you have
allowed your passion to rob me of a valuable piece
of goods. This man will fetch a good price in
Persia, and so will his son. I know that the
child is his son, though the fool thinks no one
knows that but himself, and rather prides himself
on the clever way in which he has continued to
keep his whelp beside him on the journey down.
Bah! what can one expect from such cattle? Don't
separate them, Moosa. They will thrive better to-
gether. If we only get them to market in good
condition, then we can sell them in separate lots
without risking loss of value from pining."
In a somewhat sulky tone, for he was not pleased
to be found fault with by his chief, the slave-driver
ordered out the boy, who was little more than five
years old, though the careworn expression of his thin
face seemed to indicate a much more advanced age.
Trembling with alarm, for he expected a repetition
of the punishment, yet not daring to disobey, the
child came slowly out from the midst of his hapless

companions and advanced. The man who had
partly recovered rose to a sitting position, and re-
garded Moosa and the Arab with a look of hatred
so intense that it is quite certain he would have
sprung at them if the heavy slave-stick had not
rendered such an act impossible.
"Go, you little whelp," said Moosa, pointing to
the fallen chief, and at the same time giving the
child a cut with the whip.
With a cry of mingled pain and delight poor Obo,
for it was he, rushed into his father's open arms, and
laid his sobbing head on his breast. He could not
nestle into his neck as, in the days of old, he had
been wont to do,—the rough goree effectually pre-
vented that.
Kambira bent his head over the child and re-
mained perfectly still. He did not dare to move,
lest any action, however inoffensive, might induce
Moosa to change his mind and separate them again.
Poor Kambira! How different from the hearty,
bold, kindly chief to whom we introduced the reader
in his own wilderness home! His colossal frame
was now gaunt in the extreme, and so thin that
every rib stood out as though it would burst the
skin, and every joint seemed hideously large, while
from head to foot his skin was crossed and recrossed
with terrible weals and scarred with open sores,
telling of the horrible cruelties to which he had been

subjected in the vain attempt to tame his untameable
spirit. There can be no question that if he had
been left to the tender mercies of such Portuguese
half-caste scoundrels as Moosa or Marizano he would
have been brained with an axe or whipped to death
long ago. But Yoosoof was more cool and calculating
in his cruelty ; he had more respect for his pocket
than for the gratification of his angry feelings.
Therefore Kambira had reached the coast alive.
Little had the simple chief imagined what awaited
him on that coast and on his way to it, when, in the
fulness of his heart, he had stated to Harold Seadrift
his determination to proceed thither in search of
Azinté. Experience had now crushed hope, and
taught him to despair. There was but one gleam of
light in his otherwise black sky, and that was the
presence of his boy. Life had still one charm in
it as long as he could lay hold of Obo's little hand
and hoist him, not quite so easily as of yore, on his
broad shoulders. Yoosoof was sufficiently a judge
of human character to be aware that if he separated
these two, Kambira would become more dangerous
to approach than the fiercest monster in the African
wilderness.
"We must sail to-night and take our chance,"
said Yoosoof, turning away from his captives; "the
time allowed for our trade is past, and I shall
run straight north without delay."

The Arab here referred to the fact that the period
of the year allowed by treaty for the "lawful slave
trade" of the Zanzibar dominions had come to an
end. That period extended over several months,
and during its course passes from the Sultan
secured "domestic slavers " against the British
cruisers. After its expiration no export of slaves
was permitted anywhere; nevertheless a very large
export was carried on despite non-permission and
cruisers. Yoosoof meant to run the blockade and
take his chance.
"How many dhows have you got ?" asked
Yoosoof.
"Three," replied Moosa.
" That will do," returned the Arab after a few
minutes' thought; "it will be a tight fit at first,
perhaps, but a few days at sea will rectify that.
Even in the most healthy season and favourable
conditions we must unfortunately count on a good
many losses. We shall sail to-morrow."
The morrow came, and three dhows left the har-
bour of Kilwa, hoisted their lateen sails, and steered
northwards.
They were densely crowded with slaves. Even
to the eye of a superficial observer this would have
been patent, for the upper deck of each was so
closely packed with black men, women, and children,
that a square inch of it could not anywhere be seen.


## p. 378 (#404) ############################################

378
BLACK IVORY.
They were packed very systematically, in order to
secure economical stowage. Each human being
sat on his haunches with his thighs against his
breast and his knees touching his chin. They were
all ranged thus in rows, shoulder to shoulder, and
back to shin, so that the deck was covered with a
solid phalanx of human flesh. Change of posture
was not provided for: it was not possible. There
was no awning over the upper deck. The tropical
sun poured its rays on the heads of the slaves all
day. The dews fell on them all night. The voyage
might last for days or weeks, but there was no
relief to the wretched multitude. For no purpose
whatever could they move from their terrible posi-
tion, save for the one purpose of being thrown
overboard when dead.
But we have only spoken of the upper deck of
these dhows. Beneath this there was a temporary
bamboo deck, with just space sufficient to admit of
men being seated in the position above referred to.
This was also crowded, but it was not the "Black
Hole" of the vessel. That was lower still. Seated
on the stone ballast beneath the bamboo-deck there
was yet another layer of humanity, whose condition
can neither be described nor conceived. Without
air, without light, without room to move, without
hope; with insufferable stench, with hunger and
thirst, with heat unbearable, with agony of body and

379
soul, with dread anticipations of the future, and de-
spairing memories of the past, they sat for days and
nights together—fed with just enough of uncooked
rice and water to keep soul and body together.
Not enough in all cases, however, for many suc-
cumbed, especially among the women and children.
Down in the lowest, filthiest, and darkest corner
of this foul hold sat Kambira, with little Obo crushed
against his shins. It may be supposed that there
was a touch of mercy in this arrangement. Let not
the reader suppose so. Yoosoof knew that if Kam-
bira was to be got to market alive, Obo must go
along with him. Moosa also knew that if the
strong-minded chief was to be subdued at all, it
would only be by the most terrible means. Hence
his position in the dhow.
There was a man seated alongside of Kambira who
for some time had appeared to be ill. He could
not be seen, for the place was quite dark, save when
a man came down with a lantern daily to serve out
rice and water; but Kambira knew that he was
very ill from his groans and the quiverings of his
body. One night these groans ceased, and the man
leaned heavily on the chief—not very heavily, how-
ever, he was too closely wedged in all round to
admit of that. Soon afterwards he became very
cold, and Kambira knew that he was dead. All
that night and the greater part of next day the dead

man sat propped up by his living comrades. When
the daily visitor came down, attention was drawn
to the body and it was removed.
Moosa, who was in charge of this dhow (Yoosoof
having command of another), gave orders to have the
slaves in the hold examined, and it was discovered
that three others were dead and two dying. The
dead were thrown overboard ; the dying were left
till they died, and then followed their released com-
rades.
But now a worse evil befell that dhow. Small-
pox broke out among the slaves.
It was a terrible emergency, but Moosa was quite
equal to it. Ordering the infected, and suspected,
slaves to be brought on deck, he examined them.
In this operation he was assisted and accompanied
by two powerful armed men. There were passengers
on board the dhow, chiefly Arabs, and a crew as
well as slaves. The passengers and crew together
numbered about thirty-four, all of whom were armed
to the teeth. To these this inspection was of great
importance, for it was their interest to get rid of the
deadly disease as fast as possible.
The first slave inspected, a youth of about fifteen,
was in an advanced stage of the disease, in fact
dying. · A glance was sufficient, and at a nod from
Moosa, the two powerful men seized him and hurled
him into the sea. The poor creature was too far

381
gone even to struggle for life. He sank like a
stone. Several children followed. They were un-
questionably smitten with the disease, and were at
once thrown overboard. Whether the passengers
felt pity or no we cannot say. They expressed
none, but looked on in silence.
So far the work was easy, but when men and
women were brought up on whom the disease had
not certainly taken effect, Moosa was divided between
the desire to check the progress of the evil, and the
desire to save valuable property.
The property itself also caused some trouble in a
few instances, for when it became obvious to one or
two of the stronger slave girls and men what was
going to be done with them, they made a hard
struggle for their lives, and the two strong men were
under the necessity of using a knife, now and then,
to facilitate the accomplishment of their purpose.
But such cases were rare. Most of the victims were
callously submissive; it might not be beyond the
truth, in some cases, to say willingly submissive.
Each day this scene was enacted, for Moosa was
à very determined man, and full forty human beings
were thus murdered, but the disease was not stayed.
The effort to check it was therefore given up, and
the slaves were left to recover or die where they sat.
* See account of capture of dhow by Captain Robert B. Cay, of
H.M.S. "Vulture,' in the Times of India, 1872.

While this was going on in the vessel commanded
by Moosa, the other two dhows under Yoosoof and a
man named Suliman had been lost sight of. But
this was a matter of little moment, as they were all
bound for the same Persian port, and were pretty
sure, British cruisers permitting, to meet there at
last. Meanwhile the dhow ran short of water, and
Moosa did not like to venture at that time to make
the land, lest he should be caught by one of the
hated cruisers or their boats. He preferred to let
the wretched slaves take their chance of dying of
thirst-hoping, however, to lose only a few of the
weakest, as water could be procured a little farther
north with greater security.
Thus the horrible work of disease, death, and
murder went on until an event occurred which
entirely changed the aspect of affairs on board the
dhow.
Early one morning, Moosa directed the head of
his vessel towards the land with the intention of
procuring the much needed water. At the same
hour and place two cutters belonging to H.M.S.
'Firefly,' armed with gun and rocket, twenty men,
and an interpreter, crept out under sail with the
fishing boats from a neighbouring village. They
were under the command of Lieutenants Small and
Lindsay respectively. For some days they had been
there keeping vigilant watch, but had seen no dhows,


## p. 383 (#409) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
383
and that morning were proceeding out rather de-
pressed by the influence of "hope deferred," when a
sail was observed in the offing—or, rather, a mast,
for the sail of the dhow had been lowered—the
owners intending to wait until the tide should
enable them to cross the bar.
"Out oars and give way, lads," was the immediate
order; for it was necessary to get up all speed on the
boats if the dhow was to be reached before she had
time to hoist her huge sail.
"I hope the haze will last," earnestly muttered
Lieutenant Small in the first cutter.
"Oh that they may keep on sleeping for five
minutes more," excitedly whispered Lieutenant
Lindsay in the second cutter.
These hopes were coupled with orders to have
the gun and rocket in readiness.
But the haze would not last to oblige Mr. Small,
neither would the Arabs keep on sleeping to please
Mr. Lindsay. On the contrary, the haze dissipated,
and the Arabs observed and recognised their enemies
when within about half a mile. With wonderful
celerity they hoisted sail and stood out to sea in the
full swing of the monsoon.
There was no little probability that the boats
would fail to overhaul a vessel with so large a sail,
therefore other means were instantly resorted to.
" Fire !" said Mr. Small.


## p. 384 (#410) ############################################

384
BLACK IVORY.
" Fire !" cried Mr. Lindsay.
Bang went the gun, whiz went the rocket almost
at the same moment. A rapid rifle-fire was also
opened on the slaver-shot, rocket, and ball bespat-
tered the sea and scattered foam in the air, but did
no harm to the dhow, a heavy sea and a strong
wind preventing accuracy of aim.
" Give it them as fast as you can," was now the
order; and well was the order obeyed, for blue-
jackets are notoriously smart men in action, and the
gun, the rocket, and the rifles kept up a smart iron
storm for upwards of two hours, during which time
the exciting chase lasted.
At last Jackson, the linguist, who was in the
stern of Lindsay's boat, mortally wounded the steers-
man of the dhow with a rifle-ball at a distance of
about six hundred yards. Not long afterwards the
rocket-cutter, being less heavily weighted than her
consort, crept ahead, and when within about a
hundred and fifty yards of the slaver, let fly a well-
directed rocket. It carried away the parrell which
secured the yard of the dhow to the mast, and
brought the sail down instantly on the deck.
"Hurra!" burst irresistibly from the blue-jackets.
The Arabs were doubly overwhelmed, for besides
getting the sail down on their heads, they were
astonished and stunned by the shriek, smoke, and
flame of the war-rocket. The gun-cutter coming up

at the moment, the two boats ranged alongside of
the slaver, and boarded together.
As we have said, the crew and passengers, number-
ing thirty-four, were armed to the teeth, and they
had stood by the halyards during the chase with
drawn creases, swearing to kill any one who should
attempt to shorten sail. These now appeared for a
moment as though they meditated resistance, but
the irresistible dash of the sailors seemed to change
their minds, for they submitted without striking a
blow, though many of them were very reluctant to
give up their swords and knives.
Fortunately the 'Firefly' arrived in search of her
boats that evening, and the slaves were transferred
to her deck. But who shall describe the harrowing
scene! The dhow seemed a very nest of black ants,
it was so crowded, and the sailors who had to per-
form the duty of removing the slaves were nearly
suffocated by the horrible stench. Few of the
slaves could straighten themselves after their long
confinement. Indeed some of them were unable to
stand for days afterwards, and many died on board
the 'Firefly' before they reached a harbour of refuge
and freedom. Those taken from the hold were in
the worst condition, especially the children, many
of whom were in the most loathsome stages of
smallpox, and scrofula of every description. They
were so emaciated and weak that many had to

be carried on board, and lifted for every move-
ment.
Kambira, although able to stand, was doubled up
like an old man, and poor little Obo trembled and
staggered when he attempted to follow his father, to
whom he still clung as to his last and only refuge.
To convey these poor wretches to a place where
they could be cared for was now Captain Romer's
chief anxiety. First, however, he landed the crew
and passengers, with the exception of Moosa and
three of his men. The filthy dhow was then scuttled
and sunk, after which the · Firefly steamed away
for Aden, that being the nearest port where the
rescued slaves could be landed and set free.

CHAPTER XXIII.
THE REMEDY.
READER, we will turn aside at this point to preach
you a lay sermon, if you will lend an attentive ear.
It shall be brief, and straight to the point. Our text
is,-Prevention and Cure.
There are at least three great channels by which
the life-blood of Africa is drained. One trends to
the east through the Zanzibar dominions, another
to the south-east through the Portuguese depen-
dencies, and a third to the north through Egypt.
If the slave-trade is to be effectually checked, the
flow through these three channels must be stopped.
It is vain to rest content with the stoppage of one
leak in our ship if two other leaks are left open.
Happily, in regard to the first of these channels,
Sir Bartle Frere has been successful in making a
grand stride in the way of prevention. If the
Sultan of Zanzibar holds to his treaty engagements,
" domestic slavery" in his dominions is at an end.
Nevertheless, our fleet will be required just as much

as ever to prevent the unauthorized, piratical, slave-
trade, and this, after all, is but one-third of the pre-
ventive work we have to do. Domestic slavery
remains untouched in the Portuguese dependencies,
and Portugal has decreed that it shall remain un-
touched until the year 1878! It is well that we
should be thoroughly impressed with the fact, that
so long as slavery in any form is tolerated, the
internal—we may say infernal-miseries and horrors
which we have attempted to depict, will continue
to blight the land and brutalize its people. Besides
this, justice demands that the same constraint which
we lay on the Sultan of Zanzibar should be applied
to the King of Portugal. We ought to insist that
his " domestic slavery" shall cease at once. Still
further, as Sir Bartle Frere himself has recommended,
we should urge upon our Government the appoint-
ment of efficient consular establishments in the
Portuguese dependencies, as well as vigilance in
securing the observance of the treaties signed by
the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat.
A recent telegram from Sir Samuel Baker assures
us that a great step has been made in the way of
checking the tide of slavery in the third—the
Egyptian-channel, and Sir Bartle Frere bears
testimony to the desire of the Khedive that slavery
should be put down in his dominions. For this we
have reason to be thankful; and the appearance of

affairs in that quarter is hopeful, but our hope is
mingled with anxiety, because mankind is terribly
prone to go to sleep on hopeful appearances. Our
nature is such, that our only chance of success lies,
under God, in resolving ceaselessly to energize until
our ends be accomplished. We must see to it that
the Khedive of Egypt acts in accordance with his
professions, and for this end efficient consular agency
is as needful in the north-east as in the south-east.
So much for prevention, but prevention is not
cure. In order to this two things are necessary.
There must be points or centres of refuge for the
oppressed on the mainland of Africa, and there
must be the introduction of the Bible. The first is
essential to the second. Where anarchy, murder,
injustice, and tyranny are rampant and triumphant,
the advance of the missionary is either terribly slow
or altogether impossible. The life-giving, soul-
softening Word of God, is the only remedy for the
woes of mankind, and, therefore, the only cure for
Africa. To introduce it effectually, and along with
it civilisation and all the blessings that flow there-
from, it is indispensable that Great Britain should
obtain, by treaty or by purchase, one or more small
pieces of land, there to establish free Christian
negro settlements, and there, with force sufficient to
defend them from the savages, and worse than
savages,—the Arab and Portuguese half-caste bar-

barians and lawless men who infest the land—hold
out the hand of friendship to all natives who choose
to claim her protection from the man-stealer, and
offer to teach them the blessed truths of Christianity
and the arts of civilisation. Many of the men who
are best fitted to give an opinion on the point, agree
in holding that some such centre, or centres, on the
mainland are essential to the permanent cure of
slavery, although they differ a little as to the best
localities for them. Take, for instance, Darra Salaam
on the coast, the Manganja highlands near the river
Shire, and Kartoum on the Nile. Three such centres
would, if established, begin at once to dry up the
slave-trade at its three fountain-heads, while our
cruisers would check it on the coast. In these
centres of light and freedom the negroes might see
exemplified the blessings of Christianity and civili-
sation, and, thence, trained native missionaries
might radiate into all parts of the vast continent,
armed only with the Word of God, the shield of
Faith, and the sword of the Spirit, in order to preach
the glad tidings of salvation through Jesus Christ
our Lord.
In brief, the great points on which we ought, as
a nation, to insist, are—the immediate abolition of
the slave-trade in Portuguese dependencies; the
scrupulous fulfilment of treaty obligations by the
Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat, the Shah of Persia,

391
and the Khedive of Egypt; the establishment by our
Government of efficient consular agencies where such
are required; the acquisition of territory on the
mainland for the purposes already mentioned, and
the united action of all Christians in our land to
raise funds and send men to preach the Gospel to
the negro. So doing we shall, with God's blessing,
put an end to the Eastern slave-trade, save equatorial
Africa, and materially increase the commerce, the
riches, and the happiness of the world.

CHAPTER XXIV.
TELLS OF SAD SIGHTS, AND SUDDEN EVENTS, AND UNEXPECTED
MEETINGS.
In the course of time, our hero, Harold Seadrift,
and his faithful ally, Disco Lillihammer, after in-
numerable adventures which we are unwillingly
obliged to pass over in silence, returned to the
coast, and, in the course of their wanderings in
search of a vessel which should convey them to
Zanzibar, found themselves at last in the town of
Governor Letotti. Being English travellers, they
were received as guests by the Governor, and Harold
was introduced to Senhorina Maraquita.
Passing through the market-place one day, they
observed a crowd round the flag-staff in the centre
of the square, and, following the irresistible tendency
of human nature in such circumstances, ran to see
what was going on.
They found that a slave was about to be publicly
whipped by soldiers. The unhappy man was sus-
pended by the wrists from the flag-staff, and a single

cord of coir round his waist afforded him additional
support.
" Come away, we can do no good here," said
Harold, in a low, sorrowful tone, which was drowned
in the shriek of the victim, as the first lash fell on
his naked shoulders.
"Pra'ps he's a criminal," suggested Disco, as he
hurried away, endeavouring to comfort himself with
the thought that the man probably deserved punish-
ment. "It's not the whippin' I think so much of,"
he added ; " that is the only thing as will do for
some characters; but it's the awful cruelties that
goes along with it."
Returning through the same square about an
hour later, having almost forgotten about the slave
by that time, they were horrified to observe that
the wretched man was still hanging there.
Hastening towards him, they found that he was
gasping for breath. His veins were bursting, and
his flesh was deeply lacerated by the cords with
which he was suspended. He turned his head as
the Englishmen approached, and spoke a few words
which they did not understand; but the appealing
look of his bloodshot eyes spoke a language that
required no interpreter.
At an earlier period in their career in Africa, both
Harold and Disco would have acted on their first
impulse, and cut the man down; but experience

had taught them that this style of interference, while
it put their own lives in jeopardy, had sometimes
the effect of increasing the punishment and suffer-
ings of those whom they sought to befriend.
Acting on a wiser plan, they resolved to appeal
to Governor Letotti in his behalf. They therefore
ran to his residence, where Maraquita, who con-
versed with Harold in French, informed them that
her father was in the "Geresa," or public palaver
house. To that building they hastened, and found
that it was in the very square they had left. But
Senhor Letotti was not there. He had observed the
Englishmen coming, and, having a shrewd guess
what their errand was, had disappeared and hid
himself. His chief-officer informed them that he
had left the town early in the morning, and would
not return till the afternoon.
Harold felt quite sure that this was a falsehood,
but of course was obliged to accept it as truth.
"Is there no one to act for the Governor in his
absence ?" he asked, anxiously.
No, there was no one; but after a few minutes
the chief-officer appeared to be overcome by Harold's
earnest entreaties, and said that he could take upon
himself to act, that he would suspend the punish-
ment till the Governor's return, when Harold might
prefer his petition to him in person.
Accordingly, the slave was taken down. In the

afternoon Harold saw the Governor, and explained
that he did not wish to interfere with his province
as a magistrate, but that what he had witnessed was
so shocking that he availed himself of his privilege
as a guest to pray that the man's punishment might
be mitigated.
Governor Letotti's health had failed him of late,
and he had suffered some severe disappointments in
money matters, so that his wonted amiability had
been considerably reduced. He objected, at first,
to interfere with the course of justice; but finally
gave a reluctant consent, and the man was pardoned.
Afterwards, however, when our travellers were ab-
sent from the town for a day, the wretched slave was
again tied up, and the full amount of his punishment
inflicted ; in other words, he was flogged to death."
This incident had such an effect on the mind of
Harold, that he resolved no longer to accept the
hospitality of Governor Letotti. He had some
difficulty, however, in persuading himself to carry
his resolve into effect, for the Governor, although
harsh in his dealing with the slave, had been ex-
ceedingly kind and amiable to himself; but an un-
expected event occurred which put an end to his
difficulties. This was the illness and sudden death
of his host.
1 For the incident on which this is founded we are indebted to
the Rev. Dr. Ryan, late Bishop of the Mauritius.

Poor, disconsolate Maraquita, in the first passion
of her grief, fled to the residence of the only female
friend she had in the town, and refused firmly to
return home. Thus it came to pass that Harold's
intercourse with the Senhorina was cut short at its
commencement, and thus he missed the opportunity
of learning something of the fortunes of Azinté; for
it is certain that if they had conversed much to-
gether, as would probably have been the case had
her father lived, some mention of the slave-girl's
name could not fail to have been made, and their
mutual knowledge of her to have been elicited and
interchanged.
• In those days there was no regular communica-
tion between one point and another of the east coast
of Africa and the neighbouring islands. Travellers
had frequently to wait long for a chance; and when
they got one were often glad to take advantage
of it without being fastidious as to its character.
Soon after the events above narrated, a small trad-
ing schooner touched at the port. It was bound
for the Seychelles, intending to return by Zanzibar
and Madagascar, and proceed to the Cape. Harold
would rather have gone direct to Zanzibar, but
having plenty of time on his hands, as well as
means, he was content to avail himself of the oppor-
tunity, and took passage in the schooner for him-
self, Disco, and Jumbo. That sable and faithful

friend was the only one of his companions who
was willing to follow him anywhere on the face
of the earth. The others received their pay and
their discharge with smiling faces, and scattered to
their several homes—Antonio departing to complete
his interrupted honeymoon.
Just before leaving, Harold sought and obtained
permission to visit Maraquita, to bid her good-bye.
The poor child was terribly overwhelmed by the
death of her father, and could not speak of him
without giving way to passionate grief. She told
Harold that she meant to leave the coast by the
first opportunity that should offer, and proceed to
the Cape of Good Hope, where, in some part of the
interior, lived an old aunt, the only relative she now
had on earth, who, she knew, would be glad to re-
poor girl, and expressed deep sympathy with her,
but felt that his power to console was very small
indeed. After a brief interview he bade her fare-
well.
The voyage which our travellers now commenced
was likely to be of considerable duration, for the
Seychelles Islands lie a long way to the eastward of
Africa, but, as we have said, time was of no impor-
tance to Harold, and he was not sorry to have an
opportunity of visiting a group of islands which are
of some celebrity in connexion with the east African

slave-trade. Thus, all unknown to himself or Disco,
as well as to Maraquita, who would have been in-
tensely interested had she known the fact, he was led
towards the new abode of our sable heroine Azinté.
But alas ! for Kambira and Obo,—they were
being conveyed, also, of course, unknown to them-
selves or to anyone else, further and further
away from one whom they would have given their
heart's blood to meet with and embrace, and it
seemed as if there were not a chance of any gleam
of light bridging over the ever widening gulf that
lay between them, for although Lieutenant Lindsay
knew that Azinté had been left at the Seychelles, he
had not the remotest idea that Kambira was Azinté's
husband, and among several hundreds of freed
slaves the second lieutenant of the 'Firefly' was
not likely to single out and hold converse with a
chief whose language he did not understand, and
who, as far as appearances went, was almost as
miserable, sickly, and degraded as were the rest
of the unhappy beings by whom he was sur-
rounded.
Providence, however, turned the tide of affairs
in favour of Kambira and his son. On reaching
Zanzibar Captain Romer had learned from the com-
mander of another cruiser that Aden was at that
time somewhat overwhelmed with freed slaves, a
considerable number of captures having been recently

made about the neighbourhood of that great rendez-
vous of slavers, the island of Socotra.
The captain therefore changed his mind, and once
more very unwillingly directed his course towards
the distant Seychelles.
On the way thither many of the poor negroes
died, but many began to recover strength under the
influence of kind treatment and generous diet.
Among these latter was Kambira. His erect gait
and manly look soon began to return, and his ribs,
so to speak, to disappear. It was otherwise with
poor Obo. The severity of the treatment to which
he had been exposed was almost too much for so
young a frame. He lost appetite and slowly de-
clined, notwithstanding the doctor's utmost care.
This state of things continuing until the 'Firefly'
arrived at the Seychelles, Obo was at once con-
veyed to the hospital which we have referred to as
having been established there.
Azinté chanced to be absent in the neighbouring
town on some errand connected with her duties as
nurse when her boy was laid on his bed beside a
number of similar sufferers. It was a sad sight to
behold these little ones. Out of the original eighty-
three children who had been placed there forty-
seven had died in three weeks, and the remnant
were still in a pitiable condition. While on their
beds of pain, tossing about in their delirium, the

minds of these little ones frequently ran back to
their forest homes, and while some, in spirit,
laughed and romped once more around their huts,
thousands of miles away on the banks of some
African river, others called aloud in their sufferings
for the dearest of all earthly beings to them—their
mothers. Some of them also whispered the name
of Jesus, for the missionary had been careful to
tell them the story of our loving Lord while tending
their poor bodies.
Obo had fevered slightly, and in the restless half-
slumber into which he fell on being put to bed, he,
too, called earnestly for his mother. In his case,
poor child, the call was not in vain!
Lieutenant Lindsay and the doctor of the ship,
with Kambira, had accompanied Obo to the hospital.
"Now, Lindsay," said the doctor, when the child
had been made as comfortable as circumstances
would admit of, "this man must not be left here,
for he will be useless, and it is of the utmost con-
sequence that the child should have some days
of absolute repose. What shall we do with him?"
"Take him on board again," said Lindsay. "I
daresay we shall find him employment for a short
time."
"If you will allow me to take charge of him," inter-
posed the missionary, who was standing by them at
the time, "I can easily find him employment in the

401
neighbourhood, so that he can come occasionally to
see his child when we think it safe to allow him."
"That will be the better plan," said the doctor,
"for as long as—"
A short sharp cry near the door of the room cut
the sentence short.
All eyes were turned in that direction and they
beheld Azinté gazing wildly at them, and standing
as if transformed to stone.
The instant Kambira saw his wife he leaped up
as if he had received an electric shock, bounded
forward like a panther, uttered a shout that did full
credit to the chief of a warlike African tribe, and
seized Azinté in his arms !
No wonder that thirty-six little black heads
leaped from thirty-six little white pillows and dis-
played all the whites of seventy-two eyes that were
anything but little, when this astonishing scene
took place!
But Kambira quickly recovered himself, and,
grasping Azinté by the arm, led her gently towards
the bed which had just been occupied, and pointed
to the little one that slumbered uneasily there.
Strangely enough, just at the moment, little Obo
again whispered the word 'mother.'
Poor Azinté's eyes seemed ready to start from
their sockets. She stretched out her arms and tried
to rush towards her child, but Kambira held her back.
20

BLACK IVORY.
"Obo is very sick," he said, "you must touch
him tenderly."
The chief looked into his wife's eyes, saw that
she understood him, and let her go.
Azinté crept softly to the bed, knelt down beside
it, and put her arms so softly round Obo that she
scarcely moved him, yet she gradually drew him
towards her until his head rested on her swelling
bosom, and she pressed her lips tenderly upon his
brow. It was an old familiar attitude which seemed
to pierce the slumbers of the child with a pleasant
reminiscence, and dissipate his malady, for he heaved
a deep sigh of contentment, and sank into profound
repose.
"Good !" said the doctor, in a low tone, with a
significant nod to Lindsay, when an interpreter had
explained what had been already guessed by all
present, that Kambira and Azinté were man and
wife; " Obo has a better chance now of recovery
than I had anticipated; for joy goes a long way
towards effecting a cure. Come, we will leave them
together."
Kambira was naturally anxious to remain, but,
like all commanding spirits, he had long ago learned
that cardinal virtue, " obedience to whom obedience
is due." When it was explained to him that it
would be for Obo's advantage to be left alone
with his mother for a time, he arose, bowed his

403
head, and meekly followed his friends out of the
room.
Exactly one week from that date little Obo had
recovered so much of his former health that he was
permitted to go out into the air, and, a few days
later, Lieutenant Lindsay resolved to take him,
and his father and mother, on board the 'Firefly,'
by way of a little ploy. In pursuance of this
plan he set off from the hospital in company with
Kambira, followed at a short distance by Azinté
and Obo.
Poor Lindsay ! his heart was heavy while he did
his best to convey in dumb show his congratulations
to Kambira, for he saw in this unexpected re-union
an insurmountable difficulty in the way of taking
Azinté back to her former mistress—not that he
had ever seen the remotest chance of his being able
to achieve that desirable end before this difficulty
arose, but love is at times insanely hopeful, just as
at other times—and with equally little reason—it is
madly despairing.
He had just made some complicated signs with
hands, mouth, and eyebrows, and had succeeded in
rendering himself altogether incomprehensible to his
sable companion, when, on rounding a turn of the
path that led to the harbour, he found himself
suddenly face to face with Harold Seadrift, Disco
Lillihammer, and their follower, Jumbo, all of whom

had landed from a schooner, which, about an hour
before, had cast anchor in the bay.
"Mr. Lindsay !" " Mr. Seadrift !" exclaimed each
to the other simultaneously, for the reader will re-
member that they had met once before when our
heroes were rescued from Yoosoof by the 'Firefly.'
"Kambira !" shouted Disco.
" Azinté !" cried Harold, as our sable heroine
came into view.
"Obo !" roared the stricken mariner.
Jumbo could only vent his feelings in an appalling
yell and an impromptu war-dance round the party,
in which he was joined by Disco, who performed a
hornpipe with Obo in his arms, to the intense de-
light of that convalescent youngster.
Thus laughing, questioning, shouting, and dancing,
they all effervesced towards the shore like a band of
lunatics just escaped from Bedlam !

CHAPTER XXV.
THE LAST.
" How comes it," said Lieutenant Lindsay to
Harold, on the first favourable opportunity that
occurred after the meeting described in the last
chapter ; " how comes it that you and Kambira
know each other so well ?"
"I might reply by asking," said Harold, with a
smile," how comes it that you are so well acquainted
with Azinté ? but, before putting that question, I
will give a satisfactory answer to your own."
Hereupon he gave a brief outline of those
events, already narrated in full to the reader, which
bore on his first meeting with the slave-girl, and his
subsequent sojourn with her husband.
"After leaving the interior, continued our hero,
" and returning to the coast, I visited various towns
in order to observe the state of the slaves in the
Portuguese settlements, and, truly, what I saw was
most deplorable—demoralization and cruelty, and

was
the obstruction of lawful trade, prevailed every-
where. The settlements are to my mind a very
pandemonium on earth. Every one seemed to me
more or less affected by the accursed atmosphere
that prevails. Of course there must be some excep-
tions. I met with one, at the last town I visited, in
the person of Governor Letotti."
" Letotti !" exclaimed Lindsay, stopping abruptly.
" Yes !" said Harold, in some surprise at the
lieutenant's manner, " and a most amiable man he
was—
" Was !-was! What do you mean? Is—is he
dead ?" exclaimed Lindsay, turning pale.
"He died suddenly just before I left," said
Harold.
" And Maraquita-I mean his daughter—what
of her ?" asked the lieutenant, turning as red as he
had previously turned pale.
Harold noted the change, and a gleam of light
seemed to break upon him as he replied :
" Poor girl, she was overwhelmed at first by the
heavy blow. I had to quit the place almost imme-
diately after the event."
" Did you know her well ?" asked Lindsay, with
an uneasy glance at his companion's handsome face.
"No; I had just been introduced to her shortly
before her father's death, and have scarcely ex-
changed a dozen sentences with her. It is said that

407
her father died in debt, but of course in regard to
that I know nothing certainly. At parting, she told
me that she meant to leave the coast and go to
stay with a relative at the Cape."
The poor lieutenant's look on hearing this was so
peculiar, not to say alarming, that Harold could not
help referring to it, and Lindsay was so much over-
whelmed by such unexpected news, and, withal, so
strongly attracted by Harold's sympathetic manner,
that he straightway made a confidant of him, told
him of his love for Maraquita, of Maraquita's love
for Azinté, of the utter impossibility of his being
able to take Azinté back to her old mistress, now
that she had found her husband and child, even if
it had been admissible for a lieutenant in the British
navy to return freed negroes again into slavery, and
wound up with bitter lamentations as to his un-
happy fate, and expressions of poignant regret that
fighting and other desperate means, congenial and
easy to his disposition, were not available in the
circumstances. After which explosion he subsided,
felt ashamed of having thus committed himself, and
looked rather foolish.
But Harold quickly put him at his ease. He
entered on the subject with earnest gravity.
"It strikes me, Lindsay," he said thoughtfully,
after the lieutenant had finished, " that I can aid
you in this affair; but you must not ask me how at

present. Give me a few hours to think over it, and
then I shall have matured my plans."
Of course the lieutenant hailed with heartfelt
gratitude the gleam of hope held out to him, and
thus the friends parted for a time.
That same afternoon Harold sat under a palm-
tree in company with Disco, Jumbo, Kambira,
Azinté, and Obo.
"How would you like to go with me to the
Cape of Good Hope, Kambira ?" asked Harold
abruptly.
"Whar dat ?" asked the chief through Jumbo.
"Far away to the south of Africa," answered
Harold. "You know that you can never go back
to your own land now, unless you want to be again
enslaved."
"Him say him no' want to go back," interpreted
Jumbo; "got all him care for now—Azinté and
Obo."
" Then do you agree to go with me?" said Harold.
To this Kambira replied heartily that he did.
" W'y, wot do 'ee mean for to do with 'em ?" asked
Disco, in some surprise.
"I will get them comfortably settled there,"
replied Harold. "My father has a business friend
in Cape Town who will easily manage to put me in
the way of doing it. Besides, I have a particular
reason for wishing to take Azinté there.— Ask her,


## p. 409 (#435) ############################################

409
Jumbo, if she remembers a young lady named
Senhorina Maraquita Letotti."
To this Azinté replied that she did, and the way
in which her eyes sparkled proved that she remem-
bered her with intense pleasure.
"Well, tell her," rejoined Harold," that Maraquita
has grieved very much at losing her, and is very
anxious to get her back again—not as a slave, but as
a friend, for no slavery is allowed in English settle-
ments anywhere, and I am sure that Maraquita hates
slavery as much as I do, though she is not English,
so I intend to take her and Kambira and Obo to
the Cape, where Maraquita is living—or will be
living soon."
"Ye don't stick at trifles, sir," said Disco, whose
eyes, on hearing this, assumed a thoughtful, almost
a troubled look.
"My plan does not seem to please you," said Harold.
" Please me, sir, w'y shouldn't it please me? In
course you knows best; I was only a little puzzled,
that's all."
Disco said no more, but he thought a good deal,
for he had noted the beauty and sprightliness of
Maraquita, and the admiration with which Harold
had first beheld her, and it seemed to him that
this rather powerful method of attempting to gratify
the Portuguese girl was proof positive that Harold
had lost his heart to her.


## p. 410 (#436) ############################################

Harold guessed what was running in Disco's
mind, but did not care to undeceive him, as, in so
doing, he might run some risk of betraying the trust
reposed in him by Lindsay.
The captain of the schooner, being bound for the
Cape after visiting Zanzibar, was willing to take
these additional passengers, and the anxious lieu-
tenant was induced to postpone total and irrevoc-
ate despair, although, Maraquita being poor, and
he being poor, and promotion in the service being
very slow, he had little reason to believe his pro-
spects much brighter than they were before,-poor
fellow !
Time passed on rapid wing—as time is notoriously
prone to do—and the fortunes of our dramatis per-
sonce varied somewhat.
Captain Romer continued to roam the Eastern
seas, along with brother captains, and spent his
labour and strength in rescuing a few hundreds of
captives from among the hundreds of thousands
that were continually flowing out of unhappy Africa.
Yoosoof and Moosa continued to throw a boat-load or
two of damaged "cattle" in the way of the British
cruisers, as a decoy, and succeeded on the whole
pretty well in running full cargoes of valuable Black
Ivory to the northern markets. The Sultan of
Zanzibar continued to assure the British Consul


## p. 411 (#437) ############################################

BLACK IVORY.
411
that he heartily sympathized with England in her
desire to abolish slavery, and to allow his officials,
for a "consideration," to prosecute the slave-trade
to any extent they pleased ! Portugal continued to
assure England of her sympathy and co-operation
in the good work of repression, and her subjects
on the east coast of Africa continued to export
thousands of slaves under the protection of the
Portuguese and French flags, styling them free
engagés. British Indian subjects the Banyans of
Zanzibar,—continued to furnish the sinews of war
which kept the gigantic trade in human flesh going
on merrily. Murders, etc., continued to be perpe-
trated, tribes to be plundered, and hearts to be
broken-of course "legally" and "domestically,"
as well as piratically--during this rapid flight of
time.
But nearly everything in this life has its bright
lights and half-tints, as well as its deep shadows.
During the same flight of time, humane individuals -
have continued to urge on the good cause of the
total abolition of slavery, and Christian mission-
aries have continued, despite the difficulties of slave-
trade, climate, and human apathy, to sow here and
there on the coasts the precious seed of Gospel
truth, which we trust shall yet be sown broad-cast
by native hands, throughout the length and breadth
of that mighty land.

To come more closely to the subjects of our tale :
Chimbolo, with his recovered wife and child, sought
safety from the slavers in the far interior, and con-
tinued to think with pleasure and gratitude of the
two Englishmen who hated slavery and who had
gone to Africa just in the nick of time to rescue that
unhappy slave who had been almost flogged to death,
and was on the point of being drowned in the Zam-
besi in a sack. Mokompa, also, continued to poetize,
as in days gone by, having made a safe retreat with
Chimbolo, and, among other things, enshrined all the
deeds of the two white men in native verse. Yambo
continued to extol, play, admire, and propagate the
life-sized jumping-jack to such an extent that,
unless his career has been cut short by the slavers,
we fully expect to find that creature a "domestic
institution" when the slave-trade has been crushed,
and Africa opened up—as in the end it is certain
to be.
During the progress and continuance of all these
things, you may be sure our hero was not idle. He
sailed as proposed, with Kambira, Azinté, Obo,
Disco, and Jumbo for Zanzibar, touched at the town
over which poor Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo
Bignoso Letotti had ruled, found that the Senhorina
had taken her departure ; followed, as Disco said, in
her wake; reached the Cape, hunted her up, found
her out, and presented to her, with Lieutenant

Lindsay's compliments, the African chief Kambira,
his wife Azinté, and his son Obo!
Poor Maraquita, being of a passionately affec-
tionate and romantic disposition, went nearly mad
with joy, and bestowed so many grateful glances
and smiles on Harold that Disco's suspicions were
confirmed, and that bold mariner wished her, Mara-
quita, "at the bottom of the sea !" for Disco disliked
foreigners, and could not bear the thought of his
friend being caught by one of them.
Maraquita introduced Harold to her aunt, a
middle-aged, leather-skinned, excessively dark-eyed
daughter of Portugal. She also introduced him to
a bosom friend, at that time on a visit to her aunt.
The bosom friend was an auburn-haired, fair-skinned,
cheerful-spirited English girl. Before her, Harold
Seadrift at once, without an instant's warning, fell
flat down, figuratively speaking of course, and
remained so-stricken through the heart !
The exigencies of our tale require, at this point,
that we should draw our outline with a bold and
rapid pencil.
Disco Lillihammer was stunned, and so was
Jumbo, when Harold, some weeks after their
arrival at the Cape, informed them that he was
engaged to be married to Alice Gray, only daugh-
ter of the late Sir Eustace Gray, who had been
M.P. for some county in England, which he had

forgotten the name of, Alice not having been able
to recall it, as her father had died when she was
four years old, leaving her a fortune of next-to-
nothing a year, and a sweet temper.
Being incapable of further stunning, Disco was
rather revived than otherwise, and his dark shadow
was resuscitated, when Harold added that Kambira
had become Maraquita's head-gardener, Azinté cook
to the establishment, and Obo page-in-waiting-
more probably page-in-mischief-to the young
Senhorina. But both Disco and Jumbo had a
relapse from which they were long of recovering,
when Harold went on to say that he meant to sail
for England by the next mail, take Jumbo with
him as valet, make proposals to his father to esta-
blish a branch of their house at the Cape, come
back to manage the branch, marry Alice, and
reside in the neighbourhood of the Senhorina Mara-
quita Letotti's dwelling.
"You means wot you say, I s'pose ?" asked Disco.
"Of course I do," said Harold.
"An' yer goin' to take Jumbo as yer walley ?"
"Yes."
"H'm ; I'll go too as yer keeper."
" My what?"
"Yer keeper—yer strait-veskit buckler, for if
you ain't a loonatic ye ought to be."
But Disco did not go to England in that capacity.

415
He remained at the Cape to assist Kambira, at the
express command of Maraquita ; and continued there
until Harold returned, bringing Lieutenant Lindsay
with him as a partner in the business ; until Harold
was married and required a gardener for his own
domain; until the Senhorina became Mrs. Lindsay;
until a large and thriving band of little Cape
colonists found it necessary to have a general story-
teller and adventure-recounter with a nautical turn
of mind; until, in short, he found it convenient to go
to England himself for the gal of his heart who had
been photographed there years before, and could be
rubbed off neither by sickness, sunstroke, nor ad-
versity.
When Disco had returned to the colony with the

wont at eventide to assemble the little colonists
round him, light his pipe, and, through its hazy
influence, recount his experiences, and deliver his
opinions on the slave-trade of East Africa. Some-
times he was pathetic, sometimes humorous, but,
however jocular he might be on other subjects, he
invariably became very grave and very earnest
when he touched on the latter theme.

THE NORSEMEN IN THE WEST;
Or, America before Columbus. With Illustrations.
" This thoroughly delightful book is an adaptation of the Saga of
Iceland, and also of Mr. Laing's 'Heimskingla; or, Chronicles of
the Kings of Norway,' supplemented by Mr. Ballantyne's own
experience and adventures in the wildernesses of America! These
ingredients are put together with the skill and spirit of an accom-
plished story-teller; and the result is, a book that cannot possibly be
laid down till the very last word of the last line has been read."_
Atheneum.
"Mr. Ballantyne is a conscientious writer, who does not rely on
imagination when facts are to be had, and who has taken the
trouble to get up the old sagas that tell of the discovery of Green-
land, and Vinland, and Markland, before he writes about it."-
Guardian.
"There is abundant action in the story; marvellous accounts of
wonderful escapes, of adventures with natives, and all kinds of
dangers. This is not done in a rough, unskilful way, but in such a
manner as to be certain to attract the attention of boys, and to
interest them thoroughly."-Scotsman.
"A tale told with all the author's wonted spirit, and calculated
to convey instruction of a valuable kind, as well as to afford much
leisure to the young reader."--Daily News.

THE IRON HORSE;
Or, Life on the Line. A Railway Tale. With Illustrations.
"A captivating book for boys."_Guardian,
"A most engaging tale, in which there is also a substratum of
very useful practical information."-Inverness Courier.
"To those anxious to become acquainted with the inner workings
of the great railway systems of the country, the work before us will
form an invaluable aid."- Aberdeen Herald.
"There is no vocation in life, however seemingly prosaic, but
Mr. Ballantyne can mark whatever little of the picturesque enters
into it, and turn the same to good account. There is much more
skill required in the management of a locomotive than most people
are aware of, and in this Tale of the Grand National Trunk
Railway' boys will obtain an insight into the working of an engine,
and the life of those connected with it, that they may never have an
opportunity of realising otherwise. Mr. Ballantyne is professional
and practical, as well as picturesque, and never fails to be droll also
when there is a good opportunity."- Inverness Courier.

ERLING THE BOLD:
A Tale of the Norse Sea Kings. With Illlustrations.
" A capital tale of the Norse Sea Kings."—Times.
" The tale itself is deeply interesting, and evidently founded on a
diligent study of northern literature."- Record.
- The story is interesting and full of moving accidents by flood
and field, and it will therefore scarcely fail to be popular among
lads."--Scotsman.
" This story is written in Mr. Ballantyne's best style. It is fresh,
vigorous, and full of adventure; while a great deal of knowledge on
subjects too little known is given in a genuinely popular style."_
Edinburgh Courant.
"A story from Mr. Ballantyne is one of the pleasures which many
hundreds of English schoolboys have come to regard as among the
institutions of Christmas holidays. . . . The author of 'Erling
the Bold lays before his admirers a tale which will satisfy them
that his brain and hand have lost none of their quickness and
cunning. . . . .. The story is cleverly designed, and abounds
with elements of romantic interest; and the author's illustrations
are scarcely less vigorous than his text."—Athenceum.

FIGHTING THE FLAMES :
A Tale of the London Fire Brigade. With Illustrations.
" This is one of those spirited, stirring stories, full of interest.
instinct with brave and manly sentiment, in which boys delight, and
in which Mr. Ballantyne has few equals. . . . Possessing great
interest as a tale, it is more valuable still because of the lessons of
courage, endurance, and self-sacrifice which it inculcates."—Non-
conformist.
Many a schoolboy will find keen enjoyment in the perusalof 'Fight-
ing the Flames,' and assure his little sisters with suitable emphasis
that Mr. Ballantyne is 'a stunning good story-teller.'"—Athenaeum.
"A well-told and interesting story."-Scotsman.
"Those who value the welfare of the young and rising generation
ought to encourage the circulation of such healthy works as this. ...
The moral, or rather religious tone of the book is decided and lofty,
although thereis little or no sermonizing."—Edinburgh Evening Courant.
"We commend this capital story. ... It is full of interest from
the first page to the last, and is likely to incite not only an enter-
prising spirit, but a healthy, brave, and courageous one."— Victoria
Magazine.
Crown 8vo, 5s., cloth.
DEEP DOWN:
A Tale of the Cornish Mines. With Illustrations.
"Mr. Ballantyne always accomplishes in a creditable manner the
thing that he intends to do, and on this occasion he does not show
himself lower than his reputation."—Athenaeum.
"Boys will be delighted with the sketches of the underground
world of the west country; the incidents have evidently been gathered
on the spot, and the descriptive power of the author is well brought
out." —Record.
"Mr. Ballantyne's book is one that deserves to be read with atten-
tion. It will not fail to delight boys, for it is full of deeds of daring
and of 'hairbreadth escapes. Its brave men and its boys are good,
and its wicked people are decidedly wicked. Neutral tints are not
in favour with youth, and there are none of them in this book. It
is handsomely illustrated."--Scotsman.
"This is just the subject for Mr. Ballantyne, whose stories in con-
nection with that enterprise and adventure which have made England
great are among the best of modern days."—Daily News.
"By reading Mr. Ballantyne's admirable story a very large amount
of knowledge concerning Cornish mines may be acquired; whilst,
from the fact of the information being given in the form of a connected
narrative, it is not likely very soon to be forgotten. ... A book
well worthy of being extensively read."—Mining Journal.

THE FLOATING LIGHT OF THE GOODWIN
SANDS.
With Illustrations.
"As a narrative of deeply interesting scenes and incidents, com-
paratively little known, we would most cordially recommend Mr.
Ballantyne's book."- Aberdeen Journal.
"Abounds with thrilling episodes, and is written in as instructive
a spirit, and with such a practical tone of piety withal, as to make it
truly interesting also to those of mature age."-Shipwrecked Mariner.
Few could read this work without having their hearts warmed
and their sympathies awakened by this narrative of the simple lives
and gallant deeds of the daring tars who man the floating lights on
the horror-haunted Goodwin Sands. ... A fine vein of pure
morality pervades the book ; and this, with its stirring and exciting
incidents, should make it a peculiar favourite with the young, while
it cannot fail to interest all who seek a pleasant relaxation in its
pages."--Dundee AcIvertiser
*To enable him to write thus Mr. Ballantyne lived some time on
board one of these vessels; and though we cannot profess to judge
from the same standpoint, he seems to have caught the characters
admirably. The tale will be especially interesting to adventure-loving
boys."— Record.

SHIFTING WINDS:
A Tough Yarn. With Ilustrations.
"It will quite answer the expectations of Mr. Ballantyne's
numerous readers ; for the story is as full of hairbreadth escapes,
exciting incidents, and vivid descriptions of sailor life as any boy
could desire."- Morning Post.
"There is a mistake on the very first page of this capital book.
"Shifting Winds' is not a tough yarn, but a hearty, vigorous, bracing
story, fresh with the pure breezes, and sparkling with the bright
waters of the everlasting seas."—Athenaeum.
"Is another of the excellent stories which Mr. R. M. Ballantyne has
contributed to the library of the young. He has great powers of de-
scription, and his characters stand out on the page in a well-defined
individuality, which is essential to a very lively interest in the story."
Record.
66.Shifting Winds' is a tough yarn only in the sense of being full
of thrilling interest, not certainly because there is anything about it
to suggest doubt of its truthfulness. It is a most fascinating book
for boys and young men."—Daily Review.
" Shifting Winds' is described by its author as 'a tough yarn,'
but the yarn will be by no means tough to readers who have the
interests and welfare of our seamen at heart. Written in a clear and
forcible style, healthy in tone, and benevolent in purpose, this tale
serves a far higher end than that of simple amusement." - Watchman.

Extract Letter from the Secretary of Northern Lighthouses.
".... They (the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses) have
been so much pleased with the way in which you have combined the
fiction of a tale with the popular but correct account of the building
of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, that they think it would be an inte-
resting work to transmit to their Lightkeepers, and I have therefore
to request that you will direct your publishers to transmit to me -
copies.
(Signed) "ALEXR. CUNNINGHAM."
"Thoroughly at home in subjects of adventure, the author has
made this, like all his stories for boys, smart in style, thrilling in
interest, and abounding in incidents of every kind." —Quiver.
"A union of fiction and useful knowledge. The narrative is
lively, the characters talk easily and naturally, and the picture of
the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the Pharos '
is striking and vivid."—London Review.
"A book in which the author displays his peculiar faculty of
instructing boys, whilst he amuses them, so that they are not aware
he is giving them instruction."-Athenceum.

"DEAR SIR, I am directed by the Committee to request your

off to a wreck, as a small permanent acknowledgment of the important
service you have rendered to the Lifeboat cause by your very inte-
resting work entitled, "The Lifeboat: a Tale of our Coast Heroes."
-I remain, yours faithfully,
(Signed) "RICHARD LEWIS, Secretary."
" Apart from its merit as a tale, which is considerable, the work
has a mission which would of itself be sufficient to commend it to
general notice. It is meant to bring more prominently before the
public the claims of the National Lifeboat Institution."-Morning Post.
"For those who love tales of peril on the sea Mr. Ballantyne's
tale, "The Lifeboat,' will have intense interest. Mr. Ballantyne has
gone to some trouble to collect information as to the services rendered
by the life-boatmen under the direction of the National Lifeboat In-
stitution, and he has woven the whole into a thrilling tale. ... Those
who buy the book will not fail to have more than their money's
worth in the interest which its perusal will create."—Evening Star.

"Mr. Ballantyne has taken the original journal of Mackenzie.
Sir Alexander's daughter and his two sons have placed at his disposal
all the information in their possession, and the result is an account of
manly deeds by flood and fell, which may be backed against all com-
petitors for its racy style and absorbing interest."—Edinburgh
Courant.
"Mr. Ballantyne is the most successful of story-tellers for boys.
He is always so happy in the choice of a subject, so much in earnest
in working it out, and contrives to bury the mere outlines of his
narrative amid so many lively and instructive pictures of the
adventurous side of real life, that the boyish intellect is dull indeed
that is not quickened to nobler impulses by a reading of such stories
as "The Iron Horse,' The Lifeboat,' or *The Pioneers.'"-North

OPINIONS.
" The Dean of Carlisle having read several of the little volumes
of Ballantyne's Miscellany has much pleasure in expressing his
opinion that they are written in a very pleasing style, and one well
calculated to interest and instruct the classes for which they are
intended. The writer appears to have attained the peculiar and
rare excellence of so interweaving sound religious instruction with
his narratives, as not to burthen them with prosy observations, and
yet never to lose sight of the manifest object which pervades the
whole, to save souls."
From the Rev. R. S CANDLISH, D.D., Principal of the New College,
Edinburgh.
"MY DEAR SIR, -I can have no hesitation in cordially recom-
mending your Miscellany."
From the Rev. J. C. RYLE, of Stradbroke.
"MY DEAR SIR,I am much pleased with your Miscellany, and
heartily wish it success. I am sure it will suit the young men and
women of the working classes. I cannot help feeling that your
effort to produce a literature which will inform and instruct, and yet
keep up a good religious tone, will prove a move in the right direc-
tion. Your books for the young are standard and classic with me.
I give all of them to my children as fast as they come out, and re-
commend them to all my friends."
From the Rev. NORMAN M'LEOD, D.D., Glasgow.
"I think Mr. Ballantyne's volumes admirably adapted to interest
and instruct the young."

From the Rev. D. T. K. DRUMMOND, of Elinburgh.
"I have read the first three volumes of Ballantyne's Miscellany
with the greatest interest. I have rarely seen so much that is in-
structive and interesting brought within the compass of such small
volumes, and told in such a pleasant and attractive manner. There
is a great deal of information that is most valuable given in each, and
all are based on a substratum of sound religious principle. Now that
working-men's clubs are being formed in our towns and villages, in
which they have both libraries and stated readings by the members
of the clubs themselves, I feel sure that Mr. Ballantyne's books will
be hailed as among the very best both for the library and the read-
ing-room."
From the Rev. Dr. ANDREW THOMSON, of Edinburgh.
"I have read some of Mr. Ballantyne's little volumes through at
one sitting, one chapter carrying me on to another. I have read
them with the same feeling with which, in boyish days, I have sat
and listened to a first-rate story-teller--the dashing and brave spirit
of adventure, the tine manly moral tone of the narrative, the skill
with which the right retiections are rather suggested than drawn out
prosaically, seem to me to render these little volumes eminently
adapted for circulation among working men. It would help to pro-
mote the moral health of the community not a little, were thousands
to be circulated for every one that is circulated now."
From the Rev. W. LINDSAY ALEXANDER, D.D., of Edinburgh.
"I have read with much satisfaction the first three volumes of
Ballantyne's Miscellany. The books seem to me admirably adapted to
the end the author has in view the diffusing of useful knowledge in
a pleasing and attractive form. Mr. Ballantyne possesses great
powers of graphic description, and is an excellent teller of a story.
His books are what Dr. Arnold so anxiously desired to see-books
on secular subjects written in a religious spirit."
From Mrs. WIGHTMAN, Shrewsbury.
"I hail with delight a work at once so attractive and sound, written
in such a spirited way, and containing so much valuable information."
"We have no hesitation in asserting that Ballantyne's Miscellany,
up to the present point, is attractive and useful. There is no more
practical way of communicating elementary information than that
which has been adopted in this series. When we see contained in
124 small pages (as in "Fast in the Ice") such information as a man
of fair education should possess about icebergs, northern lights,
Esquimaux, musk-oxen, bears, walruses, &c., together with all the
ordinary incidents of an Arctic voyage woven into a clear connected
narrative, we must admit that a good work has been done, and that
the author deserves the gratitude of those for whom the books are
especially designed, and also of young people of all classes."-
