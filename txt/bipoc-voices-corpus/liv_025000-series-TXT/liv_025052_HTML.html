  <h4 style="text-align:center">5. LETTER FROM A NATIVE MISSIONARY. </h4>
  <p>At the present time there are about fifty missionaries in Japan, consisting of a few English
    brethren and the great majority from America. Successful efforts also are being made towards
    raising up a native ministry. A young man of the latter class, NEE SIMA by name, on his return
    to his native land from America, writes to the secretary of the society with which he is
    connected as follows : —</p>
  <p>"Soon after my arrival at home, I presented your kind letter to my father. Before I got half
    through all of them began to weep, being much affected by your parental kindness shown to me. My
    father told me that you were our saviours and our gods. Then I told him that he must worship
    that God, the only one God, the Creator of the universe, the Saviour of mankind, the God of his
    American friends. I mentioned still further that these friends became so good and kind, even to
    a wandering stranger, because they are the true worshippers of God and the humble followers of
    Christ, who is, indeed, the Saviour of mankind. He came to this sinful world to save the poor
    and lost. These friends saved me from a miserable condition, and gave me necessary education, so
    that I might become a teacher of the glad tidings of salvation to our benighted people. They
    loved our people as much as their own American people, and gave me good education, hoping that I
    might render some service to our people, especially in leading them to the way of life.</p>
  <p>"Since that time my poor father has discontinued to worship the Japanese gods and his
    ancestors. By his consent I took down all the paper, wooden, earthen, and brass gods from
    shelves where they were kept, and burned them up. I send a few paper gods for you, which my
    mother threw over in the fire-place. There are no gods or images in this house now. I trust they
    will be the worshippers of the true God hereafter.</p>
  <p> "Beside my home friends, my humble labour within three weeks in this place has been
    wonderfully blessed. I have preached several times in the school-house in this town, and also
    preached to small audiences in different families. A week before the last Sabbath I preached to
    a large audience in a Buddhist temple. All the priests in this community came, and listened to
    the preaching of the new religion. There were over two-hundred in number present, consisting of
    priests, laymen, a few women and children.</p>
  <p> "Thirty men in this town (Annaka) and a few men out of the town took up a collection for
    purchasing some Christian books for themselves. One of them gave six en (nearly six dollars in
    gold), and a few others gave one en. The contributors are over thirty, and the amount of
    contributions is nearly 17.35 dollars in gold. They requested me to buy some Christian books
    when I go to Tokio or Yokohama. They are hungry and thirsty for the Christian truth. I find here
    everything ready for the Gospel. The field is white for the harvest."</p>
