<p>MY DEAR FRIENDS, ï¿½I, Tooloosee, your affectionate friend, send you many salams. By the favour of God I attend the Mission school at Bellary supported by you, and endeavour to learn my lessons well. I read the Word of God daily, and every Sabbath morning I repeat my lessons for the week. I also give up my lessons to dear Mrs. Wardlaw at her house. She is very kind to me and to all my school-fellows. My father and mother are exceedingly delighted to find that I am making progress in my learning. I am a poor girl; therefore I beg you will look with pity on me, and favour me with your support. Luke xviii, 13: "God be merciful to me a sinner." With many salams,</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Yours affectionately,<br>
TOOLOOSEE</p>
