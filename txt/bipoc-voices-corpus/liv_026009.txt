Abdool Meseeh's Hymn.
We hope that some of our young friends know, and can repeat, that
beautiful hymn of good Abdool Meseeh, which we print below, but we hope,
also, they are able to do more than repeat it, we mean feel it. Abdool was
a Mohammedan, but was converted by the Spirit of God on reading a New
Testament, in Persion, which was given him by the Rev. Henry Martyn.
He was baptized in Calcutta, by the name of Abdool Meseeh, which means
Servant of Christ. Some time after this, he was ordained a minister of the
Gospel, by Bishop Herber, but he did not live long afterwards. He died
in March 1827. On his death bed he sung the hymn we have referred
to, which he had composed a short time before. Of course, it was not in
English, but the translation made is quite a faithful one.
Beloved Savior let not me
In thy kind heart forgotten be:
Of all that deck the field or bower,
Thou art the fairest, sweetest flower.
Youth's morn has fled, old age comes on
But sin distracts my soul alone:
Beloved Savior let not me
In thy kind heart forgotten be.
