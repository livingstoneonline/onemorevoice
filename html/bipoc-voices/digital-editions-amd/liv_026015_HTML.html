  <h5 style="text-align:center;">LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE FROM THE BEREAVED FLOCK<br>OF THE LATE REV.
    J.J. WEITBRECHT.</h5>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><em>Burdwan Mission, March 10, 1852.</em></p>
  <p>D<small>EAR</small> C<small>HRISTIAN</small> F<small>RIENDS</small>&#8212;With deep regret and
    unspeakable sorrow
    we now announce the death of our faithful, honourable, and beloved
    minister and friend, Mr. Weitbrecht, who forsook his sweet native country,
    dear relatives, and kind friends, and spent many years amongst us,
    in order to preach the blessed Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
    Christ in this benighted heathen land of ours. He, in order to hold a
    Missionary Conference in Calcutta, left us in a strong, lively, and healthy
    frame of body, sincerely hoping to return within a few days; and we ourselves
    hoped so too, for we never expected or thought he would leave us
    for the next world so soon. But, alas! a few days after, we heard, to our
    great grief and surprise, that he had slept in his dear Saviour Christ, whom
    he loved so much in this life. Ah, dear friends! you cannot, we think,
    conceive what deep sorrow and heartrending anguish we felt when this
    melancholy and mournful intelligence reached us. There was a general
    weeping and a long lamentation in the whole Christian village for this
    kind, generous, and sympathizing pastor and friend. It has, indeed,
    been well for him that he has gone to his beloved Saviour, for he is now
    in perfect joy and happiness. But it is a great loss to us, who will
    scarcely, or perhaps never, get another such kind and feeling master and
    minister as Mr. Weitbrecht was; for having continued with him, some
    seventeen years, some twelve years, and others eight or nine years, we can
    all well testify his Christian character. Though we repeatedly offended
    and grieved him by our misbehaviour, he never reproved or punished
    us but with paternal affection and love. He behaved so properly towards
    every person, that we gave him among ourselves the name of physiognomist,
    or knower of characters.</p>
  <p>What shall we say about his love to his fellow-creatures? If any
    were taken ill at any time, he would kindly carry him medicine, against
    all difficulties and inconveniences. Oh, how often did we see him go in
    the rain, under the burning sun, and at twelve in the night, to administer
    physic to the sick folk! When any one fell into any distress or misery,
    he assisted him in his usual kindness and benevolence.</p>
  <p>As to his manner of preaching, and his conduct as a Christian pastor,
    we cannot describe them in words. The words he used in his discourses
    would strike and pierce into the hearts of hearers like a winged arrow.
    This we all know from our personal experience, and shall never forget.
    God grant, in His infinite mercy and ineffable bounty, that we may
    receive another such qualified and worthy pastor to take care of His
    tender flock.</p>
  <p>His humility during the past two years filled every body with
    wonder. We frequently said to one another, "Our Sahib has now
    humbled himself to the dust: nothing fierce can now be seen in him.
    Ah! this is truly the character of a really converted and renewed soul."</p>
  <p>When we look at the poor orphan children we feel very sorry. Who
    will so kindly support them as he did? Many of them say, with a hearty
    sob, "Why did not two or three of us die instead of our dear benefactor,
    who, if he remained alive, would tenderly beg and raise subscriptions
    for our maintenance? Still, God has mercifully left us a patroness and
    friend in Mrs. Weitbrecht, who is also very kind and affectionate, and
    she will surely do much good to the Mission."</p>
  <p>Besides, the heathen that dwell around us are also shedding tears for
    our late pastor's kind treatment and love, because, when they were unjustly
    oppressed by police people, Mr. Weitbrecht would, notwithstanding
    they are idolaters, deliver them from their distress by threatening the
    annoyers. Thus they were so much attached to him.</p>
  <p>He preached this year to the heathen as diligently and as zealously as
    ever. He went through jungles, towns, and villages, carrying the healing
    balm to the sick and dead in sin and trespasses. When discoursing,
    either with the Hindus or Mohammedans, he frequently took his passage
    for his subject, viz. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath
    anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal
    the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering
    of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach
    the acceptable year of the Lord"&#8212;Luke iv. 18, 19&#8212;and told them that,
    if they were not prepared and sanctified before death, they should
    never enter into heaven.</p>
  <p>On Sunday evening, the 29th of February, he delivered a beautiful
    sermon to a vast congregation in Calcutta. His text was almost the last
    verse of the last chapter of the Book of the Revelation, namely, "Surely
    I come quickly; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." Rev. xxxii. 20.
    After returning home he was taken with cholera morbus, and, in spite of
    all cares, troubles, prayers, and tears on the part of his beloved wife and
    other kind friends, he was summoned away, after an illness of ten hours,
    by his ever-faithful and blessed Lord Jesus Christ, to live and reign with
    Him for eternity.</p>
  <p>Thus you see, dear friends, that till his death our valuable minister
    continued faithful to Him who shed His precious blood for him on the
    cross. Now, let us conclude by warmly requesting you all to assist us,
    who are in every way helpless and miserable, with your incessant prayers
    to Him who is the Giver of every good and perfect gift, and who is
    really able to heal the wound He has made, to favour us with a kind,
    worthy, and bounteous pastor, such as we have just lost, according to His
    wise and holy will.</p>
  <p>With best regards and most sincere wishes for your welfare, both in
    this world and in the next,</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">We remain, your's truly,</p>
