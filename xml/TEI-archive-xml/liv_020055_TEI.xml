<lb/>The <placeName><term type="collective">Juju</term> house of skulls</placeName> has been <unclear>stringly</unclear> rebuilt, and the

<lb/>now as to durability, it looks down with contempt on our

<lb/>receptacle of the bones and limbs of human victims has been
<lb/>newly erected and the scattered bones picked up and replaced
<lb/>on it, and to shew that they were not beaten, an additional
<lb/>platform was erected, on both which are to be seen <del>the</del>
<lb/>fresh bones of three human victims newly taken as prisoners
<lb/>of war, killed and devoured: these victims were, a <hi rend="underline">man</hi>,
<lb/>a <hi rend="underline">woman</hi> and <hi rend="underline">her child</hi>, relatives of their opponents, caught
<lb/>from the opposite side of the river. Having been thus caught
<lb/>killed and eaten, their bones and skulls were added to the 
<lb/>trophies in the temple. Our native agents were <w>eyewit-
<lb/>nesses</w> of these attrocities only a few months ago: the <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">people</add> made
